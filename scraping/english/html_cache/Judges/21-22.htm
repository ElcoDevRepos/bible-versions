The context is the aftermath of the civil war between the Israelites and the tribe of Benjamin, where the other tribes had sworn not to give their daughters to Benjamites as wives (<a href="/judges/21.htm">Judges 21:1</a>). The leaders anticipated objections from the families of the women taken from Shiloh, highlighting the communal and familial nature of decision-making in Israelite culture.<p><b>we will tell them, &#8216;Do us a favor by helping them</b><br>The leaders of Israel are appealing to the families' sense of community and duty to assist in the restoration of the tribe of Benjamin. This reflects the importance of tribal unity and the collective responsibility to preserve the twelve tribes of Israel. The phrase suggests a pragmatic approach to resolving the crisis, emphasizing reconciliation and the survival of the tribe over strict adherence to previous oaths.<p><b>since we did not get wives for each of them in the war</b><br>This refers to the earlier conflict where the Israelites had vowed not to give their daughters to the Benjamites, leading to a shortage of wives for the surviving men of Benjamin. The war had decimated the tribe, and this shortage threatened its future. The leaders are acknowledging the need to rectify this situation to ensure the continuity of the tribe, which was crucial for maintaining the integrity of the nation of Israel.<p><b>Since you did not actually give them your daughters</b><br>This phrase is a legal and moral argument to absolve the families from breaking their oath. By not directly giving their daughters, the families could technically remain guiltless. This reflects the legalistic nature of ancient Israelite society, where adherence to vows and oaths was taken seriously, but there was also room for interpretation and flexibility in dire circumstances.<p><b>you have no guilt.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The leaders are providing a way for the families to maintain their honor and religious integrity while still contributing to the solution. This reflects the tension between law and grace, a theme that runs throughout the Bible. It also foreshadows the New Testament concept of grace, where adherence to the law is balanced with mercy and compassion. The resolution of this crisis through a loophole in the vow highlights the importance of mercy and the preservation of the community over rigid legalism.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel, who are dealing with the aftermath of a civil war against the tribe of Benjamin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_benjamites.htm">The Benjamites</a></b><br>The tribe of Benjamin, nearly wiped out due to the conflict with the other Israelite tribes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fathers_and_brothers.htm">The Fathers and Brothers</a></b><br>The family members of the women taken as wives for the Benjamites, who might object to the arrangement.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shiloh.htm">Shiloh</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites gathered to seek the Lord's guidance and where the annual festival took place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oath.htm">The Oath</a></b><br>The vow made by the Israelites not to give their daughters in marriage to the Benjamites, which complicates the resolution of the conflict.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_complexity_of_human_solutions.htm">The Complexity of Human Solutions</a></b><br>Human solutions to problems can be complex and imperfect, as seen in the Israelites' attempt to resolve the issue with the Benjamites while adhering to their oath.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_community_restoration.htm">The Importance of Community Restoration</a></b><br>The Israelites' actions highlight the importance of restoring and maintaining community, even after severe conflict.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/balancing_justice_and_mercy.htm">Balancing Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>The account illustrates the tension between justice (upholding the oath) and mercy (ensuring the survival of the Benjamites).<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_leadership_in_conflict_resolution.htm">The Role of Leadership in Conflict Resolution</a></b><br>Effective leadership is crucial in navigating complex moral and ethical dilemmas, as demonstrated by the leaders of Israel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_rash_vows.htm">The Consequences of Rash Vows</a></b><br>The account serves as a cautionary tale about making rash vows and the potential consequences that follow.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Judges_21_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Judges 21:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Judges_21_22_God_s_provision_in_disobedience.htm">How does Judges 21:22 illustrate God's provision despite Israel's disobedience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_community_duty_in_Judges_21_22.htm">What lessons can we learn about community responsibility from Judges 21:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Judges_21_22_to_OT_covenants.htm">How does Judges 21:22 connect with God's covenant promises in the Old Testament?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_Judges_21_22_today.htm">In what ways can we apply the principles of Judges 21:22 today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Judges_21_22_Seek_God_s_guidance.htm">How does Judges 21:22 challenge us to seek God's guidance in difficult situations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Judges_21_22_God_s_justice_mercy.htm">How does Judges 21:22 align with God's justice and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_permit_forced_wives_in_Judges_21_22.htm">Why did God allow the Israelites to take wives by force in Judges 21:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Cultural_reasons_for_actions_in_Judges_21_22.htm">What cultural context explains the actions in Judges 21:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_judges_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Judges 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'called_by_his_purpose'_mean.htm">How is Jesus represented in each book of the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/matthew_10__overstated_tensions_or_evidence.htm">Matthew 10 -

We are left to assume that the appeal of the elders to the parents whose two hundred daughters were thus seized was sufficient to pacify them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be favourable unto them for our sakes</span>. Rather, <span class="accented">Grant us them as a favour</span>, the masculine <span class="accented">them</span> referring to <span class="accented">the daughters of Shiloh</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> in ver. 12, and the verb <span class="accented">grant a favour</span> being followed by a double accusative. <span class="cmt_word">We reserved not to each man his wife</span>, etc. These words are somewhat difficult. If we may insert the word to, as the A.V. does, before <span class="accented">each</span> <span class="accented">man</span> (for it is wanting in the Hebrew), the sense is good. The Israelites acknowledge their own fault in not reserving women enough to be wives to the Benjamites, and ask the fathers and brothers of the daughters of Shiloh to do them a favour by enabling them to repair their fault. But it is rather a strain upon the words. The omission of the <span class="accented">to</span> is not natural in such a phrase (<a href="/numbers/26-54.htm">Numbers 26:54</a> is hardly to the point, nor is <a href="/genesis/41-12.htm">Genesis 41:12</a>, where the <span class="accented">to</span> had been expressed before the us), and <span class="accented">reserved</span> is a forced interpretation of the verb. If the words were spoken by the Benjamites, all would be plain and easy: "We received not each man his wife in the war." Hence some put the speech into the mouth of Benjamin, as though the Israelites meant, We will say in your names, in your persons, as your attorneys, so to speak, "Grant them to us," etc. But this is rather forced. Others, therefore, follow the Peschito, and read, "<span class="accented">because</span> THEY received not each man his wife," etc., which makes very good sense, but has not MS. authority. <span class="cmt_word">Ye did not give</span>, etc., <span class="accented">i.e.</span> you need not fear the guilt of the broken oath, because you did not <span class="accented">give</span> your daughters, so as to violate the oath (ver. 7), but they were taken from you by force. The A.V. gives the probable meaning of the passage, though it is somewhat obscure. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/21-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their fathers</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
