Throughout the Old Testament, God often speaks to His people through prophets, judges, or directly, highlighting His desire for a relationship with them. This divine response underscores God's awareness and concern for Israel's plight.<p><b>When the Egyptians</b><br>The mention of the Egyptians recalls Israel's bondage in Egypt and their subsequent deliverance through the Exodus. This historical event is foundational for Israel's identity as God's chosen people. It serves as a reminder of God's power and faithfulness in delivering them from oppression, as recounted in Exodus chapters 1-14.<p><b>Amorites</b><br>The Amorites were a significant Canaanite group that Israel encountered during their conquest of the Promised Land. Their defeat is recorded in <a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-35</a> and <a href="/joshua/10.htm">Joshua 10</a>. This reference serves to remind Israel of God's past victories over formidable enemies, reinforcing His ability to deliver them from current threats.<p><b>Ammonites</b><br>The Ammonites were descendants of Lot and often in conflict with Israel. Their oppression of Israel is a recurring theme in the Book of Judges, as seen in <a href="/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a> and later in <a href="/judges/11.htm">Judges 11</a>. This mention highlights the cyclical nature of Israel's disobedience and God's deliverance.<p><b>Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were a perennial enemy of Israel, known for their advanced military technology and frequent skirmishes with the Israelites. Their mention here foreshadows future conflicts, notably during the time of Samson (Judges 13-16) and King David (1 Samuel 17). This reference serves as a reminder of God's past interventions and the ongoing need for reliance on Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is reminding the Israelites of His past deliverances.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved before God delivered them through Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/amorites.htm">Amorites</a></b><br>A group of ancient people living in Canaan, whom the Israelites encountered and defeated during their conquest of the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A neighboring nation often in conflict with Israel, known for their worship of false gods.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A perennial enemy of Israel, known for their military strength and conflicts with figures like Samson and David.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_deliverance.htm">God's Faithfulness in Deliverance</a></b><br>Reflect on the numerous times God has delivered His people in the past.

His word is final, authoritative, and rooted in covenant faithfulness (<a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10-11</a>; <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). By answering directly, He confronts the people&#8217;s forgetfulness and sets the stage for a history lesson that proves His continual mercy despite their repeated apostasy (<a href="/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Egyptians</b><p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s very identity was forged when God crushed Egypt&#8217;s power, bringing them &#8220;out of the iron furnace&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30-31</a>).<p>&#8226; The Exodus deliverance showed unmatched miracles&#8212;plagues, the Red Sea, manna&#8212;making Israel a nation that owed everything to divine intervention (<a href="/psalms/105-26.htm">Psalm 105:26-38</a>).<p>&#8226; Mentioning Egypt first exposes the absurdity of present idolatry: after witnessing such salvation, how could Israel now chase Canaanite gods (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2-3</a>)?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Amorites</b><p>&#8226; The Amorites, ruled by Sihon and Og, blocked Israel&#8217;s approach to the Promised Land (<a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-35</a>). God defeated them, handing their territory to His people (<a href="/joshua/13-10.htm">Joshua 13:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Later, under Joshua, the LORD &#8220;delivered the Amorites into the hand of Israel&#8221; during the long-day battle at Gibeon (<a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; By recalling this victory, God highlights His willingness to remove insurmountable obstacles whenever His people walk in obedience (<a href="/psalms/136-17.htm">Psalm 136:17-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ammonites</b><p>&#8226; Early in the Judges period, Ehud&#8217;s deliverance from Moab set the stage, but Jephthah&#8217;s upcoming deliverance (<a href="/bsb/judges/11.htm">Judges 11</a>) is specifically from Ammon. God is reminding the nation that He has already handled this enemy before they even ask (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>; <a href="/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The reference underscores a pattern: oppression comes when Israel serves Baal and Ashtoreth, relief comes when they repent (<a href="/judges/10-6.htm">Judges 10:6-8</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-43.htm">Psalm 106:43-45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Philistines</b><p>&#8226; Shamgar struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad (<a href="/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>). Later, Samson will devastate them (<a href="/bsb/judges/13.htm">Judges 13-16</a>). God&#8217;s record against this coastal power proves He can topple any foe, whether through a single judge or national repentance (<a href="/1_samuel/7-10.htm">1 Samuel 7:10-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Mentioning the Philistines also warns of what happens when deliverance is ignored: years of harassment under Samuel, Saul, and even David trace back to incomplete trust in the LORD (<a href="/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/10-11.htm">Judges 10:11</a> is God&#8217;s gentle but firm reminder that He has always answered Israel&#8217;s cries, defeating every major oppressor in their past. The verse exposes the contrast between His unwavering faithfulness and their wavering loyalty. If He conquered Egypt&#8217;s empire, swept aside Amorite kings, silenced Ammonite taunts, and broke Philistine might, He can certainly rescue again&#8212;yet He will not be treated as one option among idols. The history lesson calls God&#8217;s people then, and now, to remember past mercies, repent of present compromise, and rest confidently in His proven power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Did not I deliver you</span>, etc. These references to former deliverances are of great historical value, and not the least so as they allude to events of which the existing records give no account, or a very imperfect one.
