His army was intentionally reduced by God from 32,000 to 300 men to demonstrate that victory would come through divine intervention rather than human strength (<a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2-7</a>). This small number highlights the miraculous nature of their victories and parallels the concept of God using the weak to shame the strong (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p><b>came to the Jordan</b><br>The Jordan River is a significant geographical and spiritual landmark in the Bible. It served as a boundary for the Promised Land and was the site of many important events, such as the crossing by the Israelites under Joshua (Joshua 3) and the baptism of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>).

This act of crossing can also be seen as a type of baptism, symbolizing a passage from one state to another, from oppression to deliverance.<p><b>exhausted yet still in pursuit</b><br>The phrase highlights the perseverance and commitment of Gideon and his men despite their physical exhaustion. It underscores the theme of endurance in the face of overwhelming odds, a common biblical motif (<a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1-3</a>). This determination can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's perseverance in His mission, enduring suffering for the sake of redemption (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>).
