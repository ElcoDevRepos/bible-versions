In the context of <a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20</a>, the Israelites are facing internal conflict with the tribe of Benjamin. The act of inquiring of the LORD reflects a dependence on God for direction, a common practice in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/2.htm">2 Samuel 2:1</a>). This inquiry was often done through the priestly use of the Urim and Thummim, sacred lots used to discern God's will (<a href="/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>). It underscores the importance of seeking God's guidance in decision-making, a principle that remains relevant for believers today.<p><b>(In those days the ark of the covenant of God was there,</b><br>The mention of the Ark of the Covenant signifies the presence of God among His people. The Ark, a sacred chest containing the tablets of the Law, Aaron's rod, and manna, symbolized God's covenant with Israel and His dwelling among them (<a href="/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10-22</a>). During this period, the Ark was located at Bethel, a significant site for worship and inquiry (<a href="/judges/20-18.htm">Judges 20:18, 26</a>-28). The presence of the Ark indicates that the Israelites were seeking guidance in a legitimate and reverent manner. The Ark also foreshadows Christ, who is the ultimate presence of God with humanity (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The reference to the Ark here emphasizes the seriousness of the situation and the Israelites' desire for divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel who are seeking guidance from God during a time of internal conflict with the tribe of Benjamin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, whom the Israelites are seeking for divine guidance and intervention.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence and covenant with Israel.

The ark&#8217;s presence signals divine authority; their inquiry reflects genuine dependence. Together, these details remind us that even in crisis God guides those who earnestly seek Him, and His covenant presence remains the sure foundation for faithful decision-making.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">Enquired of the Lord</span>--i.e., of Jehovah, as in <a href="/judges/20-23.htm" title="(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?

It is clear, however, that the nation had been thoroughly and beneficially humiliated by these two terrible reverses, and that their approach to Jehovah on this occasion was far more solemn and devout than it had been at first.<p><span class= "bld">Was there</span>--i.e., at Bethel, though Bethel has not been mentioned in the English Version, owing to the erroneous rendering of the name by "House of God" in <a href="/context/judges/20-18.htm" title="And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin?

In the Hebrew, <span class="accented">Asked the Lord</span>, as in vers. 18, 23. <span class="cmt_word">For the ark of the covenant</span>, etc. A most important statement, defining the time of these occurrences, within the lifetime of Phinehas, and also giving a strong intimation that the writer of these words lived after the tabernacle had been removed from Shiloh and its neighbourhood to Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Was there</span>. Where? The natural answer to be given is, At Bethel; for Bethel is the only place that has been named. But it is not in accordance with the other intimations given us concerning the tabernacle, that Bethel should be its resting-place under the high priesthood of Phinehas. In <a href="/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a> we have the formal pitching of the tabernacle of the congregation at Shiloh; in <a href="/joshua/22-12.htm">Joshua 22:12</a> we find it there, and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest before it; in <a href="/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-14.htm">1 Samuel 2:14</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/3-21.htm">1 Samuel 3:21</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3</a>, we find it settled there till taken by the Philistines; and in <a href="/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60</a> we find Shiloh described as the abode of the tabernacle till its capture by the Philistines, and there is no hint anywhere of Bethel or any other place having been the resting-place of the ark before it fell into the hands of the Philistines. Neither, again, is the explanation of some commentators, that the words <span class="accented">the ark</span>... <span class="accented">was there in those days</span> implies "that the ark of the covenant was only temporarily at Bethel," at all satisfactory. <span class="accented">In those days</span> has naturally a much wider and broader application, like the expression (<a href="/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>; <a href="/judges/18-1.htm">Judges 18:1</a>), In <span class="accented">those days there was no king in Israel</span>, and contrasts the time of Phinehas and the judges with the times of the monarchy, when the ark and the high priest were at Jerusalem. Unless, therefore, we understand Bethel in vers. 18, 26, 31 to mean the house of God, which seems quite impossible, we must interpret the word <span class="accented">there</span> to mean Shiloh, and suppose that the writer took no count of the temporary removal to Bethel for the convenience of consultation, but considered that it was at Shiloh in one sense, though momentarily it was a few miles off. Possibly too in the fuller narrative, of which we have here the abridgment, the name of Shiloh was mentioned as that to which there referred. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/20-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">inquired</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1458;&#1500;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
