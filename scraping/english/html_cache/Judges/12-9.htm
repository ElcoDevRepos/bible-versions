Large families were often seen as a blessing from God, as children were considered a heritage from the Lord (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>). The number thirty may symbolize completeness or abundance, reflecting Ibzan's prosperity and influence.<p><b>whom he gave in marriage to men outside his clan</b><br>Marrying outside one's clan was a strategic move to form alliances and strengthen political ties. This practice was common in the ancient Near East, where marriages were often used to secure peace and cooperation between different groups. It also reflects the broader theme in Judges of Israel's interaction with surrounding nations, sometimes leading to idolatry and conflict.<p><b>and for his sons he brought back thirty wives from elsewhere</b><br>This action mirrors the practice of forming alliances through marriage, but it also suggests a departure from the ideal of marrying within the Israelite community. The bringing of wives from elsewhere could indicate a compromise with surrounding cultures, which often led to the introduction of foreign gods and practices, a recurring issue in the Book of Judges.<p><b>Ibzan judged Israel seven years</b><br>Ibzan's judgeship lasted seven years, a number often associated with completeness or divine perfection in the Bible. His relatively short tenure as a judge suggests a period of stability and peace, though the text does not provide specific details about his leadership. The role of a judge in Israel was to deliver the people from oppression and lead them in following God's laws, a task that varied in success throughout the Book of Judges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/ibzan.htm">Ibzan</a></b><br>A judge of Israel who led for seven years.
