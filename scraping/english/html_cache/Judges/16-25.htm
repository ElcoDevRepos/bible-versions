In ancient Near Eastern cultures, feasting and merriment often accompanied religious festivals or victories. The Philistines were celebrating their perceived triumph over Samson, whom they believed was subdued by their god Dagon. This mirrors other biblical instances where feasting leads to moral or spiritual lapses, such as in the story of Belshazzar's feast in <a href="/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>.<p><b>they said, &#8220;Call for Samson to entertain us.&#8221;</b><br>The Philistines sought to mock Samson, who had been a formidable enemy. This reflects a common practice in ancient times where captives were humiliated for the amusement of their captors. Samson, once a judge and deliverer of Israel, is now reduced to a source of entertainment, highlighting the reversal of his fortunes due to his disobedience to God. This also foreshadows the ultimate downfall of the Philistines, as their mockery sets the stage for Samson's final act of strength.<p><b>So they called Samson out of the prison to entertain them.</b><br>Samson's imprisonment signifies his physical and spiritual bondage. The Philistines' ability to summon him at will underscores his loss of freedom and power. This moment is pivotal, as it leads to the climax of Samson's story. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of straying from God's commandments, yet also sets the stage for redemption and divine intervention.<p><b>And they stationed him between the pillars.</b><br>The pillars are central to the Philistine temple's structure, symbolizing the support of their society and religion. Samson's placement here is strategic, both for the Philistines' entertainment and for the narrative's unfolding. This positioning is crucial for the ensuing destruction, as it allows Samson to bring down the temple. Theologically, it represents the collapse of idolatry and the triumph of God's sovereignty, as Samson's final act leads to the defeat of the Philistines, fulfilling his role as a judge and deliverer of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God tied to his Nazirite vow.

The Philistines treat Samson like a circus act, ignorant that the Lord&#8217;s strength can return in an instant.<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/23-11.htm">Luke 23:11</a> shows Herod and his soldiers likewise ridiculing Jesus, clothing Him in a splendid robe and sending Him back to Pilate.

While the Philistines drink and laugh, they summon Samson for sport, blind to the fact that the living God is about to act. Every detail&#8212;their drunken joy, the call for entertainment, the release from prison, the positioning between pillars&#8212;shows the sovereign hand of God turning mockery into judgment and weakness into strength. The verse reminds us that when the world celebrates evil and mocks faith, the Lord remains in control, ready to vindicate His name and rescue His people in His perfect timing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">When their hearts were merry.</span>--Comp. <a href="/judges/9-27.htm" title="And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and stepped the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.">Judges 9:27</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/25-36.htm" title="And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: why she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.">1Samuel 25:36</a>; <a href="/esther/1-10.htm" title="On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,">Esther 1:10</a>.<p><span class= "bld">That he may make us sport.</span>--Whether by his forced jests, or by feats of strength, or merely by being made to submit to insults, we cannot tell.
