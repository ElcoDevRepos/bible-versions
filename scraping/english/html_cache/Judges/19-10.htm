In the context of ancient Israel, traveling at night was dangerous due to the threat of bandits and wild animals. His unwillingness to stay may reflect a sense of urgency or distrust of the local hospitality, which is a recurring theme in the narrative of Judges, where the moral and social fabric of Israel is depicted as deteriorating.<p><b>He got up and departed,</b><br>The Levite's decision to leave immediately suggests a proactive approach to his journey. This action can be seen as a reflection of the chaotic period of the Judges, where individuals often acted independently without centralized leadership. The phrase also indicates a transition in the narrative, moving the story forward and setting the stage for the events that follow.<p><b>and arrived opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem),</b><br>Jebus, known later as Jerusalem, was at this time a Canaanite city not yet conquered by the Israelites. This geographical reference is significant as it underscores the incomplete conquest of the Promised Land, a recurring issue in the Book of Judges. Jerusalem would later become the political and spiritual center of Israel under King David, highlighting the city's future importance in biblical history.<p><b>with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine.</b><br>The mention of two saddled donkeys indicates preparation for a long journey, suggesting the Levite's intent to travel efficiently and with necessary provisions. The presence of his concubine is central to the narrative, as her subsequent mistreatment and death become a catalyst for the events that lead to civil strife within Israel. The concubine's role also reflects the complex social and familial structures of the time, where concubinage was a common practice, though it often led to familial discord and moral complications.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A central figure in this account, the Levite is traveling with his concubine.

His practical diligence and separation from pagan influence are commendable, yet the verse also foreshadows Israel&#8217;s internal corruption that will surface in Gibeah.
