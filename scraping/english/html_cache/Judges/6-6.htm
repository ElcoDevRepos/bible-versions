Their oppression of Israel during this period was severe, as they would invade the land during harvest time, taking crops and livestock (<a href="/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3-5</a>). This left Israel in a state of economic destitution, highlighting the consequences of their disobedience to God. The cyclical pattern of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance is evident throughout the Book of Judges. The impoverishment serves as a physical manifestation of Israel's spiritual poverty due to their idolatry and abandonment of God's commandments.<p><b>and the Israelites cried out to the LORD</b><br>This cry to the LORD signifies a turning point, as the Israelites recognize their need for divine intervention. Throughout the Old Testament, crying out to God in times of distress is a recurring theme (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23</a>, <a href="/psalms/107-6.htm">Psalm 107:6</a>). It reflects a moment of repentance and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty. The Israelites' cry is not just a plea for relief from physical oppression but also an implicit confession of their spiritual failings. This act of crying out is a precursor to God's deliverance, which He provides through raising up judges, in this case, Gideon. It foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who responds to the cries of humanity for salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are suffering due to their disobedience and idolatry.
