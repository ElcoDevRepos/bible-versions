In the context of Judges, Israel often fell into idolatry, worshiping Baal and Asherah. A "proper altar" signifies returning to true worship, aligning with God's covenantal requirements. The altar's construction symbolizes repentance and a renewed commitment to God, reminiscent of the altars built by patriarchs like Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>) and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/35-7.htm">Genesis 35:7</a>).<p><b>on the top of this stronghold.</b><br>The stronghold likely refers to a high place or fortified area, often used for idol worship. By building God's altar here, Gideon is reclaiming territory for the LORD, demonstrating God's supremacy over false gods. This act of faith challenges the prevailing cultural norms and asserts God's authority over all creation, echoing the biblical theme of God as a fortress and refuge (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>).<p><b>And with the wood of the Asherah pole you cut down,</b><br>The Asherah pole was a symbol of Canaanite fertility worship, often associated with the goddess Asherah. Cutting it down signifies the destruction of idolatry and the removal of sin from the community. Using its wood for God's altar underscores the transformation from paganism to true worship, illustrating the biblical principle of God turning what was meant for evil into good (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p><b>take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering.</b><br>The second bull, likely a prized animal, represents a significant sacrifice, indicating the cost of true worship and devotion. A burnt offering symbolizes atonement and complete surrender to God, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a>. This act prefigures Christ's ultimate sacrifice, where He offered Himself wholly for humanity's sins (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>). The offering signifies a new beginning for Gideon and Israel, aligning with the theme of redemption and restoration found throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

The word &#8220;proper&#8221; stresses that worship must follow God&#8217;s pattern, not human preference.

That the Jews themselves were not quite certain of the meaning appears from the various versions. The LXX. render it, "in the arrangement," and the Vulg., "on which you have before placed the sacrifice." It means "with the Asherah pillar hewed down, and split up into firewood." The Jews point out the peculiar features of this burnt offering: (1) It was not at Shiloh; (2) it was not offered by a priest; (3) it was offered at night; and (4) the fire was kindled with the unhallowed materials of an idol. The Divine command was, of course, more than sufficient to justify these merely ritual irregularities; and, indeed, it is clear that in these rude times, when the country was in the hands of the heathen, the Levitic order of worship became, for the time, impossible in many particulars. Prophets and those directly commissioned by heaven were tacitly regarded as exempt from the strict rules of outward ritual which were necessary for the mass of the nation. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This rock</span>.
