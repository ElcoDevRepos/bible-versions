It suggests a message being delivered with authority and purpose. In biblical narratives, such communications often precede significant events or decisions, highlighting the importance of the message being conveyed.<p><b>&#8220;This is what Jephthah says:</b><br>Jephthah, a judge of Israel, is speaking with authority. His background as the son of a prostitute and a leader of a band of outcasts (<a href="/judges/11.htm">Judges 11:1-3</a>) contrasts with his role as a deliverer of Israel. This phrase underscores his position as a spokesperson for Israel, despite his humble beginnings, reflecting the biblical theme of God using unlikely individuals for His purposes.<p><b>Israel did not take away the land of Moab</b><br>This statement refers to the historical context of Israel's journey to the Promised Land. According to <a href="/numbers/21-26.htm">Numbers 21:26-30</a>, Israel did not seize Moabite territory during their conquest. The Moabites were descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>), and God had instructed Israel not to harass Moab or engage in battle with them (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9</a>). This reflects the divine boundaries set by God for Israel's conquests.<p><b>or of the Ammonites.</b><br>The Ammonites, also descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-38.htm">Genesis 19:38</a>), were similarly not to be attacked by Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>). Jephthah's assertion is a defense against the Ammonite king's claim that Israel had unlawfully taken their land. This historical clarification is crucial in understanding the territorial disputes and divine instructions that shaped Israel's interactions with neighboring nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, known for his leadership and vow.

(<a href="/judges/11-12.htm">Judges 11:12</a>).<p>- The Ammonite king replied that Israel had taken his territory when they came up from Egypt (<a href="/judges/11-13.htm">Judges 11:13</a>).<p>- Jephthah answers with a carefully reasoned historical review, beginning in <a href="/judges/11-15.htm">Judges 11:15</a>: &#8220;This is what Jephthah says: Israel did not take away the land of Moab or of the Ammonites.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jephthah&#8217;s Claim</b><p>- By stating plainly that Israel &#8220;did not take away the land,&#8221; Jephthah refutes the accusation.<p>- He frames the reply much like a prophetic declaration: &#8220;This is what Jephthah says,&#8221; reminiscent of &#8220;Thus says the LORD&#8221; (cf. <a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>).<p>- He focuses on two nations&#8212;Moab and Ammon&#8212;because both descended from Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-36.htm">Genesis 19:36-38</a>) and had been expressly protected by God from Israelite conquest (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9, 19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Historical Context</b><p>- When Israel left Egypt, they asked Edom for passage but were denied (<a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>).<p>- God forbade them to attack either Moab or Ammon (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4-9, 18</a>-19).<p>- Instead, Israel fought Sihon king of the Amorites, who refused peaceful passage (<a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-24</a>).<p>- The territory Israel gained lay between the Arnon and the Jabbok Rivers&#8212;land that had belonged to the Amorites, not the Ammonites or Moabites (<a href="/numbers/21-25.htm">Numbers 21:25-26</a>; <a href="/judges/11-22.htm">Judges 11:22</a>).<p>- Joshua later allotted this region to Reuben, Gad, and half-Manasseh (<a href="/joshua/13-24.htm">Joshua 13:24-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Theological Implications</b><p>- God owns the earth and distributes lands according to His will (<a href="/jeremiah/27-5.htm">Jeremiah 27:5</a>).<p>- By honoring God&#8217;s earlier commands not to harm Moab or Ammon, Israel demonstrated obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12-13</a>).<p>- Their victory over the Amorites confirmed God&#8217;s promise first made to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p>- <a href="/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10-12</a> celebrates these same victories as acts of God&#8217;s faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lessons for Today</b><p>- When falsely accused, respond with truth anchored in verifiable history (<a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15-16</a>).<p>- Recognize and respect God-given boundaries, whether territorial, moral, or relational (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p>- Remember that spiritual inheritance, like physical inheritance for Israel, is granted by God&#8217;s grace, not seized by human force (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).<p>- Stand firm in truth, wearing the belt of truth as part of God&#8217;s armor (<a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/11-15.htm">Judges 11:15</a> shows Jephthah calmly correcting a false charge: Israel never stole land from Moab or Ammon; they took territory God had already transferred from the Amorites.
