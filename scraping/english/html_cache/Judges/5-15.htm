This alliance signifies the tribe's recognition of Deborah's God-given authority and leadership. The princes of Issachar, as leaders, demonstrate their support for God's chosen deliverer, highlighting the importance of unity and obedience to divine guidance in achieving victory.<p><b>and Issachar was with Barak</b><br>Issachar's support extends to Barak, the military leader chosen by God through Deborah. This reflects the tribe's commitment to the battle against the Canaanite oppression. Their presence with Barak underscores the importance of collaboration between spiritual and military leadership in Israel's history, as seen in other instances where God raises leaders to deliver His people (e.g., Moses and Joshua).<p><b>rushing into the valley at his heels</b><br>The phrase suggests a sense of urgency and determination as Issachar follows Barak into battle. The valley likely refers to the Kishon River area, where the battle against Sisera's forces took place. This imagery of rushing into the valley conveys the courage and readiness of Issachar to engage in the fight, trusting in God's promise of victory. It echoes the swift obedience and action seen in other biblical narratives, such as David's confrontation with Goliath.<p><b>In the clans of Reuben there was great indecision</b><br>In contrast to Issachar's decisive action, the tribe of Reuben is characterized by hesitation and internal conflict. This indecision may reflect a lack of unity or fear, preventing them from joining the battle. The mention of Reuben's indecision serves as a cautionary example of the consequences of failing to act in faith and obedience. It highlights the theme of choosing to follow God's call, as seen in other biblical accounts where indecision leads to missed opportunities for blessing and deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/deborah.htm">Deborah</a></b><br>A prophetess and judge of Israel who led the Israelites to victory over the Canaanite oppressors.

The opening note of the song celebrates tribal leaders who threw their weight behind God&#8217;s appointed judge.<p>- Their partnership shows that godly leadership recognizes and submits to the authority God has established (compare <a href="/judges/4-4.htm">Judges 4:4-5</a>; <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p>- The tribe could have stayed home, yet faith moved them to stand with Deborah in a moment of national crisis (see <a href="/judges/5-9.htm">Judges 5:9</a>).<p>- By naming the &#8220;princes,&#8221; the text reminds us that courage at the top inspires courage among the people (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Issachar was with Barak</b><p>- &#8220;&#8230;and Issachar was with Barak&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/judges/5-15.htm">Judges 5:15</a>b). The whole tribe didn&#8217;t just endorse the mission; they accompanied the commander into battle.<p>- Unity appears on two levels: spiritual (Deborah) and military (Barak). When both align under God&#8217;s word, victory follows (<a href="/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6-14</a>; <a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>).<p>- Issachar&#8217;s willingness to fight stands out among the tribes. Centuries later, their descendants still had a reputation for discernment and decisive action (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-32.htm">1 Chronicles 12:32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>rushing into the valley at his heels</b><p>- &#8220;&#8230;rushing into the valley at his heels.&#8221; The phrase pictures Issachar charging down Mount Tabor behind Barak as he broke from cover to confront Sisera&#8217;s chariots (<a href="/judges/4-14.htm">Judges 4:14-16</a>).<p>- Obedience was immediate and energetic; they &#8220;rushed.&#8221; God&#8217;s people often find that hesitation robs blessing, while prompt action invites His power (<a href="/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11-13</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-29.htm">Psalm 18:29</a>).<p>- The valley below was the enemy&#8217;s territory, yet faith led them there, confident that &#8220;the LORD routed Sisera&#8221; (<a href="/judges/4-15.htm">Judges 4:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the clans of Reuben there was great indecision</b><p>- &#8220;In the clans of Reuben there was great indecision.&#8221; While Issachar charged forward, Reuben sat divided (<a href="/judges/5-16.htm">Judges 5:16-17</a>).<p>- Shepherding interests and comfortable pasturelands may have tugged at their hearts (<a href="/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1-5</a>), leading to a tragic wavering between duty and convenience.<p>- Scripture calls double-mindedness unstable (<a href="/james/1-8.htm">James 1:8</a>). Reuben&#8217;s pause became a warning: spiritual neutrality in a moment of battle is itself a choice.<p>- The contrast sharpens the lesson&#8212;faith acts; unbelief analyzes until the opportunity passes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/5-15.htm">Judges 5:15</a> sets two tribes side by side. Issachar stands as a model of immediate, united, God-honoring action under both prophetic and military leadership. Reuben illustrates how indecision, even when cloaked in thoughtful debate, can leave God&#8217;s people on the sidelines. The verse urges every believer: when the Lord calls, move without delay, for obedience joined to faith unleashes His victory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">And the princes of Issachar.</span>--The ordinary reading of the Hebrew gives the meaning, "And <span class= "ital">my </span>princes in Issachar (came down to battle) with Deborah." If this be the right reading, Deborah calls them "my princes" with a touch of pride, and hence some have assumed that she belonged to the tribe of Issachar, not to that of Ephraim. But a very slight change gives the meaning of "the princes in Issachar." Deborah did not take actual part in the battle, like Boadicea or Joan of Arc, but seems to have been close at hand, in the rear, to encourage the combatants, as the ancient British and German women used to do, and as Arab women do to this day.<p><span class= "bld">Even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">even Issachar, as well as Barak, rushed down at his feet </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>after Barak) <span class= "ital">into the plain </span>(<span class= "ital">emek</span>)<span class= "ital">." </span>It is a pity that the verse does not end here, for the next clause begins the description of "the malingerers," whose cowardice or selfishness is triumphantly contrasted with the heroic daring of Zebulon and Naphtali in <a href="/judges/5-18.htm" title="Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that risked their lives to the death in the high places of the field.">Judges 5:18</a>.<p><span class= "bld">For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.</span>--The word for "divisions" (<span class= "ital">pelagoth</span>) might mean "families" or "clans," as the LXX., or "factions," as the Vulgate seems to have understood it; but it almost certainly means <span class= "ital">streams, </span>as in <a href="/job/20-17.htm" title="He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.">Job 20:17</a> (margin, "streaming brooks"), where alone it recurs. The allusion is to the Jabbok and its numerous affluents. "Thoughts of heart" only occurs elsewhere in <a href="/isaiah/12-1.htm" title="And in that day you shall say, O LORD, I will praise you: though you were angry with me, your anger is turned away, and you comforted me.">Isaiah 12:1</a>. where it is rendered "decrees," with the epithet "empty," or "vain." Possibly, therefore, an ironic contrast is intended between the magnanimous "decisions" (<span class= "ital">chikekey </span>l?bh) of Reuben and his evanescent "projects"( <span class= "ital">chikerey </span>l?bh). The play of words is almost certainly contemptuous, and there may be some lurking scorn in the word <span class= "ital">pelagoth </span>to imply either "rivers" or "factions." Reuben debated and stayed at home on frivolous pretences, as Sparta did in the days of Marathon. But even then the sting of the reproach lies in the taunting question of the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He was sent on foot into the valley</span>.
