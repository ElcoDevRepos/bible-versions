This geographical range emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the assembly, suggesting a significant national crisis. Dan and Beersheba are often used in Scripture to denote the full extent of the Israelite territory (<a href="/1_samuel/3-20.htm">1 Samuel 3:20</a>). The inclusion of Gilead highlights the involvement of the Transjordan tribes, showing solidarity among all the tribes of Israel. This unity is significant in the context of the tribal confederation of Israel, which often struggled with internal divisions.<p><b>and the congregation assembled as one man</b><br>The phrase "as one man" underscores the unity and collective resolve of the Israelites. This expression is used to convey a sense of unanimity and shared purpose among the people. In the context of the Book of Judges, where tribal conflicts and disunity are common, this moment of unity is particularly noteworthy. It reflects a rare occasion where the tribes come together with a singular focus, which in this case is to address the grievous crime committed in Gibeah. This unity can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ideal unity that is later realized under the monarchy, particularly during the reigns of David and Solomon.<p><b>before the LORD at Mizpah</b><br>Mizpah was a significant gathering place for the Israelites, often associated with solemn assemblies and important decisions (<a href="/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5-6</a>). The phrase "before the LORD" indicates that this assembly was not merely a political or military gathering but had a religious dimension, acknowledging God's presence and seeking His guidance. Mizpah's location in the territory of Benjamin is significant, as it is near the scene of the crime that prompted this assembly. The gathering "before the LORD" suggests an appeal to divine justice and a desire for God's will to be discerned and followed. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israelite society, where God was recognized as the ultimate authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel, who are responding to a grievous crime committed in the tribe of Benjamin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/dan_to_beersheba.htm">Dan to Beersheba</a></b><br>This phrase signifies the entire land of Israel, from the northernmost city (Dan) to the southernmost city (Beersheba), indicating a united response from all tribes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilead.htm">Gilead</a></b><br>A region east of the Jordan River, included to emphasize the comprehensive gathering of the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mizpah.htm">Mizpah</a></b><br>A significant gathering place for the Israelites, often used for assemblies and important decisions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/assembled_before_the_lord.htm">Assembled before the LORD</a></b><br>This phrase indicates that the gathering was not just a political assembly but also a spiritual one, seeking divine guidance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_righteousness.htm">Unity in Righteousness</a></b><br>The Israelites' unity from Dan to Beersheba demonstrates the importance of collective action in addressing sin and injustice within the community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_assembly.htm">Spiritual Assembly</a></b><br>Assembling "before the LORD" signifies the need for spiritual discernment and seeking God's guidance in decision-making processes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability_and_justice.htm">Accountability and Justice</a></b><br>The gathering at Mizpah underscores the necessity of holding each other accountable and pursuing justice according to God's standards.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/geographical_and_spiritual_inclusivity.htm">Geographical and Spiritual Inclusivity</a></b><br>The inclusion of Gilead and the phrase "from Dan to Beersheba" remind us that God's call to righteousness and justice is comprehensive, involving all His people.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Judges_20_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Judges 20:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Judges_20_1_Israelite_tribal_unity.htm">How does Judges 20:1 demonstrate unity among the tribes of Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Mizpah_for_church_today.htm">What can we learn from Israel's assembly at Mizpah for church gatherings today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Judges_20_1_unity_Ephesians_4_3_peace.htm">How does the unity in Judges 20:1 connect to Ephesians 4:3 about peace?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_must_believers_unite_against_sin.htm">Why is it important for believers to unite against sin, as seen in Judges 20:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Use_Israelite_action_to_fight_injustice.htm">How can we apply the Israelites' collective action to address injustice in our communities?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Judges_20_1_Israel_s_unity_in_crisis.htm">What does Judges 20:1 reveal about Israel's unity during times of crisis?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Judges_20_1_and_Israel_s_tribal_setup.htm">How does Judges 20:1 reflect the tribal structure of ancient Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Judges_20_1_gathering.htm">What historical evidence supports the gathering described in Judges 20:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_judges_20.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Judges 20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/where_is_beersheba_in_the_bible.htm">Where is Beersheba mentioned in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_did_god_allow_israel's_defeats_first.htm">Judges 20:18&#8211;23 &#8211;

That it was a national place of meeting in the time of Samuel is clear from <a href="/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5-12</a>, and we learn from ver. 16 of that same chapter that it was one of the places to which Samuel went on circuit. We find it a place of national meeting also in <a href="/1_samuel/10-17.htm">1 Samuel 10:17</a>, and even so late as <a href="/2_kings/25-23.htm">2 Kings 25:23</a>, and in the time of the Maccabees (1 Macc. 3:46). Its vicinity to Shiloh, where the tabernacle was, was probably one reason why it was made a centre to the whole congregation (see especially <a href="/1_samuel/10-17.htm">1 Samuel 10:17, 22, 25</a>). Its exact site is not known with certainty, but it is thought to be that of <span class="accented">Nebi Samuil</span>, from which Jerusalem is seen at about two hours' distance to the south-east. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the Lord</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the presence of the tabernacle, which was doubtless brought there, on so solemn an occasion, from Shiloh (cf. <a href="/exodus/34-34.htm">Exodus 34:34</a>;
