This marriage was part of God's plan to create conflict between Samson and the Philistines, as seen earlier in <a href="/judges/14-4.htm">Judges 14:4</a>. The Philistines were oppressors of Israel, and this union was unusual because Israelites were generally discouraged from marrying outside their faith and community (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>).<p><b>was given</b><br>The phrase "was given" indicates a transfer of possession or responsibility, which was common in ancient Near Eastern cultures. Marriages were often arranged and controlled by families or communities, and women were sometimes treated as property. This act of giving Samson's wife to another man highlights the lack of agency women had in these situations and reflects the patriarchal society of the time.<p><b>to one of the men</b><br>This refers to one of the companions or friends who had been with Samson during the wedding feast. These men were likely Philistines, as they were part of the wedding celebration in Timnah. The presence of these men underscores the cultural and social interactions between the Israelites and the Philistines, despite their enmity.<p><b>who had accompanied him</b><br>The men who accompanied Samson were part of the wedding party, possibly serving as groomsmen or companions. In <a href="/judges/14-11.htm">Judges 14:11</a>, it is mentioned that thirty companions were brought to be with him, which was a customary practice to honor the groom. This detail emphasizes the betrayal and the broken trust, as one of these companions was given Samson's wife, further fueling the conflict between Samson and the Philistines.<br><br>This event sets the stage for the subsequent actions of Samson, leading to his vengeance against the Philistines, which is a recurring theme in his narrative. The personal betrayal Samson experiences here is a catalyst for his later exploits and serves as a reminder of the complex interplay between personal relationships and divine purposes in the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his extraordinary strength, which was a gift from God.

As <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a> affirms, He works &#8220;all things together for good&#8221; even through Samson&#8217;s anger.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his wife</b><p>&#8211; The bride was the unnamed Philistine woman from Timnah introduced in <a href="/judges/14-1.htm">Judges 14:1&#8211;2</a>.<p>&#8211; Scripture treats marriage as a covenant (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>; <a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14</a>). From God&#8217;s perspective she was Samson&#8217;s legitimate wife, despite her pagan background.<p>&#8211; Her Philistine identity highlights the tension of an unequal yoke (<a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15&#8211;16</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>). The union that began in compromise now unravels in painful consequences.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was given</b><p>&#8211; Her father transferred her to another man while Samson was absent, thinking the marriage had collapsed. <a href="/judges/15-2.htm">Judges 15:2</a> recaps the father&#8217;s reasoning: &#8220;I really thought you thoroughly hated her; so I gave her to your companion.&#8221;<p>&#8211; This action violated the permanence God intends for marriage (<a href="/matthew/19-6.htm">Matthew 19:6</a>). It also echoed Saul&#8217;s later stunt of giving Michal to another husband when David was on the run (<a href="/1_samuel/25-44.htm">1 Samuel 25:44</a>).<p>&#8211; In Scripture, &#8220;being given&#8221; can carry tragic weight&#8212;compare Bathsheba taken by David (<a href="/bsb/2_samuel/11.htm">2 Samuel 11</a>) or Israel &#8220;given&#8221; into enemy hands for disobedience (<a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>). Here it foreshadows judgment on the Philistines.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to one of the men</b><p>&#8211; The recipient was one of the thirty companions supplied by the Philistines for Samson&#8217;s wedding feast (<a href="/judges/14-11.htm">Judges 14:11</a>).<p>&#8211; These men posed as friends yet manipulated Samson during the riddle episode (<a href="/judges/14-15.htm">Judges 14:15</a>). <a href="/proverbs/19-6.htm">Proverbs 19:6</a> notes that &#8220;many curry favor with a ruler, and everyone is the friend of a man who gives gifts,&#8221; hinting at their shallow motives.<p>&#8211; Their readiness to receive Samson&#8217;s wife underscores the moral looseness of Philistine society and contrasts with the loyalty God desires among His people (<a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who had accompanied him</b><p>&#8211; The betrayal stings because the man had been part of Samson&#8217;s inner circle during the celebration. <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a> laments a similar wound: &#8220;Even my close friend, whom I trusted, who shared my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.&#8221;<p>&#8211; Treachery from within often becomes a catalyst for divine deliverance. Joseph&#8217;s brothers sold him (<a href="/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>), but God used it to save many lives (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>). Likewise, this personal injustice propels Samson toward the exploits of <a href="/bsb/judges/15.htm">Judges 15</a>, where the Spirit empowers him to strike the Philistines with decisive blows (<a href="/judges/15-4.htm">Judges 15:4&#8211;5, 14</a>&#8211;15).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/14-20.htm">Judges 14:20</a> records a shocking transfer: while Samson cools off elsewhere, his bride is handed to a so-called companion. The verse exposes Philistine faithlessness, highlights the cost of Samson&#8217;s earlier compromise, and sets the stage for God to use Samson&#8217;s righteous anger against Israel&#8217;s oppressors. What looks like marital betrayal becomes another thread in the tapestry of God&#8217;s sovereign plan to deliver His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">To his companion, whom he had used as his friend</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to the chief of the paranyraphs (the bride-conductor, LXX.); "the friend of the bride-groom" (<a href="/john/3-29.htm" title="He that has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.">John 3:29</a>). Hence, even if the suspicion as to the meaning of Samson's words in <a href="/judges/14-18.htm" title="And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion? and he said to them, If you had not plowed with my heifer, you had not found out my riddle.">Judges 14:18</a> be unfounded, it is clear that there was treachery and secret hostility at work.

The parents of the Thimnathite, having no doubt obtained Samson's dower, and supposing him to have finally broken with his treacherous wife, proceeded to give her in marriage to the Philistine young man who had been Samson's friend - perhaps the man to whom she had told the riddle. The sad end of this unhappy alliance fully justified the opposition of Samson's parents to it in ver. 3. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/14-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and his</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;im&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8123.htm">Strong's 8123: </a> </span><span class="str2">Samson -- a deliverer of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wife</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;&#353;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_802.htm">Strong's 802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woman, wife, female</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was given</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#601;&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to one of the men who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had accompanied</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#234;&#183;&#8216;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7462.htm">Strong's 7462: </a> </span><span class="str2">To tend a, flock, pasture it, in, to graze, to rule, to associate with</span><br /><br /><span class="word">him.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/judges/14-20.htm">Judges 14:20 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/judges/14-20.htm">Judges 14:20 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/judges/14-20.htm">Judges 14:20 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/judges/14-20.htm">Judges 14:20 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/judges/14-20.htm">Judges 14:20 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/judges/14-20.htm">Judges 14:20  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/judges/14-20.htm">Judges 14:20 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/judges/14-20.htm">Judges 14:20 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/judges/14-20.htm">Judges 14:20 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/judges/14-20.htm">Judges 14:20 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/judges/14-20.htm">OT History: Judges 14:20 But Samson's wife was given to his (Jd Judg.
