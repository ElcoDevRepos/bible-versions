The birth of Samson is significant as it occurs during a time when Israel was oppressed by the Philistines, and God was raising a deliverer. The miraculous nature of his birth, announced by an angel, parallels other significant biblical births, such as Isaac, John the Baptist, and Jesus.<p><b>and named him Samson.</b><br>The name "Samson" is derived from the Hebrew word "shemesh," meaning "sun." This could symbolize strength and might, reflecting Samson's future role as a judge and deliverer of Israel. The name may also suggest a connection to the sun god worshiped by the Philistines, indicating a divine irony as Samson would later challenge their gods.<p><b>The boy grew,</b><br>This phrase indicates the natural progression of Samson's life, emphasizing his development and preparation for the role God had ordained for him. It echoes the growth narratives of other biblical figures like Samuel and Jesus, who also grew in wisdom and stature, preparing for their divine missions.<p><b>and the LORD blessed him.</b><br>The blessing of the LORD signifies divine favor and empowerment. In the context of the Judges, this blessing is crucial as it sets Samson apart for his unique role as a judge and deliverer. The LORD's blessing is a recurring theme in the lives of those chosen for special purposes, such as Abraham, Joseph, and David, indicating divine presence and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>The central figure in <a href="/judges/13-24.htm">Judges 13:24</a>, Samson is born as a result of divine intervention.

The angel&#8217;s promise in <a href="/judges/13-3.htm">Judges 13:3&#8211;7</a> comes true exactly, echoing earlier fulfilled promises such as Isaac&#8217;s birth to Abraham and Sarah (<a href="/genesis/21-1.htm">Genesis 21:1-3</a>) and Samuel&#8217;s birth to Hannah (<a href="/1_samuel/1-19.htm">1 Samuel 1:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The conception highlights divine initiative. Manoah&#8217;s wife had been barren (<a href="/judges/13-2.htm">Judges 13:2</a>), yet nothing is impossible with God (<a href="/luke/1-36.htm">Luke 1:36-37</a>).<p>&#8226; Every life begins under God&#8217;s sovereignty. <a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a> reminds us, &#8220;Children are a heritage from the LORD.&#8221; Samson&#8217;s life story starts with God&#8217;s gracious gift.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and named him Samson.</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and named him Samson.&#8221; (<a href="/judges/13-24.htm">Judges 13:24</a>b)<p>&#8226; Naming is an act of faith and obedience. Like Abraham naming Isaac (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>) or Zechariah naming John (<a href="/luke/1-63.htm">Luke 1:63</a>), Manoah and his wife accept God&#8217;s plan by giving the child the name disclosed through the angel (<a href="/judges/13-8.htm">Judges 13:8, 13</a>).<p>&#8226; A name sets direction. Throughout Scripture, God-given names hint at destiny&#8212;think of Jesus, &#8220;for He will save His people&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>). Samson&#8217;s name positions him for the role foretold in <a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>: &#8220;He will begin the deliverance of Israel.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Parents participate in God&#8217;s redemptive narrative. By naming their son as instructed, they align their household with God&#8217;s purposes, much like Joshua&#8217;s declaration, &#8220;As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The boy grew, and the LORD blessed him.</b><p>&#8220;The boy grew, and the LORD blessed him.&#8221; (<a href="/judges/13-24.htm">Judges 13:24</a>c)<p>&#8226; Growth underscores normal development under extraordinary favor. Similar wording describes Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/2-26.htm">1 Samuel 2:26</a>) and Jesus (<a href="/luke/2-40.htm">Luke 2:40</a>), showing a pattern of divinely guided maturation for deliverers and redeemers.<p>&#8226; The blessing is personal and present. It is not merely future promise but ongoing empowerment, anticipating the Spirit&#8217;s stirring in Samson (<a href="/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a>) and echoing God&#8217;s blessing over Isaac (<a href="/genesis/26-12.htm">Genesis 26:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; God equips before He sends. <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a> assures believers that the One who begins a good work will carry it to completion. Samson&#8217;s early blessing foreshadows the strength he will wield on Israel&#8217;s behalf.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/13-24.htm">Judges 13:24</a> records God&#8217;s faithfulness from promise to fulfillment, the parents&#8217; obedient alignment with His plan, and the Lord&#8217;s active blessing on the child destined to deliver Israel.

St. Jerome, rendering it "strength of the sun," derives it from <span class= "ital">shemesh, "</span>sun," and <span class= "ital">on, "</span>strength." It is more probable that it means "sunny." In <a href="/ezra/4-8.htm" title="Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:">Ezra 4:8</a> we have the name Shimshai, perhaps from the same root. The connection of "the sun" with strength was very natural (<a href="/judges/5-31.htm" title="So let all your enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goes forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.">Judges 5:31</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/19-5.htm" title="Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoices as a strong man to run a race.">Psalm 19:5-6</a>). The Rabbis say that he was "named after the name of God, who is called sun and shield of Israel" (<a href="/psalms/84-12.htm" title="O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusts in you.">Psalm 84:12</a>). The mother gave the name in this instance. (Comp. <a href="/context/genesis/29-32.htm" title="And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD has looked on my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.">Genesis 29:32-35</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-18.htm" title="And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.">Genesis 35:18</a>; <a href="/luke/1-60.htm" title="And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.">Luke 1:60</a>.) Ewald refers it to an Egyptian root, and makes it mean "servant of God," in reference to his being a Nazarite. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Called his name Samson</span>. No doubt the name was significant of what the child should be (see note to ver. 17), but the etymology and meaning of the name are doubtful. Josephus ('Antiq.,' V. 8:4) says the name means "a strong one," but he does not say in what language, and it does not appear to have such a meaning in any Semitic dialect. It is commonly interpreted to mean <span class="accented">like the sun</span>, from <span class="accented">shemesh</span>, the common word for the sun; and so Jerome in his 'Onomasticon' expounds it as <span class="accented">the sun's strength</span>,' possibly with an allusion to <a href="/judges/5-31.htm">Judges 5:31</a>. Others make it equal <span class="accented">shim-</span>shorn, from the Pilpel conjugation of <span class="accented">shamem</span>, <span class="accented">to devastate.</span> Another possible derivation is from the Chaldee <span class="accented">shemash</span>, <span class="accented">to minister</span>, specially in sacred things, a root from which the Nestorian, Syriac, and Arabic names for a deacon are derived. If this were the derivation, it would be a reference to his dedication to God as a Nazarite from his mother's womb, the only thing his mother knew about him when she gave him the name. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/13-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the woman</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;i&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
