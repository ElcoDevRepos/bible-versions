Elon was a judge of Israel mentioned in the previous verses, and his tenure is noted for its brevity and lack of detailed exploits. The transition from one judge to another highlights the cyclical nature of leadership during this period, where Israel repeatedly fell into sin, cried out to God, and was delivered by a judge.<p><b>Abdon son of Hillel</b><br>Abdon is introduced as the next judge, and his lineage is specified, which was a common practice to establish credibility and authority. The name "Abdon" means "servant" or "worshiper," which may reflect his role or character. Hillel, his father, is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, suggesting that Abdon's prominence is primarily due to his role as a judge rather than his family background.<p><b>from Pirathon</b><br>Pirathon is identified as Abdon's hometown, located in the territory of Ephraim. This geographical detail situates Abdon within the tribal confederation of Israel and may indicate the regional influence he had. Archaeological evidence suggests that Pirathon was a significant settlement during this period, which could imply that Abdon had access to resources and support necessary for leadership.<p><b>judged Israel</b><br>The role of a judge in Israel was multifaceted, involving military leadership, legal arbitration, and spiritual guidance. Abdon's judgeship is part of the larger narrative of the Book of Judges, which illustrates the Israelites' struggle to remain faithful to God amidst external pressures and internal failings. The judges were seen as deliverers raised by God, and their leadership often foreshadowed the need for a more permanent and righteous king, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elon_the_zebulunite.htm">Elon the Zebulunite</a></b><br>Elon was one of the judges of Israel, hailing from the tribe of Zebulun.
