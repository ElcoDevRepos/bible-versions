The fields were central to the community's sustenance and economy. In the context of Judges, this setting underscores the normalcy of life amidst the political turmoil following Gideon's death. The fields also symbolize the land's fertility, a blessing from God, which contrasts with the spiritual barrenness of the people.<p><b>gathered grapes from their vineyards</b><br>Grape harvesting was a communal activity, often accompanied by joy and celebration. Vineyards were a sign of prosperity and God's blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-8</a>). The act of gathering grapes is reminiscent of the blessings promised to Israel if they obeyed God, yet here it occurs in a context of disobedience and idolatry. The vineyard imagery is also used by Jesus in parables, symbolizing Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>).<p><b>and trodden them</b><br>Treading grapes was a method of extracting juice for wine, a staple in ancient diets and religious rituals. This process required communal effort and was often accompanied by singing and dancing (<a href="/isaiah/16-10.htm">Isaiah 16:10</a>). The act of treading grapes can symbolize judgment in prophetic literature (<a href="/revelation/14-19.htm">Revelation 14:19-20</a>), foreshadowing the judgment that would come upon Abimelech and Shechem.<p><b>they held a festival</b><br>Festivals were integral to Israelite culture, often linked to religious observance. However, this festival was likely pagan, reflecting the syncretism and idolatry prevalent in Israel during the Judges period. Such festivals often involved feasting, drinking, and sacrifices to deities, contrasting with the God-ordained feasts meant to honor Yahweh (Leviticus 23).<p><b>and went into the house of their god</b><br>This phrase highlights the idolatry of the Shechemites, who worshipped Baal-berith (<a href="/judges/8-33.htm">Judges 8:33</a>). The "house of their god" was likely a temple dedicated to this Canaanite deity, representing a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This idolatry set the stage for divine judgment, as God often allowed Israel's enemies to rise when they turned to other gods.<p><b>and as they ate and drank</b><br>Eating and drinking in a religious context often signified fellowship with the deity being worshipped. In this case, it underscores the people's apostasy and moral decline. The act of eating and drinking in pagan worship contrasts with the Lord's Supper in the New Testament, where believers remember Christ's sacrifice (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-23.htm">1 Corinthians 11:23-26</a>).<p><b>they cursed Abimelech</b><br>Cursing Abimelech reflects the political and social unrest in Shechem. Abimelech, Gideon's son, had seized power through treachery and violence (<a href="/judges/9.htm">Judges 9:1-6</a>). The curse signifies the people's discontent and foreshadows Abimelech's downfall. Biblically, curses often precede divine judgment, as seen in the covenant curses of <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.
