The name "Lehi" means "jawbone," which is fitting given the events that follow in the chapter. This area was under Philistine control during the time of the Judges, a period characterized by cycles of Israelite disobedience, oppression by foreign powers, cries for deliverance, and the rise of judges like Samson. Samson's arrival in Lehi marks a pivotal moment in his conflict with the Philistines, who were a dominant force in the region.<p><b>the Philistines came out shouting against him</b><br>The Philistines were a seafaring people who settled along the coastal regions of Canaan. They were often in conflict with the Israelites, as seen throughout the book of Judges. Their shouting signifies both a war cry and a display of confidence in their ability to capture Samson, who had been a thorn in their side. This moment reflects the ongoing struggle between the Israelites and the Philistines, a theme that continues into the reigns of Saul and David.<p><b>And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him</b><br>The Spirit of the LORD empowering individuals is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, particularly in the book of Judges. This divine empowerment is not indicative of Samson's personal righteousness but rather God's sovereign choice to use him as an instrument of deliverance for Israel. The Spirit's coming upon Samson mightily signifies a supernatural strength and ability, reminiscent of other judges like Gideon and Jephthah, who were also empowered by the Spirit to deliver Israel from oppression.<p><b>The ropes on his arms became like burnt flax</b><br>Flax, when burnt, becomes weak and brittle, easily broken. This imagery highlights the miraculous nature of Samson's deliverance. The ropes, which were meant to bind him securely, become ineffective under the power of the Spirit. This transformation from strong to weak symbolizes God's ability to overturn human constraints and reflects the theme of divine intervention in seemingly impossible situations.<p><b>and the bonds broke loose from his hands</b><br>The breaking of the bonds signifies liberation and foreshadows the victory Samson is about to achieve over the Philistines. This act of breaking free is symbolic of Israel's potential deliverance from their oppressors when they turn to God. It also prefigures the ultimate deliverance found in Jesus Christ, who breaks the bonds of sin and death for humanity. Samson's physical liberation here is a type of the spiritual liberation that Christ offers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God.
