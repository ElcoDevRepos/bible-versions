Gibeah, a city within Benjamin's territory, is significant as the site of a grievous crime that led to this battle (Judges 19). The Benjamites' defense of Gibeah highlights tribal loyalty and the severe breakdown of unity among the Israelites. Gibeah's location, identified with modern Tell el-Ful, was strategically important, providing a defensible position.<p><b>and cut down 22,000 Israelites</b><br>The phrase indicates a devastating defeat for the Israelites, who vastly outnumbered the Benjamites. This loss underscores the seriousness of internal strife and the consequences of sin within the community. The number 22,000 may symbolize completeness in judgment, reflecting the severity of the situation. This event parallels other instances in Scripture where Israel suffers due to disobedience or moral failure, such as the defeat at Ai (Joshua 7).<p><b>on the battlefield that day</b><br>The battlefield context emphasizes the physical and spiritual warfare occurring among God's people. The phrase "that day" suggests a specific, divinely appointed time for judgment. This battle is part of a larger narrative of Israel's cyclical sin and redemption, illustrating the need for a righteous leader. It foreshadows the coming of a perfect Judge and King, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who brings ultimate peace and unity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamites.htm">Benjamites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel, descendants of Benjamin, the youngest son of Jacob.
