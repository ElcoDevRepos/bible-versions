The context is the civil war that erupted due to the grievous sin committed in Gibeah, a Benjamite city. The Israelites had initially suffered losses but eventually gained the upper hand. This turning back signifies a strategic and determined effort to subdue the remaining Benjamites, highlighting the severity of the conflict within the tribes of Israel.<p><b>and put to the sword all the cities</b><br>The phrase "put to the sword" reflects the complete destruction and judgment executed by the Israelites. This was a common practice in ancient warfare, often seen as a form of divine judgment. The cities of Benjamin were systematically destroyed, which underscores the seriousness of the offense and the need for purging evil from among the people, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/13-15.htm">Deuteronomy 13:15</a>.<p><b>including the animals and everything else they found</b><br>The inclusion of animals and all possessions in the destruction indicates a total annihilation, similar to the concept of herem, or devotion to destruction, seen in other parts of the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/joshua/6-21.htm">Joshua 6:21</a>). This reflects the idea of removing all traces of sin and corruption, ensuring that nothing remains that could lead the Israelites back into sin.<p><b>And they burned down all the cities in their path</b><br>Burning the cities was a final act of destruction, ensuring that the cities could not be easily rebuilt or reoccupied. This act of burning is reminiscent of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>) and serves as a symbol of divine judgment. It also foreshadows the future destruction of Jerusalem, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/21-10.htm">Jeremiah 21:10</a>, when the city would be burned due to the people's unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_israel.htm">Men of Israel</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel, excluding Benjamin, who united to execute judgment against the tribe of Benjamin for their grievous sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamites.htm">Benjamites</a></b><br>The tribe of Benjamin, who were nearly annihilated due to their defense of the wickedness committed in Gibeah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a></b><br>The city in Benjamin where a heinous crime was committed, leading to the conflict between Israel and Benjamin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_battle.htm">The Battle</a></b><br>A civil war within Israel, where the tribes sought to punish Benjamin for harboring and defending the perpetrators of a vile act.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/destruction_of_cities.htm">Destruction of Cities</a></b><br>The complete destruction of Benjamite cities, people, and livestock as a form of divine judgment and purification.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin, especially when unrepented, can lead to severe consequences.
