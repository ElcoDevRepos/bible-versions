The term "my Lord" indicates a recognition of authority, possibly addressing the angel of the LORD. This encounter occurs during a time of oppression by the Midianites, highlighting Gideon's humility and desperation. The use of "my Lord" can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is often addressed with similar reverence in the New Testament.<p><b>&#8220;if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us?&#8221;</b><br>Gideon's question reflects a common biblical theme of questioning God's presence during times of suffering. This echoes the laments found in the Psalms, where the psalmists often ask why God seems distant in times of trouble. Historically, Israel was experiencing oppression due to their disobedience, as outlined in <a href="/judges/6.htm">Judges 6:1</a>. This question also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of suffering and divine presence, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>.<p><b>&#8220;And where are all His wonders of which our fathers told us,&#8221;</b><br>Gideon references the miraculous acts of God in Israel's history, such as the plagues in Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea. This reflects a cultural tradition of oral history, where stories of God's deliverance were passed down through generations. The wonders serve as a type of Christ's miracles in the New Testament, demonstrating God's power and presence among His people.<p><b>&#8220;saying, &#8216;Has not the LORD brought us up out of Egypt?&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This phrase recalls the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history symbolizing deliverance and salvation. The Exodus is frequently referenced throughout the Old Testament as a demonstration of God's faithfulness and power. It serves as a type of Christ's redemptive work, as Jesus is seen as the ultimate deliverer who brings spiritual liberation.<p><b>&#8220;But now the LORD has forsaken us and delivered us into the hand of Midian.&#8221;</b><br>Gideon's statement reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where disobedience leads to divine discipline. The oppression by Midian is a consequence of Israel's idolatry, as described earlier in <a href="/judges/6.htm">Judges 6</a>. This situation is reminiscent of the cycles of sin and redemption throughout the book of Judges. The feeling of being forsaken is addressed in the New Testament, where Jesus promises never to leave nor forsake His followers (<a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>), offering a contrast to the temporary abandonment experienced by Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, called by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.
