This reflects the period of the Judges, characterized by a lack of centralized leadership in Israel, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). The invitation indicates Micah's desire for spiritual legitimacy and guidance, as Levites were set apart for religious duties (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-10</a>).<p><b>&#8220;and be my father and priest,&#8221;</b><br>Micah seeks a personal priest, which deviates from the established Levitical priesthood centered in the tabernacle. The term "father" here is a title of respect and authority, suggesting a spiritual leadership role. This reflects the syncretism and religious confusion of the time, as Micah attempts to create his own version of worship, contrary to <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-14</a>, which prescribes centralized worship.<p><b>&#8220;and I will give you ten shekels of silver per year,&#8221;</b><br>The offer of ten shekels of silver annually indicates a formal agreement and the value placed on religious services. This payment reflects the economic practices of the time, where silver was a common medium of exchange. The amount suggests a modest but significant compensation, highlighting the Levite's willingness to accept a stable position despite its irregularity.<p><b>&#8220;a suit of clothes,&#8221;</b><br>Providing clothing was part of the compensation, indicating the Levite's dependence on Micah for his basic needs. This reflects the cultural practice of patronage, where a benefactor supports a client in exchange for services. Clothing also symbolizes status and identity, and in this context, it may signify the Levite's new role in Micah's household.<p><b>&#8220;and your provisions.&#8221;</b><br>Micah promises to supply the Levite's daily needs, ensuring his sustenance. This arrangement underscores the Levite's vulnerability and the lack of a centralized support system for the priesthood during this period. It also highlights the personal nature of the agreement, as Micah assumes responsibility for the Levite's well-being.<p><b>So the Levite went in.</b><br>The Levite's acceptance of Micah's offer demonstrates the pragmatic decisions made by individuals during the time of the Judges. His willingness to serve in a non-traditional role reflects the broader theme of religious and moral ambiguity in the book of Judges. This decision foreshadows the eventual consequences of Israel's departure from God's prescribed order, as seen in the subsequent narrative of the Danites' idolatry (Judges 18).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A man from the hill country of Ephraim who creates a shrine and hires a Levite to be his priest.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A young man from Bethlehem in Judah who becomes a priest for Micah, despite the irregularity of the arrangement.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>A region in Israel where Micah resides, known for its central location and significance in Israelite history.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethlehem_in_judah.htm">Bethlehem in Judah</a></b><br>The Levite's original home, a town with significant biblical history, including being the birthplace of King David and later, Jesus Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shrine.htm">The Shrine</a></b><br>A place of worship set up by Micah, which includes an idol and other religious artifacts, contrary to God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_syncretism.htm">The Danger of Syncretism</a></b><br>Micah's actions demonstrate the risk of blending true worship with pagan practices.

Inviting the young Levite to remain in his house sounds generous (compare <a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16</a> where Ruth clings to Naomi), yet <a href="/judges/17-13.htm">Judges 17:13</a> shows Micah&#8217;s real motive: &#8220;Now I know that the LORD will be good to me, since the Levite has become my priest.&#8221; Throughout Judges, &#8220;everyone did what was right in his own eyes&#8221; (<a href="/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>; cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/12-8.htm">Deuteronomy 12:8</a>). By asking the Levite to stay, Micah hopes to place God&#8217;s favor on a private shrine&#8212;something God had never sanctioned (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Be my father and priest</b><p>Calling the Levite &#8220;father&#8221; is a respectful term for a spiritual adviser (<a href="/2_kings/6-21.htm">2 Kings 6:21</a>; 13:14; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>). Yet priesthood in Israel was reserved for Aaron&#8217;s descendants serving at the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1-5</a>). Micah blurs that line, inventing a personal religion that borrows holy language while ignoring God&#8217;s clear commands. By contrast, later Danites tempt the same Levite with wider influence: &#8220;Come with us&#8230; be a father and a priest to a tribe and clan in Israel&#8221; (<a href="/judges/18-19.htm">Judges 18:19</a>). Both offers expose how easily spiritual leadership can be reduced to career advancement when truth is sidelined.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ten shekels of silver per year</b><p>Micah sweetens the deal with a measurable salary. Ten shekels were a modest but steady income (compare the bride-price in <a href="/genesis/34-12.htm">Genesis 34:12</a> or the thirty shekels paid Judas in <a href="/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a>). God had already provided for Levites through tithes and portions (<a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21-24</a>), yet Micah offers a private paycheck, substituting human arrangement for divine provision. When ministry becomes a mere contract, the message is soon shaped to please the patron (<a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A suit of clothes</b><p>Priestly garments were to be &#8220;for glory and for beauty&#8221; and strictly regulated (<a href="/exodus/28-2.htm">Exodus 28:2</a>). Micah offers a single &#8220;suit of clothes,&#8221; likely everyday attire, signaling convenience over consecration. Later Gehazi covets &#8220;two changes of clothes&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/5-22.htm">2 Kings 5:22-27</a>) and reaps judgment. Clothing often symbolizes identity; here it marks a compromised priesthood.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your provisions</b><p>Food and lodging complete the package. God&#8217;s law already guaranteed Levites &#8220;their due portions&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-27.htm">Deuteronomy 14:27-29</a>). Micah&#8217;s private stipend bypasses communal responsibility and central worship. The apostle Paul reminds that &#8220;those who serve at the altar share in the offerings&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13</a>), but always within God&#8217;s ordained framework, not personal contracts that feed individualism.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the Levite went in</b><p>The young man accepts, illustrating how spiritual drift often begins with small compromises. Like Elimelech leaving Bethlehem for Moab (<a href="/ruth/1-1.htm">Ruth 1:1-2</a>) or Demas loving this present world (<a href="/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>), the Levite chooses comfort over covenant. His decision sets the stage for the idolatry of <a href="/bsb/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>, where an entire tribe is led astray.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Micah&#8217;s invitation blends devotion-sounding words with self-serving reality. A genuine priesthood, God-ordained place of worship, and proper provision already existed, yet both Micah and the Levite trade obedience for convenience&#8212;ten shekels, a suit of clothes, daily rations. <a href="/judges/17-10.htm">Judges 17:10</a> warns that when God&#8217;s clear commands are replaced by private arrangements, even sincere-sounding religion becomes idolatry, leading individuals and communities away from the Lord&#8217;s blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Be unto me a father and a priest.</span>--The title "father" is here ecclesiastical, like "papa," "pope," &c, and this title was given to spiritual directors, as we find in several other passages in the Bible (<a href="/2_kings/2-12.htm" title="And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.

This is not a common application of the word father in the Old Testament. The prominent idea seems to be one of honour, combined with authority to teach and advise. It is applied to prophets (<a href="/2_kings/2-12.htm">2 Kings 2:12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/6-21.htm">2 Kings 6:21</a>; <a href="/2_kings/13-14.htm">2 Kings 13:14</a>), and to Joseph (<a href="/genesis/45-8.htm">Genesis 45:8</a>). The idea is implied in the converse phrase of <span class="accented">son</span>, applied to those to whom the prophets stood in 'the relation of spiritual fathers (see <a href="/2_kings/8-9.htm">2 Kings 8:9</a>; <a href="/proverbs/4-10.htm">Proverbs 4:10, 20</a>, and frequently elsewhere). The abuse of the feeling which dictates the term as applied to human teachers is reproved by our Lord (<a href="/matthew/23-9.htm">Matthew 23:9</a>). It has been freely used in the Christian Church, as in the titles <span class="accented">papa</span> or <span class="accented">pope</span> applied to bishops, <span class="accented">abbot</span> and <span class="accented">abbas</span>, <span class="accented">father in God</span>, <span class="accented">fathers of the Church</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> Here there is perhaps a special reference to the function of Micah's priest to ask counsel of God, and then give that counsel to those who came to inquire (see note to ver. 5). It may be added that the idea of <span class="accented">counsellor</span> seems to be inherent in the word cohen or <span class="accented">priest</span>, as in <a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-5.htm">1 Kings 4:5</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Ten shekels</span> - a little over a pound of our money, but probably equivalent to &pound;20, when considered relatively to articles of consumption. <span class="cmt_word">A suit of apparel</span>.

Thence it came to mean the <span class="accented">estimation</span> or <span class="accented">worth</span> of a person or thing - some-what as we use the word <span class="accented">rank.</span> From this last sense some interpret the word here to mean the <span class="accented">worth</span> or <span class="accented">price</span> of his clothes. Others, including St. Jerome and the Septuagint, interpret it <span class="accented">a pair</span> of vestments, meaning summer and winter clothing. But perhaps the A.V., <span class="accented">suit</span>, meaning the whole set of under and upper garments, is after all the best interpretation. <span class="cmt_word">The Levite went in</span>. The Hebrew is <span class="accented">went</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> according to the common use of the word, <span class="accented">went his way.</span> And such is probably the meaning here. He went his way to consider the proposal made to him. The result is given in the next verse: <span class="accented">And the Levite was content</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/17-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Stay</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular &#124;
