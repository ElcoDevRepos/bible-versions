Throughout the Book of Judges, the Israelites repeatedly turn away from Yahweh to worship the gods of the surrounding nations, such as Baal and Ashtoreth. This command from God is a form of divine irony, highlighting the futility of trusting in false gods. It echoes the covenant stipulations found in Deuteronomy, where God warns Israel of the consequences of idolatry. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the first commandment, emphasizing exclusive worship of the one true God.<p><b>Let them save you in your time of trouble.</b><br>This statement underscores the impotence of idols and false gods. In the ancient Near Eastern context, people believed that gods had power over specific aspects of life, such as fertility, weather, or war. However, the God of Israel is portrayed as sovereign over all creation, rendering other deities powerless. This challenge to the Israelites is similar to Elijah's confrontation with the prophets of Baal in <a href="/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>, where the inability of Baal to respond to his followers' cries is starkly contrasted with Yahweh's power. The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance found in Jesus Christ, who is the only true Savior in times of trouble, fulfilling the role that false gods could never achieve.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who repeatedly turned away from Him to worship other gods, leading to their oppression by surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God who delivered Israel from Egypt and established a covenant with them, yet is now responding to their idolatry with righteous judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreign_gods.htm">Foreign Gods</a></b><br>The idols and deities of the surrounding nations that the Israelites chose to worship, forsaking their covenant with Yahweh.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites_and_philistines.htm">Ammonites and Philistines</a></b><br>The oppressors of Israel during this period, used by God as instruments of judgment against Israel's unfaithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, he becomes the judge who delivers Israel from the Ammonites later in the chapter.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_idolatry.htm">The Consequences of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry leads to spiritual and often physical bondage.
