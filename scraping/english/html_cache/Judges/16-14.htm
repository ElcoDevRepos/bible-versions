Sleep in the Bible often symbolizes a lack of spiritual vigilance (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>). Samson's physical strength was unmatched, but his spiritual discernment was weak, leading to his downfall.<p><b>Delilah took the seven braids of his hair</b><br>The seven braids represent the Nazirite vow, which included not cutting one's hair (<a href="/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>). Delilah's actions symbolize betrayal and the breaking of a covenant. The number seven often signifies completeness or divine perfection in the Bible, highlighting the gravity of this act.<p><b>and wove them into the web</b><br>This act of weaving can be seen as a metaphor for entanglement in sin. The web represents a trap, similar to how sin ensnares individuals (<a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>). Delilah's weaving is a physical manifestation of the spiritual entrapment Samson faces.<p><b>Then she tightened it with a pin</b><br>The pin signifies the finality and firmness of the trap. In ancient weaving, a pin would secure the threads, symbolizing how sin can become firmly rooted in one's life. This act shows Delilah's determination to subdue Samson.<p><b>and called to him, &#8220;Samson, the Philistines are here!&#8221;</b><br>Delilah's call is a repeated tactic to test Samson's strength (<a href="/judges/16-6.htm">Judges 16:6, 16</a>:9, 16:12). The Philistines were long-time oppressors of Israel, representing the constant threat of worldly powers against God's people. This call to Samson is a reminder of the ever-present danger of falling into enemy hands.<p><b>But he awoke from his sleep</b><br>Samson's awakening is a moment of realization and action. It parallels spiritual awakening, where one becomes aware of their sinful state and the need for repentance (<a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a>). However, Samson's awakening is temporary, as he does not fully grasp the spiritual implications of his actions.<p><b>and pulled out the pin with the loom and the web</b><br>Samson's physical strength allows him to escape the immediate trap, but it foreshadows his eventual downfall when his strength is truly compromised (<a href="/judges/16-19.htm">Judges 16:19-21</a>). This act demonstrates that while he can break free physically, he remains spiritually bound. The pulling out of the pin signifies a temporary victory over sin, but without true repentance, the cycle continues.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was linked to his Nazirite vow and uncut hair.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/delilah.htm">Delilah</a></b><br>A woman from the Valley of Sorek who was bribed by the Philistine rulers to discover the secret of Samson's strength.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A group of people who were enemies of Israel and sought to capture and subdue Samson.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/valley_of_sorek.htm">Valley of Sorek</a></b><br>The location where Delilah lived and where Samson frequently visited her.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazirite_vow.htm">Nazirite Vow</a></b><br>A vow taken by individuals to be set apart for God, which included abstaining from cutting one's hair, consuming alcohol, and avoiding contact with dead bodies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_compromise.htm">The Danger of Compromise</a></b><br>Samson's repeated visits to Delilah show how small compromises can lead to significant downfalls.

The loom was doubtless one of a simple kind in ordinary domestic use (like that described in <span class= "ital">Livingstone's Travels</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and Samson, startled from sleep, tore away his locks with the plug which fastened them down and the warp into which they were woven.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she fastened it with the pin</span>. The Septuagint and many commentators understand that she used the pin (it is the common word for a tent pin) to fasten the loom or frame to the ground, or to the wall. But a good sense comes out if we understand the phrase to mean, <span class="accented">So she struck with the shuttle</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she did what Samson told her to do, viz., wove his locks into the warp which was already prepared. This was done by successive strokes of the shuttle, to which the hair was fastened. <span class="accented">To strike with the peg or shuttle</span> may have been the technical phrase for throwing the shuttle with the woof into the warp; and it is a strong argument in favour of this interpretation that it makes her action the simple fulfilment of his directions. He said, "Weave my locks into the warp. So she struck with the shuttle." <span class="cmt_word">With the pin of the beam, and with the web</span>. The Hebrew word '<span class="accented">ereg</span> cannot mean <span class="accented">the beam</span>, as it is here translated; it is the substantive of the verb <span class="accented">to weave</span> in ver. 13. Its obvious meaning, therefore, is <span class="accented">the woof.</span> The pin of the woof, therefore, is the shuttle with the woof attached to it, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Samson's hair, which was firmly woven into the <span class="accented">warp.</span> He went away with. This is the same word as was applied in ver. 3 to his <span class="accented">plucking up</span> the gateposts. Now, with the strength of his neck, he tore up the shuttle which fastened his hair to the warp, and so dragged the whole solid frame along with it. However, as we do not know the technical term of the art of the weaving among the Hebrews and Philistines, nor the precise construction of their looms, some obscurity necessarily attaches to this description. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/16-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[So while he slept, Delilah took the seven braids of his hair and wove them into the web].
