Gaza was one of the five major Philistine cities, located on the southwestern coast of Canaan. It was a significant Philistine stronghold, and Samson's presence there indicates his boldness and disregard for the danger posed by the Philistines. This journey to Gaza also reflects the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Philistines during the period of the Judges, a time characterized by cycles of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance.<p><b>where he saw a prostitute</b><br>The mention of a prostitute highlights Samson's moral weaknesses, particularly his susceptibility to sexual temptation. This aspect of his character is a recurring theme in his narrative, as seen in his relationships with women like Delilah. The presence of a prostitute in Gaza also reflects the moral and spiritual decay prevalent in Philistine society, which was often at odds with the covenantal standards of Israel. This encounter foreshadows the further complications in Samson's life due to his inability to resist such temptations.<p><b>and went in to spend the night with her</b><br>Samson's decision to spend the night with the prostitute demonstrates his impulsive nature and lack of self-control. This act of disobedience to God's laws concerning sexual purity and separation from pagan practices is a significant flaw in his character. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of straying from God's commandments, as seen throughout the history of Israel. Samson's actions here can be contrasted with the life of Jesus Christ, who, though tempted, remained sinless and obedient to God's will, serving as the ultimate example of righteousness and self-control.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his extraordinary strength, which was a gift from God tied to his Nazirite vow.

Scripture records it as historical fact (cf. <a href="/judges/15-20.htm">Judges 15:20</a>; <a href="/1_kings/13-11.htm">1 Kings 13:11</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminds us that even divinely empowered people face decisive days when choices reveal their hearts (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The suddenness emphasizes how temptation can appear in an ordinary moment; vigilance is always necessary (<a href="/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Samson went to Gaza</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;went to Gaza&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Gaza was a chief city of the Philistines, the very people God raised Samson to oppose (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>; <a href="/joshua/15-47.htm">Joshua 15:47</a>).<p>&#8226; By entering enemy territory voluntarily, Samson drifted from his Nazarite calling and mission (<a href="/numbers/6-1.htm">Numbers 6:1-8</a>; <a href="/judges/15-14.htm">Judges 15:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers likewise court danger when they place themselves in settings that nurture sin (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/4-14.htm">Proverbs 4:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He saw a prostitute</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;where he saw a prostitute&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Samson&#8217;s eyes again lead him (compare <a href="/judges/14-1.htm">Judges 14:1-3</a>).

The verse warns believers that unchecked desires, ignored callings, and flirtations with hostile environments erode spiritual strength, yet it also underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty to accomplish His purposes despite human failure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Then went Samson to Gaza.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">And Samson, &c. </span>The narrative is brief and detached. Gaza is near the sea, and was the chief town of the Philistines, in the very heart of their country.
