This phrase indicates the extent of their encampment, reaching as far as Gaza, a significant city in the Philistine territory. This shows the widespread nature of the oppression, affecting a large portion of the land. Historically, Gaza was a major city on the southwestern edge of Canaan, indicating the invaders' reach and the strategic importance of their encampment. The mention of Gaza highlights the severity of the threat, as it was a key location for trade and military movements.<p><b>and destroying the produce of the land</b><br>The invaders' strategy involved not just military oppression but economic devastation. By destroying the crops, they aimed to weaken Israel by cutting off their food supply, leading to famine and desperation. This tactic was common in ancient warfare, as it would force the subjugated people into submission. The destruction of produce also has spiritual implications, as the land was a gift from God to the Israelites, and its devastation symbolized a breach in the covenant relationship due to Israel's disobedience.<p><b>They left Israel with no sustenance</b><br>The complete lack of sustenance underscores the severity of the Midianite oppression. This phrase highlights the dire situation faced by the Israelites, who were left without the basic necessities for survival. It reflects the consequences of Israel's disobedience to God, as they were left vulnerable to their enemies. This situation sets the stage for God to raise up a deliverer, Gideon, to rescue His people, demonstrating His mercy and faithfulness despite their unfaithfulness.<p><b>neither sheep nor oxen nor donkeys</b><br>The mention of sheep, oxen, and donkeys indicates the comprehensive nature of the devastation. These animals were essential for agriculture, transportation, and daily life in ancient Israel. Sheep provided wool and meat, oxen were crucial for plowing fields, and donkeys were used for carrying loads. The loss of these animals would have crippled the Israelites' ability to recover economically and sustain themselves. This phrase emphasizes the totality of the Midianite oppression and the desperate need for divine intervention. The absence of these animals also symbolizes the stripping away of Israel's blessings due to their disobedience, pointing to the need for repentance and reliance on God for restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianites.htm">Midianites</a></b><br>A nomadic people who oppressed Israel during the time of the Judges.

Israel could no longer flee to a safer season; the enemy was settled on their doorstep, a living reminder that &#8220;the LORD gave them into the hands of Midian seven years&#8221; (<a href="/judges/6-1.htm">Judges 6:1</a>).<p>- This fulfills covenant warnings that hostile nations would &#8220;besiege you in all your towns&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-52.htm">Deuteronomy 28:52</a>) when Israel spurned God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As far as Gaza</b><p>- Gaza sat at the far southwest edge of Canaan, near the Mediterranean. By reaching that point, the raiders effectively swept the entire length of Israel&#8217;s arable valleys.<p>- The phrase underscores how thorough the incursion was&#8212;no tribe could claim distance as protection. Similar language appears when Philistines later overran the land &#8220;from Geba to Gezer&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>), showing coast-to-coast pressure.<p>- God had once promised these borders as a blessing (<a href="/joshua/15-47.htm">Joshua 15:47</a>); their occupation now signals that blessing withheld.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Destroying the produce of the land</b><p>- Instead of taking fields for themselves, the invaders ruined them: &#8220;destroying the produce of the land.&#8221; Crops that survived till harvest would feed next year; wiping them out guaranteed prolonged hunger.<p>- This matches the curse, &#8220;You will sow much seed&#8230; but harvest little, because locusts will consume it&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38</a>). In <a href="/bsb/judges/6.htm">Judges 6</a> the &#8220;locusts&#8221; are human, yet the devastation is identical (cf. <a href="/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a>).<p>- The act also robbed Israel of offerings for the tabernacle (<a href="/leviticus/2-14.htm">Leviticus 2:14</a>), compounding spiritual loss.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They left Israel with no sustenance</b><p>- Grain gone, vineyards trampled, and storage pits empty meant daily survival became Israel&#8217;s full-time job.<p>- Such deprivation forced them into mountain caves and strongholds (<a href="/judges/6-2.htm">Judges 6:2</a>), cities reversed into refugee camps.<p>- God designed the Promised Land as &#8220;a land of wheat and barley&#8230; in which you will lack nothing&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8-9</a>); the contrast is deliberate, driving the nation to cry out (<a href="/judges/6-6.htm">Judges 6:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Neither sheep nor oxen nor donkeys</b><p>- Livestock were Israel&#8217;s tractors, transportation, and bank accounts.

The scene echoes Amalek&#8217;s earlier tactic of targeting the weak (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-18</a>).<p>- Total loss magnifies the miracle when Gideon later defeats Midian &#8220;as one man&#8221; (<a href="/judges/6-16.htm">Judges 6:16</a>); only God could reverse so absolute a poverty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/judges/6-4.htm">Judges 6:4</a> paints an escalating picture: enemy forces settle in Israel, sweep the land to its farthest border, decimate every harvest, starve the people, and strip them of all livestock.
