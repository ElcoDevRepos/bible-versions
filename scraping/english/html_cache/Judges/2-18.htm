The term "judge" (Hebrew: "shofet") refers not only to a legal arbiter but also to a military leader or deliverer. The raising up of judges by the LORD underscores His sovereignty and mercy, as He intervenes in response to Israel's distress. This divine intervention is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament, highlighting God's faithfulness to His covenant people despite their repeated unfaithfulness.<p><b>He was with that judge</b><br>The presence of the LORD with the judge signifies divine empowerment and guidance. This echoes the promise of God's presence with leaders like Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>) and Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>). The success of the judges was not due to their own strength or wisdom but to the LORD's presence, which ensured victory and deliverance. This concept foreshadows the New Testament promise of God's presence with believers through the Holy Spirit (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p><b>and saved them from the hands of their enemies</b><br>The deliverance from enemies is a central theme in Judges, reflecting the physical and spiritual salvation that God provides. This salvation is a precursor to the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ, who delivers from sin and death. The phrase "hands of their enemies" emphasizes the tangible threat and oppression faced by Israel, often due to their disobedience and idolatry.<p><b>while the judge was still alive</b><br>The temporary nature of the judges' leadership highlights the need for a permanent and perfect deliverer, pointing to the future kingship of David and ultimately to Jesus Christ, the eternal King. The death of each judge often led to a relapse into sin, illustrating the insufficiency of human leaders and the need for a lasting solution to sin.<p><b>for the LORD was moved to pity by their groaning</b><br>This phrase reveals God's compassionate nature and His responsiveness to the cries of His people. The "groaning" of the Israelites is reminiscent of their cries in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a>), showing a pattern of God responding to the suffering of His people. This compassion is a key attribute of God, who is described as "gracious and compassionate" throughout Scripture (<a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8</a>).<p><b>under those who oppressed them and afflicted them</b><br>The oppression and affliction faced by Israel were often consequences of their disobedience and idolatry. These hardships served as a means of discipline, intended to bring the people back to reliance on God. The cycle of oppression and deliverance in Judges serves as a reminder of the consequences of sin and the need for repentance and faithfulness to God. This pattern also points to the ultimate deliverance from spiritual oppression through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is actively involved in the lives of His people, showing compassion and delivering them through judges.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judges.htm">Judges</a></b><br>Leaders raised by God to deliver Israel from oppression.
