In biblical terms, love is often demonstrated through actions rather than mere words (1 <a href="/john/3-18.htm">John 3:18</a>). This phrase reflects the theme of genuine love versus deceit, a recurring issue in relationships throughout Scripture.<p><b>she asked,</b><br>Delilah's role as the questioner places her in a position of power in this interaction. Her questioning is strategic, aiming to uncover Samson's secret. This reflects the broader biblical theme of temptation and testing, reminiscent of Eve's dialogue with the serpent in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.<p><b>when your heart is not with me?</b><br>The heart in biblical terms often represents the center of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>). Delilah accuses Samson of withholding his true self, which is a significant charge given the covenantal nature of relationships in the Bible, where the heart's allegiance is paramount (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>).<p><b>This is the third time you have mocked me</b><br>The number three in Scripture often signifies completeness or emphasis (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:12</a>). Delilah's mention of the third time underscores the seriousness of Samson's repeated deception. This pattern of three can also be seen in Peter's denial of Christ (<a href="/matthew/26-34.htm">Matthew 26:34</a>).<p><b>and failed to reveal to me the source of your great strength!</b><br>Samson's strength is a divine gift, linked to his Nazirite vow (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>). Delilah's insistence on uncovering this secret reflects the spiritual battle between God's purposes and human manipulation. The theme of strength and weakness is echoed in Paul's writings, where God's power is made perfect in weakness (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God tied to his Nazirite vow.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/delilah.htm">Delilah</a></b><br>A Philistine woman whom Samson loved.
