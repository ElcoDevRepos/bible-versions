In the context of <a href="/judges/8.htm">Judges 8</a>, it follows Gideon's pursuit and defeat of the Midianite kings Zebah and Zalmunna. This marks a transition from the battle to the aftermath, highlighting Gideon's leadership and the completion of his military campaign.<p><b>Gideon son of Joash</b><br>Gideon, also known as Jerubbaal, is a central figure in the Book of Judges. He is called by God to deliver Israel from the oppression of the Midianites. His lineage as the son of Joash places him within the tribe of Manasseh, one of the lesser tribes, emphasizing God's use of unlikely individuals for His purposes. Gideon's story is a testament to faith and obedience, despite initial hesitations and doubts.<p><b>returned from the battle</b><br>This indicates the conclusion of a military engagement. Gideon's return signifies victory and the fulfillment of God's promise to deliver Israel from its enemies. The battle against the Midianites was not just a physical confrontation but also a spiritual one, demonstrating God's power and faithfulness to His covenant people.<p><b>along the Ascent of Heres</b><br>The Ascent of Heres is a geographical location, though its exact identification remains uncertain. It suggests a route or path taken by Gideon during his return. The term "Heres" can mean "sun" or "sunrise," possibly indicating a direction or a place associated with light. This ascent may symbolize the rising of Israel's fortunes under Gideon's leadership, as well as the light of God's deliverance shining upon His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

The phrase grounds the verse in the immediate aftermath of Gideon&#8217;s pursuit of the Midianite kings (<a href="/judges/8-10.htm">Judges 8:10&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; It signals a clear sequence: God first grants the miraculous victory with three hundred men (<a href="/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19&#8211;22</a>), Gideon then completes the chase, and only &#8220;after this&#8221; does he pause.<p>&#8226; The timing underscores divine faithfulness&#8212;God&#8217;s promise of deliverance (<a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>) is fulfilled before Gideon turns back, echoing other &#8220;afterward&#8221; moments where the Lord&#8217;s work precedes rest (<a href="/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43&#8211;45</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Gideon son of Joash</b><p>&#8226;

Mentioning his father Joash ties the victory to a family once steeped in Baal worship (<a href="/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25&#8211;32</a>), highlighting how wholehearted obedience can reverse spiritual compromise.<p>&#8226; The verse thus testifies to God&#8217;s ability to raise deliverers from unlikely places, just as He later does with David, the shepherd boy (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>returned from the battle</b><p>&#8226; Gideon does not retreat; he returns because the conflict is decisively won&#8212;an echo of Israelite warriors who came home only when God&#8217;s assignment was complete (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-27.htm">2 Chronicles 20:27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>).<p>&#8226; His return sets the stage for accountability with fellow Israelites, first rewarding faithful allies (<a href="/judges/8-16.htm">Judges 8:16&#8211;17</a>) and then refusing kingship (<a href="/judges/8-23.htm">Judges 8:23</a>), illustrating that victory must be followed by godly stewardship.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the movement from battle to return previews the pattern of Christ, who after triumphing at the cross &#8220;sat down at the right hand of God&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along the Ascent of Heres</b><p>&#8226;

The verse marks closure to combat and transition to accountability, reminding us that every God-given triumph should propel us higher in obedience, humility, and stewardship of His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Before the sun was up.</span>--If the rendering were certain, it would prove that he had made a night attack on Karkor; but it seems more probable that the words should be rendered "from the ascent of Heres," or "of Hechares," as in the LXX., Peshito, and Arabic. If so, it implies that he came round by some other road to attack Succoth. The word for "going up" is <span class= "ital">maaleh, </span>as in <span class= "ital">Maaleh Ahrabbim, </span>"the ascent of scorpions" (see Note on <a href="/judges/1-36.htm" title="And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.">Judges 1:36</a>), which is also applied to sunrise. (<a href="/genesis/19-15.htm" title="And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take your wife, and your two daughters, which are here; lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.">Genesis 19:15</a>.) It cannot possibly mean "before <span class= "ital">sunset</span>" (<span class= "ital">ehe die Sonne heraufgekommen war</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>as Luther renders it, following the Chaldee and various Rabbis. The ordinary word for "sun" is <span class= "ital">shemesh, </span>not <span class= "ital">cheres; </span>but the latter word occurs in various names (see on <a href="/judges/1-35.htm" title="But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.">Judges 1:35</a>; <a href="/judges/2-9.htm" title="And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.">Judges 2:9</a>), which makes it perhaps more probable that this also is the name of some place. It might, indeed, be prudent for Gideon to desist from further pursuit when the dawn revealed the paucity and exhaustion of his followers; and in poetic style (<a href="/job/9-7.htm" title="Which commands the sun, and it rises not; and seals up the stars.">Job 9:7</a>) <span class= "ital">cheres </span>may mean "sun," so that here the phrase <span class= "ital">might </span>be an archaism, as <span class= "ital">cheresah </span>is in <a href="/judges/14-18.htm" title="And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion? and he said to them, If you had not plowed with my heifer, you had not found out my riddle.">Judges 14:18</a>; but the preposition used <span class= "ital">(min</span>) cannot mean "before." Aquila renders it "from the ascent <span class= "ital">of the groves" </span>and Symmachus "of the <span class= "ital">mountains;" </span>but this is only due to a defective reading. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Before the sun was up</span>. There is a wonderful diversity in the renderings of this verse. Some of the old versions and Jewish Rabbis interpret it <span class="accented">before sunset.</span> Many of the best Jewish commentators, however, understand the phrase as the A.V. does - "Before the going up of the sun," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> before sunrise; supposing Gideon's attack on the Midianitish camp to have been a night attack, and Succoth to have been so near to Karkor that he was able to reach it by sunrise. But others say that the word here rendered <span class="accented">sun</span> (<span class="accented">heres</span>) is only used in poetry, and that the word rendered up is never used of sunrise, but, as, in the phrase "the going up of Akrabbim" (<a href="/judges/1-36.htm">Judges 1:36</a>), of an ascent up a hill. They therefore take <span class="accented">heres</span> as a proper name, and translate "from the going up of Hems." Others again, by an almost imperceptible change in the last letter, read "the mountains" instead of <span class="accented">Heres.</span> But the A.V. may be well defended, and gives an excellent sense. In <a href="/judges/14-18.htm">Judges 14:18</a> the same word for the sun is used in the very similar phrase, "before the sun went down." In <a href="/genesis/19-15.htm">Genesis 19:15</a> the phrase, "the morning arose," has the verb from which the word here rendered <span class="accented">up</span> is derived; and a note of time here exactly suits the context. It marks the celerity of Gideon's move. ments that he was actually on his way back to Succoth at sunrise, after having routed the Midianites and taken their two kings prisoners. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/8-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After this, Gideon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1506;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(gi&#7695;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1439.htm">Strong's 1439: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gideon -- a judge of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Joash</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1430;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3101.htm">Strong's 3101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joash</span><br /><br /><span class="word">returned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1435;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(min-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4480.htm">Strong's 4480: </a> </span><span class="str2">A part of, from, out of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the battle</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mil&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4421.htm">Strong's 4421: </a> </span><span class="str2">A battle, war</span><br /><br /><span class="word">along the Ascent of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1469;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(mil&#183;ma&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m, Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4608.htm">Strong's 4608: </a> </span><span class="str2">An elevation, acclivity, platform, a rise, priority</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Heres.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1469;&#1512;&#1462;&#1505;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;res)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2775.htm">Strong's 2775: </a> </span><span class="str2">The itch, the sun</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/judges/8-13.htm">Judges 8:13 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/judges/8-13.htm">Judges 8:13 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/judges/8-13.htm">Judges 8:13 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/judges/8-13.htm">Judges 8:13 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/judges/8-13.htm">Judges 8:13 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/judges/8-13.htm">Judges 8:13  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/judges/8-13.htm">Judges 8:13 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/judges/8-13.htm">Judges 8:13 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/judges/8-13.htm">Judges 8:13 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/judges/8-13.htm">Judges 8:13 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/judges/8-13.htm">OT History: Judges 8:13 Gideon the son of Joash returned (Jd Judg.
