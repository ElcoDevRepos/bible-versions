Timnah was a town located in the territory of the tribe of Dan, near the border of Philistine lands. This journey symbolizes Samson's initial steps towards engaging with the Philistines, who were oppressors of Israel at the time. The act of "going down" can also be seen as a metaphor for Samson's spiritual descent, as he begins to stray from his Nazirite vow and divine calling.<p><b>with his father and mother</b><br>Samson's parents accompany him, highlighting the familial involvement and concern in his decisions. His parents, who were previously visited by the Angel of the Lord, were aware of Samson's divine purpose. Their presence underscores the tension between parental guidance and Samson's personal desires. This also reflects the cultural norm of arranged marriages and parental involvement in marital decisions during that period.<p><b>and came to the vineyards of Timnah</b><br>The mention of vineyards is significant, as Samson, being a Nazirite, was to abstain from wine and anything related to the vine (<a href="/numbers/6-3.htm">Numbers 6:3-4</a>). His presence in a vineyard suggests a proximity to temptation and a potential compromise of his Nazirite vow. This setting foreshadows Samson's struggles with self-control and his tendency to place himself in situations that test his commitments.<p><b>Suddenly a young lion came roaring at him</b><br>The sudden appearance of the lion represents an unexpected challenge and a test of Samson's strength and divine empowerment. In biblical symbolism, lions often represent danger, power, and sometimes the adversary (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>). This encounter prefigures Samson's role as a deliverer of Israel, empowered by God to overcome formidable foes. The lion can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is referred to as the "Lion of the tribe of Judah" (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>), symbolizing strength and victory over evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his extraordinary strength, which was a gift from God.

The wording highlights a moral descent as well&#8212;moving toward a marriage outside Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Timnah lay within Judah&#8217;s borders (<a href="/joshua/15-10.htm">Joshua 15:10</a>) yet was under Philistine influence; Samson&#8217;s trip foreshadows the tension between his divine calling (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>) and his personal choices.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty over Samson&#8217;s steps is clear, for &#8220;his father and mother did not know it was from the LORD, who was seeking an occasion against the Philistines&#8221; (<a href="/judges/14-4.htm">Judges 14:4</a>). Even when Samson&#8217;s motives blur, the Lord directs the outcome (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With his father and mother</b><p>&#8226; The verse repeats the parents&#8217; presence, underscoring a principle of family accountability (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>; <a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Their accompaniment shows obedience to cultural custom&#8212;parents arranged marriages (<a href="/genesis/24-3.htm">Genesis 24:3&#8211;4</a>). Yet they silently follow Samson&#8217;s wish, illustrating how even godly families can feel powerless when a child pushes past counsel.<p>&#8226; Moments later the parents will be separated from Samson (<a href="/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>), contrasting earthly guardianship with the ultimate protection God alone provides (<a href="/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Came to the vineyards of Timnah</b><p>&#8226; A Nazarite like Samson was to &#8220;abstain from wine, vinegar, even grapes or raisins&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/6-3.htm">Numbers 6:3</a>).

Humanly speaking, Samson has no weapon and no chance.<p>&#8226; The roar invites fear, but the coming victory (v.6) will showcase that &#8220;the battle belongs to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>). God orchestrates this encounter to reveal the Spirit&#8217;s power working through Samson and to foreshadow further deliverance from Philistine oppression.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>This single verse moves from a deliberate journey into enemy territory to a life-threatening ambush, weaving together Samson&#8217;s flawed choices and God&#8217;s flawless plan. Timnah&#8217;s vineyards hint at compromise, while the roaring lion uncovers spiritual hostility.
