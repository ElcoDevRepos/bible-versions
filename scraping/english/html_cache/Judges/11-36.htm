In the ancient Near Eastern context, family hierarchy was significant, and addressing one's father with respect was customary. This reflects the patriarchal society of the time, where the father's authority was paramount.<p><b>&#8220;you have given your word to the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>Jephthah's vow to the LORD is central to this narrative. In biblical times, vows were considered binding and sacred, especially those made to God. This reflects the seriousness with which oaths were taken, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>, which underscores the importance of fulfilling vows made to the LORD.<p><b>&#8220;Do to me as you have said,&#8221;</b><br>This statement shows the daughter's submission and acceptance of her father's vow, illustrating the cultural expectation of obedience to parental authority. It also reflects the gravity of vows and the belief that breaking them would bring dishonor and potential divine retribution.<p><b>&#8220;for the LORD has avenged you of your enemies, the Ammonites.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase acknowledges God's role in delivering victory over the Ammonites, a recurring theme in the Book of Judges where God raises leaders to deliver Israel from oppression. The Ammonites were a frequent adversary of Israel, and their defeat is seen as a divine act of justice and fulfillment of God's promises to protect His people.

He that swears to his own hurt, and changes not.">Psalm 15:4</a>), and in the beautiful devotion of his daughter, cheerfully acquiescing in her own sacrifice for the good of her country. Compare the examples of Iphigenia; of Macaria (Pausan. i. 32); of Au-churus, the son of Midas; of Curtius; of the Decii; of Marius offering his daughter for victory over the Cimbri; and of the Romans during more than one national panic.

The touching submission of Jephthah's daughter to her unnatural and terrible fate, while it reveals a most lovable character, seems also to show that the idea of a human sacrifice was not so strange to her mind as it is to ours. The sacrifice of his eldest son as a burnt offering by the king of Moab, some 300 years later, as related <a href="/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>; the intended sacrifices of Iphigenia and of Phrixus in Greek mythology; the sacrifices of children to Moloch, so often spoken of in Scripture; the question in <a href="/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>, "Shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?" the Phoenician custom mentioned by Sanchoniatho (quoted by Porphyry), of sacrificing to Saturn one of those most dear to them in times of war, pestilence, or drought; the yearly sacrifice at Carthage of a boy chosen by lot ('Sil. Italicus,' 4, 765), and many other examples, prove the prevalence of human sacrifices in early times, and in heathen lands.
