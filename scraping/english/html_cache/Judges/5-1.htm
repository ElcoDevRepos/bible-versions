In the context of Judges, it follows the victory over the Canaanite king Jabin and his commander Sisera. The phrase emphasizes the immediacy of the response to God's deliverance, highlighting the importance of timely praise and thanksgiving.<p><b>Deborah and Barak</b><br>Deborah was a prophetess and judge of Israel, a rare female leader in a patriarchal society, demonstrating God's use of unexpected individuals to fulfill His purposes. Barak, the military leader, worked alongside Deborah, showing a partnership in leadership. Their collaboration underscores the theme of unity in achieving God's plans. Deborah's role as a judge and prophetess is significant, as it reflects God's empowerment of women in leadership roles, even in ancient times.<p><b>son of Abinoam</b><br>Barak is identified as the son of Abinoam, which provides a genealogical context, grounding him in the history of Israel. This detail connects Barak to his tribal heritage, likely from the tribe of Naphtali, emphasizing the importance of lineage and identity in Israelite society.<p><b>sang this song</b><br>The act of singing a song of victory is a common biblical motif, seen in other instances such as the Song of Moses (Exodus 15) and the Song of Hannah (1 Samuel 2). Songs in the Bible often serve as a means of commemorating God's deliverance and acts of salvation. This particular song, known as the Song of Deborah, is one of the oldest examples of Hebrew poetry and serves as a historical record of the event, as well as a theological reflection on God's intervention. The use of song also highlights the cultural importance of oral tradition in preserving history and theology.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/deborah.htm">Deborah</a></b><br>A prophetess and judge of Israel, Deborah was a leader who inspired the Israelites to victory over their oppressors.

Triumph and thanksgiving rose together&#8212;echoing <a href="/psalms/118-24.htm">Psalm 118:24</a>, &#8220;This is the day that the LORD has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Application: celebrating God&#8217;s works while they&#8217;re fresh in memory cements faith and testimony for future generations (<a href="/joshua/4-6.htm">Joshua 4:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Deborah and Barak</b><p>&#8226; Two leaders&#8212;one a prophet-judge (<a href="/judges/4-4.htm">Judges 4:4-5</a>), the other a military commander (<a href="/judges/4-14.htm">Judges 4:14-16</a>)&#8212;blend voices.
