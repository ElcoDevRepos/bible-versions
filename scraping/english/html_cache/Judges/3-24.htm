This act was part of God's deliverance of Israel from Moabite oppression. Ehud's departure signifies the completion of his mission and the beginning of Israel's liberation. The narrative highlights God's use of unexpected means and people to achieve His purposes, as seen throughout the book of Judges.<p><b>Eglon&#8217;s servants came in</b><br>The servants of King Eglon, who were likely accustomed to attending to his needs, entered the scene. Their presence underscores the normalcy of court life and the routine duties of servants in ancient Near Eastern palaces. This moment sets the stage for the discovery of Eglon's death, which would have been shocking and disruptive to the Moabite court.<p><b>and found the doors of the upper room locked</b><br>The locked doors indicate Ehud's careful planning and execution of his plan to escape undetected. The upper room, often used for private meetings or rest, suggests a place of vulnerability for Eglon. The locked doors also symbolize the temporary concealment of the king's death, allowing Ehud time to escape and rally Israel.<p><b>&#8220;He must be relieving himself in the cool room,&#8221; they said</b><br>The servants' assumption reflects cultural norms regarding privacy and modesty. The "cool room" likely refers to a private chamber designed for comfort, possibly with ventilation to provide relief from the heat. This assumption delayed their discovery of Eglon's death, illustrating how God orchestrated events to ensure Ehud's successful escape. The delay also emphasizes the irony and humiliation of Eglon's demise, contrasting the king's perceived dignity with the reality of his situation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /

Mean</div><b>After Ehud was gone</b><p>- The verse picks up immediately after Ehud&#8212;Israel&#8217;s divinely appointed deliverer&#8212;has exited King Eglon&#8217;s private chamber.<p>- His departure signals completion of the mission God gave him (<a href="/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15&#8211;23</a>). Compare Gideon&#8217;s stealthy withdrawal in <a href="/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19&#8211;21</a>.<p>- God&#8217;s providence is evident: Ehud leaves undetected, fulfilling <a href="/psalms/121-7.htm">Psalm 121:7</a>, &#8220;The LORD will guard you from all evil.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eglon&#8217;s servants came in</b><p>- The royal attendants return to their normal duties, unaware that their king is already dead.<p>- Their delayed arrival fulfills the timing God ordained, echoing <a href="/1_samuel/14-27.htm">1 Samuel 14:27&#8211;30</a>, where human hesitation advances divine purposes.<p>- The narrative shows how God can use even routine staff movements to accomplish deliverance (<a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30&#8211;31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And found the doors of the upper room locked</b><p>- Locked doors would usually indicate the king&#8217;s desire for privacy; Ehud had cleverly secured them (<a href="/judges/3-23.htm">Judges 3:23</a>).<p>- The servants&#8217; inability to enter provides Ehud crucial time to escape and rally Israel (<a href="/judges/3-26.htm">Judges 3:26&#8211;27</a>).<p>- Similar divine timing appears in <a href="/acts/12-6.htm">Acts 12:6&#8211;10</a>, where a miraculously opened gate enables Peter&#8217;s escape.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;He must be relieving himself in the cool room,&#8221; they said</b><p>- Ancient palaces often had a summer upper chamber designed for ventilation (<a href="/2_samuel/4-5.htm">2 Samuel 4:5</a>).<p>- Assuming a private bodily function, the servants delay further, respecting royal dignity (<a href="/1_samuel/24-3.htm">1 Samuel 24:3</a>).<p>- God uses their natural assumption to mask Ehud&#8217;s deed, illustrating <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>: &#8220;A man&#8217;s heart plans his way, but the LORD directs his steps.&#8221;<p>- The irony underscores divine judgment: the proud king dies while his own staff imagines an ordinary moment, much like Haman&#8217;s downfall in <a href="/esther/7-7.htm">Esther 7:7&#8211;10</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/3-24.htm">Judges 3:24</a> captures a divinely orchestrated pause. Ehud&#8217;s safe exit, the servants&#8217; respectful delay, and the locked doors all converge to give Israel&#8217;s deliverer time to flee and mobilize the nation. The verse reminds us that God&#8217;s sovereignty extends to ordinary details&#8212;closed doors, human assumptions, and timing&#8212;turning them into instruments for His people&#8217;s salvation and for judgment on the oppressor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Behold, the doors of the parlour were locked.</span>--It never occurred to them to suppose that they could have been fastened from without.
