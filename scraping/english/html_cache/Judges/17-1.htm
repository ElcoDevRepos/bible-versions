This name is significant in the context of the narrative, as it contrasts with Micah's actions, which demonstrate a departure from true worship of Yahweh.

Ephraim was one of the prominent tribes of Israel, descended from Joseph's son Ephraim. This area was significant in Israel's history, serving as a backdrop for various biblical events. The tribe of Ephraim often played a leading role in the affairs of the nation, and its central location made it a crossroads for cultural and religious influences.

Both, no doubt, are long prior to Samson.
