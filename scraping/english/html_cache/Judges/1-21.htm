Their failure to drive out the Jebusites, a Canaanite people, highlights a recurring theme in the Book of Judges: Israel's incomplete obedience to God's command to fully possess the land. This disobedience led to ongoing struggles and conflicts with the remaining inhabitants. Jerusalem, at this time, was a significant city located on the border between the territories of Benjamin and Judah. The Jebusites' continued presence in Jerusalem is significant because it later became the capital city under King David, who successfully conquered it (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-9</a>). This failure also foreshadows the spiritual and political challenges Israel would face due to incomplete obedience.<p><b>So to this day the Jebusites live there among the Benjamites.</b><br>The phrase "to this day" suggests that the text was written at a time when the Jebusites were still present in Jerusalem, indicating a long-standing coexistence. This coexistence may have led to cultural and religious influences that were contrary to Israelite worship and practices, contributing to the cycle of sin and repentance seen throughout Judges. The presence of the Jebusites among the Benjamites serves as a reminder of the consequences of not fully following God's commands. It also sets the stage for future events, such as King David's conquest of Jerusalem, which would establish it as the political and spiritual center of Israel. The persistence of the Jebusites in the land can be seen as a type of the spiritual battles believers face, where incomplete victory can lead to ongoing struggles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamites.htm">Benjamites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel, descended from Benjamin, the youngest son of Jacob.
