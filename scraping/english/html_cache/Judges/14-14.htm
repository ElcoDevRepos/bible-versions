This setting is significant as it highlights the tension between the Israelites and the Philistines, who were oppressors of Israel during this period. Samson's role as a judge is unique, as he often acts independently rather than leading Israel in battle.<p><b>Out of the eater came something to eat,</b><br>This phrase refers to the lion that Samson killed earlier in the chapter. The lion, a symbol of strength and ferocity, is the "eater." The honey found in the carcass represents something unexpected and nourishing coming from a source of danger. This riddle is a metaphor for God's ability to bring good out of evil situations, a theme seen throughout the Bible, such as in Joseph's story (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p><b>and out of the strong came something sweet.</b><br>The "strong" again refers to the lion, and the "sweet" is the honey. This imagery can be seen as a type of Christ, who is both the Lion of Judah (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>) and the source of spiritual sweetness and sustenance. The paradox of strength producing sweetness can also be seen in the life of Christ, who through His suffering and death brought salvation and grace.<p><b>For three days they were unable to explain the riddle.</b><br>The three days the Philistines struggled with the riddle can be seen as symbolic, as the number three often represents completeness or divine intervention in the Bible. This period of confusion foreshadows the resurrection of Christ, who rose on the third day, bringing clarity and victory over sin and death. The inability of the Philistines to solve the riddle without external help highlights human limitations and the need for divine revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, given by God.

Here it sets up a dramatic moment when frustration drives the men to threaten Samson&#8217;s bride (<a href="/judges/14-15.htm">Judges 14:15</a>), revealing the darkness of Philistine culture.<p>&#8226; Their blindness contrasts with Samson&#8217;s inside knowledge, reminding us that spiritual insight depends on relationship with the Lord (<a href="/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/14-14.htm">Judges 14:14</a> illustrates God&#8217;s surprising ability to bring good out of peril.

Josephus gives the riddle in the form,"the all-devouring having generated sweet food from itself, though itself far from sweet" (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 8, ? 6). The whole of Samson's life has been described by Ewald as "a charming poetic picture, in which the interspersed verses gleam forth like the brightest pearls in a circlet." It must be confessed that the riddle was hardly a fair one, for the event to which it alluded was most unusual, and no one could have guessed such a riddle without some clue; for--<p>" 'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb<p>In the dead carrion."<p>Shakespeare: <span class= "ital">Henry V., </span>ii. 4.<p>Cassel quotes a curious parallel from the legends of North Germany. The judges offer a woman her husband's life if she can make a riddle which they cannot guess. On her way to the court she had found the carcase of a horse in which a bird had built its nest and hatched six young ones, which she took away. Her riddle was (I venture rudely to translate the rude old lines):--<p>"As hitherwards on my way I sped,<p>I took the living out of the dead,<p>Six were thus of the seventh made quit:--<p>To rede my riddle, my lords, 'tis fit."<p>The judges failed, and the husband was spared (Mullen-hof, <span class= "ital">Sagen, </span>p. 506).<p><span class= "bld">In three days.</span>--It is hard to see why this is mentioned if it was only on the <span class= "ital">seventh </span>day (<a href="/judges/14-15.htm" title="And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife, Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire: have you called us to take that we have? is it not so?">Judges 14:15</a>) that they tried the unfair means of inducing Samson's wife to reveal the secret. Bishop Hervey conjectures, with much probability, that we should read <span class= "ital">shesheth </span>"six," for <span class= "ital">shelsheth, </span>"four."
