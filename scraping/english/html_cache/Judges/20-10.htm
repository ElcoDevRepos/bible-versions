The selection of men from each tribe underscores the communal nature of the response to the crime committed in Gibeah. This method of conscription ensures that the burden of military service is shared equally among the tribes, promoting fairness and solidarity. The number ten is often symbolic in the Bible, representing completeness or a whole unit, which may suggest the thoroughness of the Israelites' commitment to justice.<p><b>and a hundred out of every thousand</b><br>The escalation in numbers from ten to a hundred signifies the seriousness of the situation and the need for a substantial force. This scaling up reflects the gravity of the offense and the collective determination to address it. The use of a decimal system for organizing troops is efficient and practical, ensuring that a significant portion of the population is mobilized without overwhelming any single tribe. This method of organization may also reflect ancient military practices where proportional representation was crucial for maintaining balance and unity among diverse groups.<p><b>and a thousand out of every ten thousand</b><br>This further increase in numbers highlights the magnitude of the response required to address the atrocity. The phrase suggests a large-scale mobilization, indicating that the crime in Gibeah was not only a local issue but a national crisis that demanded a unified and decisive action. The structure of the numbers also reflects a well-planned military strategy, ensuring that the force is both large enough to be effective and proportionally representative of the entire nation of Israel.<p><b>to supply provisions for the army</b><br>The mention of provisions underscores the logistical considerations necessary for sustaining a military campaign. It reflects the practical aspects of warfare in ancient times, where ensuring a steady supply of food and resources was crucial for maintaining an army's effectiveness. This detail also highlights the communal effort required, as the entire nation must contribute to support the troops. The provision of supplies is a reminder of the interconnectedness of the tribes and their shared responsibility in upholding justice.<p><b>when they go to Gibeah in Benjamin</b><br>Gibeah, located in the territory of Benjamin, is the focal point of the conflict. The city is significant in biblical history, later becoming the royal residence of King Saul. The mention of Gibeah ties the narrative to the broader theme of moral and social decay within Israel, as the crime committed there is a reflection of the nation's spiritual state. The tribe of Benjamin's involvement adds a layer of complexity, as it pits one tribe against the collective will of the others, foreshadowing internal strife and division.<p><b>to punish them for the atrocity they have committed in Israel</b><br>The term "atrocity" indicates a heinous crime that has shocked the conscience of the nation. This phrase emphasizes the need for justice and the moral imperative to address sin within the community. The collective action to punish the perpetrators reflects the biblical principle of communal responsibility for sin and the necessity of purging evil from among the people. This narrative echoes other biblical instances where God calls His people to act against wickedness, reinforcing the theme of divine justice and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel, who are gathering to address the grievous sin committed in Gibeah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a></b><br>A city in the territory of Benjamin where a heinous crime was committed, leading to the conflict.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamites.htm">Benjamites</a></b><br>The tribe of Benjamin, who are defending the perpetrators of the crime in Gibeah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/levite.htm">Levite</a></b><br>A man whose concubine was abused and murdered in Gibeah, sparking the outrage among the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/assembly_at_mizpah.htm">Assembly at Mizpah</a></b><br>The gathering of the Israelite tribes to decide on a course of action against Gibeah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_justice.htm">The Importance of Justice</a></b><br>The Israelites' decision to address the sin in Gibeah underscores the necessity of upholding justice within the community of believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/communal_responsibility.htm">Communal Responsibility</a></b><br>The passage highlights the collective responsibility of God's people to confront and rectify sin, ensuring the community remains holy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>The events in <a href="/bsb/judges/20.htm">Judges 20</a> remind us that sin has far-reaching consequences, affecting not just individuals but entire communities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_god's_guidance.htm">Seeking God's Guidance</a></b><br>Before taking action, believers should seek God's wisdom and guidance to ensure their actions align with His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_righteousness.htm">Unity in Righteousness</a></b><br>The unity of the Israelite tribes in addressing the sin in Gibeah serves as a model for believers to unite in pursuing righteousness and justice.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Judges_20_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Judges 20:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Judges_20_10_Justice_in_community.htm">How does Judges 20:10 demonstrate the importance of justice within a community?
