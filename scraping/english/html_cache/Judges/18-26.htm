However, due to pressure from the Amorites and Philistines, they sought a new inheritance in the north. This movement reflects the broader theme of Israel's struggle to fully possess the Promised Land. The Danites' journey northward is a significant moment in their history, marking a shift in their tribal identity and location. This relocation is also a precursor to the establishment of the city of Dan, which later becomes a center of idolatry in Israel (<a href="/1_kings/12-29.htm">1 Kings 12:29-30</a>).<p><b>and Micah turned to go back home</b><br>Micah, a resident of the hill country of Ephraim, had created a shrine with an idol and hired a Levite to serve as his priest. His encounter with the Danites resulted in the loss of his idol and priest, highlighting the spiritual confusion and syncretism prevalent in Israel during the time of the Judges. Micah's return home symbolizes the futility of his idolatrous practices and the transient nature of his personal religion. This incident underscores the theme of spiritual apostasy and the need for true worship of Yahweh.<p><b>because he saw that they were too strong for him</b><br>Micah's realization of the Danites' strength reflects the lawlessness and might-makes-right mentality of the period, as described in <a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>: "In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes." The Danites' ability to overpower Micah without consequence illustrates the lack of centralized authority and the moral chaos of the era. This phrase also serves as a reminder of the consequences of relying on human strength and idolatry rather than trusting in the Lord. The narrative foreshadows the eventual downfall of Israel due to its repeated failure to adhere to God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_danites.htm">The Danites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel seeking a new territory to settle.

here that quest for land continues unhindered, fulfilling <a href="/genesis/49-16.htm">Genesis 49:16&#8211;17</a> and foreshadowing <a href="/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>.<p>&#8226; The scene exposes the unchecked momentum of a culture doing &#8220;what was right in his own eyes&#8221; (<a href="/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Although the Danites carry stolen idols, the narrative never credits those idols with power; instead, God allows this movement as part of Israel&#8217;s larger story of discipline (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Micah turned to go back home</b><p>&#8226;

Trust placed in anything but the living God proves hollow.<p>&#8211; Home without the Lord&#8217;s presence offers no real security (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Micah&#8217;s retreat underscores the failure of self-styled religion and the emptiness of reclaiming &#8220;normal&#8221; life once idols are exposed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because he saw that they were too strong for him</b><p>&#8226; Sheer force settles the dispute; Micah gauges the odds and bows to superior might (<a href="/proverbs/24-10.htm">Proverbs 24:10</a>).<p>&#8226;

Yet God&#8217;s providence still overarches human strength; elsewhere He reminds Israel, &#8220;The battle is not yours, but God&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>). Micah has no such promise because he has replaced the Lord with idols.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/18-26.htm">Judges 18:26</a> pictures two contrasting realities: the unstoppable march of a tribe acting in self-interest and the helpless collapse of a man who trusted in what his own hands had crafted. The Danites continue unchecked, yet their success is not endorsement but another snapshot of the lawless era of the Judges. Micah&#8217;s retreat exposes the futility of idol-reliance&#8212;when opposition rises, powerless gods cannot save. The verse therefore warns that only the true and living God offers real strength; any substitute leaves us retreating in defeat when real power confronts us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - The verse tells us what the two parties did, but not in the Order in which an English writer would express it; for no doubt the Danites, encumbered with their women, and children, and baggage, did not <span class="accented">go on their way</span> till Micah and his party had turned back, though in English the contrary order is rather implied.
