Succoth was a significant location during the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land (<a href="/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17</a>). The men of Succoth had previously refused to assist Gideon and his men, showing a lack of faith and support for God's chosen leader. This reflects a broader theme of Israel's struggle with faithfulness and unity.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Here are Zebah and Zalmunna,</b><br>Zebah and Zalmunna were kings of Midian, enemies of Israel. Their capture by Gideon fulfills God's promise of deliverance from oppression (<a href="/judges/6-14.htm">Judges 6:14-16</a>). This victory demonstrates God's power and faithfulness, as well as Gideon's role as a deliverer, a type of Christ who defeats the enemies of God's people.<p><b>about whom you taunted me,</b><br>The men of Succoth had mocked Gideon, doubting his ability to defeat the Midianite kings. This taunting represents a lack of faith and trust in God's plan and His appointed leader. It highlights the recurring theme of Israel's spiritual weakness and the need for strong, God-fearing leadership.<p><b>saying, &#8216;Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your possession,</b><br>This phrase reflects skepticism and disbelief in Gideon's mission. The "hands" symbolize power and control, and the men of Succoth doubted Gideon's ability to achieve victory. This mirrors the broader biblical narrative of doubting God's promises, as seen in the Israelites' history of unbelief (<a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>).<p><b>that we should give bread to your weary men?&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The refusal to provide bread to Gideon's men shows a lack of hospitality and support, contrary to the cultural expectations of the time. In the ancient Near East, providing for travelers and warriors was a duty, especially for fellow Israelites. This refusal underscores the spiritual and moral decline in Israel, as well as the need for repentance and renewal.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.
