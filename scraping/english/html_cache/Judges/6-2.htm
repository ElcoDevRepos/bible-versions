Historically, they were nomadic tribes known for their raids and conflicts with Israel. The phrase "prevailed against Israel" indicates a period of oppression and dominance, which is a recurring theme in the Book of Judges. This oppression was a consequence of Israel's disobedience to God, as they turned to idolatry and forsook the covenant. The Midianites' dominance is a fulfillment of the cyclical pattern of sin, servitude, supplication, and salvation seen throughout Judges. This period of oppression lasted seven years, emphasizing the completeness of their suffering and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>Because of the Midianites, the Israelites prepared shelters for themselves in the mountains, caves, and strongholds.</b><br>The Israelites' response to Midianite oppression was to seek refuge in natural fortifications. The geographical landscape of Israel, with its numerous hills and caves, provided suitable hiding places. This behavior reflects a time of great fear and desperation, as the Israelites were forced to abandon their homes and live in seclusion to avoid the Midianite raids. The use of "shelters" and "strongholds" suggests a defensive strategy, highlighting the severity of the threat posed by the Midianites. This situation is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God's people sought refuge in caves, such as David hiding from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/22.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>) and Elijah fleeing from Jezebel (<a href="/1_kings/19-9.htm">1 Kings 19:9</a>). The need for such shelters underscores the Israelites' vulnerability and the dire circumstances they faced, setting the stage for God's deliverance through Gideon.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/midian.htm">Midian</a></b><br>A nomadic people who oppressed Israel during the time of the Judges.

Midian&#8217;s power was dominant, relentless, and humiliating, just as promised in covenant warnings (<a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>).<p>- God had previously allowed other nations to &#8220;prevail&#8221; when Israel rebelled&#8212;King Jabin&#8217;s Canaanite hand in <a href="/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a> and the Philistine hand in <a href="/judges/10-7.htm">Judges 10:7</a> serve as clear parallels.<p>- The oppression was meant to turn hearts back to the LORD (<a href="/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-42.htm">Psalm 106:42&#8211;43</a>). When His people cry out, He answers&#8212;even after long seasons of discipline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because of the Midianites</b><p>- The Midianites and their Amalekite allies swarmed &#8220;like locusts&#8221; (<a href="/judges/6-5.htm">Judges 6:5</a>), stripping fields bare and destroying livelihoods (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-33.htm">Deuteronomy 28:33</a>).<p>- Fear replaced the peace Israel once knew in the land flowing with milk and honey. Their daily reality mirrored earlier prophetic warnings: disobedience would bring enemies who would &#8220;consume your crops&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a>).<p>- Yet even this fear was a mercy: it pressed Israel toward repentance (<a href="/judges/6-6.htm">Judges 6:6&#8211;7</a>). God sometimes allows distress so that wayward hearts will seek Him again (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-4.htm">2 Chronicles 15:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Israelites prepared shelters for themselves in the mountains, caves, and strongholds</b><p>- Natural caves, mountain clefts, and improvised fortresses became refuge. Israel, meant to occupy cities it had not built (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10&#8211;11</a>), now hid in fear, much like the future generation under Saul who &#8220;hid in caves, thickets, and cisterns&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/13-6.htm">1 Samuel 13:6</a>).<p>- These makeshift shelters highlight the depth of national humiliation. God&#8217;s covenant people, called to live openly under His blessing (<a href="/psalms/44-1.htm">Psalm 44:1&#8211;3</a>), were reduced to life on the run, a reversal of the conquest recorded in Joshua.<p>- Yet even in hiding, faith could survive. <a href="/hebrews/11-38.htm">Hebrews 11:38</a> recalls believers who &#8220;wandered in deserts and mountains, living in caves and holes in the ground.&#8221; God&#8217;s redemptive plan often begins in unlikely, humble places&#8212;one of those caves may well have housed Gideon&#8217;s future army.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/6-2.htm">Judges 6:2</a> paints a vivid picture of covenant consequences. Midian&#8217;s dominating &#8220;hand&#8221; fulfilled God&#8217;s warnings, driving Israel into fear-filled hiding. Caves and mountain dens replaced settled homes, underscoring how sin robs God&#8217;s people of the very blessings He intends. Yet the verse also sets the stage for deliverance: when oppression brings repentance, the LORD is ready to raise up a deliverer and restore His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">The hand of Midian prevailed.</span>--See <a href="/judges/3-10.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD came on him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.">Judges 3:10</a>.

Three places of hiding are mentioned: (1) The <span class= "ital">mineharoth, </span>perhaps catacombs and galleries in the rocks, which, as the article shows, were pointed out long afterwards. (2) Craggy peaks, like Rimmon, Magada, &c. (3) "Limestone caves, here first mentioned, and afterwards often used, like the Corycian cave in Greece during the Persian invasion, and the caves of the Asturias in Spain during the occupation of the Moors. It was returning to the old troglodyte habits of the Horites and Phoenicians" (Stanley, i. 340). These caves were used, long afterwards, by the brigands whom Herod and the Romans found it so hard to extirpate.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The dens... and caves</span>.
