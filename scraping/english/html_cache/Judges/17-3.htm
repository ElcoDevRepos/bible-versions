The context is set in the period of the Judges, a time characterized by moral and spiritual decline in Israel. The return of the silver suggests a resolution of a previous wrongdoing, as the silver was initially stolen. The number eleven hundred is notable, as it is the same amount Delilah received from the Philistine lords to betray Samson (<a href="/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5</a>), indicating a recurring theme of betrayal and moral compromise.<p><b>she said, &#8220;I wholly dedicate the silver to the LORD for my son&#8217;s benefit</b><br>The mother's declaration of dedicating the silver to the LORD reflects a common practice of making vows or dedicating possessions to God, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/27.htm">Leviticus 27</a>. However, her intention to use the silver for idolatry contradicts the commandment against graven images (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>). This reflects the syncretism prevalent in Israel during the Judges era, where worship of Yahweh was often mixed with pagan practices.<p><b>to make a graven image and a molten idol</b><br>The creation of a graven image and a molten idol directly violates the second commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4-5</a>). This act underscores the spiritual confusion and apostasy in Israel at the time. The use of silver for idol-making is reminiscent of the golden calf incident (Exodus 32), where the Israelites also fell into idolatry shortly after receiving the law. This highlights the recurring struggle with idolatry throughout Israel's history.<p><b>Therefore I will now return it to you.&#8221;</b><br>The mother's decision to return the silver to her son for idol-making purposes reveals a misguided attempt to honor God, reflecting the moral ambiguity and lack of spiritual leadership during the time of the Judges. This act sets the stage for the establishment of a private shrine, which further deviates from the centralized worship prescribed in <a href="/deuteronomy/12.htm">Deuteronomy 12</a>.

The narrative shows the outward form of repentance, yet it happens in a climate where &#8220;every man did what was right in his own eyes&#8221; (<a href="/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>). What looks like a good start soon drifts off course.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I wholly dedicate the silver to the LORD</b><p>The mother&#8217;s vow sounds devout, reminiscent of Hannah&#8217;s pledge, &#8220;I give him to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/1-28.htm">1 Samuel 1:28</a>). Scripture welcomes genuine vows (<a href="/leviticus/27-2.htm">Leviticus 27:2</a>), and the language &#8220;wholly dedicate&#8221; affirms that everything belongs to God (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>). Yet devotion must match God&#8217;s revealed will; obedience is &#8220;better than sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). Here the verbal tribute masks a troubling plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For my son&#8217;s benefit</b><p>Her motive is to bless Micah. Parents rightly seek their children&#8217;s good (<a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>), and God delights to bless families (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-3.htm">Deuteronomy 6:3</a>). Still, spiritual welfare can never be secured through disobedience. Jesus warned, &#8220;What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul?&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>). Love that bypasses God&#8217;s commands ultimately harms the very people it aims to help.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To make a graven image and a molten idol</b><p>This purpose flatly contradicts &#8220;You shall not make for yourself a carved image&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>), reinforced in <a href="/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a> and highlighted by the golden-calf disaster (<a href="/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>). Mixing Yahweh&#8217;s name with an idol is spiritual syncretism&#8212;the heart of Israel&#8217;s recurring downfall (<a href="/2_kings/17-41.htm">2 Kings 17:41</a>). The mother&#8217;s plan shows how far the nation&#8217;s conscience had drifted: calling an idol &#8220;for the LORD&#8221; does not sanctify it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Therefore I will now return it to you</b><p>She hands the silver back so Micah can commission the idol, entrenching private religion in place of &#8220;the place the LORD will choose&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11-13</a>). This action sets the stage for Micah&#8217;s household shrine (<a href="/judges/17-5.htm">Judges 17:5</a>) and later the tribe of Dan&#8217;s adoption of the same idolatry (<a href="/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30-31</a>). Personal decisions ripple outward; sin rarely stays isolated.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/17-3.htm">Judges 17:3</a> reveals a veneer of piety covering blatant disobedience. A mother and son speak of dedicating treasure to the LORD but immediately channel it into forbidden images. The episode illustrates the spiritual confusion of the era: sincerity detached from Scripture breeds idolatry. True devotion requires wholehearted submission to God&#8217;s commands, not merely religious language or family affection cloaked in disobedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">I had wholly dedicated the silver.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Consecrating, I consecrated</span>--either, "I have <span class= "ital">now </span>consecrated it" as a thanksgiving for its restoration, or "I had done so before it was stolen."<p><span class= "bld">For my son</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>for your benefit.<p><span class= "bld">To make a graven image and a molten image.</span>--Whether in the universal decadence of religion, the people, untaught by a careless priesthood, had become ignorant of the second commandment, or whether she justified her conduct by the same considerations which have been used even in the Christian Church in favour of image-worship, we cannot tell. The word used for a graven image is <span class= "ital">pesel, </span>and for a molten image is <span class= "ital">massecah. </span>They are the very words used in the curse against idolaters in <a href="/deuteronomy/27-15.htm" title="Cursed be the man that makes any graven or molten image, an abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and puts it in a secret place. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen.">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>. Some suppose the two words to be used by Hendiadys (like "cups and gold" for "golden cups" ) to describe <span class= "ital">one silver image </span>adorned with sculptured ornament. All that is clear is that the <span class= "ital">pesel </span>is the more prominent, but the details are left quite vague. It is therefore impossible to determine whether the graven and molten image consisted of one or of two silver "calves," like that of the wilderness, and those afterwards set up by Jeroboam at Dan and Bethel. <span class= "ital">This, </span>however, was a form which the violation of the second commandment was constantly liable to take, and it probably involved much less blame than other violations of it--<span class= "ital">not, </span>as is often stated, because the Israelites had become familiar with the worship of Apis and Mnevis in Egypt, but because the calf was a recognised cherubic emblem, and had consequently been deliberately sanctioned in the symbolism of the Temple. (See <a href="/exodus/20-4.htm" title="You shall not make to you any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.">Exodus 20:4</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-23.htm" title="You shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall you make to you gods of gold.">Exodus 20:23</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/32-4.htm" title="And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a engraving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.">Exodus 32:4-5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7-25.htm" title="It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above on them, and all their hinder parts were inward.">1Kings 7:25</a>, &c.) Some suppose that the <span class= "ital">massecah </span>was the pedestal of the <span class= "ital">pesel, </span>and that it was too heavy for the Danites to carry away, since it is not mentioned among the things which they seized. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I had wholly dedicated</span>.

But the A.V. makes very good sense. Her former purpose had been that the money should be given for her son's benefit to make his house an house of gods. Now that he had confessed, she resumed her purpose. <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore I restore it unto thee</span> - that is, in the shape of the graven and molten images, as it follows in the next verse. The narrative gives a curious example of the semi-idolatry of the times. <span class="cmt_word">A graven image and a molten image</span>. There is a good deal of difficulty in assigning the exact meaning of the two words here used, and their relation to one another in the worship to which they belong. <span class="accented">The molten image</span> (<span class="accented">massechah</span>), however, seems to be pretty certainly the <span class="accented">metal</span>, here the <span class="accented">silver</span>, image of a calf, the form which the corrupt worship of Jehovah took from the time when Aaron made the molten calf (<a href="/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>, called there '<span class="accented">egel massechah</span>, a molten calf) to the time when Jeroboam set up the golden calves at Dan and Bethel (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28, 29</a>). And that <span class="accented">massechah</span> means something <span class="accented">molten is</span> certain both from its etymology (<span class="accented">nasach</span>, to pour) and from what Aaron said in <a href="/exodus/32-24.htm">Exodus 32:24</a>: "I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf." Here too Micah's mother gives the silver to the founder, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the fuser of metals. The <span class="accented">pesel</span>, or <span class="accented">graven image</span>, on the other hand, is something hewn or graven, whether in wood or stone, and sometimes overlaid with gold and silver (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>). One might have thought, from the language of ver. 4, and from the mention of the <span class="accented">pesel</span> alone in <a href="/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30, 31</a>, that only one image is here intended, which was graven with the chisel after it was cast, as Aaron's calf seems to have been. But in <a href="/judges/18-17.htm">Judges 18:17, 18</a> they are mentioned separately, with the ephod and teraphim named between them, so that they must be distinct. From the above passages the <span class="accented">pesel or graven image</span> would seem to have been the most important object, and the difficulty is to assign the true relation of the <span class="accented">massechah</span> or <span class="accented">molten image</span> to it. Hengstenberg thinks the <span class="accented">massechah</span> was a pedestal on which the <span class="accented">pesel</span> stood, and that the ephod was the robe with which the <span class="accented">pesel</span> was clothed, and that the teraphim were certain tokens or emblems attached to the ephod which gave oracular answers. But this is not much more than guess-work. Berthean considers the ephod, here as elsewhere, to be the priest's garment, put on when performing the most solemn services, and specially when seeking an answer from God. And he thinks that the <span class="accented">massechah</span> formed a part of the ornament of the ephod, because in <a href="/judges/18-18.htm">Judges 18:18</a> the Hebrew has "the <span class="accented">pesel</span> of the ephod." The teraphin he thinks are idols, a kind of <span class="accented">Dii minores</span> associated with the worship of Jehovah in this impure worship. But there does not seem to be any means at present of arriving at any certainty. The <span class="accented">massechah</span> might be a rich gold or silver overlaying of the wooden image, possibly movable, or it might be the separate image of a calf supposed to belong, as it were, to the <span class="accented">pesel</span>, and to symbolise the attributes of the Godhead. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/17-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And when he had</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1435;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#353;e&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
