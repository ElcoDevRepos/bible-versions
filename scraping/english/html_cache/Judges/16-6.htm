Her role in the narrative highlights the recurring theme of Israel's entanglement with foreign nations and their gods. Delilah's approach to Samson is direct, indicating her determination and the influence of the Philistine rulers who have promised her a reward for discovering the secret of Samson's strength.<p><b>&#8220;Please tell me the source of your great strength</b><br>Samson's strength is legendary, and it is a gift from God, linked to his Nazirite vow, which includes not cutting his hair. This request from Delilah is significant because it touches on the divine aspect of Samson's abilities. The Philistines are aware that his strength is not natural, and they seek to understand and undermine the divine favor that empowers him. This mirrors the spiritual battles believers face, where the enemy seeks to understand and exploit weaknesses.<p><b>and how you can be tied up and subdued.&#8221;</b><br>Delilah's inquiry is not just about understanding Samson's strength but also about finding a way to neutralize it. The language of being "tied up and subdued" foreshadows Samson's eventual capture and humiliation by the Philistines. This phrase also reflects the broader narrative of Israel's struggle with sin and oppression, as they often find themselves "tied up" by their disobedience and need deliverance. Samson's eventual downfall serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of compromising one's divine calling.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/delilah.htm">Delilah</a></b><br>A Philistine woman who is approached by the lords of the Philistines to discover the secret of Samson's strength.

She is not acting innocently; the Philistine rulers have already bribed her (<a href="/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5</a>), so every word is edged with betrayal.<p>- Like the Philistine woman at Timnah who pressed Samson for his riddle&#8217;s answer (<a href="/judges/14-15.htm">Judges 14:15</a>), Delilah uses intimacy to breach Samson&#8217;s defenses.<p>- Her speech echoes the seductive, destructive talk warned against in <a href="/proverbs/7-21.htm">Proverbs 7:21</a>&#8212;&#8220;With her persuasive words she led him astray&#8221;.<p>- This scene reminds us that the enemy often comes through seemingly friendly voices (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-14.htm">2 Corinthians 11:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Please tell me</b><p>- The phrase sounds tender, even affectionate, masking deadly intent.<p>- Such coaxing mirrors the serpent&#8217;s invitation in <a href="/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a> and illustrates <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>: desire gives birth to sin when enticed.<p>- Samson has already toyed with compromise (<a href="/judges/16-1.htm">Judges 16:1</a>), so Delilah&#8217;s plea lands on spiritually weakened soil.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The source of your great strength</b><p>- Delilah wants the secret, but Scripture is clear: &#8220;The Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon him&#8221; (<a href="/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>; 15:14). Samson&#8217;s strength is no natural talent; it is God&#8217;s gift, tied to his Nazirite consecration (<a href="/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>).<p>- His uncut hair is a visible seal of that vow, yet the hair itself is not magic; the covenant&#8212;and the God who ordained it&#8212;is the true source (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>).<p>- By entertaining Delilah&#8217;s question, Samson flirts with surrendering what makes him distinct for God&#8217;s purpose, echoing <a href="/hebrews/12-16.htm">Hebrews 12:16</a>&#8217;s warning against treating holy things casually.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And how you can be tied up and subdued</b><p>- Delilah does not disguise her goal: immobilize and master him. Her frank wording exposes the spirit behind the request&#8212;total domination by Israel&#8217;s enemies (<a href="/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5</a>).<p>- Scripture repeatedly shows that sin aims to bind: Israel in slavery (<a href="/exodus/1-13.htm">Exodus 1:13-14</a>), Samson earlier in Philistine ropes (<a href="/judges/15-13.htm">Judges 15:13</a>), and believers who must &#8220;stand firm and do not be encumbered again by a yoke of slavery&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>).<p>- The contrast is stark: God empowers for deliverance; the enemy schemes for bondage (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>). When Samson ultimately reveals his secret (<a href="/judges/16-17.htm">Judges 16:17</a>), he hands the enemy the very chains they crave.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Delilah&#8217;s seemingly gentle request is a calculated assault on the God-given strength that sets Samson apart. Beneath polite words lies a plot to overthrow God&#8217;s deliverer and keep Israel in oppression. The verse warns that alluring voices can carry lethal agendas, that covenant gifts must be guarded, and that sin&#8217;s true aim is always to bind and subdue.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And wherewith thou mightest be bound.</span>--The narrative, if taken as a full account of all that took place, would leave in the mind an impression of almost incredible fatuity on the part of Samson. The general lesson is that of <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_esdras/4-26.htm" title="Yea, many there be that have run out of their wits for women, and become servants for their sakes.">1 Esdras 4:26</a> : "Many have gone out of their wits for women, and have become slaves on account of them; many have perished and erred and sinned by reason of women." (Comp. <a href="/proverbs/7-26.htm" title="For she has cast down many wounded: yes, many strong men have been slain by her.">Proverbs 7:26</a>.) Eastern legends constantly show how women have deceived even prophets. But there was no reason why the sacred historian should linger over the details of scenes so unworthy. If Delilah spoke thus plainly at once, we can only imagine that she was professing to treat the whole matter as a jest. Josephus says: "When Samson was drinking, or at other moments, expressing admiration of his deeds, she kept scheming how to ascertain in what way he was so pre-eminent in valour." An illustration may be found in <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_esdras/4-29.htm" title="Yet did I see him and Apame the king's concubine, the daughter of the admirable Bartacus, sitting at the right hand of the king,">1 Esdras 4:29</a> : "I saw Apame taking the crown from the king's head and setting it on her own head; she also struck the king with her left hand, and yet for all that the king gaped and gazed upon her with open mouth. If she laughed upon him, he laughed; if she took displeasure at him, he flattered her, that she may be reconciled to him." The genius of a great poet has depicted such wiles in the idyll of Merlin and Vivi-enne, and it is only by supposing that such wiles were put forth in this instance that we can retain credit for even the most ordinary sense on the part of the Danite hero. But his fault was not stupidity--it was sensual infatuation; and in the ruin and shame which this sensual weakness brought upon him, and the way in which, step by step, it led him to forfeit the great gift of God, lies the chief moral of the story. We find the same lesson in the legend of Hercules and Omphale; and even if this legend was not influenced by the story of Samson's life, yet there is a general analogy between the character of the Greek and the Jewish hero. Samson was no Solomon, and yet the heart of even Solomon--<p>". . . . though large,<p>Beguiled by fair idolatresses, fell."<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/16-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Delilah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#601;&#183;l&#238;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1807.htm">Strong's 1807: </a> </span><span class="str2">Delilah -- Philistine mistress of Samson</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
