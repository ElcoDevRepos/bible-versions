Caravan routes were essential for commerce and communication in the ancient Near East, often connecting major cities and regions. Gideon's choice to use this route suggests his tactical acumen, as it allowed for swift and unexpected movement. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using seemingly ordinary means to achieve His purposes, as seen in other instances where God uses the natural landscape to aid His people (e.g., the parting of the Red Sea in <a href="/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>).<p><b>east of Nobah and Jogbehah</b><br>Nobah and Jogbehah were locations in the territory of Gilead, east of the Jordan River. Nobah was named after a leader who captured it (<a href="/numbers/32-42.htm">Numbers 32:42</a>), while Jogbehah is mentioned as a fortified city (<a href="/numbers/32-35.htm">Numbers 32:35</a>). The mention of these places highlights the geographical context of Gideon's pursuit of the Midianites. This area was part of the land allotted to the tribes of Gad and Reuben, emphasizing the fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel the land. The eastward direction also symbolizes moving towards the rising sun, often associated with new beginnings and divine intervention.<p><b>and he attacked their army</b><br>Gideon's attack on the Midianite army is a continuation of his divinely appointed mission to deliver Israel from oppression (<a href="/judges/6-14.htm">Judges 6:14</a>). This reflects the recurring biblical theme of God empowering unlikely leaders to achieve victory, as seen with David against Goliath (1 Samuel 17). Gideon's leadership and courage are central to the narrative, demonstrating how God can use individuals to fulfill His plans despite overwhelming odds.<p><b>taking them by surprise</b><br>The element of surprise was crucial in ancient warfare, often determining the outcome of battles. Gideon's ability to catch the Midianites off guard underscores his wisdom and the divine guidance he received. This surprise attack is reminiscent of other biblical accounts where God grants victory through unexpected means, such as Joshua's conquest of Jericho (Joshua 6). It also foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ, who triumphs over sin and death in ways that defy human expectation (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54-57</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.
