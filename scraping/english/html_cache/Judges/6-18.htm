Gideon's request for the Angel to stay indicates his desire for confirmation and assurance of the divine encounter. This reflects the cultural context of the time, where hospitality and the presence of a guest were highly valued. The request also shows Gideon's cautious nature and his need for reassurance, which is a recurring theme in his story. This moment parallels other biblical instances where individuals seek confirmation from God, such as Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3) and Thomas seeking proof of Jesus' resurrection (<a href="/john/20-24.htm">John 20:24-29</a>).<p><b>Let me bring my offering and set it before You.</b><br>Gideon's intention to bring an offering signifies his recognition of the divine nature of his visitor. In the historical context, offerings were a common way to honor deities and seek their favor. The act of setting the offering before the Angel underscores the sacrificial system established in the Mosaic Law, where offerings were presented to God as acts of worship and atonement (Leviticus 1-7). This offering can be seen as a type of Christ, foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, who is both the offerer and the offering (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). Gideon's offering also reflects his faith and willingness to honor God, despite his initial doubts and fears.<p><b>And the LORD said, &#8220;I will stay until you return.&#8221;</b><br>The LORD's response demonstrates His patience and willingness to accommodate Gideon's request, highlighting God's grace and understanding of human frailty. This assurance from the LORD is significant, as it confirms His presence and commitment to Gideon, despite Gideon's hesitations. The phrase echoes God's promise of presence and faithfulness found throughout Scripture, such as His assurance to Joshua, "I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you" (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>). This divine patience and willingness to wait for Gideon can be seen as a reflection of Christ's patience with His disciples and His followers today, as He waits for them to come to Him in faith and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

With holy fear he pleads for the Divine Presence to remain.<p>&#8226; Like Moses, who petitioned, &#8220;If Your Presence does not go with us, do not lead us up from here&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/33-15.htm">Exodus 33:15</a>), Gideon knows victory is impossible without the Lord nearby.<p>&#8226; The request shows humility. Gideon does not command; he courteously asks, recognizing authority. Compare Abraham&#8217;s similar invitation, &#8220;Please let a little water be brought&#8230; rest yourselves under the tree&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/18-3.htm">Genesis 18:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Application: Genuine faith clings to God&#8217;s nearness rather than rushing ahead in self-confidence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Until I return to You</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;until I return to You&#8221; (<a href="/judges/6-18.htm">Judges 6:18</a>b)<p>&#8226; Gideon intends to act quickly, yet he asks permission, displaying both urgency and reverence.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Return to You&#8221; implies he believes the Angel will still be there; this is trust, not presumption.<p>&#8226; Elijah left Elisha &#8220;and went up and ate and drank, and came back&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/19-5.htm">1 Kings 19:5-8</a>), returning strengthened for the mission. Gideon seeks a similar strengthening moment.<p>&#8226; Application: When God calls, pauses for preparation are acceptable if they are rooted in obedience, not delay.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let me bring my offering and set it before You</b><p>&#8220;Let me bring my offering and set it before You.&#8221; (<a href="/judges/6-18.htm">Judges 6:18</a>c)<p>&#8226; The Hebrew word for &#8220;offering&#8221; here refers to a gift of homage. Gideon wants to worship before waging war.<p>&#8226; Worship precedes warfare throughout Scripture: &#8220;Joshua fell facedown&#8230; and worshiped&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>) before Jericho; King Jehoshaphat appointed singers &#8220;to praise the LORD&#8221; ahead of battle (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-21.htm">2 Chronicles 20:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Gideon&#8217;s offering will become a sign (vv. 19-21); God consumes it with fire, confirming His commission.<p>&#8226; Application: Presenting ourselves and our resources to the Lord is foundational to any assignment He gives (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the LORD said, &#8220;I will stay until you return.&#8221;</b><p>&#8220;And the LORD said, &#8216;I will stay until you return.&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/judges/6-18.htm">Judges 6:18</a>d)<p>&#8226; God graciously agrees.

He begs God&#8217;s nearness, hurries to prepare an offering, and receives the Lord&#8217;s promise to wait.
