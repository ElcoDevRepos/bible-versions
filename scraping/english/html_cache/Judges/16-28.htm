Throughout his life, Samson often acted on his own impulses, but here he acknowledges the LORD as his source of strength. This reflects a turning point, similar to other biblical figures who call upon God in times of distress, such as Jonah (<a href="/jonah/2.htm">Jonah 2:1</a>) and David (<a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>).<p><b>O Lord GOD, please remember me:</b><br>The plea for God to "remember" is a request for divine intervention and favor. In biblical terms, when God "remembers," it often leads to action, as seen with Noah (<a href="/genesis/8.htm">Genesis 8:1</a>) and Hannah (<a href="/1_samuel/1-19.htm">1 Samuel 1:19</a>). Samson's use of "Lord GOD" (Adonai Yahweh) emphasizes his recognition of God's sovereignty and covenantal faithfulness.<p><b>Strengthen me, O God, just once more:</b><br>Samson's request for strength "just once more" highlights his understanding of God's power and his own limitations. This moment parallels the concept of God's grace being sufficient in weakness, as Paul later articulates in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>. It also underscores the theme of redemption and second chances found throughout Scripture.<p><b>so that with one vengeful blow I may pay back the Philistines for my two eyes:</b><br>Samson's desire for vengeance is personal, tied to the loss of his eyesight, which the Philistines took from him. This reflects the cultural context of retributive justice common in the ancient Near East. While the New Testament teaches forgiveness (<a href="/matthew/5-38.htm">Matthew 5:38-39</a>), Samson's actions are part of God's judgment against the Philistines, who oppressed Israel. This act of deliverance, despite its personal motivation, aligns with God's broader plan to use Samson as a judge to begin freeing Israel from Philistine domination (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was derived from his Nazirite vow to God.

O God.</span>--Three names of God--Adonai, Jehovah, Elohim.<p><span class= "bld">That I may be at once avenged of the Philistines.</span>--Again we see that Samson stood at a comparatively low level of spiritual enlightenment as well as of moral purity. One cannot help feeling that Milton has read into the hero's character an austere grandeur which it did not possess. His Samson of the <span class= "ital">Samson Agonistes </span>is rather Milton himself than the Jewish hero. That stern classic poem is the "thundering reverberation of a mighty spirit, struck by the plectrum of disappointment."<p><span class= "bld">For my two eyes.</span>--The words rendered "at once" in the previous clause may be rendered "that I may avenge myself <span class= "ital">the revenge of one </span>of my two eyes." If so, there seems to be in the words a grim jest, as though no vengeance would suffice for the fearful loss of both his eyes (LXX., "<span class= "ital">one </span>revenge for my <span class= "ital">two </span>eyes"), "one last tremendous deed, one last fearful jest." There is a curious parallel to this achievement of Samson in the story of Cleo-medes of Astypalaea, who in revenge for a fine pulls down a pillar, and crushes the boys in a school (Pausan. <span class= "ital">Perieg. </span>Vi. 2, 3). Cassel tells us that on July 21st, 1864, many people were killed by the breaking of a granite pillar in the Church of the Transfiguration at St. Petersburg.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Samson called unto the Lord</span>.

Perhaps we may see in this an evidence that his affliction and shame had not been without their effect, in bringing him back to God humbled and penitent. The language is very earnest. "O Lord, Jehovah, remember me strengthen me only this once, O God!" The threefold name by which he addresses the Almighty implies great tension of spirit. <span class="cmt_word">That I may be at once avenged</span>. Meaning <span class="accented">at one stroke</span> - he would take one vengeance so terrible that it would be sufficient for his two eyes, which makes very good sense if the Hebrew will bear it.
