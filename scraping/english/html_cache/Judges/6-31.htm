This indicates Joash's position of authority and influence within the community. His response is significant as it shows a shift from idolatry to a defense of his son&#8217;s actions, possibly indicating a change in his own beliefs or a protective instinct. This moment reflects the tension between the worship of Yahweh and the prevalent Canaanite practices, highlighting the spiritual conflict in Israel during the time of the Judges.<p><b>&#8220;Are you contending for Baal?</b><br>Joash challenges the townspeople by questioning their defense of Baal, a Canaanite deity. This rhetorical question exposes the futility of worshiping a god who cannot defend himself. It underscores the biblical theme of the impotence of idols, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, where the prophet mocks the creation and worship of idols. Joash's question implies that if Baal were truly a god, he would not need human defense.<p><b>Are you trying to save him?</b><br>This question further emphasizes the absurdity of the situation. The idea of humans needing to save a deity is ironic and highlights the powerlessness of Baal compared to the God of Israel. This reflects the biblical narrative that only the true God is the Savior, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/43-11.htm">Isaiah 43:11</a>, where God declares, "I, even I, am the LORD, and apart from me there is no savior."<p><b>Whoever pleads his case will be put to death by morning!</b><br>Joash issues a stern warning to those who would defend Baal, suggesting that such actions are not only futile but also deserving of death. This reflects the seriousness of idolatry in Israelite law, where worshiping other gods was a capital offense (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6-10</a>). Joash's declaration serves as a turning point, protecting Gideon and reinforcing the call to return to the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>If Baal is a god, let him contend for himself</b><br>Joash's statement challenges the power and existence of Baal, suggesting that a true deity would not need human intervention. This echoes the biblical theme of God&#8217;s sovereignty and power, as seen in the story of Elijah on Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-20.htm">1 Kings 18:20-40</a>), where the impotence of Baal is similarly exposed. It serves as a call to recognize the one true God who acts on behalf of His people.<p><b>with the one who has torn down his altar.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase refers to Gideon, who, under divine instruction, destroyed the altar of Baal. This act of defiance against idolatry is a pivotal moment in Gideon's story, marking the beginning of his role as a judge and deliverer of Israel. It foreshadows the ultimate victory of God over false gods and points to the New Testament fulfillment in Christ, who triumphs over all spiritual powers and authorities (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash</a></b><br>The father of Gideon, who defends his son&#8217;s actions against the townspeople who are angry about the destruction of Baal's altar.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>The son of Joash, chosen by God to deliver Israel from the Midianites.

Joash, once complicit, defends his son, exposes Baal&#8217;s impotence, and calls any defender of Baal worthy of death. The verse teaches that only the living God can contend for Himself; all idols require human rescue and therefore are no gods at all. Gideon&#8217;s new name, Jerubbaal, becomes a standing testimony that the LORD alone is God and that faith-filled obedience, even when risky, reveals the emptiness of every rival deity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">Unto all that stood against him.</span>--The meaning of these words is very uncertain. They may mean, "to all that stood around."<p><span class= "bld">Will ye plead for Baal?</span>--The pronoun <span class= "ital">ye </span>is very emphatic, being twice expressed in the Hebrew.<p><span class= "bld">He that will plead for him, let him be put to death.</span>--These words of Joash were extraordinarily bold and cunning. Possibly the brave act of his son may have roused his conscience, and Gideon may have told him that he had acted under Divine guidance. But he saves his son's life, not by excusing his act, but by feigning such a zeal for Baal as to denounce it as a blasphemous impiety to suppose that Baal will not avenge his own insult--an impiety <span class= "ital">so </span>monstrous, that the man who was guilty of it should be at once put to death. Thus he made Baal-worship a plea for <span class= "ital">not </span>avenging the insult offered to Baal. He was well aware that if he thus gained time, the fact that Baal did <span class= "ital">not </span>interfere to protect himself from such fearful outrage would weigh powerfully with all his worshippers. Among idolaters the sight of an act of open contempt for their idol often shakes their superstitious reverence. Aristophanes, Persius, and Lucian sneer at the inability of Jupiter to defend his own temple, golden locks, and golden beard. When Olaf had the huge image of Odin destroyed, and when the high priest Coifi at Saxmundham, clad in armour and mounted on horseback (two things which were forbidden to a priest), rode up to the Saxon idols and hurled them down, the people, seeing that no thunder followed, but that all went on as well as usual, were quite ready to embrace Christianity.<p><span class= "bld">Whilst it is yet morning.</span>--The Hebrew is <span class= "ital">ad habb?ker </span>("until morning"); LXX., <span class= "ital">he?s pr?i, </span>which may mean, "before to-morrow's sun has dawned." (<span class= "ital">Antequan lux crastina veniat, </span>Vulg.; as also the Syriac, Arabic, and Chaldee.) It is a much more likely rendering than that of the E.V., for it implies, "Let us wait till to-morrow, to see whether Baal will avenge himself." Joash knew that in popular outbreaks procrastination means security.<p><span class= "bld">If he be a god.</span>--Compare the language of Elijah to the Baal and Asherah priests (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm" title="And Elijah came to all the people, and said, How long halt you between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him.
