At this time, the Danites were struggling to secure their allotted inheritance in the Promised Land, as described in <a href="/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40-48</a>. The sending of five men indicates a strategic reconnaissance mission, similar to the twelve spies sent by Moses in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>. This reflects a common practice in ancient warfare and exploration.<p><b>men of valor from Zorah and Eshtaol</b><br>Zorah and Eshtaol were towns located in the territory originally assigned to the tribe of Dan, near the border of the Philistine territory. These towns are also associated with Samson, another Danite, as seen in <a href="/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a>. The term "men of valor" suggests that these were experienced warriors, capable of handling the challenges of scouting and potential conflict.<p><b>to spy out the land and explore it</b><br>The mission to "spy out the land" echoes the earlier biblical narrative of the Israelite spies sent into Canaan. This task was to assess the land's suitability for settlement and its inhabitants' strength. The Danites were seeking a new territory because they had not been able to fully conquer their original allotment, as noted in <a href="/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Go and explore the land,&#8221; they told them</b><br>This command reflects a proactive approach to finding a solution to their territorial challenges. The directive to "explore" suggests a thorough investigation, not just of military aspects but also of the land's resources and potential for settlement. This mirrors God's command to the Israelites to explore the Promised Land, emphasizing the importance of divine guidance in their endeavors.<p><b>The men entered the hill country of Ephraim</b><br>The hill country of Ephraim was a central region in Israel, known for its rugged terrain and strategic importance. It was part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Ephraim, descendants of Joseph. This area was significant in Israel's history, being the location of Shiloh, where the tabernacle was set up (<a href="/joshua/18.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>).<p><b>and came to the house of Micah</b><br>Micah's house is central to the narrative in <a href="/judges/17.htm">Judges 17-18</a>, where he had established a shrine with an idol and hired a Levite as a priest. This reflects the religious syncretism and idolatry prevalent in Israel during the time of the Judges, highlighting the spiritual decline and lack of centralized worship.<p><b>where they spent the night</b><br>Spending the night at Micah's house suggests hospitality, a valued cultural practice in ancient Israel. It also sets the stage for the subsequent events, where the Danites would learn about Micah's shrine and the Levite priest, leading to their decision to take both for themselves. This act foreshadows the moral and spiritual chaos that characterizes the period of the Judges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/danites.htm">Danites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel, descendants of Dan, one of the twelve sons of Jacob.

Rather than finish driving out the Philistines, they chose to look elsewhere. In sending only five representatives, they acted much like Israel did under Moses when twelve spies were chosen (<a href="/numbers/13-1.htm">Numbers 13:1-3</a>). Their small number suggests covert reconnaissance rather than an open military campaign. At this point the narrator quietly signals the tension between God-given territory and human shortcuts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>men of valor from Zorah and Eshtaol</b><p>Zorah and Eshtaol lay on Dan&#8217;s troubled border with Philistia, and later would be remembered as Samson&#8217;s hometowns (<a href="/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a>). Growing up under constant threat forged courageous warriors. Scripture often highlights such &#8220;valiant men&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>), but here bravery is applied to a quest that ultimately drifts from God&#8217;s plan. Valor without obedience can still end in compromise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to spy out the land and explore it</b><p>The mandate echoes earlier moments in Israel&#8217;s history&#8212;Caleb and Joshua scouting Canaan (<a href="/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-24.htm">Deuteronomy 1:24</a>) and the two spies checking Jericho (<a href="/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1</a>). Reconnaissance itself is wise, yet motives matter. Unlike those earlier missions, the Danite search stems from discontent rather than divine command. They are seeking an easier inheritance, not the one assigned.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Go and explore the land,&#8221; they told them</b><p>The tribal leadership gives a simple, forceful charge. Similar directives appear later in the chapter (<a href="/judges/18-8.htm">Judges 18:8, 10</a>) when the scouts encourage the whole tribe to act. Speech often reveals heart: here the focus is entirely horizontal&#8212;&#8220;the land&#8221;&#8212;with no mention of the LORD who apportioned it. Contrast Joshua&#8217;s constant reminders of God&#8217;s promise (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The men entered the hill country of Ephraim</b><p>Moving northward, the scouts leave Danite soil and step into a neighboring tribal allotment (<a href="/judges/17-1.htm">Judges 17:1</a>). Ephraim&#8217;s hills offered strategic elevation and, sadly, pockets of syncretism that had already taken root (<a href="/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a> hints at moral decline in the north). Physically the journey is north; spiritually it is downhill.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and came to the house of Micah</b><p>Micah&#8217;s shrine (<a href="/judges/17-5.htm">Judges 17:5</a>) featured a carved idol, an ephod, and a hired Levite. By God&#8217;s law worship was to be centralized at the tabernacle (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-6</a>). Stumbling upon this house of idolatry, the scouts will later adopt Micah&#8217;s compromise for themselves (<a href="/judges/18-14.htm">Judges 18:14-20</a>). Wrong turns often begin with seemingly random encounters that expose underlying desires.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>where they spent the night</b><p>Hospitality was customary (<a href="/genesis/19-2.htm">Genesis 19:2</a>; <a href="/judges/19-4.htm">Judges 19:4</a>), yet staying under Micah&#8217;s roof placed the men in an environment of spiritual compromise. Evening hours can be moments of reflection or of subtle temptation. Their overnight stay becomes the seedbed for the theft of Micah&#8217;s idols and a distorted form of worship that will plague Dan for generations (<a href="/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30-31</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-21.htm">2 Kings 17:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/18-2.htm">Judges 18:2</a> records more than a scouting trip; it uncovers a heart condition. Dan&#8217;s warriors, though courageous, seek convenience over covenant obedience. Their journey north exposes them to an attractive but forbidden form of worship that they will later embrace. The verse reminds us that valor, planning, and opportunity are not enough. Without wholehearted trust in God&#8217;s assigned inheritance and His prescribed worship, even the bold can stray into idolatry and lead an entire tribe down a path of compromise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">From their coasts.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">their ends </span>(<a href="/genesis/19-4.htm" title="But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:">Genesis 19:4</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm" title="And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.">1Kings 12:31</a>).
