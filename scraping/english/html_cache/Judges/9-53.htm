The fact that a woman is the one who drops the millstone is significant, as women were often not seen as warriors or direct participants in battle. This act subverts the typical expectations of gender roles in warfare. The use of a millstone, a common household item, highlights the unexpected nature of Abimelech's downfall. This event echoes the story of Jael in <a href="/judges/4-21.htm">Judges 4:21</a>, where another woman uses an unconventional weapon to defeat an enemy of Israel.<p><b>on Abimelech&#8217;s head</b><br>Abimelech, the son of Gideon, had declared himself king after killing his seventy brothers. His rule was marked by violence and treachery, and his death by a blow to the head symbolizes the divine retribution for his actions. The head, often seen as the seat of authority and leadership, being struck down signifies the end of his illegitimate reign. This act fulfills the curse of Jotham, Gideon's youngest son, who prophesied destruction upon Abimelech and the people of Shechem (<a href="/judges/9-20.htm">Judges 9:20</a>).<p><b>crushing his skull</b><br>The crushing of Abimelech's skull is a vivid depiction of his demise and serves as a literal and symbolic end to his tyranny. In biblical literature, the crushing of the head is often associated with the defeat of evil, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the seed of the woman is prophesied to crush the serpent's head. This imagery connects Abimelech's death to the broader biblical theme of God's justice prevailing over wickedness. The manner of his death also reflects the principle of divine justice, as Abimelech, who killed his brothers on a single stone, is himself killed by a stone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal) and a concubine from Shechem.

In the older English of Chaucer and his immediate successors such compounds as <span class="accented">to-break</span>, <span class="accented">to-burst</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> were very common, and were frequently preceded by the adverb <span class="accented">all.</span> Hence, some English scholars would read the phrase here, <span class="accented">and all to-brake his skull.</span> It is, however, certain that before the time when the A.V. was made the compounds <span class="accented">to-break</span>, <span class="accented">to-burst</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> had become entirely obsolete, and the compound <span class="accented">all-to</span> had come into use. The right way, therefore, in which to read the present phrase <span class="accented">is</span>, <span class="accented">and all-to brake his skull</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> smashed it, dashed it in pieces.
