It reflects the theocratic nature of Israel during the time of the Judges, where God directly intervened in the affairs of His people. This divine communication is consistent with other instances in the Old Testament where God speaks to His chosen leaders, such as Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) and Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>).<p><b>&#8220;There are still too many men.</b><br>God's statement underscores the principle that victory comes not by human strength or numbers but by divine power. This is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>, where Jonathan declares that the LORD can save "by many or by few." It also prefigures the New Testament teaching that God's power is made perfect in weakness (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p><b>Take them down to the water,</b><br>The water serves as a place of testing and separation. In biblical symbolism, water often represents purification and testing (e.g., the crossing of the Red Sea in <a href="/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a> and the Jordan River in <a href="/joshua/3.htm">Joshua 3</a>). This setting provides a practical means for God to demonstrate His sovereignty in choosing the right men for the task.<p><b>and I will sift them for you there.</b><br>The sifting process indicates a divine selection, separating those who are fit for battle from those who are not. This echoes the idea of God refining His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/malachi/3-3.htm">Malachi 3:3</a>, where God is described as a refiner and purifier. It also foreshadows the New Testament concept of God testing and refining believers (<a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>).<p><b>If I say to you, &#8216;This one shall go with you,&#8217; he shall go.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes obedience to God's specific instructions. It reflects the necessity of following divine guidance without question, a principle seen throughout Scripture, such as in the call of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-4</a>) and the instructions given to Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7-9</a>).<p><b>But if I say, &#8216;This one shall not go with you,&#8217; he shall not go.&#8221;</b><br>The exclusion of certain men highlights God's sovereign choice and the importance of reliance on His wisdom rather than human judgment. This principle is mirrored in the New Testament, where Jesus chooses His disciples (<a href="/john/15-16.htm">John 15:16</a>) and where believers are reminded that God&#8217;s ways are higher than human ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.
