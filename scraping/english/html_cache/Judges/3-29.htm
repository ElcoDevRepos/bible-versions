The timing is crucial as it follows Ehud's assassination of Eglon, the Moabite king, which was a turning point for Israel's deliverance.<p><b>they struck down about ten thousand Moabites</b><br>The Moabites were descendants of Lot and often in conflict with Israel. The number "ten thousand" signifies a complete and decisive victory, emphasizing the totality of the defeat. This victory was significant as it marked the liberation of Israel from Moabite oppression. The Moabites were located east of the Dead Sea, and their defeat here underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to deliver Israel from their enemies.<p><b>all robust and valiant men</b><br>This description highlights the strength and capability of the Moabite forces, making Israel's victory even more remarkable. The Moabite warriors were not weak or unprepared; they were formidable opponents. This emphasizes the divine intervention and empowerment of Israel's forces, as such a victory against strong adversaries would have been unlikely without God's aid.<p><b>Not one of them escaped</b><br>This phrase underscores the completeness of the victory. It reflects the thoroughness of God's deliverance and judgment against the Moabites. The total annihilation of the enemy is reminiscent of other biblical battles where God ensures victory for His people, such as the defeat of the Amalekites by Saul (1 Samuel 15) and the destruction of the Canaanite cities during Joshua's conquest.

Scripture shows God often marks decisive moments when He moves to deliver His people&#8212;think of &#8220;that night&#8221; when the Passover angel came (<a href="/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29</a>) or &#8220;in the days of Shamgar&#8221; (<a href="/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>).<p>&#8211; This phrase underscores that God&#8217;s timing is precise; deliverance comes neither early nor late (cf. <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>, &#8220;when the fullness of time had come&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they struck down about ten thousand Moabites</b><p>&#8211; The verb &#8220;struck down&#8221; signals a literal, decisive military victory, not a metaphor.<p>&#8211; Ten thousand is a massive number for Israel&#8217;s fledgling forces. Similar large-scale victories appear in <a href="/1_samuel/11-11.htm">1 Samuel 11:11</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/13-17.htm">2 Chronicles 13:17</a>, revealing a pattern: when God fights for His people, numbers favoring the enemy are overturned.<p>&#8211; The defeat of Moab reverses Moab&#8217;s earlier oppression of Israel (<a href="/judges/3-14.htm">Judges 3:14</a>). God keeps His promise to curse those who curse His covenant people (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all robust and valiant men</b><p>&#8211; Scripture highlights that the Moabites were &#8220;robust and valiant,&#8221; emphasizing they were elite warriors, the best Moab had.

God delights to show His sufficiency against apparent superiority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Not one of them escaped</b><p>&#8211; Totality of judgment: the victory is complete, leaving no remnant to regroup. The phrase mirrors Joshua&#8217;s conquests where &#8220;he left no survivors&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a>).<p>&#8211; It highlights covenant faithfulness&#8212;Israel will &#8220;possess the gates of their enemies&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>).<p>&#8211; Spiritually, it foreshadows the ultimate triumph of Christ, when every enemy is put under His feet (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>). No hostile power will slip away from divine justice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/3-29.htm">Judges 3:29</a> records a historical, God&#8211;engineered victory: at God&#8217;s appointed time, Israel, led by Ehud, slew about ten thousand of Moab&#8217;s strongest warriors, and none escaped.
