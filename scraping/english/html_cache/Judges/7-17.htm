This reflects the biblical principle of leadership by example, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/11.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a> where Paul urges believers to imitate him as he imitates Christ. Gideon's directive underscores the necessity of unity and trust in leadership, crucial for the success of their mission.<p><b>Gideon said</b><br>Gideon, whose name means "hewer" or "one who cuts down," is a judge of Israel during a time of oppression by the Midianites. His leadership is marked by divine selection and empowerment, as seen in <a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12-16</a>. His role as a judge is both military and spiritual, serving as a deliverer and a restorer of faith in God.<p><b>When I come to the outskirts of the camp</b><br>The strategic approach to the Midianite camp highlights the element of surprise and the psychological warfare employed by Gideon. The outskirts of the camp represent the boundary between safety and vulnerability. This tactic is reminiscent of other biblical battles where God uses unconventional means to secure victory, such as the fall of Jericho in <a href="/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>.<p><b>do exactly as I do</b><br>This command reinforces the need for precise obedience and coordination among Gideon's men. It reflects the biblical theme of following God's appointed leader, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>, which speaks to the importance of submitting to those who lead in accordance with God's will.

In a moment when only three hundred men stand against a massive Midianite host, Gideon doesn&#8217;t offer a lecture&#8212;he offers himself.<p>&#8226; Leadership by example: Like Paul urging, &#8220;Imitate me, as I imitate Christ&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-1.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>), Gideon knows people learn faith best when they can see it lived.<p>&#8226; Visible faith: Earlier the Angel of the LORD called Gideon a &#8220;mighty man of valor&#8221; (<a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>). Now Gideon&#8217;s actions begin to match that title, fulfilling <a href="/hebrews/13-7.htm">Hebrews 13:7</a>&#8217;s call to consider the outcome of a leader&#8217;s way of life and imitate their faith.<p>&#8226; Modeling obedience: Peter describes shepherds as &#8220;examples to the flock&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-3.htm">1 Peter 5:3</a>).

Trusting that divine cue, he approaches the perimeter exactly when fear already grips the foe, much like Jonathan timing his climb against the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Faith at the edge: The &#8220;outskirts&#8221; represent the threshold between safety and risk. Israel&#8217;s history shows God acting when His people stand at such edges&#8212;Jericho&#8217;s walls fell only after Israel marched right up to them (<a href="/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do exactly as I do</b><p>&#8220;Do exactly as I do&#8221; (<a href="/judges/7-17.htm">Judges 7:17</a>c).
