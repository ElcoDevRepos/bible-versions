The mention of "roots in Amalek" is intriguing, as Amalek was traditionally an enemy of Israel. This could suggest a historical connection or a metaphorical expression of overcoming past enmities. Ephraim's involvement in the battle reflects their willingness to unite against common foes, a theme seen throughout Israel's history.<p><b>Benjamin came with your people after you.</b><br>The tribe of Benjamin, though small, was known for its fierce warriors. Their participation "after you" indicates a following or supportive role, possibly highlighting the unity among the tribes during this period. Benjamin's loyalty and courage are echoed in other biblical narratives, such as their support for King Saul, who was from this tribe.<p><b>The commanders came down from Machir,</b><br>Machir was a descendant of Manasseh, and this phrase likely refers to the half-tribe of Manasseh east of the Jordan. The "commanders" suggest a military leadership role, emphasizing the strategic importance of Machir's contribution. This reflects the broader theme of unity and cooperation among the tribes in the face of external threats.<p><b>the bearers of the marshal&#8217;s staff from Zebulun.</b><br>Zebulun was a tribe known for its valor and willingness to risk their lives, as seen in other parts of Judges. The "marshal&#8217;s staff" symbolizes authority and leadership, indicating that Zebulun provided key leaders or officers in the battle. This aligns with the prophetic blessings given to Zebulun, highlighting their role in Israel's military endeavors and their faithfulness to God's call.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>A prominent tribe of Israel, often associated with leadership and strength.

But the meaning seems to be, "Out of Ephraim (came down to the battle) those whose root is in Amalek," or, "among the Amalekites." Ephraim had firmly rooted himself (comp. <a href="/isaiah/27-6.htm" title="He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.">Isaiah 27:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/80-10.htm" title="The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.">Psalm 80:10</a>) in the country which had been the stronghold of the Amalekites.

In after days Benjamin clung to the skirts of Judah, but at this period his fortunes were more allied with those of Ephraim. "After thee, Benjamin," seems to have become (perhaps from this allusion) a war-cry of the tribe (<a href="/hosea/5-8.htm" title="Blow you the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Bethaven, after you, O Benjamin.">Hosea 5:8</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - They who spring (whose root is) from Ephraim <span class="accented">went</span> against Amalek, following thee, O Benjamin, with thy people;
