This phrase likely refers to the leaders or nobles of the society, those who had the means to own such animals. In biblical times, donkeys were valued for their endurance and ability to navigate difficult terrain, making them a symbol of peace and humility, as opposed to horses, which were associated with war. The mention of white donkeys may also symbolize purity and righteousness, drawing a parallel to Jesus' entry into Jerusalem on a donkey (<a href="/matthew/21.htm">Matthew 21:1-11</a>), emphasizing humility and peace.<p><b>who sit on saddle blankets</b><br>Saddle blankets were used for comfort and to signify the rider's status. Those who could afford such luxuries were typically people of influence and authority. This phrase suggests a call to those in positions of power to reflect on their responsibilities and the events unfolding around them. The use of saddle blankets indicates a settled and comfortable lifestyle, contrasting with the hardships faced by the common people. This can be seen as a reminder to leaders to remain humble and attentive to God's will, much like the leaders in Israel were expected to be.<p><b>and you who travel the road</b><br>Traveling the road implies movement and journey, often associated with trade, communication, and the spread of news. In the context of Judges, this could refer to the dissemination of the victory song of Deborah and Barak, encouraging all who hear it to consider its significance. Roads in ancient Israel were vital for connecting communities and facilitating the exchange of goods and ideas. This phrase may also symbolize the spiritual journey of believers, urging them to remain vigilant and faithful as they navigate life's path, much like the Israelites were called to follow God's guidance through the wilderness.<p><b>ponder</b><br>The call to ponder is an invitation to reflect deeply on the events and lessons of the song of Deborah. It encourages the audience to consider the mighty acts of God, the deliverance He provided, and the role of human leaders in His divine plan. This reflection is not just intellectual but also spiritual, prompting a response of gratitude, obedience, and faith. The act of pondering is akin to meditating on God's Word, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>, where the righteous delight in the law of the Lord and meditate on it day and night. This meditation leads to a deeper understanding of God's character and His purposes for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/deborah.htm">Deborah</a></b><br>A prophetess and judge of Israel who, along with Barak, led Israel to victory over the Canaanite army led by Sisera. <a href="/bsb/judges/5.htm">Judges 5</a> is a song of victory attributed to her.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/barak.htm">Barak</a></b><br>The military leader who, under Deborah's guidance, led the Israelite forces against Sisera.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were oppressed by the Canaanites and delivered through the leadership of Deborah and Barak.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanites.htm">Canaanites</a></b><br>The oppressors of Israel during this period, specifically under the command of Sisera, the commander of King Jabin's army.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/white_donkeys.htm">White Donkeys</a></b><br>Symbolic of wealth and status, as only the affluent could afford such animals and the luxury of riding them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledging_god's_blessings.htm">Acknowledging God's Blessings</a></b><br>The mention of riding white donkeys serves as a reminder to recognize and speak of God's blessings in our lives, regardless of our status or wealth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_of_the_privileged.htm">Responsibility of the Privileged</a></b><br>Those who are blessed with resources and status have a responsibility to speak out and act justly, using their influence for God's purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>The call to speak is directed at various groups, highlighting the importance of unity among different social classes in praising God and recounting His deeds.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_on_god's_deliverance.htm">Reflecting on God's Deliverance</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were called to remember and speak of their deliverance, we too should regularly reflect on and testify about God's work in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/engagement_in_community.htm">Engagement in Community</a></b><br>The reference to those who travel the road suggests active participation in the community, encouraging believers to engage with and support one another.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Judges_5_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Judges 5:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Reflect_on_God_s_past_deliverances.htm">How does Judges 5:10 encourage us to reflect on God's past deliverances today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Gratitude_s_role_in_daily_walk_with_God.htm">What role does gratitude play in our daily walk with God, as seen here?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_do_we_express_it_today.htm">How can we "tell of it" in our modern context and community?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Both_urge_proclaiming_God_s_deeds.htm">Connect Judges 5:10 with Psalm 105:2.

White (or bright) donkeys were prized animals, used by nobles and rulers (see <a href="/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>, where Jair&#8217;s sons ride thirty of them).<p>&#8226; Deborah is summoning the influential to speak up about the Lord&#8217;s victory over Sisera. Their resources and position must be leveraged to proclaim God&#8217;s acts (compare <a href="/1_kings/1-33.htm">1 Kings 1:33</a>, where Solomon&#8217;s royal procession on David&#8217;s mule signals authority; <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a> shows the Messiah riding a donkey as King).<p>&#8226; Application: Those with status today should not stay silent when God delivers; their testimony can inspire an entire community to trust Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who sit on saddle blankets</b><p>&#8226; The phrase moves from riders in motion to officials at rest. Cushioned &#8220;saddle blankets&#8221; were the ancient equivalent of comfortable seats, often used by judges or elders at the city gate (<a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/25-7.htm">Deuteronomy 25:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Deborah addresses leaders who dispense justice. Now that the Lord has broken Canaanite oppression, righteous governance must resume (see <a href="/psalms/122-5.htm">Psalm 122:5</a>, &#8220;For there the thrones for judgment stand&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Application: After any God-given victory, leaders are responsible to maintain justice, peace, and gratitude instead of slipping back into complacency.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you who travel the road</b><p>&#8226; The invitation widens to ordinary travelers&#8212;merchants, families, pilgrims&#8212;who can once again move freely. Just four verses earlier, <a href="/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6</a> said, &#8220;The highways were abandoned.&#8221; Now the roads are open.<p>&#8226; This safety is a direct result of the Lord&#8217;s intervention, echoing <a href="/2_chronicles/15-5.htm">2 Chronicles 15:5</a>, where unrest made travel perilous, and <a href="/isaiah/35-8.htm">Isaiah 35:8-10</a>, where redeemed people return on a holy highway.<p>&#8226; Application: Everyday routines&#8212;commutes, errands, conversations&#8212;become platforms for talking about God&#8217;s deliverance. No one is too &#8220;normal&#8221; to testify.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>ponder</b><p>&#8226; Deborah&#8217;s final command: &#8220;ponder&#8221; (literally, give careful thought). All classes of society must pause to rehearse the Lord&#8217;s righteousness (<a href="/judges/5-11.htm">Judges 5:11</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11-12</a> urges the same habit: &#8220;I will remember the works of the LORD&#8230;I will meditate on all Your deeds.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Practical steps:<p>&#8211; Set aside moments to recount specific answers to prayer.<p>&#8211; Share these stories aloud so the next generation hears (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-7.htm">Deuteronomy 32:7</a>).<p>&#8211; Let reflection lead to fresh devotion (<a href="/1_samuel/12-24.htm">1 Samuel 12:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/5-10.htm">Judges 5:10</a> invites every segment of Israel&#8212;elite riders, seated judges, and everyday travelers&#8212;to pause and think about the Lord&#8217;s recent rescue. Status, comfort, or routine travel must not dull spiritual alertness; instead, each sphere of life becomes a stage for celebrating God&#8217;s righteous acts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Speak.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">Think of it. </span>or, perhaps, "Meditate <span class= "ital">the </span>song." It is placed in the original in far more forcible position at the end of the verse.<p><span class= "bld">Ye that ride on white asses.</span>--That is, nobles and wealthy (<a href="/judges/10-4.htm" title="And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.">Judges 10:4</a>; <a href="/judges/12-14.htm" title="And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on three score and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.">Judges 12:14</a>). The word can hardly mean "white," because there are no such things as white asses. It means rather "bright-coloured" (<a href="/ezekiel/27-18.htm" title="Damascus was your merchant in the multitude of the wares of your making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.">Ezekiel 27:18</a>), "glossy-skinned," or "dappled" (<span class= "ital">super nitentes asinos, </span>Vulg.). These were the more valuable sort of asses, and were used by the rich and great. It is only because this was not understood among the Greeks and Romans, who despised the ass, that the LXX. and Josephus so often disguise the word in writing for Gentiles, using <span class= "ital">p?lon, "</span>steed," or the general word <span class= "ital">hupozugion, </span>"beast of burden," instead. No incident was more derided among the Gentiles than the riding to Zion of her king, "meek and sitting upon an ass" (<a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm" title="Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, your King comes to you: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding on an ass, and on a colt the foal of an ass.">Zechariah 9:9</a>), (see the <span class= "ital">Life of Christ, </span>2:197). Here though the Alexandrine MS. of the LXX has "on female asses of the South "--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of Ethiopia--we find in other MSS. "on beasts of burden."<p><span class= "bld">Ye that sit in judgment.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">ye that sit on rich divans, </span>though our version follows the Vatican MS. of <span class= "ital">the </span>LXX., the Chaldee, and the Vulgate. The Hebrew is, <span class= "ital">"</span>ye that sit on <span class= "ital">middin," </span>and some Jews understood it to mean "at <span class= "ital">Middin</span>"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>ye inhabitants of the town Middin (which is mentioned in <a href="/joshua/15-61.htm" title="In the wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah,">Joshua 15:61</a>, and which they suppose may have been peculiarly oppressed and insulted by the enemy).
