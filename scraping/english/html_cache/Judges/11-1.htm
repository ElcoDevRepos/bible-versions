This area was known for its rugged terrain and was part of the territory allotted to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. The Gileadites were often involved in conflicts with neighboring peoples, which may have contributed to Jephthah's development as a warrior.<p><b>was a mighty man of valor;</b><br>This phrase highlights Jephthah's reputation as a courageous and skilled warrior. The term "mighty man of valor" is used in the Old Testament to describe individuals who possess exceptional bravery and military prowess, similar to Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>). This sets the stage for Jephthah's role as a deliverer of Israel, chosen by God to lead His people against their oppressors.<p><b>he was the son of a prostitute,</b><br>Jephthah's background is marked by social stigma due to his mother's profession. In ancient Israelite society, being the son of a prostitute would have placed Jephthah at a disadvantage, both socially and legally. This detail emphasizes God's ability to use unlikely individuals for His purposes, reflecting the theme of divine grace and redemption seen throughout Scripture.<p><b>and Gilead was his father.</b><br>Gilead, Jephthah's father, is likely a reference to a prominent man or clan within the region, rather than the geographical area itself. This connection to a notable family or clan may have provided Jephthah with some legitimacy despite his mother's status. The mention of his father underscores the complex family dynamics that play a significant role in Jephthah's story, as his half-brothers later drive him away, fearing he would claim an inheritance (<a href="/judges/11-2.htm">Judges 11:2</a>). This familial conflict sets the stage for Jephthah's eventual rise to leadership and deliverance of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A mighty warrior from Gilead, known for his leadership and military prowess.

This God-given commendation appears before any mention of Jephthah&#8217;s stigma, spotlighting his fitness for the task.<p>&#8226; The same phrase describes Gideon in <a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>, David&#8217;s relatives in <a href="/1_samuel/16-18.htm">1 Samuel 16:18</a>, and warriors in <a href="/2_kings/5-1.htm">2 Kings 5:1</a>.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/11-32.htm">Hebrews 11:32</a> later ranks Jephthah with heroes of faith, confirming his valor was more than physical daring; it flowed from trusting obedience.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word affirms people by what He equips them to do, not by how society labels them. That truth sets the tone for the rest of the chapter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he was the son of a prostitute</b><p>The verse abruptly states Jephthah&#8217;s disadvantage: &#8220;he was the son of a prostitute&#8221; (<a href="/judges/11-1.htm">Judges 11:1</a>).

Compare Rahab in <a href="/bsb/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a> and <a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a> or Tamar in <a href="/bsb/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>; both illustrate God&#8217;s habit of working through marginalized people.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/9-11.htm">Romans 9:11</a> reminds us His purpose stands &#8220;not by works but by Him who calls,&#8221; underscoring that background never thwarts divine choice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Gilead was his father</b><p>Finally, the verse confirms paternity: &#8220;and Gilead was his father&#8221; (<a href="/judges/11-1.htm">Judges 11:1</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/judges/11-2.htm">Judges 11:2</a> details Gilead&#8217;s legitimate sons who later disowned Jephthah, foreshadowing family conflict.<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/25-5.htm">Genesis 25:5-6</a> shows a parallel when Abraham&#8217;s other sons were sent away; yet God remained faithful to each covenant thread.<p>&#8226; By naming Gilead, Scripture roots Jephthah within Israel&#8217;s tribal structure, affirming his legal right to lead despite social scorn.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/11-1.htm">Judges 11:1</a> compresses Jephthah&#8217;s entire biography into a single sentence, balancing honor (&#8220;a mighty man of valor&#8221;) with dishonor (&#8220;son of a prostitute&#8221;). The verse demonstrates that the Lord, who authors every detail, delights to raise overlooked people for pivotal roles.

The answer to these questions depends mainly upon the insoluble problem of the chronology; but we may note (1) that since no <span class= "ital">other </span>Gilead is mentioned, we should naturally infer that <span class= "ital">this </span>is the grandson of Manasseh; and (2) that the fact referred to in the obscure genealogy of <a href="/context/1_chronicles/7-14.htm" title="The sons of Manasseh; Ashriel, whom she bore: (but his concubine the Aramitess bore Machir the father of Gilead:">1Chronicles 7:14-17</a> seems to show that the family of Manasseh had Syrian (Aramean) connections, and Jephthah's mother may have been an Aramitess from the district of Tob.
