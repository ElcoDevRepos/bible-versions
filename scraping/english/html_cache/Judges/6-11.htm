The oak tree is significant in biblical narratives as a place of divine encounters and covenants (e.g., <a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6-7</a>). This setting underlines the sacredness of the moment and the divine appointment taking place.<p><b>that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite</b><br>Joash is identified as an Abiezrite, a clan within the tribe of Manasseh.

The Abiezrites were part of the larger narrative of Israel's struggle against foreign oppression.<p><b>where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress</b><br>Threshing wheat in a winepress is an unusual activity, as threshing typically occurs in open spaces to allow the wind to separate the grain from the chaff. This indicates the dire circumstances and fear of the Midianite oppression, forcing Gideon to work in secrecy and highlighting the desperation and resourcefulness of the Israelites.<p><b>to hide it from the Midianites</b><br>The Midianites were a nomadic people who oppressed Israel during this period, as described earlier in <a href="/judges/6.htm">Judges 6</a>. Their raids devastated the land, leading to widespread fear and poverty.

The Angel of the LORD calmly sits under a village oak, locating Himself in the ordinary life of a fearful family. By naming Joash the Abiezrite and depicting Gideon threshing wheat in a winepress, Scripture highlights divine initiative, humble circumstances, and oppressive conditions. Yet the Lord&#8217;s presence signals impending deliverance: He chooses the weak to shame the strong, transforming hidden survival into open victory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">There came an angel of the Lord.</span>--It is obviously absurd to suppose, as some have done, that a prophet is intended, like the one in <a href="/judges/6-8.htm" title="That the LORD sent a prophet to the children of Israel, which said to them, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;">Judges 6:8</a>. There the word is <span class= "ital">Nabi, </span>here it is <span class= "ital">Maleak-Jehovah, </span>as in <a href="/judges/2-1.htm" title="And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.">Judges 2:1</a>. Josephus, when he says that "a phantasm stood by him in the shape of a youth," is merely actuated by his usual desire to give the story as classical an aspect as possible for his Gentile readers.<p><span class= "bld">Under an oak.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">under the terebinth </span>(<span class= "ital">haelah</span>)<span class= "ital">:--</span>some well-known tree beside the altar in Ophrath. (Comp. <a href="/genesis/35-4.htm" title="And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.">Genesis 35:4</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Ophrah.</span>--This Ophrah was in Western Manasseh. There was another in Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/18-23.htm" title="And Avim, and Pharah, and Ophrah,">Joshua 18:23</a>). The name means "fawn," and the place is identified by Van de Velde with Erfai, near the north border of Ephraim.<p><span class= "bld">Joash the Abi-ezrite.</span>--Joash was the head of the family which descended from Abiezer, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh (<a href="/numbers/26-30.htm" title="These are the sons of Gilead: of Jeezer, the family of the Jeezerites: of Helek, the family of the Helekites:">Numbers 26:30</a>; <a href="/joshua/17-2.htm" title="There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.">Joshua 17:2</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An angel</span>, etc. Rather, the <span class="accented">angel of the Lord</span>, otherwise called "the angel of his presence" (<a href="/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>). In vers. 14, 16, 23, for <span class="accented">the angel of the Lord</span> we have simply <span class="accented">the Lord</span> (see <a href="/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">An oak</span>. Rather <span class="accented">the oak</span>, or <span class="accented">terebinth</span>, as it should be rendered. It was doubtless a well-known tree still standing in the writer's time (see ver. 19). Compare the mention of <span class="accented">the oak</span> (terebinth) at Shechem (<a href="/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>); <span class="accented">the great oak</span> (terebinth) in which Absalom was caught (<a href="/2_samuel/18-9.htm">2 Samuel 18:9</a>); <span class="accented">Deborah's palm tree</span> (<a href="/judges/4-5.htm">Judges 4:5</a>, where see note). Observe the simple way in which the ministration of the angel is introduced, as if it were a matter of course in the eyes of him who is the Lord of the millions of the heavenly host, those ministers of his who do his pleasure. Human scepticism, the twin sister of human selfishness, would blot out all creation except itself. <span class="cmt_word">To hide it</span>, etc. These graphic touches give a lively picture of the straits to which the Israelites were reduced by the Midianite occupation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/6-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the Angel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1443;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;&#8217;a&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4397.htm">Strong's 4397: </a> </span><span class="str2">A messenger, of God, an angel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1438;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
