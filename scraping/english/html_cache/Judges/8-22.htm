This reflects a common pattern in the Book of Judges, where the people turn to a leader after a period of distress. Gideon's leadership is recognized by the people, indicating their desire for stability and continuity. This request marks a significant moment in Israel's history, as it foreshadows their eventual demand for a monarchy, which is later fulfilled in the books of Samuel.<p><b>&#8220;Rule over us&#8212;</b><br>The request for Gideon to rule signifies a shift from the theocratic leadership established by God to a more human-centered governance. This desire for a king-like figure is a precursor to Israel's later rejection of God's direct rule in favor of a human king, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/8.htm">1 Samuel 8</a>. The Israelites' request reflects their longing for a tangible, human leader to provide security and governance.<p><b>you and your son and grandson&#8212;</b><br>The mention of Gideon's son and grandson suggests the establishment of a dynastic rule, which was not part of God's original plan for Israel. This desire for hereditary leadership contrasts with the judgeship, which was not passed down through family lines. The request indicates a misunderstanding of God's intention for Israel's leadership, which was meant to be based on divine appointment rather than human succession.<p><b>for you have saved us from the hand of Midian.&#8221;</b><br>The Israelites attribute their deliverance to Gideon, recognizing his role in their victory over the Midianites. This acknowledgment, however, overlooks the fact that it was ultimately God who delivered them, using Gideon as His instrument. This reflects a recurring theme in Judges, where the people often fail to recognize God's sovereignty and instead focus on human leaders. The phrase highlights the tension between divine deliverance and human agency, a theme that runs throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

After seven years of Midianite oppression (<a href="/judges/6-1.htm">Judges 6:1-6</a>), the people turn to the hero who led them. Much like earlier cycles (<a href="/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18</a>; 3:9-11), they&#8217;re quick to look to the visible deliverer rather than to the LORD who raised him up (<a href="/judges/6-14.htm">Judges 6:14</a>). Their words reveal gratitude but also a misplaced focus: Gideon, not God, becomes center stage.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Rule over us</b><p>Here is Israel&#8217;s first recorded request for a king-like ruler. The desire anticipates the fuller demand made to Samuel generations later: &#8220;Now appoint a king to judge us like all the other nations&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>). Although <a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a> made provision for a future king, God&#8217;s ideal was always His own direct rule (<a href="/1_samuel/12-12.htm">1 Samuel 12:12</a>). By asking Gideon to &#8220;rule,&#8221; Israel is seeking stability and security in human leadership rather than trusting the invisible yet sovereign King (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you and your son and grandson</b><p>The request isn&#8217;t just for immediate leadership; it&#8217;s dynastic. They want a hereditary monarchy anchored in Gideon&#8217;s family&#8212;grandson included. This mirrors the pattern later seen with Saul and David (<a href="/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13-14</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). Israel&#8217;s longing for an enduring human dynasty exposes a deeper issue: their confidence rests in flesh and blood, not in the covenant faithfulness of the LORD who promised to sustain them generation after generation (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for you have saved us</b><p>Their reasoning is practical: &#8220;You delivered us, therefore you deserve the throne.&#8221; But <a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2</a> records God&#8217;s earlier warning: &#8220;The LORD said to Gideon, &#8216;You have too many men for Me to deliver Midian into their hands, lest Israel boast against Me, saying, &#8216;My own hand has saved me.&#8217;&#8217;&#8221; The people now do exactly what God sought to prevent&#8212;crediting salvation to Gideon. Contrast their praise of Gideon with <a href="/psalms/115-1.htm">Psalm 115:1</a>: &#8220;Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to Your name be the glory.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the hand of Midian</b><p>Midian had left Israel &#8220;impoverished&#8221; (<a href="/judges/6-6.htm">Judges 6:6</a>), hiding in caves and losing harvests. God&#8217;s deliverance was total: &#8220;Thus Midian was subdued before the Israelites, so that they could no longer lift their heads&#8221; (<a href="/judges/8-28.htm">Judges 8:28</a>). The phrase &#8220;hand of Midian&#8221; underscores the oppressive grip now broken by divine intervention (<a href="/isaiah/9-4.htm">Isaiah 9:4</a>). Gideon was God&#8217;s chosen instrument, but the victory was the LORD&#8217;s (<a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/8-22.htm">Judges 8:22</a> captures a pivotal temptation: exchanging God&#8217;s kingship for a human dynasty. Israel, relieved and grateful, looks to Gideon to institutionalize their security. The verse highlights three timeless lessons:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s people easily shift credit from the Savior to the servant.<p>&#8226; Human leadership, however impressive, must never replace divine rule.<p>&#8226; True deliverance invites worship, not the coronation of human heroes. Thankful hearts are right; transferring ultimate trust to anyone but God is not.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Then the men of Israel.</span>--Here begins the third great phase of the life of Gideon. which was characterised by his noblest act--the refusal of the kingdom--and his most questionable act--the setting up of a schismatic worship.<p><span class= "bld">Rule thou over us.</span>--The energy and success of Gideon had shown them the advantage of united action under one great leader; but they forgot that Gideon had received a special call from God. and that, as Gideon reminded them. God was their king. Yet no doubt the memory of Gideon deepened the wish which Samuel was afterwards commanded to grant (<a href="/context/2_samuel/8-5.htm" title="And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.">2Samuel 8:5-7</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/12-12.htm" title="For you did it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.">2Samuel 12:12</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/12-17.htm" title="And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.">2Samuel 12:17</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22, 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rule thou</span>, etc. The gratitude of Israel to their great deliverer, added to a sense that it would be for their own security, and to a desire, already perhaps beginning to he felt, to be like the nations around them (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>), naturally led to the offer, "Rule thou over us." But the time predicted by Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14, 15</a>) was not yet come. And so Gideon returned an answer replete with moderation and piety: "I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the Lord shall rule over you" (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>;
