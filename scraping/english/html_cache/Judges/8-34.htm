Throughout Judges, the Israelites repeatedly forget God's past deliverances and fall into idolatry and sin. This forgetfulness is not merely a lapse in memory but a willful neglect of God's commandments and covenant. It serves as a warning about the dangers of spiritual complacency and the importance of continual remembrance and gratitude.<p><b>the LORD their God</b><br>The use of "LORD" in all capital letters signifies the covenant name of God, Yahweh, emphasizing His personal relationship with Israel. This relationship is foundational to Israel's identity and history, as God chose them as His people and delivered them from Egypt. The phrase underscores the gravity of Israel's forgetfulness, as it is not just any god they are neglecting, but their covenant God who has shown them steadfast love and faithfulness.<p><b>who had delivered them</b><br>This refers to God's repeated acts of salvation throughout Israel's history, particularly during the Exodus and the conquest of Canaan. The term "delivered" is significant, as it denotes God's active intervention in rescuing His people from oppression and danger. This deliverance is a central theme in the Old Testament, foreshadowing the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who saves humanity from sin and death.<p><b>from the hands of all their enemies</b><br>The phrase "from the hands of all their enemies" indicates the comprehensive nature of God's deliverance. In the context of Judges, this includes various oppressors such as the Midianites, Canaanites, and Philistines. Each deliverance was a demonstration of God's power and faithfulness, reinforcing His role as the protector and defender of Israel. This also points to the spiritual reality of God delivering His people from spiritual enemies, a theme echoed in the New Testament.<p><b>on every side</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the totality and completeness of God's protection. The Israelites were surrounded by hostile nations, yet God provided deliverance on every side, showcasing His omnipotence and sovereignty. It serves as a reminder of God's ability to protect and sustain His people in all circumstances, a truth that is applicable to believers today who face various trials and adversities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon (Jerubbaal)</a></b><br>A judge of Israel who led the Israelites to victory over the Midianites with God's guidance.

Their very name (&#8220;he strives with God,&#8221; <a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>) reminds us of a relationship formed by God&#8217;s initiative. Yet Judges repeatedly records a cycle in which these same people:<p>&#8226; receive grace (<a href="/judges/2-16.htm">Judges 2:16</a>)<p>&#8226; grow complacent (2:17)<p>&#8226; fall into idolatry (2:19)<p>This verse signals another turn of that sorrowful wheel, echoing earlier warnings in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a> and <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a> that Israel&#8217;s identity is inseparable from loyalty to the LORD.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Failed to remember</b><p>The statement &#8220;failed to remember&#8221; exposes the heart issue. Forgetting is never mere mental lapse; it is covenant breach (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-21.htm">Psalm 106:21</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-6.htm">Hosea 13:6</a>).<p>Consequences of such forgetfulness:<p>&#8226; loss of gratitude, leading to self-reliance (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11-14</a>)<p>&#8226; moral drift toward surrounding cultures (<a href="/judges/8-33.htm">Judges 8:33</a>)<p>&#8226; forfeiture of blessings tied to obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-17.htm">Deuteronomy 30:17-18</a>)<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The LORD their God</b><p>The Hebrew text underscores the personal, covenant name&#8212;YHWH&#8212;joined to &#8220;their God.&#8221; He is not a regional deity but the One who bound Himself to them by oath (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-6.htm">Deuteronomy 5:6</a>). The phrase re-centers the verse on His unwavering character even while His people waiver.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who had delivered them</b><p>Past victories are recited to stir present faith. Gideon&#8217;s triumph over Midian (<a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7-22</a>) was unmistakably God&#8217;s work&#8212;&#8220;The LORD said to Gideon, &#8216;I will save you with the three hundred men&#8217; &#8221; (7:7). The pattern matches other rescues: David from Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-37.htm">1 Samuel 17:37</a>) and Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From the hands of all their enemies</b><p>&#8220;Hands&#8221; evokes power and oppression. God had broken every grip&#8212;Canaanite, Midianite, Ammonite&#8212;just as He promised in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10</a> and fulfilled in <a href="/joshua/21-44.htm">Joshua 21:44</a>. The plural &#8220;enemies&#8221; stresses that no threat lay outside His sovereign reach (<a href="/psalms/18-17.htm">Psalm 18:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On every side</b><p>Total security surrounded the nation (<a href="/2_samuel/7-1.htm">2 Samuel 7:1</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/15-15.htm">2 Chronicles 15:15</a>). Safety &#8220;on every side&#8221; should have stirred wholehearted worship, yet comfort often bred compromise. The phrase is a sober reminder that prosperity tests allegiance as surely as hardship does (<a href="/proverbs/30-8.htm">Proverbs 30:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/judges/8-34.htm">Judges 8:34</a> indicts Israel for spiritual amnesia. Though the LORD had secured them completely, they shrugged off His past mercies and severed the link between memory and obedience. The verse warns every generation: deliverance forgotten becomes devotion forsaken. Remembering God&#8217;s faithful acts fuels present faithfulness, anchoring hearts to the Deliverer who still surrounds His people on every side.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Remembered not the Lord their God.</span>--According to <a href="/judges/9-46.htm" title="And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.">Judges 9:46</a>, they looked on Baal as their <span class= "ital">Elohim, </span>and forgot that Jehovah was the one God.
