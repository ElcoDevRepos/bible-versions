The number "three thousand" suggests a significant concern for their safety and the need to confront Samson with a large group, highlighting the fear and respect Samson commanded. The "cave at the rock of Etam" is a specific location, possibly a stronghold or a place of refuge. Etam is mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/4-32.htm">1 Chronicles 4:32</a> as a town in the territory of Judah, suggesting a strategic or symbolic significance. This setting underscores the tension between Samson and his own people, who are under Philistine oppression.<p><b>and they asked Samson, &#8220;Do you not realize that the Philistines rule over us?</b><br>This question reflects the subjugation of the Israelites under Philistine control during this period. The Philistines were a dominant force in the region, and their rule over Israel is a recurring theme in the Book of Judges. The men of Judah's question reveals their resignation to this oppression and their fear of further retaliation. It also highlights a lack of faith or understanding of God's deliverance through Samson, who was raised as a judge to begin to deliver Israel from the Philistines (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>).<p><b>What have you done to us?&#8221;</b><br>The men of Judah express concern over the consequences of Samson's actions, fearing retribution from the Philistines. This question indicates a communal mindset where individual actions are seen in the context of their impact on the entire community. It also shows a lack of unity and support for Samson's divinely appointed mission, contrasting with the expected solidarity among the tribes of Israel.<p><b>&#8220;I have done to them what they did to me,&#8221; he replied.</b><br>Samson's response is one of personal retribution, reflecting the lex talionis principle, or the law of retaliation, which is seen in the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23-25</a>). His actions are driven by personal vendetta rather than a collective deliverance strategy. This phrase also highlights Samson's flawed character, as he often acts out of personal motives rather than divine guidance. Despite this, God uses Samson's actions to fulfill His purposes, illustrating how God can work through imperfect individuals to achieve His plans. Samson's life can be seen as a type of Christ in that he is a deliverer of Israel, though imperfect, pointing to the ultimate deliverer, Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfills God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his extraordinary strength, given by God, and his complex relationship with the Philistines.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_judah.htm">Men of Judah</a></b><br>The Israelites from the tribe of Judah who confronted Samson, fearing repercussions from the Philistines.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>The ruling oppressors over Israel at the time, known for their enmity with the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cave_in_the_rock_of_etam.htm">Cave in the Rock of Etam</a></b><br>The location where Samson took refuge, symbolizing a place of both physical and spiritual retreat.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah's_submission.htm">Judah's Submission</a></b><br>The event highlights the Israelites' subjugation and their fear of the Philistines, leading them to confront Samson.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_sovereignty.htm">Understanding God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Despite the Philistines' rule, God is ultimately in control.

Scripture presents a cycle: Israel sins, God allows oppression, and He raises a deliverer (<a href="/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18-19</a>). Samson&#8217;s personal vendetta fits into that larger divine pattern of stirring Israel to confront their oppressors (compare <a href="/judges/14-4.htm">Judges 14:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Three thousand men of Judah went to the cave at the rock of Etam</b><p>&#8226; The sheer number reflects fear rather than honor; they believe Samson is dangerous.<p>&#8226; Judah&#8217;s choice to negotiate, not rally behind Samson, shows spiritual timidity&#8212;unlike later times when God&#8217;s people would gather behind David against Philistine giants (<a href="/1_samuel/17-52.htm">1 Samuel 17:52</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;rock of Etam&#8221; pictures Samson isolated from his own tribe, yet set apart by God, similar to Elijah in a cave (<a href="/1_kings/19-9.htm">1 Kings 19:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They asked Samson, &#8220;Do you not realize that the Philistines rule over us?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Judah has accepted servitude as normal. In contrast, God&#8217;s covenant promised victory when obedient (<a href="/leviticus/26-7.htm">Leviticus 26:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; This mindset echoes earlier compromises, such as the tribe of Dan settling for partial inheritance (<a href="/judges/18-1.htm">Judges 18:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Samson&#8217;s presence exposes their complacency; deliverance often begins when God disturbs false peace (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What have you done to us?</b><p>&#8226; Their question centers on self-preservation. Rather than, &#8220;How can we join God&#8217;s deliverance?&#8221; they blame the one acting in faith.<p>&#8226; Similar unbelief confronted Moses (<a href="/exodus/14-11.htm">Exodus 14:11-12</a>) and later Jesus (<a href="/john/11-47.htm">John 11:47-48</a>).<p>&#8226; The text shows that fear can turn brethren into accusers, yet God still advances His plan through the faithful remnant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I have done to them what they did to me,&#8221; he replied</b><p>&#8226; Samson&#8217;s reply appeals to justice: measure for measure. The law allowed proportional retribution (<a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23-25</a>).<p>&#8226; While personal, Samson&#8217;s acts also fulfill God&#8217;s purpose of striking the Philistines (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>).<p>&#8226; His words foreshadow the ultimate divine principle: God will repay oppressors according to their deeds (<a href="/revelation/18-6.htm">Revelation 18:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/15-11.htm">Judges 15:11</a> reveals a timid Judah confronting its God-appointed deliverer. The tribe&#8217;s accommodation to Philistine rule contrasts with Samson&#8217;s zeal for righteous retaliation. Their question uncovers fear; his answer exposes the justice of resisting oppression. Through this exchange, Scripture shows that deliverance often begins with one believer&#8217;s bold obedience amid widespread compromise, assuring us that God remains faithful to oppose tyranny and fulfill His covenant promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Went to the top of the rock Etam.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">went down to the cave of the rock Etam. </span>They would easily gain information as to Samson's hiding-place.<p><span class= "bld">What is this that thou hast done unto us?</span>--The abject condition into which the Lion Tribe had sunk can best be estimated by this <span class= "ital">reproach </span>against the national hero, and still more by their baseness in betraying him.

The abject state to which they were reduced is shown By their complaint of Samson, What is this that thou hast done unto us?" instead of hailing him as a deliverer. <span class="cmt_word">As they did unto me</span>, etc. It is instructive to read Samson's defence of himself in the very words used by the Philistines in ver. 10. "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." There is no end to rendering "evil for evil." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/15-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In response, three</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#183;&#353;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7969.htm">Strong's 7969: </a> </span><span class="str2">Three, third, thrice</span><br /><br /><span class="word">thousand</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1508;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;l&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_505.htm">Strong's 505: </a> </span><span class="str2">A thousand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Judah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;&#183;h&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
