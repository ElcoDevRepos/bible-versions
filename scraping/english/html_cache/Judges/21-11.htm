It reflects the seriousness with which they approached the need to address the sin and moral decay that had led to the conflict. The phrase indicates a command that is not open to negotiation, emphasizing the gravity of the situation and the need for decisive action.<p><b>Devote to destruction every male:</b><br>The term "devote to destruction" is a translation of the Hebrew word "herem," which means to completely destroy or consecrate something to God by destroying it. This concept is seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>). It reflects the idea of purging evil from among the people to maintain holiness and obedience to God's commands. The focus on males here is significant, as it was the men of Benjamin who had committed the grievous sin that led to the conflict.<p><b>As well as every female who has had relations with a man:</b><br>This part of the command extends the destruction to women who have been sexually active, likely to ensure that no remnant of the tribe's sinful practices remains. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, sexual purity was closely tied to covenant faithfulness. The inclusion of women in this directive underscores the comprehensive nature of the judgment and the desire to prevent any continuation of the tribe's previous behavior. This reflects the broader biblical theme of purity and the need to remove sin from the community, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12-18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel who are seeking to address the issue of the tribe of Benjamin's near extinction after a civil war.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_benjamin.htm">Tribe of Benjamin</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, nearly wiped out due to a conflict with the other tribes over a grievous sin committed in Gibeah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jabesh-gilead.htm">Jabesh-gilead</a></b><br>A city whose inhabitants did not join the assembly of Israel at Mizpah, leading to their being targeted for destruction.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/civil_war.htm">Civil War</a></b><br>The internal conflict among the tribes of Israel, specifically between the tribe of Benjamin and the other tribes, resulting in significant loss of life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mizpah.htm">Mizpah</a></b><br>The gathering place for the Israelites where they took an oath against giving their daughters to the Benjamites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>The events in <a href="/bsb/judges/21.htm">Judges 21</a> highlight the severe consequences of sin and disobedience, both on a personal and communal level.

(Comp. <a href="/context/leviticus/27-21.htm" title="But the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, shall be holy to the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.">Leviticus 27:21-28</a>; <a href="/context/numbers/21-2.htm" title="And Israel vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.">Numbers 21:2-3</a>.) The words are easy to read; it is needless to dwell on the horror of the massacre which they describe. We are dealing throughout with the fierce passions of men living in times of gross spiritual darkness; for we cannot doubt that the oath against Jabesh-Gilead was carried out, though the writer drops a veil over all but the result. The vow of destruction (<span class= "ital">cherem, anathema, </span><a href="/context/leviticus/27-28.htm" title="Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he has, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.">Leviticus 27:28-29</a>) was quite different from the vow of devotion (<span class= "ital">neder</span>) and the vow of abstinence (<span class= "ital">corban</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p>(11) <span class= "bld">To dance in dances.</span>--Possibly the dances of the vintage festival. There is a fountain in a narrow dale, at a little distance from Shiloh, which was very probably the scene of this event. It is a needless conjecture that the feast was the Passover, and the dances a commemoration of the defeat of the Egyptians, like those of Miriam. There seems to have been no regular town at Shiloh; at least, no extensive ruins are traceable. It was probably a community like the Beth-Micah (see Note on <a href="/judges/18-2.htm" title="And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.">Judges 18:2</a>), which was mainly connected with the service of the Tabernacle. The "daughters of Shiloh" would naturally include many women who were in one way or other employed in various functions about the Tabernacle, and not only those who came there to worship (<a href="/1_samuel/2-22.htm" title="Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">1Samuel 2:22</a>, where "assembled" should be rendered <span class= "ital">served, </span>as in <a href="/numbers/4-23.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shall you number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:23</a>; "the handmaid" of the priests is mentioned in <a href="/2_samuel/17-17.htm" title="Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.">2Samuel 17:17</a>).
