The Israelites, who were meant to serve God alone, found themselves serving a foreign king due to their disobedience and idolatry. This pattern of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance is a recurring theme in the Book of Judges. It highlights the consequences of turning away from God and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>Eglon king of Moab</b><br>Eglon was the king of Moab, a nation descended from Lot, Abraham's nephew. The Moabites were often in conflict with Israel. Eglon's rule over Israel signifies a reversal of fortunes, as Moab had previously been subdued by Israel under Moses (<a href="/numbers/21-26.htm">Numbers 21:26-30</a>). This subjugation serves as a reminder of the Israelites' failure to fully conquer and maintain control over the Promised Land as commanded by God.<p><b>eighteen years</b><br>The duration of eighteen years signifies a significant period of suffering and oppression. It reflects the severity of Israel's disobedience and the patience of God, who allows His people to experience the consequences of their actions before raising a deliverer.
