This grief reflects the deep familial and covenantal bonds within the twelve tribes of Israel. Historically, the tribe of Benjamin was nearly annihilated due to a civil war sparked by the grievous sin in Gibeah (Judges 19-20). The mourning indicates a realization of the severity of their actions and the loss of a brotherly tribe. This grief can be compared to the mourning over lost unity and fellowship within the body of Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>, where if one part suffers, every part suffers with it.<p><b>because the LORD had made a void in the tribes of Israel</b><br>The phrase acknowledges divine sovereignty in the events that transpired. The "void" or gap in the tribes signifies the absence of Benjamin, highlighting the consequences of sin and disobedience. This void serves as a reminder of the importance of unity and the dangers of internal strife. Theologically, it underscores the belief that God allows certain events to unfold as a means of discipline or to fulfill His purposes, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>. The void also foreshadows the need for restoration and reconciliation, themes central to the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who came to restore what was lost and to reconcile humanity to God (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel who had gathered to address the issue of the tribe of Benjamin after the civil war.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tribe_of_benjamin.htm">The Tribe of Benjamin</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, nearly annihilated due to the conflict arising from the incident at Gibeah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is acknowledged as having allowed the void or gap in the tribes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mizpah.htm">Mizpah</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites had gathered to discuss the fate of Benjamin and seek a solution.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_civil_war.htm">The Civil War</a></b><br>The conflict between the tribe of Benjamin and the other Israelite tribes, resulting in significant loss and the near extinction of Benjamin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/grief_and_compassion.htm">Grief and Compassion</a></b><br>The Israelites' grief for Benjamin highlights the importance of compassion and empathy, even towards those who have erred.
