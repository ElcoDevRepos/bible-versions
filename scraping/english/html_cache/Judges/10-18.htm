Gilead was known for its balm, a valuable commodity in ancient times. The rulers' discussion reflects the decentralized leadership structure common in Israel during the time of the Judges, where tribal leaders or elders often made decisions. This setting is during a period of oppression by the Ammonites, highlighting the need for a strong leader to deliver Israel, a recurring theme in the Book of Judges.<p><b>Whoever will launch the attack against the Ammonites</b><br>The Ammonites were descendants of Lot and often in conflict with Israel. This phrase suggests a call for a military leader to initiate an offensive against them. The Ammonites' oppression of Israel is part of a cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance seen throughout Judges. The call for a leader to "launch the attack" implies a proactive and courageous action, reminiscent of other judges like Gideon and Deborah, who were called to deliver Israel from its enemies.<p><b>will be the head of all who live in Gilead</b><br>This promise of leadership over Gilead to whoever leads the attack reflects the urgent need for deliverance and the willingness to reward military leadership with political authority. It foreshadows the rise of Jephthah, who becomes the leader despite his outcast status, illustrating God's use of unexpected individuals to fulfill His purposes. This offer of leadership parallels the anointing of future kings in Israel, where military success often led to political power, as seen with King David. The phrase also underscores the theme of God raising leaders to deliver His people, a type of Christ as the ultimate deliverer and head of the Church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leaders_of_gilead.htm">Leaders of Gilead</a></b><br>These were the tribal leaders or elders of the region of Gilead, which was located east of the Jordan River.
