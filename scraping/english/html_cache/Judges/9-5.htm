This location is significant as it was the center of Gideon's family and his legacy. The act of returning to his father's house indicates a claim to familial authority and inheritance. Ophrah is situated in the territory of Manasseh, highlighting the tribal dynamics at play during this period of the Judges.<p><b>and on one stone murdered his seventy brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal.</b><br>The use of "one stone" suggests a methodical and possibly ritualistic execution, emphasizing the brutality and premeditated nature of the act. The number seventy is symbolic in the Bible, often representing completeness or totality, indicating the extent of the massacre. This act of fratricide is a stark contrast to the legacy of Gideon, who was a judge and deliverer of Israel. The murder of his brothers reflects the moral and spiritual decline in Israel during the time of the Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><b>But Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, survived,</b><br>Jotham's survival is significant as it introduces a remnant theme, common in biblical narratives, where God preserves a faithful remnant despite widespread apostasy or destruction. Jotham's escape sets the stage for his later actions and pronouncements, which serve as a prophetic voice against Abimelech's tyranny. The preservation of the youngest son echoes other biblical stories where the youngest is chosen or preserved for a special purpose, such as David or Joseph.<p><b>because he hid himself.</b><br>Jotham's act of hiding indicates wisdom and discernment, qualities that are often attributed to those whom God uses for His purposes. His survival is not attributed to chance but to his prudent action, suggesting divine providence at work. This act of hiding can be seen as a parallel to other biblical figures who were hidden for protection, such as Moses or Jesus, emphasizing God's sovereignty and protection over His chosen instruments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (Jerubbaal) and a concubine from Shechem.
