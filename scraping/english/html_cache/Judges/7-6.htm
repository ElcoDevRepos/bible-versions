The act of lapping water with their hands to their mouths is significant as it demonstrates vigilance and readiness, qualities necessary for the battle ahead. The number three hundred is symbolic of God's power and provision, as it is a small number compared to the Midianite army, emphasizing that victory comes from the Lord, not human strength. This selection process is reminiscent of God's choosing of the faithful remnant throughout Scripture, such as the 7,000 in Israel who did not bow to Baal (<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>).<p><b>all the others knelt to drink.</b><br>The contrast between the two groups is stark. Those who knelt to drink were less alert, focusing on their immediate needs rather than the potential threat. This distinction serves as a metaphor for spiritual readiness and the importance of being watchful, as echoed in the New Testament exhortations to be vigilant (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>). The act of kneeling, while not inherently negative, in this context suggests a lack of preparedness, which is crucial in the spiritual battles faced by believers. This separation of the vigilant from the complacent is a recurring theme in Scripture, illustrating the need for discernment and readiness in following God's call.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>The judge chosen by God to deliver Israel from the Midianites.
