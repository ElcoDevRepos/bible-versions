It is significant in biblical history as the hometown of King Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/10-26.htm">1 Samuel 10:26</a>). The decision to lodge in Gibeah rather than a foreign city like Jebus (Jerusalem) reflects the expectation of hospitality among fellow Israelites. This expectation is rooted in the cultural and religious norms of ancient Israel, where hospitality was a sacred duty (<a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18:1-8</a>). The failure of Gibeah's inhabitants to offer hospitality foreshadows the moral decay and lawlessness depicted in the subsequent narrative.<p><b>The Levite went in and sat down in the city square,</b><br>The Levite's presence in the city square indicates a common practice in ancient times where travelers would wait in public spaces to be offered lodging by local residents. This practice is seen in other biblical accounts, such as in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19:1-3</a> with Lot in Sodom. The Levite's role as a religious figure adds a layer of expectation for hospitality, as Levites were set apart for religious duties and often relied on the generosity of others (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-19.htm">Deuteronomy 12:19</a>).<p><b>but no one would take them into his home for the night.</b><br>The refusal of the townspeople to offer hospitality is a stark violation of cultural norms and highlights the moral decline in Israel during the time of the Judges, a period characterized by the repeated phrase, "In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). This lack of hospitality contrasts sharply with the expected behavior of Israelites and serves as a prelude to the tragic events that follow. The narrative echoes the inhospitable actions of Sodom, drawing a parallel between Gibeah and the infamous city destroyed for its wickedness (Genesis 19). This incident underscores the need for righteous leadership and foreshadows the eventual establishment of monarchy in Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A central figure in this account, the Levite is traveling with his concubine and servant.

As <a href="/psalms/15-1.htm">Psalm 15:1-5</a> describes, a righteous person &#8220;does not slander&#8221; and &#8220;honors those who fear the LORD&#8221;&#8212;including strangers at the gate.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but no one would take them into his home for the night</b><p>&#8211; The deliberate refusal highlights a spiritual crisis. In Israel, withholding hospitality was a breach of both social duty and divine command (<a href="/job/31-32.htm">Job 31:32</a>).<p>&#8211; The silence of Gibeah contrasts sharply with other biblical scenes: Rahab risked her life for Israelite spies (<a href="/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1-4</a>), and the Good Samaritan aided an injured stranger (<a href="/luke/10-33.htm">Luke 10:33-34</a>).<p>&#8211; By noting that &#8220;no one&#8221; responded, Scripture stresses collective guilt. The entire town is implicated, foreshadowing the violent wickedness that will unfold (<a href="/judges/19-22.htm">Judges 19:22-25</a>) and echoing the judgment that fell on Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-4.htm">Genesis 19:4-5</a>).<p>&#8211; The phrase prepares readers for the refrain of Judges: &#8220;In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes&#8221; (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>), revealing the deep need for righteous leadership and ultimately pointing forward to the King of kings (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/19-15.htm">Judges 19:15</a> exposes Gibeah&#8217;s failure to practice covenantal hospitality, signaling the spiritual decay of Israel during the time of the judges. The Levite&#8217;s trust in fellow Israelites is met with chilling indifference, setting the stage for the chapter&#8217;s tragic events. This verse reminds believers today that genuine faith expresses itself in welcoming and protecting the vulnerable, reflecting the Lord who graciously receives all who seek refuge in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">In a street.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">in the open place </span>(<span class= "ital">Rechob</span>)--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the square or market-place of the city, often a space <span class= "ital">outside </span>the walls (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-16.htm" title="And you shall gather all the spoil of it into the middle of the street thereof, and shall burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD your God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again.">Deuteronomy 13:16</a>).
