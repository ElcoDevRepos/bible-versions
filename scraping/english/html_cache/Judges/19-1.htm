The absence of a king suggests a period of decentralized leadership, where the tribes of Israel were governed by judges. This era is characterized by the repeated cycle of Israel's disobedience, oppression by enemies, cries for deliverance, and God raising a judge to save them. The lack of centralized authority often led to moral and social chaos, as seen in the events of <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19-21</a>. This phrase also foreshadows the eventual demand for a monarchy in Israel, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/8.htm">1 Samuel 8</a>.<p><b>a Levite who lived in the remote hill country of Ephraim</b><br>The Levites were a tribe set apart for religious duties, serving in the Tabernacle and later the Temple. This Levite's residence in the hill country of Ephraim, rather than in a Levitical city, may indicate a departure from his expected role. Ephraim was a significant tribe in Israel, often associated with leadership and influence. The geographical setting in the hill country suggests isolation, which may contribute to the Levite's actions and the unfolding narrative. The Levite's presence in Ephraim connects to other biblical stories, such as the division of the kingdom under Jeroboam, an Ephraimite.<p><b>took for himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah</b><br>A concubine was a secondary wife, often of lower status, who did not have the same rights as a primary wife. This practice, while culturally accepted in ancient times, often led to familial strife and complications, as seen in the stories of Abraham, Jacob, and David. Bethlehem in Judah is significant as the future birthplace of King David and Jesus Christ, highlighting the town's importance in biblical history. The mention of Bethlehem may also serve to contrast the moral decay in Israel with the future hope of a righteous king. The Levite's choice to take a concubine from Bethlehem may reflect the inter-tribal relationships and social dynamics of the time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of God's chosen people, who at this time had no centralized leadership or king, leading to a period of moral and social chaos.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/levite.htm">Levite</a></b><br>A member of the tribe of Levi, set apart for religious duties.

It appears from <a href="/judges/20-27.htm">Judges 20:27, 28</a> that the events narrated in these three last chapters of the Book of Judges happened in the lifetime of Phinehas, and while the ark was at Shiloh (see <a href="/judges/20-27.htm">Judges 20:27</a>, note). Phinehas evidently outlived Joshua (<a href="/joshua/24-29.htm">Joshua 24:29, 33</a>), though there is no evidence to show how long. The events in these chapters must have occurred in the interval between the death of Joshua and the death of Phinehas. <span class="cmt_word">A certain Levite</span>, etc. It is a curious coincidence that both the Levite whose sad story is here told, and the Levite the son of Gershom of whom we read in the preceding chapters, were sojourners in the hill country of Ephraim, and also closely connected with Bethlehem-judah. Perhaps the legitimate inference (see ver. 18, and <a href="/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26, 27</a>) is that in both cases the Levites were drawn to Ephraim by the ark being at Shiloh, and also that there was a colony of Levites at Bethlehem-judah. Whether there was any connection between the presence of Levites at Bethlehem and the annual sacrifice at Bethlehem which existed in David's time, and which argues the existence of a high place there, can only be a matter of conjecture (see <a href="/1_samuel/9-13.htm">1 Samuel 9:13</a>, and 1 Samuel 20:29). All we can say is that there was the universal prevalence of high-place worship during the time of the judges, and that the services of Levites were sought after in connection with it (<a href="/judges/17-13.htm">Judges 17:13</a>). On the side. Hebrew, sides. In the masculine form the word means the hip and upper part of the thigh; in the feminine, as here, it is applied only to inanimate objects, as a house, the temple, a cave, the north, a pit, a country, etc., and is used in the dual number (see <a href="/1_samuel/24-4.htm">1 Samuel 24:4</a>; <a href="/1_kings/6-16.htm">1 Kings 6:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/48-3.htm">Psalm 48:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/128-3.htm">Psalm 128:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/32-23.htm">Ezekiel 32:23</a>, etc.). It means the innermost, hindmost, furthermost parts. Its application here to the northern side of Ephraim seems to imply that the writer wrote in the south, probably in Judah. <span class="cmt_word">A concubine</span>.
