The location is near the spring of Harod, which is significant as it is a natural water source in the Jezreel Valley, a strategic area for military campaigns. This setting emphasizes the need for divine guidance in choosing the right men for battle, as the Israelites are vastly outnumbered. The act of bringing the men to the water symbolizes a test of faith and obedience, reminiscent of other biblical tests such as Abraham's test with Isaac.<p><b>and the LORD said to him</b><br>The direct communication from the LORD to Gideon highlights the divine involvement in Israel's deliverance. This phrase underscores the theme of God&#8217;s sovereignty and His role as the ultimate leader of Israel. It reflects the pattern seen throughout the Old Testament where God provides specific instructions to His chosen leaders, such as Moses and Joshua, ensuring that His plans are fulfilled.<p><b>&#8220;Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog</b><br>This instruction serves as a divine test to distinguish between the men. Lapping water like a dog suggests vigilance and readiness, as these men would remain alert to their surroundings while drinking. This method of selection is unique and emphasizes God's unconventional ways of achieving His purposes, often using the weak or the few to demonstrate His power, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>.<p><b>from those who kneel to drink.&#8221;</b><br>Kneeling to drink indicates a lack of readiness and awareness, as these men would be more vulnerable to surprise attacks. This separation process is not based on human wisdom but on divine criteria, illustrating that God&#8217;s ways are higher than human understanding (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). The distinction between the two groups foreshadows the reduction of Gideon's army, ensuring that the victory would be attributed to God alone, not human strength or numbers. This principle is echoed in <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>, where it is stated that success comes "not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit," says the LORD Almighty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

Gideon&#8217;s instant obedience, the Lord&#8217;s direct word, the unexpected lapping test, and the contrast with kneeling all serve one purpose: to display that victory belongs to the Lord, not human strength. By choosing a handful of alert, committed men, God assures Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;that He delights to work through those who listen, stay vigilant, and trust His power alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue.</span>--Josephus (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 6, ? 4) says that Gideon led them down to the spring in the fiercest heat of the noonday, and that he judged those to be the bravest who flung themselves down and drank, and those to be the cowards who lapped the water hastily and tumultuously. Theodoret also thinks that the Divine aid was shown by the fact that the greatest cowards were chosen. This may have been a Jewish legend (Hagadah); but it seems more reasonable to suppose that greater self-control would be shown by stooping and drinking the water out of the hand than by flinging themselves at full length to drink, which would be the natural instinct of a thirsty man. Rashi says that those who went down on their knees to drink were secret <span class= "ital">idolators, </span>who had "bowed the knee to Baal" (<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm" title="Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which has not kissed him.">1Kings 19:18</a>).<p><span class= "bld">As a dog lappeth.</span>--Some commentators fancy that this is an allusion to Egyptian dogs, who, out of fear for the Nile crocodiles, only venture to lap the water while they are running along the banks.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The water</span>, viz., of the well or spring of Harod. <span class="cmt_word">That lappeth</span>, etc. It showed a much more soldierly and self-controlled spirit just to quench the thirst by lapping the water out of the palm of the hand, than to kneel down and drink without stint out of the spring itself.
