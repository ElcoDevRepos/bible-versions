In <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>, Gideon's army is divided into three companies, a strategic move that reflects military tactics of the time, allowing for surprise and confusion among the enemy. The number three can also symbolize completeness or divine perfection in biblical numerology.<p><b>and shattered their jars</b><br>The jars, likely made of clay, were used to conceal the torches until the right moment. The breaking of the jars symbolizes the revelation of God's power and the suddenness of His deliverance. This act of breaking jars can be seen as a metaphor for the breaking of earthly vessels to reveal divine light, reminiscent of <a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>, where believers are described as jars of clay containing the treasure of the gospel.<p><b>Holding the torches in their left hands</b><br>The torches represent the light of God, guiding and illuminating the path of His people. In the context of battle, the light would have been a psychological weapon, creating fear and confusion among the Midianites. The left hand, often considered the weaker hand, holding the torch, signifies that the true strength and victory come from God, not human might.<p><b>and the horns in their right hands</b><br>The right hand is traditionally associated with power and authority in biblical literature (<a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>). By holding the horns in their right hands, the Israelites demonstrate that their authority and power in this battle come from God. The simultaneous use of light and sound would have amplified the perceived size and strength of Gideon's army.<p><b>they shouted, &#8220;A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!&#8221;</b><br>This battle cry acknowledges both divine intervention and human leadership. The phrase emphasizes that the victory belongs to the LORD, yet it also recognizes Gideon's role as God's chosen instrument. This dual acknowledgment is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God works through human agents to accomplish His purposes (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>). The sword, though not physically present, symbolizes the power and judgment of God, reminiscent of the "sword of the Spirit" in <a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

The same God who toppled Jericho now confronts Midian.<p>- The clay jars hid the torches until the crucial moment; once smashed, sudden light filled the camp. It&#8217;s an acted-out sermon: the weakness of clay yields to the brilliance of God&#8217;s deliverance (compare <a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>&#8212;&#8220;We have this treasure in jars of clay&#8221;).<p>- By faith they obeyed the exact plan the LORD had given (<a href="/judges/7-9.htm">Judges 7:9-18</a>). Obedience, not numbers, is what wins God&#8217;s battles.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Holding the torches in their left hands and the horns in their right hands</b><p>- Both hands are occupied; there is no room for swords. Their posture declares dependence on God alone, echoing <a href="/2_chronicles/20-17.htm">2 Chronicles 20:17</a>: &#8220;You need not fight this battle; take your positions, stand firm, and see the salvation of the LORD.&#8221;<p>- Torches blaze in the night, a vivid picture of the LORD as light: &#8220;The LORD is my light and my salvation&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>). Jesus later tells His followers, &#8220;You are the light of the world&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a>). When God delivers, His people shine.<p>- A single torch and trumpet would normally represent a whole unit of soldiers. Three hundred torches and trumpets therefore make the Midianites assume a vast army surrounds them&#8212;God turns weakness into strategic advantage.<p>- The scene invites personal application: keep both hands full with God-given responsibilities&#8212;proclaim (trumpet) and shine (torch)&#8212;and trust Him to handle the battle&#8217;s outcome.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they shouted, &#8220;A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!&#8221;</b><p>- The cry puts the LORD first. Gideon is named second, underscoring that any human leader is merely God&#8217;s instrument (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>: &#8220;the battle is the LORD&#8217;s&#8221;).<p>- Irony: the men hold no swords, yet they proclaim one. The real &#8220;sword&#8221; is God&#8217;s decisive power, later pictured as &#8220;the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>).<p>- Their unified shout causes panic among the Midianites, who &#8220;turned their swords against one another&#8221; (<a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>). When God fights, the enemy self-destructs&#8212;see also <a href="/isaiah/31-8.htm">Isaiah 31:8</a>.<p>- By linking Gideon&#8217;s name with the LORD&#8217;s, the cry also signals loyalty. God often pairs His work with willing servants (<a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>), showing that divine sovereignty and human responsibility coexist.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/7-20.htm">Judges 7:20</a> portrays an unlikely army obeying precise, God-given instructions. Trumpets blast, jars break, torches flare, and a faith-filled shout rises: every detail proclaims that victory belongs to the LORD, not to human strength. As modern followers of Christ, we are called to the same pattern&#8212;proclaim boldly, shine brightly, trust completely&#8212;and watch God turn apparent weakness into triumphant deliverance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">The trumpets in their right hands . . .</span>--Thus they were comparatively defenceless, though, if they had any armour at all, doubtless they could still hold the shield on the left arm, while the sword was girded on the thigh. The effect of the sudden crash and glare and shout upon the vast unwieldy host of the Bedouins may be imagined. Startled from sleep in a camp which, like Oriental camps, must have been most imperfectly protected and disciplined, they would see on every side blazing torches, and hear on every side the rams' horns and the terrible shout of the Israelites. (Comp. Tac. <span class= "ital">Ann. i.</span> 68.) The instant result was a wild panic, such as that which seized the camp of the Persians at Plataee. The first thought which would rise in their minds would be that there was some treachery at work among the motley elements of the camp itself. Even a well-disciplined camp is liable to these outbursts of panic. One such occurred among the Greeks in the camp of the Ten Thousand during their retreat. To shame these groundless alarms, Klearchus next morning caused a reward to be proclaimed for any one who would give information "who had let the ass loose;" and this seems to have been a standing joke to shame Greek soldiers from such panics (Xen. <span class= "ital">Anab. ii.</span> 2, 20). Several stratagems similar to that of Gideon are recorded in history. Polyaenus, in his book on the "Art of War," tells us that Di?tas, when attacking Heraea, "ordered the trumpeters to stand apart, and sound a charge opposite to many quarters of the city; and that the Heraeans, hearing the blasts of many trumpets from many directions, thinking that the whole region was crowded with enemies, abandoned the city." Frontinus also tells us that the Tarquinians and Faliscans tried to frighten the Romans with torches, and Minucius Rufus terrified the Scordisci by trumpets blown among the rocks (<span class= "ital">Strateg. </span>ii. 3). Hannibal on one occasion escaped from Fabius Maximus by tying torches to the heads of cattle, and having them driven about the hills. The Druids waved torches to repel the attack of Suetonius Paulinus on the island of Mona (Tac. <span class= "ital">Ann. xiv.</span> 30). An Arab chief (Bel-Arab) in the eighteenth century used trumpets in exactly the same manner as Gideon did on this occasion, and with the same success (Niebuhr, <span class= "ital">Beschr. von Arabien, </span>p. 304).
