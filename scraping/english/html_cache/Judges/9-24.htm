Jerubbaal, another name for Gideon, was a judge of Israel who led the people to victory against the Midianites. The crime mentioned is the massacre of his seventy sons by Abimelech, one of Gideon's sons, who sought to eliminate any rivals to his rule. This act of fratricide is seen as a grave sin, violating the sanctity of family and the commandment against murder. The justice sought here is divine, indicating that God is the ultimate judge who will ensure that such heinous acts are punished.<p><b>and their blood be avenged on their brother Abimelech</b><br>Abimelech's actions are particularly egregious because they involve the betrayal and murder of his own family. In ancient Israelite culture, family bonds were sacred, and the shedding of innocent blood was a serious offense that cried out for vengeance. The concept of blood vengeance was deeply ingrained in the culture, often requiring a kinsman-redeemer to avenge the wrong. Here, God Himself takes on the role of avenger, underscoring the severity of Abimelech's crime. This also foreshadows the biblical principle that God will avenge the blood of the innocent, as seen in <a href="/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>.<p><b>and on the leaders of Shechem, who had helped him murder his brothers</b><br>The leaders of Shechem are complicit in Abimelech's crime, having supported his rise to power and his violent actions. Shechem was a significant city in the tribal confederation of Israel, and its leaders' involvement indicates a broader societal corruption. This complicity highlights the theme of collective responsibility and the consequences of aligning with evil. The alliance between Abimelech and Shechem's leaders is a cautionary tale about the dangers of political ambition and the moral decay that can result from seeking power at any cost. This narrative serves as a reminder of the biblical principle that those who sow injustice will reap calamity, as stated in <a href="/proverbs/22-8.htm">Proverbs 22:8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal) and a concubine from Shechem.

Jerubbaal is Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-32.htm">Judges 6:32</a>). The verse in focus calls this act a &#8220;crime,&#8221; underscoring its deliberate, wholesale slaughter. &#8226; Gideon&#8217;s earlier faithfulness (<a href="/bsb/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>) contrasts sharply with the faithlessness of his son. &#8226; The magnitude of the offense echoes Cain&#8217;s murder of Abel (<a href="/genesis/4-8.htm">Genesis 4:8-10</a>) and sets the stage for divine intervention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;might come to justice</b><p>God&#8217;s purpose is to ensure the crime does not remain unpunished.
