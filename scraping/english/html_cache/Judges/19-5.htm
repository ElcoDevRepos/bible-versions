Hospitality was a significant cultural value, and extended stays were not unusual. This timeframe also reflects the patience and persistence of the Levite, who had come to reconcile with his concubine.<p><b>they got up early in the morning</b><br>Rising early was typical for travelers in ancient times to avoid the heat of the day. This practice is seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/genesis/19-27.htm">Genesis 19:27</a> when Abraham rose early to see the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. It signifies diligence and a readiness to undertake a journey.<p><b>and prepared to depart</b><br>The preparation to leave suggests a resolution to the initial conflict that brought the Levite to Bethlehem. It also indicates a transition in the narrative, moving from reconciliation to the impending journey, which will lead to significant events in Gibeah.<p><b>but the girl&#8217;s father said to his son-in-law</b><br>The father-in-law's role here is crucial, as he represents the familial and social customs of the time. His interaction with the Levite shows a desire to maintain peace and goodwill, reflecting the importance of family ties and reconciliation.<p><b>&#8220;Refresh your heart with a morsel of bread</b><br>This phrase is an invitation to extend hospitality further. "Refresh your heart" is a Hebrew idiom meaning to be strengthened or encouraged. Bread, a staple food, symbolizes sustenance and fellowship. This echoes the hospitality shown by Abraham in <a href="/genesis/18-5.htm">Genesis 18:5</a> when he offered bread to the divine visitors.<p><b>and then you can go.&#8221;</b><br>The father-in-law's suggestion to delay departure emphasizes the cultural importance of hospitality and rest before a journey.

Three complete days of feasting have already passed (vv. 1&#8211;4). In Scripture, extended hospitality often signifies goodwill and covenant-like bonding (<a href="/genesis/24-54.htm">Genesis 24:54&#8211;55</a>; <a href="/acts/10-23.htm">Acts 10:23</a>). Yet this added day also foreshadows delay&#8212;time that will place the travelers on the road after dark, setting the stage for the chapter&#8217;s grim events. Patience in generous hosting is commendable, but <a href="/proverbs/27-14.htm">Proverbs 27:14</a> warns that even a blessing can become wearisome when stretched too far.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They got up early in the morning</b><p>Like Abraham rising early for his journey (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>) or Moses preparing Israel to depart Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31</a>), the Levite begins the day with resolve. Early rising in Scripture often accompanies obedience or purposeful action (<a href="/psalms/119-147.htm">Psalm 119:147</a>). The travelers intend to make good use of daylight, a sensible choice in an age when night travel was dangerous (<a href="/john/11-9.htm">John 11:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Prepared to depart</b><p>Preparation implies ordered planning&#8212;packing, saddling animals, gathering provisions. <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a> reminds that &#8220;a man&#8217;s heart plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps.&#8221; Although the Levite plans a straightforward return to Ephraim, divine providence will use this journey to expose Israel&#8217;s moral collapse (cf. <a href="/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The girl&#8217;s father said to his son-in-law</b><p>The father-in-law interjects before departure, mirroring Jethro&#8217;s warm reception of Moses (<a href="/exodus/18-7.htm">Exodus 18:7</a>). Family bonds carried strong obligations; refusing a host could be interpreted as disrespect (<a href="/genesis/19-2.htm">Genesis 19:2&#8211;3</a>). Here, the older man&#8217;s repeated pleas (vv. 6&#8211;8) reveal both genuine affection and a cultural insistence on honoring guests (<a href="/romans/12-10.htm">Romans 12:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Refresh your heart with a morsel of bread</b><p>&#8220;Refresh your heart&#8221; is a Hebrew idiom for strengthening one&#8217;s spirit through food (<a href="/1_samuel/14-27.htm">1 Samuel 14:27, 29</a>). Even a &#8220;morsel&#8221; signals life-giving sustenance (<a href="/1_kings/17-12.htm">1 Kings 17:12</a>). The father offers simple fare, echoing Jesus&#8217; later invitation, &#8220;Come, have breakfast&#8221; (<a href="/john/21-12.htm">John 21:12</a>). Yet every extra meal prolongs the stay, illustrating how good intentions can inadvertently hinder timely obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then you can go</b><p>The assurance &#8220;and then you can go&#8221; parallels Laban&#8217;s attempt to delay Jacob (<a href="/genesis/30-27.htm">Genesis 30:27&#8211;28</a>) and Rebekah&#8217;s family stalling her departure (<a href="/genesis/24-55.htm">Genesis 24:55&#8211;56</a>). Well-meaning hosts often want &#8220;just one more day,&#8221; but <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a> teaches there is &#8220;a time to go.&#8221; The Levite&#8217;s eventual acquiescence leads to travel at an unsafe hour, underscoring the practical wisdom of redeeming the time (<a href="/ephesians/5-15.htm">Ephesians 5:15&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/19-5.htm">Judges 19:5</a> captures a courteous yet fateful moment: after multiple days of generous hospitality, the Levite rises early to leave, but his father-in-law persuades him to stay for one more meal. The verse highlights (1) the cultural virtue of hospitality, (2) the importance of diligent planning, and (3) the danger of well-intentioned delays. It sets the narrative tension that ultimately exposes Israel&#8217;s need for godly leadership, reminding readers to balance gracious fellowship with timely obedience to God&#8217;s leading.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Early in the morning.</span>--Except in winter, most journeys are performed in the early morning or late evening, in order to avoid the burning heat.<p><span class= "bld">Comfort thine heart.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Prop up thy heart, </span>as in <a href="/genesis/18-5.htm" title="And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort you your hearts; after that you shall pass on: for therefore are you come to your servant.
