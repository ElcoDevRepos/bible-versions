In the context of ancient warfare, turning in battle could imply a feigned retreat, a tactic used to draw the enemy into a vulnerable position. This strategy is reminiscent of Joshua's tactics at Ai (<a href="/joshua/8-15.htm">Joshua 8:15-19</a>), where a similar feigned retreat led to victory. The Israelites' decision to turn in battle reflects their reliance on divine guidance and strategic planning, emphasizing the importance of wisdom and discernment in warfare.<p><b>When the Benjamites had begun to strike them down,</b><br>The Benjamites, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, were known for their skill in battle, particularly their left-handed slingers (<a href="/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>). This phrase highlights their initial success in the conflict, showcasing their confidence and military prowess. Historically, the tribe of Benjamin was small but fierce, often engaging in battles with other tribes. This moment in the narrative underscores the tension and division within the nation of Israel, as internal conflict threatened their unity.<p><b>killing about thirty men of Israel,</b><br>The loss of thirty men, while seemingly small, would have been significant in the context of tribal warfare, where every warrior counted. This loss served to embolden the Benjamites, reinforcing their belief in their superiority and the righteousness of their cause. The specific number may also symbolize a testing period for Israel, as numbers often carry symbolic weight in biblical texts.<p><b>they said, &#8220;They are defeated before us as in the first battle.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reflects the Benjamites' confidence, recalling their previous victory over the Israelites (<a href="/judges/20-21.htm">Judges 20:21</a>). It highlights the cyclical nature of conflict and the danger of overconfidence. The reference to the "first battle" serves as a reminder of past failures and the need for humility and reliance on God. This moment foreshadows the eventual downfall of the Benjamites, as their pride blinds them to the Israelites' strategy and God's ultimate plan for justice and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_israel.htm">Men of Israel</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel, excluding Benjamin, who were engaged in a civil war against the tribe of Benjamin due to the grievous sin committed in Gibeah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamin.htm">Benjamin</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, which was defending itself against the other tribes due to the incident involving the Levite's concubine in Gibeah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/battle.htm">Battle</a></b><br>The conflict between the tribe of Benjamin and the other Israelite tribes, which was part of a larger account of judgment and justice within Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a></b><br>The city in the territory of Benjamin where the initial atrocity occurred, leading to the civil war.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/first_battle.htm">First Battle</a></b><br>Refers to the initial encounter between the Israelites and the Benjamites, where the Benjamites were victorious, leading to overconfidence in this subsequent battle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin has far-reaching consequences, affecting not only individuals but entire communities.

By turning, Israel lures Benjamin away from Gibeah, clearing the field for the hidden ambush to ignite the city (v. 38).<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: God sometimes uses apparent setbacks to accomplish decisive victory (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When the Benjamites had begun to strike them down</b><p>&#8226; Benjamin believes it is witnessing a third straight rout. Earlier they had killed 22,000 (v. 21) and 18,000 (v. 25).<p>&#8226; The text underlines how convincing Israel&#8217;s retreat was; Benjamin &#8220;had begun&#8221; to cut them down, exactly as planned (<a href="/judges/20-31.htm">Judges 20:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross-reference <a href="/judges/20-32.htm">Judges 20:32</a>, where Benjamin says, &#8220;They are defeated before us,&#8221; revealing overconfidence. Compare with Pharaoh pressing Israel to the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-5.htm">Exodus 14:5&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Lesson: God allows an enemy temporary success to expose pride and set the stage for justice (<a href="/psalms/37-12.htm">Psalm 37:12-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Killing about thirty men of Israel</b><p>&#8226; The casualties are far smaller than on the prior days, underscoring that Israel&#8217;s losses are now controlled and purposeful.<p>&#8226; Thirty deaths bought Israel time to complete the ambush. Strategy does not erase real cost, reminding us that obedience can still involve sacrifice (<a href="/luke/14-27.htm">Luke 14:27-33</a>).<p>&#8226; The number also heightens dramatic irony: Benjamin assumes another easy win, unaware that its own defeat is moments away (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They said, &#8220;They are defeated before us as in the first battle.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Benjamin interprets Israel&#8217;s flight exactly as Israel intended.

While Benjamin celebrates, the signal&#8212;smoke rising from Gibeah (<a href="/judges/20-40.htm">Judges 20:40</a>)&#8212;will reverse the momentum.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;as in the first battle&#8221; shows how past success can create a false security if God&#8217;s hand has turned (<a href="/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Application: victories without repentance can harden the heart; true security rests not in past triumphs but in present alignment with God&#8217;s will (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/20-39.htm">Judges 20:39</a> captures the pivotal moment of Israel&#8217;s civil war. Israel&#8217;s feigned retreat, Benjamin&#8217;s premature confidence, the modest casualty count, and Benjamin&#8217;s boastful declaration all converge to illustrate how God can use strategic obedience to overturn entrenched sin. What looks like defeat for the faithful is often the doorway to God&#8217;s decisive deliverance, while prideful reliance on yesterday&#8217;s victories leaves the unrepentant exposed to judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(39) <span class= "bld">And when the men of Israel retired.</span>--This merely repeats with more graphic details the fact already mentioned in <a href="/judges/20-31.htm" title="And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goes up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.">Judges 20:31</a>.
