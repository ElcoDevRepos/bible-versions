The temple referred to here is likely a temple dedicated to Dagon, the Philistine god, as mentioned earlier in <a href="/judges/16-23.htm">Judges 16:23</a>. Archaeological evidence suggests that Philistine temples often had a central hall supported by two main pillars, making this account plausible. Samson's reaching for the pillars signifies his intention to bring down the structure, an act of divine retribution against the Philistines who had oppressed Israel. This moment is a culmination of Samson's life, marked by his Nazirite vow and his role as a judge of Israel, despite his personal failings.<p><b>Bracing himself against them with his right hand on one pillar and his left hand on the other,</b><br>This action symbolizes Samson's final act of faith and reliance on God's strength. The positioning of his hands on the pillars is significant, as it demonstrates his physical readiness and determination to fulfill his mission. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who also stretched out His arms in sacrifice. Samson's bracing against the pillars is a moment of both physical and spiritual significance, as he calls upon the Lord for strength one last time. This mirrors the biblical theme of God's power being made perfect in human weakness, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>.
