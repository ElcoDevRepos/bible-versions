The setting is the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite. The act of collapsing at her feet signifies a complete reversal of power dynamics, as Sisera, a mighty warrior, is brought low by a woman, which was culturally significant in a patriarchal society. This moment fulfills the prophecy given by Deborah in <a href="/judges/4-9.htm">Judges 4:9</a>, where she foretold that the honor of victory would go to a woman.<p><b>he fell</b><br>The repetition of Sisera falling emphasizes his defeat and the end of his oppressive reign over the Israelites. In biblical literature, falling often symbolizes defeat and humiliation. This event is a turning point in the narrative, showcasing God's deliverance of Israel through unexpected means. It also serves as a reminder of the theme of divine justice, where the oppressor is brought down.<p><b>there he lay still</b><br>This phrase indicates the finality of Sisera's defeat. The stillness contrasts with the chaos of battle and the pursuit that led him to Jael's tent. It underscores the peace that follows God's intervention and judgment. The stillness can also be seen as a metaphor for the cessation of Canaanite oppression over Israel, as Sisera's death marks the beginning of a period of peace for the Israelites.<p><b>at her feet he collapsed, he fell</b><br>The repetition of this phrase reinforces the dramatic nature of Sisera's downfall. It highlights the role of Jael in God's plan, as her actions directly lead to the fulfillment of Deborah's prophecy. This repetition also serves to emphasize the completeness of Sisera's defeat and the unexpected means by which God delivers His people.<p><b>where he collapsed, there he fell dead</b><br>The finality of Sisera's death is underscored here. His death at the hands of Jael, a non-Israelite woman, is significant in the broader narrative of Judges, where God often uses unlikely individuals to achieve His purposes. This event prefigures the ultimate victory over evil through Jesus Christ, who, like Jael, brings about salvation in unexpected ways. The death of Sisera symbolizes the end of an era of oppression and the beginning of a new chapter for Israel, much like the death and resurrection of Christ signify the defeat of sin and the promise of new life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jael.htm">Jael</a></b><br>The wife of Heber the Kenite, who played a crucial role in the defeat of Sisera by killing him.
