The transition suggests a period of continued unrest and the need for deliverance. Shamgar's name is of non-Israelite origin, possibly indicating a foreign or mixed heritage. "Son of Anath" may refer to a Canaanite goddess, suggesting cultural assimilation or influence. This highlights the diverse backgrounds of those God used to deliver Israel, emphasizing His sovereignty and the unexpected ways He raises leaders.<p><b>And he too saved Israel,</b><br>Shamgar's role as a savior aligns him with the judges who preceded and followed him, each raised by God to deliver Israel from oppression. His deliverance is a testament to God's faithfulness in responding to the cries of His people, despite their recurring disobedience. This phrase underscores the cyclical pattern of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance that characterizes the Book of Judges.<p><b>striking down six hundred Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were a significant threat to Israel, often depicted as formidable enemies due to their military prowess and advanced weaponry. Shamgar's feat of killing six hundred Philistines is remarkable, suggesting divine empowerment. This act of deliverance prefigures later conflicts with the Philistines, notably during the time of Samson and David. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory over sin and death through Christ, who delivers His people from spiritual oppression.<p><b>with an oxgoad.</b><br>An oxgoad is a long, pointed stick used to drive oxen, indicating Shamgar's humble status as a farmer. His use of an agricultural tool as a weapon highlights God's ability to use ordinary means and people for extraordinary purposes. This mirrors other biblical instances where God uses the weak to confound the strong, such as David with his sling or Moses with his staff. It points to the theme of divine empowerment and the sufficiency of God's provision in the face of overwhelming odds.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shamgar.htm">Shamgar</a></b><br>A judge of Israel who delivered the Israelites from the oppression of the Philistines.

God responds by raising another deliverer, demonstrating His ongoing patience.<p>&#8226; Shamgar&#8217;s appearance is also mentioned in the Song of Deborah: &#8220;In the days of Shamgar son of Anath&#8230; the roads were deserted&#8221; (<a href="/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6</a>). That note hints at social instability, showing the need for someone courageous to step forward.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he too saved Israel</b><p>&#8226; Judges regularly highlights that salvation comes through individuals God appoints: &#8220;Then the LORD raised up judges, who saved them from the hands of those who plundered them&#8221; (<a href="/judges/2-16.htm">Judges 2:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Shamgar&#8217;s salvation is part of a pattern: &#8220;Then the LORD sent Jerub-baal, Barak, Jephthah, and Samuel, and He delivered you&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/12-11.htm">1 Samuel 12:11</a>).

We know nothing of Shamgar's tribe or family, but, as neither his name nor that of his father is Jewish, it has been conjectured that he may have been a Kenite; a conjecture which derives some confirmation from his juxtaposition with Jael in <a href="/judges/5-6.htm" title="In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways.">Judges 5:6</a>. Shamgar means "name of a stranger" (comp. Grershom, "a stranger there"). Samgar-Nebo is the name of a Babylonian general (<a href="/jeremiah/39-3.htm" title="And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.">Jeremiah 39:3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Six hundred men.</span>--It has been most needlessly assumed that he slew them single-handed, and not, as is probable, at the head of a band of peasants armed with the same rude weapons as himself. If he slew 600 with his own hand, the <span class= "ital">whole </span>number that perished would almost certainly have been added. There is, indeed, no impossibility (even apart from Divine assistance, which is implied though not expressly attributed to him) in the supposition that in a battle which may have lasted for more than one day a single chief may with his own hand have killed this number, for we are told that in a night battle against Moawijah, Ali raised a shout each time he had killed an enemy, and his voice was heard 300 times in one night; and a story closely resembling that of Shamgar is narrated of a Swedish peasant; but the question here is merely one of interpretation, and nothing is more common in Scripture, as in all literature, than to say that a leader personally did what was done under his leadership, <span class= "ital">e.g., "</span>Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands" (<a href="/1_samuel/18-7.htm" title="And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.">1Samuel 18:7</a>).<p><span class= "bld">With an ox goad.</span>--The LXX.

The phrase occurs here alone--<span class= "ital">bemalmad ha b?k?r; </span>literally, "with a thing to teach oxen." There can be little doubt that an ox-goad is meant. In the East they are sometimes formidable implements, eight feet long, pointed with a strong sharp iron head. The use of them--since whips were not used for cattle--is alluded to in <a href="/1_samuel/13-21.htm" title="Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.">1Samuel 13:21</a>; <a href="/acts/9-5.htm" title="And he said, Who are you, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom you persecute: it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.">Acts 9:5</a>.

Disarmament was the universal policy of ancient days (<a href="/1_samuel/13-19.htm" title="Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:">1Samuel 13:19</a>); and this reduced the Israelites to the use of inventive skill in very simple weapons (<a href="/1_samuel/17-40.htm" title="And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a money; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.">1Samuel 17:40</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-43.htm" title="And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you come to me with staves?

In <a href="/judges/10-6.htm">Judges 10:6</a> we read of Israel worshipping the gods of the Phllistines, and of an alliance between the Ammonites and Philistines to vex Israel; but the precise connection between the events of the two chapters, or the exact time when either occurred, cannot be determined with certainty. Nothing more is known of Shamgar, except the mention of him in Deborah's song (<a href="/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6</a>). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/3-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After Ehud</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1444;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
