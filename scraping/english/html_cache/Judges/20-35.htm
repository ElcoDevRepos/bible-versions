This reflects a recurring theme in the Old Testament where God is portrayed as the ultimate warrior and deliverer of His people (<a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>). The context of this battle is a civil war within Israel, where the tribe of Benjamin was defending the men of Gibeah who had committed a grievous sin (Judges 19). The phrase "in the presence of Israel" suggests that the victory was witnessed by the other tribes, reinforcing the idea that God was actively involved in the affairs of His people. This event serves as a reminder of the consequences of sin and the importance of seeking God's guidance in conflict.<p><b>and on that day the Israelites slaughtered 25,100 Benjamites</b><br>The specific number of casualties underscores the severity of the conflict and the extent of the judgment against Benjamin. The use of the word "slaughtered" indicates a decisive and overwhelming defeat, which was common in ancient warfare narratives. This event is part of a larger narrative that illustrates the cycle of sin, judgment, and redemption found throughout the Book of Judges. The historical context reveals the tribal tensions and the fragile unity among the Israelites during this period. The large number of casualties also reflects the seriousness with which God viewed the sin of the Benjamites and the necessity of purging evil from among His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5</a>).<p><b>all armed with swords</b><br>This detail highlights the preparedness and military capability of the Benjamites, who were known for their skill in battle (<a href="/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>). Despite their readiness and armament, they were unable to withstand the judgment of God, illustrating the futility of relying solely on human strength and weapons (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>). The mention of swords also connects to the broader biblical theme of spiritual warfare, where believers are called to put on the full armor of God (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>). In this context, the physical battle serves as a type of the spiritual battles faced by believers, where victory is achieved not by might, but by the Spirit of the LORD (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The divine being who orchestrates the events and ensures the victory of Israel over Benjamin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamin.htm">Benjamin</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, which is in conflict with the other tribes due to the grievous sin committed in Gibeah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel, excluding Benjamin, who unite to execute judgment on the tribe of Benjamin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a></b><br>The city in the territory of Benjamin where the initial crime that led to the conflict occurred.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/battle.htm">Battle</a></b><br>The event where the Israelites, under divine guidance, defeat the Benjamites, resulting in significant casualties.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>God is the ultimate judge who ensures justice is served.

<a href="/1_samuel/14-23.htm">1 Samuel 14:23</a>).<p>- The phrase underscores that the outcome was the direct result of divine judgment on Benjamin&#8217;s unrepentant defense of the wickedness in Gibeah (<a href="/judges/19-22.htm">Judges 19:22&#8211;30</a>; 20:12&#8211;13).<p>- Israel&#8217;s earlier defeats (<a href="/judges/20-21.htm">Judges 20:21, 25</a>) showed that victory would come only when the LORD chose to grant it, highlighting His sovereignty (<a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the presence of Israel</b><p>- The nation watched the LORD vindicate righteousness, reinforcing corporate faith (<a href="/joshua/3-10.htm">Joshua 3:10</a>;

<a href="/2_chronicles/20-17.htm">2 Chronicles 20:17</a>).<p>- The wording also serves as a sober warning: the same God who defends can discipline His own people when they tolerate sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-30.htm">Hebrews 10:30&#8211;31</a> referencing <a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35&#8211;36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on that day</b><p>- The judgment was swift once the LORD pronounced it, echoing other &#8220;day&#8221;

when He will again act decisively against unrepentant sin (<a href="/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Israelites slaughtered 25,100 Benjamites</b><p>- The large number mirrors the gravity of Benjamin&#8217;s corporate guilt (<a href="/numbers/31-7.htm">Numbers 31:7&#8211;18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12&#8211;18</a>).<p>- Israel became the human instrument of God&#8217;s justice, similar to later judgments on idolatrous cities (<a href="/1_kings/18-40.htm">1 Kings 18:40</a>) and even on rebellious Israelite factions (<a href="/numbers/16-32.htm">Numbers 16:32&#8211;35</a>).<p>- The heavy losses anticipate the near extinction of the tribe (<a href="/judges/20-46.htm">Judges 20:46&#8211;48</a>), showing how sin can endanger the very existence of a covenant community.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all armed with swords</b><p>- Every fallen Benjamite was a capable soldier (<a href="/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a> describes their skill), proving the victory was not due to enemy weakness but divine intervention (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16&#8211;17</a>).<p>- The detail highlights how reliance on military prowess without moral integrity is futile (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/32-8.htm">2 Chronicles 32:8</a>).<p>- It also contrasts with God&#8217;s earlier instructions to Israel that obedience, not armaments, guarantees security (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/20-35.htm">Judges 20:35</a> records a moment when God Himself moved to purge entrenched sin from within His people. After Israel humbled themselves, the LORD granted victory over a fully armed, numerically strong Benjamin, making it clear that divine justice&#8212;not human strength&#8212;decides every battle. The verse stands as both a reassurance that God defends righteousness and a warning that unrepentant sin invites severe, even catastrophic, discipline.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">Destroyed of the Benjamites . . .</span>--Here again we have a summary of the final result, followed by details, in a manner which proves either that the narrative was compiled from various sources (one of which seems to have been a poem), or that it was penned before the "periodic style" of history (<span class= "ital">lexis katestrammene</span>) had been invented.
