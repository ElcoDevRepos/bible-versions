This area was known for its balm, a valuable commodity in ancient times. The fords of the Jordan were shallow crossing points, strategically important for controlling movement between territories. Capturing these fords was crucial in the conflict between the Gileadites and the Ephraimites, as it allowed the Gileadites to control access to the region of Ephraim, located west of the Jordan. This reflects the ongoing tribal tensions in Israel during the period of the Judges, a time marked by decentralized leadership and frequent inter-tribal conflicts.<p><b>and whenever a fugitive from Ephraim would say, &#8220;Let me cross over,&#8221;</b><br>The term "fugitive" indicates that the Ephraimites were in retreat, likely after a defeat in battle. The request to "cross over" suggests an attempt to return to their homeland or escape capture. This scenario highlights the desperation and vulnerability of the Ephraimites, who were seeking refuge or a safe passage. The historical context of this passage is a civil conflict within Israel, where the tribe of Ephraim had previously shown arrogance and hostility towards other tribes, as seen in their interactions with Gideon in <a href="/judges/8.htm">Judges 8</a>.<p><b>the Gileadites would ask him, &#8220;Are you an Ephraimite?&#8221;</b><br>This question was a test to identify the fleeing Ephraimites. The Gileadites needed to distinguish friend from foe, as the Ephraimites were their adversaries in this conflict. The question reflects the tribal identities that were strong during this period, with each tribe having its own distinct characteristics and loyalties. The Gileadites' inquiry underscores the importance of tribal affiliation in ancient Israel, where alliances and enmities were often based on tribal lines.<p><b>If he answered, &#8220;No,&#8221;</b><br>The response "No" would be a denial of Ephraimite identity, likely in an attempt to avoid capture or death. This situation illustrates the fear and deception that can arise in times of war. The denial of one's tribal identity in this context is significant, as it shows the lengths to which individuals would go to preserve their lives. This moment also foreshadows the subsequent test involving the pronunciation of "Shibboleth," which further emphasizes the deep divisions and hostilities between the tribes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gileadites.htm">Gileadites</a></b><br>A group of Israelites from the region of Gilead, east of the Jordan River.

If the rendering of the English Version be adopted in <a href="/judges/12-4.htm" title="Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, You Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.">Judges 12:4</a>, we can only suppose that there is a bitter retribution implied in the words. The Ephraimites had taunted the Eastern Manassites with being "fugitives of Ephraim," and in the next verse they themselves appear to be in another, but fatal, sense "fugitives of Ephraim."<p><span class= "bld">Art thou an Ephraimite?</span>--There must have been considerable traffic across the Jordan fords, and the object was to distinguish between Ephraimite fugitives and harmless travellers and merchants. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/12-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The Gileadites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1435;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(gil&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1568.htm">Strong's 1568: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gilead -- a region in Palestine, also the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">captured</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yil&#183;k&#333;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
