The "rest" signifies a cessation of conflict and a return to normalcy in daily life. The number forty often symbolizes a generation or a period of testing and completion in the Bible, as seen in the forty years of Israel's wandering in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>) and Jesus' forty days of fasting (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). This rest was a direct result of Othniel's leadership and God's deliverance, highlighting the cyclical pattern of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance found throughout the Book of Judges.<p><b>until Othniel son of Kenaz died</b><br>Othniel, the first judge of Israel, was a nephew of Caleb, a prominent figure known for his faithfulness (<a href="/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6-14</a>). His leadership brought about the deliverance of Israel from the oppression of Cushan-Rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia (<a href="/judges/3-8.htm">Judges 3:8-10</a>). The mention of his death marks the end of the period of peace, suggesting that the stability of Israel was closely tied to the presence of a godly leader. This pattern is seen throughout Judges, where the death of a judge often leads to a return to idolatry and chaos. Othniel's role as a deliverer can be seen as a type of Christ, who brings ultimate deliverance and peace to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/othniel.htm">Othniel</a></b><br>The first judge of Israel after the death of Joshua.

For the very difficult chronology of this period, see the Introduction. Many questions have been raised, such as--Do the forty years <span class= "ital">include </span>or <span class= "ital">exclude </span>the period of servitude? Is forty meant to be an exact or a general number? Are the various periods of rest and servitude continuous and successive, or do they refer to different parts of the Holy Land, and do they synchronise? Perhaps no final answer to these questions is as yet possible, and no less than fifty schemes of the chronology of the period of the judges have been attempted, which fact alone proves how insufficient are the data on which to decide.<p><span class= "bld">Died.</span>--Probably <span class= "ital">during </span>the forty years, unless we suppose that he attained a most unusual age.

The first part of the verse only belongs to the preceding section, which it closes quite naturally. The result of Othniel's victories was a rest of forty years (cf. ver. 30; 5:31; 8:28, etc.). The latter half of the verse - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">Othniel the son of Kenaz died</span> - begins a new section, and is introductory to the first apostasy, which followed after his death. <p> CHAPTER 3:13-31 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/3-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1430;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_776.htm">Strong's 776: </a> </span><span class="str2">Earth, land</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had rest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1511;&#1465;&#1445;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;ti&#353;&#183;q&#333;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8252.htm">Strong's 8252: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be quiet or undisturbed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for forty</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;b&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_705.htm">Strong's 705: </a> </span><span class="str2">Forty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">years,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8141.htm">Strong's 8141: </a> </span><span class="str2">A year</span><br /><br /><span class="word">until Othniel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1514;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1461;&#1445;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#601;&#183;n&#238;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6274.htm">Strong's 6274: </a> </span><span class="str2">Othniel -- a hero in Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Kenaz</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1469;&#1494;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#601;&#183;naz)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7073.htm">Strong's 7073: </a> </span><span class="str2">Kenaz -- an Edomite, also two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">died.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1502;&#1464;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;m&#257;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4191.htm">Strong's 4191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To die, to kill</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/judges/3-11.htm">Judges 3:11 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/judges/3-11.htm">Judges 3:11 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/judges/3-11.htm">Judges 3:11 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/judges/3-11.htm">Judges 3:11 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/judges/3-11.htm">Judges 3:11 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/judges/3-11.htm">Judges 3:11  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/judges/3-11.htm">Judges 3:11 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/judges/3-11.htm">Judges 3:11 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/judges/3-11.htm">Judges 3:11 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/judges/3-11.htm">Judges 3:11 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/judges/3-11.htm">OT History: Judges 3:11 The land had rest forty years (Jd Judg.
