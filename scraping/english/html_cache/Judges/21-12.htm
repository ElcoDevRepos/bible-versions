It was part of the tribe of Manasseh's inheritance. The city had failed to send representatives to the assembly at Mizpah, which led to the decision to punish them. This reflects the tribal disunity and moral chaos during the period of the Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). The city later becomes significant in the story of King Saul, who rescues it from the Ammonites (1 Samuel 11).<p><b>four hundred young women who had not had relations with a man</b><br>The emphasis on the women being virgins is significant in the context of ancient Israelite culture, where virginity was highly valued, especially in the context of marriage. This detail also underscores the tragic nature of the events, as these women were taken from their homes to become wives for the Benjaminites, highlighting the desperate measures taken to preserve the tribe of Benjamin after the civil war.<p><b>and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh</b><br>Shiloh was an important religious center during this time, housing the Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant. It was located in the hill country of Ephraim. Bringing the women to Shiloh may indicate an attempt to legitimize the actions taken by seeking divine approval or blessing, as Shiloh was a place where people sought God's guidance.<p><b>in the land of Canaan</b><br>The reference to Canaan situates the narrative within the broader context of the Israelite conquest and settlement of the Promised Land. It serves as a reminder of the incomplete conquest and the ongoing struggles with the Canaanite culture and practices, which often led the Israelites away from their covenant with God. The land of Canaan is also a type of the spiritual inheritance promised to believers, symbolizing the rest and blessings found in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jabesh-gilead.htm">Jabesh-gilead</a></b><br>A city in the territory of Gilead, east of the Jordan River.

solution in motion after Israel wept before the LORD (<a href="/judges/21-2.htm">Judges 21:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar transitions appear when God provides an answer to national distress (<a

matters&#8212;e.g., Gideon&#8217;s 300 (<a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>) or David&#8217;s 400 (<a href="/1_samuel/25-13.htm">1 Samuel 25:13</a>)&#8212;showing God&#8217;s precise

By seizing 400 virgin women from Jabesh-gilead and bringing them to Shiloh, Israel acts decisively&#8212;yet imperfectly&#8212;within God&#8217;s sovereign plan.

If so, the idiom is like the Greek one in which a woman speaking of herself in the plural uses the masculine (<span class= "ital">Brief Greek Syntax, </span>p. 61).
