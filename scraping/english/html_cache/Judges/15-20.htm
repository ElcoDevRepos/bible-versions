Unlike others who led military campaigns, Samson's leadership was more personal and individualistic. His judgeship was marked by his extraordinary physical strength, which was a gift from God, and his Nazirite vow, which set him apart for divine purposes. The role of a judge in Israel was not only to lead in battle but also to provide guidance and deliverance from oppression. Samson's life, however, was a mix of personal failings and divine empowerment, reflecting the complex relationship between God and His chosen leaders.<p><b>for twenty years</b><br>The twenty-year period of Samson's judgeship is significant as it represents a substantial time of leadership during the era of the judges, which was characterized by cycles of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance. This period suggests that despite his personal flaws, Samson was able to provide a measure of stability and resistance against the Philistines. The number twenty in biblical terms can symbolize a period of waiting or completeness, indicating that Samson's judgeship fulfilled a specific purpose in God's plan for Israel.<p><b>in the days of the Philistines.</b><br>The Philistines were a dominant force in the region during this time, often oppressing the Israelites. They were a seafaring people who settled along the coastal regions of Canaan and were known for their advanced iron technology, which gave them a military advantage. The phrase "in the days of the Philistines" highlights the context of oppression under which Samson operated. This period was marked by frequent conflicts between the Israelites and the Philistines, setting the stage for Samson's acts of defiance against them. The Philistine oppression is a recurring theme in the narrative of Judges, illustrating the consequences of Israel's disobedience to God and their need for deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his extraordinary strength, which was a gift from God.

The verse reminds us that, despite Israel&#8217;s failures and lingering foreign control, the Lord faithfully supplied leadership, sustained His people, and kept His redemptive plan on course.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">And he judged Israel.</span>--Probably, as Jephthah had done, with the sort of vague prerogatives of a military hero. Why the verse is found here, as though to close the narrative (comp. <a href="/judges/12-7.htm" title="And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.">Judges 12:7</a>, &c.), and is again repeated in <a href="/judges/16-31.htm" title="Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial plot of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.">Judges 16:31</a>, we cannot say. The next chapter belongs mainly to Samson's fall and humiliation. These twenty years probably fell within the contemporary judgeship of Eli.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he judged Israel</span>, etc. See ch. 16:81. It looks as if it had been the intention to close the history of Samson with these Words, but that ch. 16. was subsequently added, possibly from other sources. Compare the close of chs. 20. and 21. of the Gospel of St. John. A possible explanation, however, of this verse being placed here is that it results from the statement in ver. 19, that Samson's spirit came again, and he revived, or came to life again, after being on the very point of death; and, adds the writer, he judged Israel after this for twenty years. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/15-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And [Samson] judged</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1465;&#1447;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;p&#333;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8199.htm">Strong's 8199: </a> </span><span class="str2">To judge, pronounce sentence, to vindicate, punish, to govern, to litigate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1435;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for twenty</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;e&#347;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6242.htm">Strong's 6242: </a> </span><span class="str2">Twenty, twentieth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">years</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8141.htm">Strong's 8141: </a> </span><span class="str2">A year</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#238;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the Philistines.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;&#601;&#183;li&#353;&#183;t&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6430.htm">Strong's 6430: </a> </span><span class="str2">Philistines -- inhabitants of Philistia</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/judges/15-20.htm">Judges 15:20 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/judges/15-20.htm">Judges 15:20 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/judges/15-20.htm">Judges 15:20 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/judges/15-20.htm">Judges 15:20 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/judges/15-20.htm">Judges 15:20 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/judges/15-20.htm">Judges 15:20  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/judges/15-20.htm">Judges 15:20 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/judges/15-20.htm">Judges 15:20 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/judges/15-20.htm">Judges 15:20 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/judges/15-20.htm">Judges 15:20 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/judges/15-20.htm">OT History: Judges 15:20 He judged Israel in the days (Jd Judg.
