This reflects the biblical principle of righteousness and justice, where one must be blameless in disputes (<a href="/proverbs/17-15.htm">Proverbs 17:15</a>). The context involves Jephthah's role as a judge and leader of Israel, emphasizing the importance of integrity in leadership.<p><b>but you have done me wrong by waging war against me</b><br>The Ammonites' aggression is highlighted here. Historically, the Ammonites claimed land east of the Jordan, which they believed was theirs. This reflects the ongoing territorial disputes in the region, rooted in ancient claims and conflicts (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>). The phrase underscores the theme of unjust aggression, a recurring issue in Israel's history.<p><b>May the LORD, the Judge, decide today</b><br>Jephthah appeals to God as the ultimate Judge, a common biblical theme where God is seen as the arbiter of justice (<a href="/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>). This reflects the belief in divine justice and intervention in human affairs. It also foreshadows the final judgment, where God will judge all nations (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>).<p><b>between the Israelites and the Ammonites</b><br>The conflict is framed as a national issue, not just a personal one. This highlights the collective identity of Israel as God's chosen people, often in conflict with surrounding nations (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). The Ammonites, descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-38.htm">Genesis 19:38</a>), often opposed Israel, symbolizing the broader spiritual battle between God's people and their adversaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, known for his leadership and vow.

His words echo Paul&#8217;s, &#8220;I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man&#8221; (<a href="/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a>).<p>The lesson is clear: believers may&#8212;and should&#8212;stand firmly when falsely accused, confident that blameless conduct speaks for itself.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but you have done me wrong by waging war against me.</b><p>Jephthah turns the charge back on the Ammonite king (<a href="/judges/11-27.htm">Judges 11:27</a>b).<p>&#8226; Ammon is the aggressor, ignoring God&#8217;s earlier protection of their territory (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>) while invading Israel&#8217;s God-given land (<a href="/numbers/21-24.htm">Numbers 21:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Their hostility resembles the Ammon-Syrian provocation of David, when &#8220;the Ammonites came out and drew up for battle&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/10-17.htm">2 Samuel 10:17</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/120-7.htm">Psalm 120:7</a> laments, &#8220;I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.&#8221; Jephthah voices the same frustration: he has sought peace; Ammon insists on conflict.<p>By calling out the injustice, Jephthah underscores a biblical principle&#8212;wrongful aggression places a nation squarely under God&#8217;s scrutiny (<a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>May the LORD, the Judge, decide today between the Israelites and the Ammonites.</b><p>Jephthah&#8217;s final appeal shifts the dispute into God&#8217;s courtroom (<a href="/judges/11-27.htm">Judges 11:27</a>c).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>) anchors his confidence; God is the ultimate arbiter.<p>&#8226; The title &#8220;Judge&#8221;

(<a href="/2_chronicles/20-12.htm">2 Chronicles 20:12</a>).<p>&#8226; By saying &#8220;today,&#8221; Jephthah expects swift intervention, trusting God to vindicate righteousness in real time, just as He did when fire fell on Elijah&#8217;s altar &#8220;at the time of the offering&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36-38</a>).<p>&#8226; New-Testament faith echoes the same assurance: &#8220;Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, says the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p>For believers, conflicts ultimately rest in God&#8217;s hands; His verdict is final and flawless.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jephthah&#8217;s statement is a three-part model for every follower of Christ: maintain blameless conduct, identify and resist injustice, and entrust final judgment to the LORD.

Jephthah maintains the rights of Israel on three grounds, viz., (1) Right of direct conquest, not from Ammon but from the Amorites (15-20); (2) The decision of God (<a href="/context/judges/11-21.htm" title="And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.">Judges 11:21-23</a>), which he supports by an <span class= "ital">argumentum ad hominem</span>--namely, the acquiescence in this decision of the Moabite god Chemosh (<a href="/judges/11-24.htm" title="Will not you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess?
