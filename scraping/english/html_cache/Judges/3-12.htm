The Israelites' actions are measured against God's standards, highlighting their failure to uphold the covenant. This cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance is a central motif in Judges. The phrase "in the sight of the LORD" underscores the omniscience of God, who sees and judges the actions of His people. This pattern of behavior is reminiscent of the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on Israel's obedience or disobedience.<p><b>So He gave Eglon king of Moab power over Israel,</b><br>God's sovereignty is evident as He allows Eglon, the king of Moab, to subjugate Israel. This act of divine judgment serves as a consequence of Israel's sin. Moab, located east of the Dead Sea, was historically an enemy of Israel, and its oppression is a fulfillment of the curses for disobedience mentioned in Deuteronomy. The Moabites were descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>), and their enmity with Israel is a recurring theme in the Old Testament. This oppression is a tool used by God to bring Israel to repentance, demonstrating His control over nations and history.<p><b>because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</b><br>The repetition of this phrase emphasizes the direct correlation between Israel's sin and their subjugation. It serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings are contingent upon obedience. The phrase also highlights the moral and spiritual decline of the Israelites, who repeatedly turn away from God despite His past deliverances. This cycle of sin and judgment is a precursor to the need for a more permanent solution to sin, ultimately fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ, who offers redemption and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God who repeatedly fall into cycles of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance throughout the Book of Judges.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is just and righteous, allowing consequences for sin but also providing deliverance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/eglon,_king_of_moab.htm">Eglon, King of Moab</a></b><br>The ruler whom God strengthens to oppress Israel as a consequence of their disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A neighboring nation to Israel, often in conflict with them, representing a source of temptation and oppression.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cycle_of_sin_and_deliverance.htm">The Cycle of Sin and Deliverance</a></b><br>A recurring theme in Judges where Israel falls into sin, faces oppression, cries out to God, and is delivered by a judge.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>God&#8217;s justice requires that sin be addressed.

God had warned Israel in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15&#8211;68</a> that disobedience would bring foreign domination. Their actions triggered the promised consequences.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So He gave Eglon king of Moab power over Israel</b><p>&#8220;So He gave Eglon king of Moab power over Israel&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12</a>b)<p>&#8226; The LORD is the active subject; He &#8220;gave&#8221; Israel into Eglon&#8217;s hand, underscoring divine sovereignty even over pagan rulers (<a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Eglon&#8217;s rise fulfills God&#8217;s disciplinary purpose, much like He later used Assyria (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5&#8211;6</a>) and Babylon (<a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Moab had been a traditional foe (<a href="/bsb/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22&#8211;25</a>). Their dominance here highlights how sin opens doors for old enemies to resurface.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s judgment is never random; it&#8217;s targeted to shake His people out of complacency (<a href="/psalms/94-12.htm">Psalm 94:12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.&#8221; (<a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12</a>c)<p>&#8226; The verse ends by restating the cause, bookending the account so no one misses the link between sin and suffering (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-39.htm">Lamentations 3:39</a>).<p>&#8226; This &#8220;because&#8221; rules out blaming foreign politics or military weakness; Israel&#8217;s real crisis is spiritual (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-19.htm">2 Chronicles 7:19&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; Repetition drives home God&#8217;s fairness: He warned, Israel rebelled, judgment followed.

Israel&#8217;s relapse into sin prompts the LORD to raise up Eglon as an instrument of discipline. The verse frames the entire episode with the reminder that what matters is God&#8217;s viewpoint. Sin invites bondage; obedience invites blessing. The cycle of Judges calls believers today to heed God&#8217;s warnings, repent quickly, and walk in faithfulness to avoid preventable hardships.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Did evil again.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">"</span>added to do evil."
