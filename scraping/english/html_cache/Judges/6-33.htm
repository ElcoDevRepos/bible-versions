The Midianites and Amalekites were recurring adversaries of Israel, often representing forces of oppression and idolatry. The "people of the east" likely refers to nomadic tribes from the Arabian desert, emphasizing the widespread threat against Israel. Historically, these groups were known for their raids and plundering, which left Israel impoverished and desperate. This gathering signifies a formidable alliance, reminiscent of the spiritual battles believers face, where multiple forces of evil unite against God's people.<p><b>crossed over the Jordan</b><br>The Jordan River served as a significant geographical and symbolic boundary for Israel. Crossing it often marked a transition into a new phase of conflict or conquest. For the invading forces, crossing the Jordan represented an aggressive move into Israelite territory, echoing the earlier Israelite crossing under Joshua, but now with hostile intent. This crossing can be seen as a reversal of the blessings associated with the Promised Land, as foreign powers sought to dominate and oppress God's chosen people.<p><b>and camped in the Valley of Jezreel</b><br>The Valley of Jezreel, a fertile and strategic location in northern Israel, was often a battleground due to its agricultural richness and central position. It was a place where significant biblical events occurred, including battles and prophetic actions. The encampment of enemy forces here underscores the threat to Israel's sustenance and security. This valley would later be associated with prophetic visions of judgment and redemption, symbolizing the ongoing spiritual warfare and the ultimate victory of God's kingdom. The gathering of enemies in Jezreel foreshadows the need for divine intervention, pointing to the deliverance that God would bring through Gideon, a type of Christ who delivers His people from oppression.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianites.htm">Midianites</a></b><br>A nomadic people who were oppressing Israel during the time of the Judges.

Crossing the fords near Bethshean, they were probably encamped, not in the broad part of the plain of Jezreel, but in the valley between Gilboa and Little Hermon. The word Jezreel means "God's sowing."

The great plain of Jezreel, or Esdraelon (which is the Greek form of the name), through which the Kishon flows, is eight hours in length from east to west, and five hours (twelve miles) in breadth from north to south. It is described as "a very extensive and fertile plain shut in between the mountain ranges of Samaria and Mount Carmel on the south, and of Galilee on the north," and extending from the Mediterranean at the Gulf of <span class="accented">Caipha</span>, or <span class="accented">Haipha</span>, to the valley of the Jordan. The access to it from the fords of Jordan in the neighbourhood of Bethshan (or <span class="accented">Beishan</span>, called by the Greeks <span class="accented">Scythopolis</span>) made it the natural place for invasion by the wild tribes east of Jordan, as it is to this day. Particular parts of this great plain are called "the valley, of Megiddo" and "the plain of Samaria." For a full account of the plain of Esdraelon see Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' ch. 9. <span class="cmt_word">Went over</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> crossed the Jordan. It appears from vers. 3-5 that these invasions were repeated at certain seasons. When they had plundered all they could get, and eaten up all the produce of the land, they would go back for a while to their own country east of Jordan, and then return again. So they did now, but they met with a different reception this time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/6-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
