The Ammonites' aggression against Israel was a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often due to territorial disputes and historical enmity. This conflict is part of the broader narrative of the Israelites' struggle to maintain their God-given land amidst surrounding hostile nations. The Ammonites' war against Israel can be seen as a consequence of Israel's disobedience to God, as outlined in the cycles of sin and deliverance in the Book of Judges.<p><b>the elders of Gilead</b><br>Gilead was a region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and rugged terrain. The elders were the leaders or representatives of the tribes residing in this area. Their role was crucial in decision-making and leadership, especially during times of crisis. The elders' involvement highlights the communal and tribal nature of Israelite society, where leadership was often decentralized and based on tribal affiliations. This reflects the period of the Judges, where there was no centralized monarchy, and leadership was often ad hoc and situational.<p><b>went to get Jephthah</b><br>Jephthah was a Gileadite, known for being a mighty warrior but also the son of a prostitute, which led to his rejection by his half-brothers and the elders of Gilead. His story is a powerful example of God using unlikely individuals to achieve His purposes, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. Jephthah's leadership is reminiscent of other judges whom God raised up to deliver Israel, despite their humble or flawed beginnings. This action by the elders signifies a desperate need for deliverance, prompting them to seek out Jephthah despite his previous rejection.<p><b>from the land of Tob</b><br>Tob was a region located northeast of Gilead, possibly in modern-day Syria. It was a place where Jephthah had fled to escape his brothers' hostility. The land of Tob is significant as it represents a place of refuge and exile for Jephthah, who gathered a band of followers there. This mirrors the biblical motif of God preparing His chosen leaders in places of obscurity or exile, similar to Moses in Midian or David in the wilderness. Jephthah's return from Tob to lead Israel underscores the theme of redemption and restoration, as God often calls back those who have been cast out to fulfill His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A group of people descended from Lot, often in conflict with Israel.
