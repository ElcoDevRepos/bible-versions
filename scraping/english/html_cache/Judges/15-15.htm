In the context of ancient Israel, donkeys were common animals, and their bones would have been readily available. The term "fresh" suggests that the jawbone was still strong and not brittle, making it an effective tool for combat. This event occurs during a time when the Philistines were oppressing Israel, and Samson was raised as a judge to deliver them. The use of a jawbone also underscores the theme of God empowering the weak or seemingly insignificant to achieve His purposes, reminiscent of David's use of a sling against Goliath.<p><b>reached out his hand and took it</b><br>Samson's action of reaching out and taking the jawbone demonstrates his initiative and willingness to act in faith. This phrase emphasizes the personal responsibility and courage required to step into God's calling. It also reflects the biblical principle that God often requires human cooperation to accomplish His divine plans. Samson's act can be seen as a type of Christ, who willingly took on the role of Savior, using what was available to fulfill God's mission.<p><b>and struck down a thousand men</b><br>The defeat of a thousand men with a single jawbone is a testament to the supernatural strength given to Samson by the Spirit of the Lord. This miraculous victory serves as a reminder of God's power to deliver His people against overwhelming odds. It parallels other biblical accounts where God grants victory to His chosen leaders, such as Gideon's defeat of the Midianites with just 300 men. This event foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and death, achieved through His sacrificial death and resurrection. The number "thousand" often symbolizes completeness or a large multitude in Scripture, emphasizing the totality of the victory God provided through Samson.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his extraordinary strength, which was a gift from God.

The principle: use what God provides, however unlikely, because victory depends on Him, not the instrument.<p>&#8226; By taking the jawbone, Samson openly rejects Philistine weapons, underscoring that Israel&#8217;s real strength is the LORD (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and struck down a thousand men</b><p>&#8226; The numbers are literal and astounding, yet they align with covenant promises: &#8220;Five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/26-8.htm">Leviticus 26:8</a>; cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>).<p>&#8226; The Spirit-empowered exploit parallels other lone-warrior victories: Jonathan and his armor-bearer routing a garrison (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6, 13</a>&#8211;14) and Eleazar striking until his hand froze to the sword (<a href="/2_samuel/23-9.htm">2 Samuel 23:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; The jawbone becomes a testimony of divine might; Samson later names the place Ramath-lehi, &#8220;Jawbone Hill&#8221; (<a href="/judges/15-17.htm">Judges 15:17</a>). As with David&#8217;s triumph over Goliath, the battle belongs to the LORD (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p>&#8226; Human odds are irrelevant when God intervenes.

Samson&#8217;s immediate obedience turns availability into victory, fulfilling covenant promises that one could chase a thousand. The account calls every believer to trust God&#8217;s provision, act in faith with whatever is in hand, and remember that true strength and deliverance come from the LORD alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">A new jawbone.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">a moist jawbone--i.e., </span>the jawbone of an animal recently dead, and before the bone had become brittle. In this instance, at any rate, Samson might feel himself absolved from the rule of ceremonial cleanness, which forbad him as a Nazarite to touch carcases. A jawbone is a mighty magic weapon in one of the Polynesian legends (Grey, <span class= "ital">Polyn.

If Goliath was able single-handed to strike terror into the whole army of Israel, Samson with his long locks and colossal strength would be still more likely to strike a terror into the Philistines, and all the more because a supernatural awe was doubtless attached by this time to his name and person. The very fact that, though armed only with this wretched weapon of offence, he yet dared to rush upon the Philistines would make them fly in wilder panic (<a href="/joshua/23-10.htm" title="One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fights for you, as he has promised you.">Joshua 23:10</a>). "One man of you shall chase a thousand; for the Lord your God He it is that fighteth for you, as He hath promised you." (Comp. Leviticus 26; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-30.htm" title="How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>.) So we read that one of David's heroes slew three hundred men (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-11.htm" title="And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.">1Chronicles 11:11</a>; comp. <a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm" title="These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.">2Samuel 23:8</a>). The Philistines, dull and superstitious, seem to have been peculiarly liable to these panics (<a href="/context/1_samuel/14-4.htm" title="And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.">1Samuel 14:4-18</a>).
