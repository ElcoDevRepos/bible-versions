The mention of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, introduces a key figure in the narrative. The Kenites were a nomadic tribe, descendants of Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, and were generally at peace with Israel. Jael's tent is significant as it represents a place of supposed safety for Sisera, yet it becomes the setting for his downfall. This reflects the unexpected ways God can deliver His people, using unlikely individuals to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>because there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite</b><br>The peace between Jabin, the Canaanite king, and Heber the Kenite suggests a political alliance or at least a non-aggression pact. This context explains why Sisera would seek refuge there, expecting hospitality and safety. The Kenites' neutrality or alliance with Jabin contrasts with their historical connection to Israel, creating a complex political landscape. This situation sets the stage for Jael's decisive action, which defies expected loyalties and aligns with God's deliverance of Israel.

Sisera seeks protection where he expects least resistance, yet God often overturns worldly expectations (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>).<p>&#8226; Tents also echo earlier wilderness settings where God&#8217;s people trusted Him daily (<a href="/exodus/33-7.htm">Exodus 33:7-11</a>), contrasting Israel&#8217;s dependence on God with Sisera&#8217;s self-reliance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the wife of Heber the Kenite</b><p>&#8226; Jael&#8217;s identity connects her to the Kenites, descendants of Moses&#8217; father-in-law (<a href="/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29-32</a>).

The verse invites believers to trust God&#8217;s unseen strategy, recognize that worldly strength cannot thwart His plans, and courageously align with His purposes regardless of prior loyalties.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael.</span>--In a different direction from that taken by his army, which fled towards Harosheth (Kimchi). The expression is probably used by anticipation. He could hardly have meant to fly to Jael rather than to Heber, until Jael came to meet him, unless there are circumstances unknown to us. Women had separate tents (<a href="/genesis/18-6.htm" title="And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes on the hearth.">Genesis 18:6</a>), and these were regarded as inviolably secure.

The name Jael means "gazelle" (like Tabitha, Dorcas), "a fit name for a Bedouin's wife--especially for one whose family had come from the rocks of Engedi, the spring of the wild goat or chamois" (Stanley).<p><span class= "bld">For there was peace.</span>--This enabled Sisera boldly to appeal to these nomads for <span class= "ital">dakheel</span>--the sacred duty of protection. A poor strolling Bedouin tribe might well be left by Jabin to its natural independence; tribute can only be secured from Fellahin--i.e., from settled tribes. Three days must have elapsed since the battle before it would be possible for Sisera to fly on foot from the Kishon to "the nomad's terebinth." It may well be conceived that the unfortunate general arrived there in miserable plight--a starving and ruined fugitive.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/4-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Meanwhile, Sisera</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1505;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1505;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;s&#238;&#183;s&#601;&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
