Judah, being the largest and most powerful tribe, was often seen as a leader among the tribes of Israel. This aligns with Jacob's blessing in <a href="/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8-10</a>, where Judah is prophesied to be a leader and ruler. The choice of Judah also foreshadows the eventual rise of King David and the lineage of Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the "Lion of the tribe of Judah" in <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>.<p><b>answered the LORD.</b><br>The phrase emphasizes that the directive comes directly from God, highlighting divine authority and guidance. Throughout the Old Testament, God communicates His will to the Israelites, often through leaders or prophets. This divine communication underscores the covenant relationship between God and His people, where God provides direction and expects obedience.<p><b>Indeed, I have delivered the land</b><br>This statement reflects God's sovereignty and His role in the fulfillment of His promises to the patriarchs, particularly the promise of land to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>. The use of the past tense "have delivered" indicates the certainty of God's promise, even before the physical conquest occurs. It reassures the Israelites of God's faithfulness and power.<p><b>into their hands.</b><br>The phrase signifies the transfer of control and possession of the land to the Israelites. It implies victory and success in their endeavors, contingent upon their obedience to God's commands. This concept of divine assistance in battle is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, as seen in the battles led by Joshua. It also serves as a reminder of the spiritual battles believers face, where victory is assured through faith and reliance on God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who guides and directs His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, known for its leadership and strength.

<a href="/judges/20-18.htm">Judges 20:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording highlights Judah&#8217;s responsibility: faith must translate into movement.<p>&#8226; For us, it underscores that God often appoints specific people or groups to take first steps, and obedience opens the way for others.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>answered the LORD</b><p>&#8226;
