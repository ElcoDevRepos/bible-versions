It was a place where Abraham and Jacob had encounters with God (<a href="/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8, 28</a>:19). The Israelites' gathering here signifies a return to a place of divine encounter and covenant. Bethel was a central location for worship and seeking God's guidance, highlighting the people's desire for divine intervention and reconciliation after the civil strife with the tribe of Benjamin.<p><b>and sat there before God until evening</b><br>Sitting before God indicates a posture of humility and submission, seeking divine presence and guidance. The duration "until evening" suggests a prolonged period of reflection, prayer, and possibly fasting, emphasizing the seriousness of their lament and the depth of their need for God's direction. This act of waiting on God is reminiscent of other biblical instances where waiting is associated with seeking God's will (<a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>).<p><b>lifting up their voices and weeping bitterly</b><br>The act of lifting their voices and weeping bitterly reflects profound grief and repentance. This emotional response is similar to other biblical expressions of lament, such as in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/6-6.htm">Psalm 6:6</a>) and the prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/9.htm">Jeremiah 9:1</a>). It indicates a communal acknowledgment of sin and the consequences of their actions, particularly the near extinction of the tribe of Benjamin. This weeping can be seen as a precursor to seeking God's mercy and forgiveness, paralleling the repentance seen in the story of Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The collective group of God's chosen people, who are experiencing deep sorrow and regret over the near extinction of the tribe of Benjamin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethel.htm">Bethel</a></b><br>A significant location in Israelite history, often associated with worship and encounters with God.

By returning here after the violent civil war, the tribes acknowledge God&#8217;s authority over national matters, just as Joshua had done when he set up an altar nearby (<a href="/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30-35</a>).<p>&#8226;

Israel had fasted and offered sacrifices the previous day (<a href="/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26</a>); now they extend that posture, illustrating earnest perseverance in seeking God&#8217;s will (<a href="/luke/18-7.htm">Luke 18:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lifting up their voices</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;lifting up their voices&#8230;&#8221;
