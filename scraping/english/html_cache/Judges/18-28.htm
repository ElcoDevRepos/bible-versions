In the context of the Book of Judges, this period was marked by a lack of centralized leadership in Israel, as "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). The absence of deliverance for Laish underscores the isolation and defenselessness of the city, which lacked the protection of a strong ally or military force. This situation is reminiscent of other biblical instances where cities or peoples were left without deliverance, such as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19).<p><b>because the city was far from Sidon</b><br>Laish's geographical distance from Sidon, a major Phoenician city, meant it was isolated from potential aid or support. Sidon was a significant city known for its trade and maritime prowess, but Laish's separation from it left the city vulnerable. This distance is significant in understanding the strategic decisions of the Danites, who sought a location that was both prosperous and easy to conquer. The remoteness of Laish from Sidon also reflects the broader theme of isolation and vulnerability in the ancient Near East.<p><b>and had no alliance with anyone</b><br>The lack of alliances made Laish an easy target for the Danites. In the ancient world, alliances were crucial for defense and survival, as they provided mutual protection and support. The absence of such alliances for Laish indicates a degree of complacency or overconfidence in their security. This situation contrasts with the Israelites, who often relied on alliances, albeit sometimes to their detriment, as seen in their interactions with surrounding nations throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>it was in a valley near Beth-rehob</b><br>The location of Laish in a valley near Beth-rehob suggests a fertile and desirable land, which would have been attractive to the Danites. Valleys were often associated with agricultural abundance, making them prime targets for settlement and conquest. Beth-rehob is mentioned in other biblical texts, such as <a href="/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>, indicating its significance in the region. The geographical setting underscores the strategic considerations of the Danites in choosing a new homeland.<p><b>And the Danites rebuilt the city and lived there</b><br>The rebuilding and settlement of the city by the Danites mark a significant moment in their tribal history. This act of rebuilding signifies not only physical reconstruction but also the establishment of a new identity and presence in the land. The Danites' actions reflect the broader theme of conquest and settlement in the Promised Land, as seen throughout the Book of Joshua. This event also foreshadows the later struggles and idolatry of the tribe of Dan, as they set up a carved image in the city (<a href="/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30-31</a>), highlighting the recurring theme of Israel's faithfulness and apostasy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/danites.htm">Danites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel seeking a new territory due to their inability to secure their allotted inheritance.

Here the writer underscores absolute helplessness, setting the stage for the Danites&#8217; swift victory.<p>- The verse affirms the literal outworking of God&#8217;s earlier warnings: apart from His appointed saviors, human defenses prove futile (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because the city was far from Sidon</b><p>- Geographic isolation mattered.

Like the Ammonites attacking Jabesh-gilead before Saul&#8217;s reign (<a href="/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1-3</a>), the Danites struck a target too remote for allies to respond in time.<p>- The detail roots the narrative in real terrain, reminding us that God&#8217;s Word records actual places and distances.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and had no alliance with anyone</b><p>- Unlike Gibeon, which secured covenantal protection through shrewd diplomacy (<a href="/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3-15</a>), Laish stood alone.<p>- <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a> notes, &#8220;in an abundance of counselors there is safety,&#8221; yet Laish neglected political ties.<p>- Their independence became vulnerability; God&#8217;s Word warns that isolation, whether spiritual or national, invites danger (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it was in a valley near Beth-rehob</b><p>- Valleys offer rich soil and trade routes but limited natural defenses. Earlier spies prized the &#8220;quiet and unsuspecting&#8221; nature of this setting (<a href="/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7</a>).<p>- Beth-rehob appears again when Arameans muster there against Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>), indicating the area&#8217;s ongoing strategic value.<p>- The physical openness mirrors Laish&#8217;s spiritual openness to conquest&#8212;no fortified walls, no watchfulness (cf. <a href="/proverbs/24-31.htm">Proverbs 24:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the Danites rebuilt the city and lived there</b><p>- After burning Laish (<a href="/judges/18-27.htm">Judges 18:27</a>), the tribe rebuilt and renamed it Dan, anchoring their northern inheritance (<a href="/judges/18-29.htm">Judges 18:29</a>; <a href="/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>).<p>- Settlement followed by immediate idolatry (<a href="/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30-31</a>) reveals how quickly victory can turn to spiritual compromise.<p>- Yet the historical fact stands: God allowed Dan to secure territory, fulfilling Israel&#8217;s broader mandate to possess the land (<a href="/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43-45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/18-28.htm">Judges 18:28</a> records a swift conquest made possible by Laish&#8217;s total vulnerability&#8212;no deliverer, no allies, distant help, and an exposed valley location.
