The unity of Israel here contrasts with the earlier disunity seen throughout the period of the Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). This moment of unity is significant in the narrative, as it shows a rare instance of the tribes coming together for a common cause.<p><b>and arrayed themselves at Baal-tamar</b><br>Baal-tamar is a location near Gibeah, and its name suggests a place associated with a deity, "Baal," which was common in Canaanite religion. The Israelites' positioning here is strategic, indicating their readiness for battle. The use of "arrayed" suggests military organization and preparedness, reflecting the seriousness of their mission. This location is not frequently mentioned in Scripture, but its mention here underscores the tactical planning involved in the conflict.<p><b>and the Israelites in ambush charged from their positions</b><br>The ambush tactic employed by the Israelites is reminiscent of earlier biblical battles, such as the battle of Ai in <a href="/joshua/8.htm">Joshua 8</a>, where a similar strategy was used. This method of warfare demonstrates the Israelites' reliance on cunning and strategy, rather than sheer numbers or strength. It also reflects the divine guidance often seen in Israel's military campaigns, where God provides wisdom and direction for victory.<p><b>west of Gibeah</b><br>Gibeah, a Benjaminite city, is central to the narrative of <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19-21</a>. The geographical reference to the west of Gibeah indicates the specific positioning of the ambush, which was crucial for the success of the Israelites' plan. Gibeah's location in the tribal territory of Benjamin is significant, as it was the site of the atrocity that sparked the conflict. The mention of the direction "west" may also have symbolic implications, as westward movements in the Bible sometimes signify moving away from God's presence, which could reflect the moral decline seen in the narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_israel.htm">Men of Israel</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel, excluding Benjamin, who are engaged in a civil war against the tribe of Benjamin due to the grievous sin committed in Gibeah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/baal_tamar.htm">Baal Tamar</a></b><br>A location near Gibeah where the Israelite forces positioned themselves.

The army rises in unity, takes disciplined formation at Baal-tamar, and unleashes a well-planned ambush west of the city. Each movement reflects obedience to divine instruction, strategic wisdom modeled in previous victories, and the Lord&#8217;s commitment to purge sin and restore righteousness among His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">Put themselves in array at Baal-tamar.</span>--This is either a detail added out of place (so that we might almost suppose that there has been some accidental transposition of clauses), or it means that when the Israelites in their pretended rout had got as far as Baal-tamar ("Lord of the Palm") they saw the appointed smoke-signal of the ambuscade, and at that point rallied against their pursuers. What makes this probable is that Baal-tamar can only have derived its name from some famous, and therefore isolated, palm-tree. Now there was exactly such a palm tree--the well known "Palm of Deborah" (see Note on <a href="/judges/4-5.htm" title="And she dwelled under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.">Judges 4:5</a>)--"between Ramah and Bethel," and therefore at a little distance from the spot where the roads branch. The place was still called Bathamar in the days of Eusebius and Jerome. The Chaldee rendering, "in the plains of Jericho" ("the palm city," <a href="/judges/1-16.htm" title="And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelled among the people.">Judges 1:16</a>), is singularly erroneous.<p><span class= "bld">Out of the meadows of Gibeah.</span>--The word <span class= "ital">maareh, </span>rendered "meadows," occurs nowhere else. Some derive it from <span class= "ital">arah, </span>"to strip." The LXX., not understanding it, render it as a name, <span class= "ital">Maraagabe, </span>and in Cod. A (following a different reading), "from the west of Gibeah," as also does the Vulg. Rashi renders it, "because of the stripping of Gibeah," and Buxtorf, "after the stripping of Gibeah." It is, however, clear that the words are in apposition to and in explanation of "out of their places:" The Syriac and Arabic understand <span class= "ital">maareh </span>to mean "a cave" or "caves," printing it <span class= "ital">maarah </span>instead of <span class= "ital">maareh. </span>Similarly the reading "from the west" only involves the change of a single letter (<span class= "ital">maarab</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>If the text be left unaltered, the "meadows" may have been concealed from the town by intervening rocks. In <a href="/isaiah/19-7.htm" title="The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no more.">Isaiah 19:7</a> <span class= "ital">aroth </span>mean "pastures."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rose up out of their place</span>. The narrative is singularly obscure and broken, and difficult to follow. But the meaning seems to be, that when the Israelite army had reached Baal-tamar in their flight, they suddenly stopped and formed to give battle to the pursuing Benjamites. And at the same time the liers in wait came out from their ambushment and placed themselves in the rear of the Benjamites on the direct road to Gibeah. <span class="cmt_word">Baal</span>-<span class="cmt_word">tamar</span>, a place of palm trees. The site has not been identified, but may possibly, or probably, be the same as the palm tree of Deborah, between Ramah and Bethel (<a href="/judges/4-5.htm">Judges 4:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The meadows of Gibeah</span>, Hebrew, <span class="accented">Maareh-Geba</span>, may very likely have been, as the Septuagint takes it, a proper name, denoting some locality outside Gibeah (here called Geba) where the ambush was concealed. The meaning of the word <span class="accented">maareh</span> is thought to be a bare tract of ground without trees - something like a heath or common. It may have had pits, or deep depressions, where the ambush would be hid both from the city itself and from the high road, or other facilities for concealment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/20-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1465;&#1443;&#1500;
