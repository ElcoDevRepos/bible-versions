The man is a Levite, a member of the tribe set apart for religious duties in Israel. The presence of a concubine highlights the cultural practices of the time, where concubinage was a socially accepted arrangement, though not God's ideal for marriage. The servant's inclusion indicates the man's social status and the practicalities of travel in ancient Israel.<p><b>his father-in-law, the girl&#8217;s father, said to him</b><br>The father-in-law's role is significant in the cultural context of hospitality and family honor. In ancient Near Eastern societies, the father-in-law had a vested interest in the well-being of his daughter and her household. This interaction reflects the familial bonds and obligations that were central to the social fabric of the time.<p><b>&#8220;Look, the day is drawing to a close. Please spend the night.</b><br>The father-in-law's insistence on staying reflects the cultural importance of hospitality. In biblical times, travel was fraught with danger, and night travel was particularly risky. Offering shelter was a way to ensure safety and demonstrate generosity, a virtue highly esteemed in the ancient world.<p><b>See, the day is almost over. Spend the night here, that your heart may be merry.</b><br>This repetition emphasizes the urgency and sincerity of the father-in-law's request. The phrase "that your heart may be merry" suggests a desire for the Levite to enjoy rest and fellowship, which aligns with the biblical theme of hospitality as a means of fostering community and joy.<p><b>Then you can get up early tomorrow for your journey home.&#8221;</b><br>The suggestion to leave early the next day indicates a practical concern for the Levite's safety and well-being. Traveling in daylight was safer and more efficient. This reflects the wisdom literature's emphasis on planning and prudence, as seen in Proverbs, where careful preparation is often commended.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A central figure in this account, the Levite is traveling with his concubine.
