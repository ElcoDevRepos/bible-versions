In biblical narratives, morning often symbolizes a time of decision or action (e.g., <a href="/genesis/19-27.htm">Genesis 19:27</a>, <a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24</a>). It sets the stage for the events that follow, highlighting the contrast between the darkness of the previous night and the light of day.<p><b>when her master got up</b><br>The term "master" reflects the patriarchal society of ancient Israel, where men held authority over women, including concubines. This relationship is complex, as concubines were considered part of the household but had fewer rights than wives. The Levite's actions throughout the chapter reveal a lack of compassion and responsibility, which is a recurring theme in Judges, illustrating the moral decline of Israel during this period.<p><b>and opened the doors of the house</b><br>Opening the doors signifies a transition from the private to the public sphere. In biblical times, the act of opening doors could symbolize readiness to face the world or to reveal what is hidden. This action foreshadows the discovery of the tragic events that occurred during the night.<p><b>to go out on his journey</b><br>The Levite's intention to continue his journey underscores his disregard for the gravity of the situation. It reflects the self-centeredness and moral apathy prevalent in the narrative. This journey motif is common in Scripture, often representing a physical and spiritual path (e.g., Abraham's journey in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a>).<p><b>there was his concubine</b><br>The presence of the concubine at this moment is a stark reminder of the previous night's violence and the Levite's failure to protect her. Her status as a concubine, rather than a wife, highlights her vulnerability and the societal norms that devalued her life. This tragic event serves as a critique of the social and moral decay in Israel.<p><b>collapsed in the doorway of the house</b><br>The doorway is a significant location, symbolizing a threshold between safety and danger, life and death. Her collapse here emphasizes the failure of the household to provide protection and the broader failure of Israel to uphold justice and righteousness.<p><b>with her hands on the threshold</b><br>This detail poignantly captures her desperate attempt to reach safety, evoking a sense of tragedy and helplessness. The threshold, a place of transition, becomes a symbol of her unfulfilled hope for rescue. This imagery can be seen as a metaphor for Israel's spiritual state, caught between covenant faithfulness and moral collapse.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A man from the tribe of Levi, who was traveling with his concubine. He is central to the account and his actions are pivotal in the unfolding events.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_concubine.htm">The Concubine</a></b><br>The Levite's concubine, who suffered abuse and ultimately died. Her tragic fate is a catalyst for the subsequent events in Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a></b><br>A town in the territory of Benjamin where the events took place.

Sunrise simply exposes the prior night&#8217;s darkness&#8212;sin no longer hidden but laid bare (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>). Israel is living in the period when &#8220;everyone did what was right in his own eyes&#8221; (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>), and this opening phrase quietly reminds us that the nation&#8217;s moral night has lasted far too long.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when her master got up</b><p>The Levite rises, apparently rested, while his concubine lies abused outside. His callousness echoes the selfish slumber of Jonah amid a storm (<a href="/jonah/1-5.htm">Jonah 1:5-6</a>) and contrasts with true covenant love that &#8220;seeks not its own&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-5.htm">1 Corinthians 13:5</a>). A spiritual leader who should embody compassion instead models indifference, fulfilling <a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>&#8212;&#8220;the compassion of the wicked is cruel.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and opened the doors of the house</b><p>Opening the doors should have welcomed life and blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-6.htm">Deuteronomy 28:6</a>), yet here it unveils death. The doorway becomes a stage where hidden sin steps into the light (<a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11-13</a>). Like Lot opening his door in <a href="/genesis/19-6.htm">Genesis 19:6</a>, this doorway frames a moment of moral crisis, revealing how far God&#8217;s people have drifted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to go out on his journey</b><p>The Levite prepares to resume his itinerary as though nothing extraordinary has happened, mirroring the priest and Levite who passed by the wounded man in <a href="/luke/10-31.htm">Luke 10:31-32</a>. Convenience overrides compassion; plans outweigh people. His haste shows a heart unmoved by the suffering next to him, even though <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a> calls God&#8217;s people to &#8220;do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>there was his concubine</b><p>The text does not name her, emphasizing her vulnerability and how readily she is treated as property rather than partner. God&#8217;s intent from Eden is that a man &#8220;hold fast to his wife&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>), yet this Levite treats her as disposable. The phrase confronts us with the objectification that always accompanies spiritual decay (<a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>collapsed in the doorway of the house</b><p>Her body is &#8220;collapsed,&#8221; echoing Sisera who &#8220;fell, lay still&#8221; in <a href="/judges/5-27.htm">Judges 5:27</a>. The doorway&#8212;meant for hospitality&#8212;now frames the cost of unrestrained lust (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>). The house that promised shelter has failed her, just as Israel&#8217;s tribal society has failed to protect the vulnerable (<a href="/psalms/82-3.htm">Psalm 82:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with her hands on the threshold</b><p>Her outstretched hands evoke a desperate reach for safety she never attained. Thresholds in Scripture can be places of protection (<a href="/exodus/12-22.htm">Exodus 12:22-23</a>) or judgment (<a href="/1_samuel/5-4.htm">1 Samuel 5:4</a>). Here the threshold testifies against covenant unfaithfulness: she almost crossed into refuge but died inches away. It is a sobering picture of a nation needing true deliverance, which only God can provide (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/19-27.htm">Judges 19:27</a> captures, scene by scene, the tragedy of a people estranged from God: a new morning without new mercy, a spiritual leader without compassion, a doorway without protection, and a threshold stained by sin&#8217;s wages. The verse exposes Israel&#8217;s heart&#8212;and ours&#8212;apart from obedient faith. Even in the darkest account, Scripture invites us to see the cost of rebellion and the urgency of returning to the Lord who alone can turn night into true day (<a href="/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">Her hands were upon the threshold.</span>--As though they had been stretched out towards her husband in one last agony of appeal (Vulg., <span class= "ital">sparsis in limine cnanibus</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The woman was fallen down at the door</span>, etc. Poor thing!
