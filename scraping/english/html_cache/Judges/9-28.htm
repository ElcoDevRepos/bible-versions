His father, Ebed, is otherwise unknown, suggesting Gaal's outsider status. This sets the stage for conflict, as Gaal seeks to incite rebellion against Abimelech.<p><b>Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him?</b><br>Gaal questions Abimelech's legitimacy, highlighting the tension between Abimelech and the people of Shechem. Abimelech, though a son of Gideon (Jerubbaal), lacks the divine calling that Gideon had. Shechem, a significant city in Israel's history, was a place of covenant renewal (<a href="/joshua/24-25.htm">Joshua 24:25</a>). Gaal's rhetorical question challenges the authority and loyalty to Abimelech, suggesting that neither he nor the city deserves allegiance.<p><b>Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is not Zebul his officer?</b><br>Jerubbaal, another name for Gideon, means "let Baal contend." Gaal uses this to remind the people of Abimelech's mixed heritage and questionable claim to leadership. Zebul, Abimelech's officer, is portrayed as a mere subordinate, further undermining Abimelech's authority. This reflects the political instability and lack of unity in Israel during the time of the Judges.<p><b>You are to serve the men of Hamor, the father of Shechem.</b><br>Hamor was the father of Shechem, the city's namesake, mentioned in <a href="/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>. Gaal appeals to the Shechemites' ancestral pride and heritage, suggesting they should align with their historical roots rather than with Abimelech. This reference to Hamor evokes memories of past alliances and covenants, urging the people to reconsider their loyalties.<p><b>Why should we serve Abimelech?</b><br>Gaal's final question is a direct challenge to Abimelech's rule, emphasizing the lack of legitimate reason for the Shechemites to support him. This reflects the broader theme in Judges of Israel's struggle with leadership and faithfulness to God. Gaal's rebellion is a microcosm of the larger cycle of disobedience and deliverance that characterizes the period of the Judges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gaal_son_of_ebed.htm">Gaal son of Ebed</a></b><br>A newcomer to Shechem who challenges Abimelech's authority, questioning his legitimacy and encouraging the people to serve the original Shechemite leaders.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (Jerubbaal) who made himself king over Shechem through manipulation and violence, including the murder of his brothers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>An ancient city with significant historical and religious importance, often associated with covenantal events in Israel's history.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerubbaal.htm">Jerubbaal (Gideon)</a></b><br>Abimelech's father, a judge of Israel who led the people to victory against the Midianites but refused kingship, emphasizing God's rule over Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/z/zebul.htm">Zebul</a></b><br>An officer of Abimelech in Shechem, loyal to Abimelech and opposed to Gaal's rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/q/questioning_authority.htm">Questioning Authority</a></b><br>Gaal's challenge to Abimelech reminds us to discern the legitimacy and righteousness of those in authority over us.

Abimelech shares Gideon&#8217;s blood but none of his faith.<p>&#8226; By stressing Gideon&#8217;s name, Gaal reminds listeners that Abimelech is only a half-Israelite, born to Gideon&#8217;s concubine from Shechem (<a href="/judges/8-31.htm">Judges 8:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Zebul, the city prefect (<a href="/judges/9-30.htm">Judges 9:30</a>), is painted as an outsider&#8217;s puppet.

Mentioning him evokes ancestral dignity and native rule.<p>&#8226; Gaal urges the Shechemites to recall covenantal identity much as Joshua had rallied Israel to remember its heritage (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement suggests local leadership&#8212;including Gaal&#8212;deserves their loyalty, not a foreign-spirited king.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why should we serve Abimelech?</b><p>&#8226; Gaal&#8217;s closing question drives the point home: there is no moral, familial, or covenantal obligation to submit to Abimelech&#8217;s kingship.<p>&#8226; Similar rhetorical challenges precede God&#8217;s judgment on illegitimate authority (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>; <a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p>&#8226; In the narrative that follows, the LORD vindicates this challenge by turning Shechem against Abimelech and fulfilling Jotham&#8217;s curse (<a href="/judges/9-22.htm">Judges 9:22&#8211;57</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/9-28.htm">Judges 9:28</a> records Gaal&#8217;s bold speech that strips Abimelech of legitimacy, appeals to Shechem&#8217;s ancient heritage, and calls the city to reject oppressive rule. By contrasting Abimelech&#8217;s dubious lineage and ruthless methods with the honorable memory of Hamor and Gideon, Gaal ignites a revolt that God ultimately uses to judge both parties, proving once again that allegiance rightly belongs to the LORD and to leaders who honor His covenant.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Who is Abimelech?</span>--This is obviously contemptuous, like "Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse?" in <a href="/1_samuel/25-10.htm" title="And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.">1Samuel 25:10</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Who is Shechem?</span>--The meaning of this clause is very obscure. It can hardly be a <span class= "ital">contrast </span>between the insignificance of Abimelech and the grandeur of Shechem (Vulg., <span class= "ital">qu? est Shechem?</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Some say that "Shechem" means "Abimelech;" but there is no trace of kings assuming the name of the place over which they rule, nor does the LXX. mend matters much by interpolating the words, "who is <span class= "ital">the son of </span>Shechem?"<p><span class= "bld">The son of Jerubbaal?</span>--And, therefore, on the father's side, disconnected both with Ephraimites and Canaanites; and the Baal-fighter's son has no claim on Baal-worshippers.<p><span class= "bld">And Zebul his officer?</span>--We are not even under the rule of Abimelech, but of his underling.<p><span class= "bld">Serve the men of Hamor.</span>--Here the LXX., Vulg., and other versions adopt a different punctuation and a different reading. But there is no reason to alter the text. The Canaanites were powerful; the Ephraimites had apostatised to their religion; even Abimelech bears a Canaanite name (<a href="/genesis/26-1.htm" title="And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar.">Genesis 26:1</a>), and owed his power to his Hivite blood. Gaal says in effect. "Why should we serve this son of an upstart alien when we might return to the allegiance of the descendants of our old native prince Hamor, whose son Shechem was the <span class= "ital">hero eponymos </span>of the city?" (<a href="/genesis/33-19.htm" title="And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.">Genesis 33:19</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-32.htm" title="And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.">Joshua 24:32</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Gaal</span>, etc. Gaal now saw his opportunity, and encouraged the revolt. <span class="cmt_word">Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him?</span> The meaning of these words, though somewhat obscure at first, becomes plain if we compare the two similar passages, <a href="/1_samuel/25-10.htm">1 Samuel 25:10</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>. In the first we have the contemptuous question, "Who is David?" and in the second the analogous one, "What portion have we in David?" but in both we have the same person described by different terms: "Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse?" and, "What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse." Here, therefore, it is clear that <span class="accented">Shechem</span> is merely another name for <span class="accented">Abimelech</span>; and it is easy to see why. Abimelech's mother was a Canaanite bond-woman, a Shechemite; and the plea for making Abimelech king was, "for he is our brother" (vers. 2, 3). <span class="accented">Shechem</span>, or <span class="accented">the son of Shechem</span>, was therefore a natural description of Abimelech. But, adds Gaal, <span class="cmt_word">is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and</span> (is not) <span class="cmt_word">Zebul his officer?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he is not a real Shechemite; he is the son of Jerubbaal; and what right has he to reign over you Shechemites? And why should Zebul lord it over you? He is only Abimelech's officer, <span class="cmt_word">No; serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem</span>. Fling off the yoke of the Abi-ezrite stranger, and set up a real Canaanite government from the old race of Hamor, the true founder and head of Shechem (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/2-50.htm">1 Chronicles 2:50-52</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/9-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Gaal</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(ga&#183;&#8216;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1603.htm">Strong's 1603: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gaal -- probably a Canaanite</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Ebed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1431;&#1489;&#1462;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;e&#183;&#7687;e&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5651.htm">Strong's 5651: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ebed -- 'servant', two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;
