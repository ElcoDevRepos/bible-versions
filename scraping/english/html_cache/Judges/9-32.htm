It suggests urgency and immediacy, often used in biblical narratives to prompt a decisive moment. In the context of <a href="/judges/9.htm">Judges 9</a>, it marks a shift in the plot where a plan is about to be executed.<p><b>tonight</b><br>The use of "tonight" emphasizes the immediacy and secrecy of the action. Nighttime operations in biblical times were often associated with stealth and surprise, as seen in other biblical accounts such as Gideon's attack on the Midianites (<a href="/judges/7-9.htm">Judges 7:9-25</a>). The cover of darkness provides a tactical advantage.<p><b>you and the people with you</b><br>This phrase highlights the involvement of a group, indicating that the action is not solitary but requires collective effort. It reflects the communal nature of ancient Israelite society, where leaders often acted with the support of their followers. This can be compared to other instances where leaders like David or Joshua led their people into battle.<p><b>are to come and lie in wait</b><br>The strategy of lying in wait is a common military tactic in the Bible, used to ambush or surprise an enemy. This tactic is seen in other biblical narratives, such as Joshua's ambush of Ai (<a href="/joshua/8-2.htm">Joshua 8:2-9</a>). It reflects the cunning and strategic planning often necessary in warfare during this period.<p><b>in the fields</b><br>Fields in ancient Israel were not only agricultural spaces but also common locations for military maneuvers and battles. The choice of fields for lying in wait suggests a strategic use of the landscape, taking advantage of open spaces for concealment and surprise. This setting is reminiscent of other biblical battles that took place in similar environments, such as the battle between David and Goliath in the Valley of Elah (1 Samuel 17).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal), who declared himself king over Shechem after killing his seventy brothers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gaal_son_of_ebed.htm">Gaal son of Ebed</a></b><br>A man who opposed Abimelech and sought to lead a rebellion against him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/zebul.htm">Zebul</a></b><br>The ruler of the city of Shechem who remained loyal to Abimelech and informed him of Gaal's plans.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>An ancient city in the land of Canaan, significant in Israel's history, where Abimelech was made king.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fields_of_shechem.htm">Fields of Shechem</a></b><br>The location where Abimelech and his men were instructed to lie in wait to ambush Gaal and his followers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_ambition.htm">The Dangers of Ambition</a></b><br>Abimelech's account warns against unchecked ambition and the pursuit of power at any cost.
