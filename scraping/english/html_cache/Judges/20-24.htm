This battle is part of a larger narrative that began with a grievous crime in Gibeah, leading to a civil war within Israel. The second day suggests persistence and determination in the Israelites' efforts, despite their initial defeat. It reflects the ongoing struggle and the need for perseverance in the face of adversity, a theme echoed in other biblical narratives such as the Israelites' journey through the wilderness.<p><b>the Israelites advanced</b><br>The Israelites' advance signifies a strategic military movement. This action demonstrates their resolve to address the sin within their community, as the tribe of Benjamin had refused to surrender the perpetrators of the crime in Gibeah. The advance can be seen as an act of justice, aligning with the biblical principle of purging evil from among the people (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5</a>). It also highlights the unity of the other tribes of Israel in their collective response to the moral corruption within their nation.<p><b>against the Benjamites</b><br>The Benjamites, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, were known for their warrior skills and valor (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-40.htm">1 Chronicles 8:40</a>). This internal conflict underscores the tragic division within the chosen people of God, reminiscent of other familial and tribal conflicts in the Bible, such as the strife between Jacob's sons. The Benjamites' resistance to the collective will of the other tribes illustrates the dangers of pride and isolation. This battle foreshadows future divisions within Israel, ultimately leading to the split into the northern and southern kingdoms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel, excluding Benjamin, who are seeking justice for the crime committed in Gibeah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamites.htm">Benjamites</a></b><br>The tribe of Benjamin, who are defending themselves against the other tribes of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a></b><br>A city in the territory of Benjamin where a grievous crime was committed, leading to the conflict.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/second_day.htm">Second Day</a></b><br>Refers to the continuation of battle efforts by the Israelites against the Benjamites after an initial defeat.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/battle.htm">Battle</a></b><br>The ongoing conflict between the Israelites and the Benjamites, which is part of a larger account of civil strife within Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>The Israelites' repeated inquiries to God before battle underscore the importance of seeking divine guidance in our decisions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/justice_and_righteousness.htm">Justice and Righteousness</a></b><br>The conflict arises from a desire to address a grave injustice, reminding us of the need to stand against wrongdoing in our communities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_adversity.htm">Perseverance in Adversity</a></b><br>Despite initial setbacks, the Israelites continue their efforts, teaching us the value of perseverance in the face of challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_and_division.htm">Unity and Division</a></b><br>The internal conflict among the tribes of Israel serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of division within the body of believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_sin.htm">Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>The entire account is a stark reminder of how sin can lead to devastating consequences, affecting not just individuals but entire communities.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Judges_20_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Judges 20:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Judges_20_24_God_s_guidance_in_battle.htm">How does Judges 20:24 illustrate the importance of seeking God's guidance in battles?
