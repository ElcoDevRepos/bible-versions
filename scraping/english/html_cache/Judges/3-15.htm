This cycle reflects the Israelites' dependence on God and their tendency to turn away from Him, only to return in times of distress. The act of crying out signifies repentance and acknowledgment of their need for divine intervention.<p><b>and He raised up Ehud son of Gera</b><br>God's response to the Israelites' cry is to raise up a deliverer, demonstrating His mercy and faithfulness. Ehud, the son of Gera, is chosen by God to lead and deliver Israel. This highlights the divine initiative in the deliverance process, emphasizing that salvation comes from God, not human effort.<p><b>a left-handed Benjamite</b><br>Ehud's left-handedness is significant, as it is mentioned specifically. In the tribe of Benjamin, which means "son of the right hand," being left-handed is unusual and noteworthy. This characteristic plays a crucial role in Ehud's ability to deliver Israel, as it allows him to conceal a weapon and surprise Eglon. It also illustrates how God uses unexpected means and people to accomplish His purposes.<p><b>as their deliverer</b><br>Ehud is appointed as a deliverer, a role similar to that of a judge, tasked with leading Israel out of oppression. This foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who delivers humanity from sin. The concept of a deliverer is central to the narrative of Judges, where God raises leaders to rescue His people.<p><b>So they sent him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab</b><br>The Israelites are under the subjugation of Eglon, king of Moab, and are required to pay tribute, indicating their oppressed state. The tribute is a symbol of their servitude and the political dynamics of the time. Ehud's mission to deliver the tribute sets the stage for his plan to assassinate Eglon, which leads to Israel's liberation. This reflects the political and military strategies employed in ancient Near Eastern cultures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ehud.htm">Ehud</a></b><br>A left-handed man from the tribe of Benjamin, chosen by God to deliver Israel from Moabite oppression.

The phrase &#8220;again&#8221; reminds us of the familiar cycle in Judges&#8212;rebellion, oppression, repentance, deliverance (<a href="/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18-19</a>). Crying out is not a mere scream of pain; it is a confession of need that acknowledges God as the only rescuer, just as Israel did in earlier bondage (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-25</a>) and would later do in Samson&#8217;s day (<a href="/judges/15-18.htm">Judges 15:18</a>). <a href="/psalms/107-13.htm">Psalm 107:13</a> captures the pattern: &#8220;Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble; He saved them from their distress.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He raised up Ehud son of Gera</b><p>God personally &#8220;raised up&#8221; the next judge, emphasizing His active sovereignty. The deliverer is not self-appointed; he is chosen, equipped, and sent by the LORD (<a href="/judges/2-16.htm">Judges 2:16</a>). Ehud hails from Benjamin, a tribe small in number but often highlighted when God wants to show that salvation comes &#8220;not by might nor by power&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>; see also <a href="/1_samuel/9-21.htm">1 Samuel 9:21</a>). The mention of Gera roots Ehud in a real family line, underscoring the historical reliability of the narrative.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a left-handed Benjamite</b><p>Left-handedness was uncommon and tactically advantageous. <a href="/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a> notes 700 left-handed slingers from Benjamin&#8212;apparently, the tribe trained ambidextrous warriors. Ironically, &#8220;Benjamin&#8221; means &#8220;son of the right hand,&#8221; yet God chooses a man noted for using his left. It is a subtle reminder that the LORD delights to work through unexpected means (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>), turning what some might view as a limitation into a strategic edge.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as their deliverer</b><p>The term &#8220;deliverer&#8221; (judged) implies more than military heroism; it carries the idea of salvation. Ehud prefigures the ultimate Deliverer, Christ, whom God &#8220;raised up&#8230; a horn of salvation&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-69.htm">Luke 1:69</a>). In every judge we see a shadow of the greater redemption story: God hears, God sends, God saves (<a href="/isaiah/19-20.htm">Isaiah 19:20</a>). Ehud&#8217;s specific commission is to liberate Israel from Moab&#8217;s heavy oppression (<a href="/judges/3-14.htm">Judges 3:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So they sent him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab</b><p>Tribute signifies subjugation&#8212;regular payments of goods or silver to a foreign ruler (<a href="/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>). By sending Ehud, Israel outwardly complies with Moab&#8217;s demands while, inwardly, God is setting Eglon up for downfall. Ehud&#8217;s left-handedness allows him to conceal a sword on his right thigh, an unexpected location for guards to check, paving the way for the daring assassination in verses 16-26. The scene illustrates <a href="/psalms/18-27.htm">Psalm 18:27</a>&#8212;&#8220;You save an afflicted people, but haughty eyes You abase.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15</a> shows the faithful pattern of a holy God responding to repentant cries. He selects an unlikely hero&#8212;Ehud, the left-handed Benjamite&#8212;to demonstrate that deliverance is His work alone. The tribute mission becomes a divine setup for liberation. The verse invites us to trust that when God&#8217;s people genuinely call on Him, He will raise up exactly the right means, however unconventional, to bring salvation and break every yoke.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Ehud the son of Gera.</span>--In <a href="/genesis/46-21.htm" title="And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.">Genesis 46:21</a> Gera is a son of Benjamin; in <a href="/1_chronicles/8-3.htm" title="And the sons of Bela were, Addar, and Gera, and Abihud,">1Chronicles 8:3</a> he is a son of Bela, son of Benjamin.

A left-handed man wearing no sword or dagger on his left side, and using his right hand for other purposes, would naturally throw a man off his guard.
