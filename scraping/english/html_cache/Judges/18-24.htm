The making of gods refers to the creation of idols, which was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4-5</a>). The context here is the story of Micah, who had crafted a carved image and a metal idol, violating the commandment against idolatry. This reflects the spiritual decline and syncretism in Israel, where people mixed the worship of Yahweh with pagan practices. The making of gods also underscores the futility of idolatry, as these gods were man-made and powerless, contrasting with the omnipotent God of Israel.<p><b>and my priest,</b><br>Micah had appointed his own son as a priest and later hired a Levite to serve as his personal priest (<a href="/judges/17-5.htm">Judges 17:5, 10</a>-12). This action was contrary to the established Levitical priesthood, which was supposed to serve at the Tabernacle and later the Temple. The Levite's willingness to serve as a priest for Micah's idols indicates the corruption and lack of adherence to God's laws during this period. This reflects the theme of the book of Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>), highlighting the moral and spiritual chaos of the time.<p><b>and went away.</b><br>The tribe of Dan, seeking a territory to settle, took Micah's idols and priest as they moved northward to capture the city of Laish (<a href="/judges/18-27.htm">Judges 18:27-29</a>). This movement signifies the Danites' departure from their allotted inheritance and their failure to trust in God's provision. The taking of the idols and priest symbolizes the spread of idolatry and the further decline of true worship in Israel. It also foreshadows the establishment of a rival center of worship in Dan, which would later become a center of idolatry in the Northern Kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>).<p><b>What else do I have?</b><br>Micah's lament reveals his misplaced trust and dependence on material and spiritual possessions rather than on God. His question underscores the emptiness and insecurity that come from relying on idols and human institutions. This serves as a warning against idolatry and the danger of placing one's hope in anything other than God. It echoes the biblical theme that true security and fulfillment are found only in a relationship with the living God (<a href="/psalms/16-2.htm">Psalm 16:2</a>).<p><b>How can you say to me, &#8216;What is the matter with you?&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights Micah's sense of injustice and loss. It reflects the moral confusion and lack of accountability during the time of the Judges. The Danites' indifference to Micah's plight illustrates the breakdown of community and covenantal relationships in Israel. This phrase also serves as a critique of the moral relativism that characterized the era, where personal desires and ambitions often overrode communal and divine standards. It calls readers to reflect on the importance of aligning one's life with God's will and the consequences of straying from His commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1.

44:15&#8211;17</a>; <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>).<p>&#8226; His outrage reveals how tightly a heart can cling to something that directly breaks the second commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4-5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>).<p>&#8226; When the tribe of Dan simply picks up the images and walks off, the scene underlines the helplessness of any substitute for the living God (<a href="/jeremiah/10-3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And my priest</b><p>Micah&#8217;s second loss is the Levite he hired (<a href="/judges/17-10.htm">Judges 17:10-13</a>).<p>&#8226; God had already appointed where true worship and priestly service belonged (<a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Micah&#8217;s &#8220;personal chaplain&#8221; shows how easily convenience can replace obedience, much like later kings who &#8220;made priests from every class of people&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>).<p>&#8226; The Danites prize the same illegitimate arrangement, proving that misplaced religion spreads quickly when it promises benefit (<a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And went away</b><p>The raiders leave, and with them goes everything Micah trusted.<p>&#8226; Theft is wrong (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>), yet God allows this event to expose the fragility of counterfeit worship (<a href="/job/20-5.htm">Job 20:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Micah watches his security evaporate in moments&#8212;a vivid picture of those who &#8220;trust in riches and fall&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>).<p><hr

href="/mark/8-36.htm">Mark 8:36</a>).<p>&#8226; True treasure endures only when it is &#8220;in heaven, where no thief approaches&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-33.htm">Luke 12:33-34</a>).<p><hr

did what was right in his own eyes&#8221; (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus identifies the same impulse when He speaks of noticing a speck in another&#8217;s eye while ignoring the log in our own (<a href="/matthew/7-3.htm">Matthew 7:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/18-24.htm">Judges 18:24</a> reveals the emptiness of man-made religion. Micah&#8217;s handmade gods and hired priest, swept away in a moment, leave him with nothing. His lament uncovers the tragedy of trusting anything other than the Lord: idols cannot protect, possessions cannot last, and self-righteousness cannot justify. Real security rests only in the living God, whose truth and presence cannot be carried off by any thief.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">My gods which I made.</span>--He does not scruple to call the pesel and teraphim "gods" (his Elohim), any more than the idolater Laban had done (<a href="/genesis/30-31.htm" title="And he said, What shall I give you? And Jacob said, You shall not give me any thing: if you will do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep your flock.">Genesis 30:31</a>). The expression seems to be intended to show scorn for Micah; and perhaps it is from missing this element that the LXX. soften it down into "my graven image," and the Chaldee to "my fear." "My gods which I made" would be a very ordinary expression for the Greeks, who called a sculptor a "god-maker" (<span class= "ital">theopoios</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>but was startling on the lips of an Israelite. Micah pathetically asks "What have I more?" but we may well hope that his present loss was his ultimate gain, and that he found the true God in place of the lost gods which he had made.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My gods</span>, or, as some render it, <span class="accented">my god.</span> But the plural is probably right, as Micah was thinking of the molten and graven images, and the teraphim, and called them <span class="accented">gods</span>, without perhaps meaning to imply that there was any God but Jehovah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/18-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1441;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
