Her name is often associated with treachery and seduction. The Philistines were enemies of Israel, and Delilah's involvement with Samson highlights the recurring theme of Israel's entanglement with foreign nations. This relationship is a reflection of Israel's spiritual infidelity, as seen throughout the Book of Judges.<p><b>&#8220;You have mocked me and lied to me!</b><br>Delilah accuses Samson of deception, which is ironic given her own deceitful intentions. This interaction underscores the theme of betrayal and the consequences of straying from God's commandments. Samson's actions reflect his flawed character and foreshadow his eventual downfall. The motif of deception is prevalent in biblical narratives, such as Jacob's deception of Isaac (Genesis 27).<p><b>Now please tell me how you can be tied up.&#8221;</b><br>Delilah's request is a direct attempt to discover the secret of Samson's strength. This moment is critical as it leads to Samson's capture and humiliation. The request for binding echoes the theme of bondage and liberation found throughout the Bible, such as Israel's bondage in Egypt and subsequent deliverance. Samson's eventual capture serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of compromising one's divine calling.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God tied to his Nazirite vow.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/delilah.htm">Delilah</a></b><br>A Philistine woman who was used by the Philistine rulers to discover the secret of Samson's strength.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>The enemies of Israel during the time of the Judges, often in conflict with Samson.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazirite_vow.htm">Nazirite Vow</a></b><br>A special vow taken to set oneself apart for God, which included abstaining from cutting hair, consuming alcohol, and avoiding contact with dead bodies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/valley_of_sorek.htm">Valley of Sorek</a></b><br>The location where Samson met Delilah, a place associated with temptation and betrayal.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_compromise.htm">The Danger of Compromise</a></b><br>Samson's interactions with Delilah highlight the peril of compromising one's values and commitments, especially in relationships that lead us away from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_temptation.htm">Recognizing Temptation</a></b><br>Delilah's persistence is a reminder to be vigilant and discerning about the sources of temptation in our lives, understanding that they often come subtly and repeatedly.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_integrity.htm">The Importance of Integrity</a></b><br>Samson's deception of Delilah shows the importance of maintaining integrity and truthfulness, even when faced with pressure or manipulation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_our_hearts.htm">Guarding Our Hearts</a></b><br>The account encourages believers to guard their hearts and minds, being cautious about whom we allow to influence us and how we respond to their demands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_strength_in_our_weakness.htm">God's Strength in Our Weakness</a></b><br>Despite Samson's failures, his account ultimately points to God's ability to use even our weaknesses for His purposes, reminding us to rely on His strength rather than our own.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Judges_16_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Judges 16:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Delilah_s_persistence_our_resilience.htm">How does Delilah's persistence in Judges 16:10 challenge our spiritual resilience today?

This mirrors Satan&#8217;s ancient tactic of accusing the righteous (<a href="/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>).<p>- Her words aim at Samson&#8217;s emotions, not reason. <a href="/proverbs/7-21.htm">Proverbs 7:21</a> notes how &#8220;With her enticing speech she caused him to yield.&#8221;<p>- Samson has indeed lied, violating God&#8217;s command against bearing false witness (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). His casual treatment of truth foreshadows the greater compromise yet to come (cf. <a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p>- While Delilah claims moral injury, her heart is set on the silver promised by the Philistine rulers (<a href="/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Now please tell me how you can be tied up.&#8221;</b><p>- The request is specific and insistent; she wants the secret, not a trick. Each plea narrows the gap between temptation and sin (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>- Delilah&#8217;s persistence resembles that of the nagging widow in <a href="/luke/18-1.htm">Luke 18:1&#8211;5</a>, but here it serves evil rather than justice.<p>- Samson should have fled the situation, as Joseph did from Potiphar&#8217;s wife (<a href="/genesis/39-12.htm">Genesis 39:12</a>). Instead, he stays, inching toward surrender.<p>- The verse exposes the danger of trusting worldly love over covenant obedience. True safety lies not in secrecy but in faithfulness to God&#8217;s word (<a href="/psalms/119-9.htm">Psalm 119:9&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/16-10.htm">Judges 16:10</a> captures the tightening snare around Samson: Delilah speaks with feigned hurt, accuses him of deception, and persistently presses for the key to his downfall. Her words reveal a manipulative heart, while Samson&#8217;s presence shows a heart drifting from obedience. The verse teaches the peril of entertaining temptation, the cost of compromised truth, and the urgency of guarding one&#8217;s God-given calling before the enemy&#8217;s rope ever reaches our hands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Now tell me, I pray thee.</span>--Delilah would, of course, tell Samson that the scene had been merely playful jest, and that she had said "Philistines upon thee, Samson!" only to be delighted with one fresh exhibition of his great strength, if he really had not revealed the secret.
