His words often reflect his impulsive and vengeful nature, as seen throughout his narrative in the Book of Judges. Samson's actions and statements are frequently direct responses to personal grievances, highlighting the cycle of retribution prevalent in the period of the Judges.<p><b>With the jawbone of a donkey:</b><br>The jawbone of a donkey is an unconventional weapon, emphasizing the theme of God using the weak or unexpected to achieve His purposes. This reflects the broader biblical motif where God empowers individuals with seemingly inadequate resources, as seen with David and his sling (1 Samuel 17) or Gideon and his small army (Judges 7). The use of a donkey's jawbone also underscores the improvisational nature of Samson's battles, relying on what is immediately available.<p><b>I have piled them into heaps:</b><br>This phrase suggests a significant victory, with the imagery of heaps indicating a large number of defeated foes. It reflects the hyperbolic language often used in ancient Near Eastern literature to describe military triumphs. The piling of bodies can also symbolize the completeness of the victory and the overwhelming power granted to Samson by God.<p><b>With the jawbone of a donkey:</b><br>The repetition of this phrase emphasizes the miraculous nature of the victory. It serves to remind the reader of the unlikely means by which God delivers His people. This repetition also highlights the personal nature of Samson's strength, which is both a divine gift and a source of personal pride, often leading to his downfall.<p><b>I have slain a thousand men:</b><br>This statement underscores the magnitude of the victory and the supernatural strength bestowed upon Samson. The number "thousand" is often used in the Bible to signify completeness or a large quantity, rather than a precise count. This victory serves as a testament to God's power working through Samson, despite his personal flaws. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance that God provides through Jesus Christ, who conquers sin and death, not through physical might, but through sacrifice and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his extraordinary strength, which was a gift from God.

For every reader, the verse reminds us that God&#8217;s strength, not human resources, secures triumph for His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass.</span>--Here we once more find ourselves in very primitive regions of poetry and paronomasia. Samson's exultation over his extraordinary achievement finds vent in a sort of punning couplet, which turns entirely on the identity of sound between <span class= "ital">chamor, </span>a heap, and <span class= "ital">chamor, </span>an ass, and the play of <span class= "ital">meaning </span>between <span class= "ital">aleph, </span>a thousand, and <span class= "ital">aleph, </span>an ox. In the Hebrew the couplet runs:--<p>"Bi-lechi <span class= "ital">ha-chamor chamor chamorathaim.</span><p>Bi-lechi <span class= "ital">ha-chamor </span>hicceythi <span class= "ital">eleph </span>eesh."<p>Literally, with some attempt, however clumsy, to keep up the play of words,<p>"<span class= "ital">With jaw of the ass, a </span>(<span class= "ital">m</span>)<span class= "ital">ass two </span>(<span class= "ital">m</span>)<span class= "ital"> asses,<p>With jaw of the ass I smote an ox-load of men."</span><p>The versions are, of course, unable to preserve these rough paronomasias, which are characteristic of the age. It would be quite a mistake to infer that they show any levity of spirit in Samson. On the contrary, such peculiarities of expression often arise out of deep emotion. When John of Gaunt begins his dying speech to Richard II. with--<p>"Old Gaunt, indeed! and gaunt in being old," &c.,<p>the king asks:--<p>"Can sick men play so nicely with their names?"<p>and the dying prince makes the striking answer:--<p>"No; misery makes sport to mock herself." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Samson said</span>, etc. The exploit gave birth to one of Sam son's punning, enigmatical, sayings: "With <span class="accented">the jawbone of the ass</span>, <span class="accented">one heap</span>, <span class="accented">two heads</span> of slain." <span class="accented">Hamor</span>, an ass, means also <span class="accented">an heap</span>.
