The intermarriage with the Canaanites and other local tribes led to the dilution of Israel's religious and cultural identity. Historically, such alliances were common in the ancient Near East as a means of securing political and economic stability. However, for Israel, this practice was a direct violation of their covenant with God, which was intended to keep them holy and distinct (<a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15-16</a>).<p><b>gave their own daughters to their sons</b><br>This reciprocal arrangement further entrenched the Israelites in the cultures and practices of the surrounding nations. By giving their daughters in marriage, the Israelites not only compromised their own faith but also risked the spiritual well-being of future generations. This practice is reminiscent of Solomon's marriages to foreign women, which led him astray (<a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-4</a>). The giving of daughters signifies a deeper level of integration and acceptance of foreign customs, which often included idolatry.<p><b>and served their gods</b><br>This phrase indicates the ultimate consequence of Israel's disobedience: idolatry. Serving the gods of the surrounding nations was a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). The Israelites' worship of foreign deities often involved practices that were abhorrent to God, such as child sacrifice and temple prostitution. This syncretism led to a cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance that characterizes the Book of Judges. Theologically, this serves as a warning against the dangers of compromising one's faith and the ease with which idolatry can infiltrate a community. The pattern of Israel's unfaithfulness and God's subsequent deliverance through judges foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who offers redemption from sin and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God who were commanded to remain separate from the pagan nations around them to maintain their covenant relationship with God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanite_nations.htm">Canaanite Nations</a></b><br>The surrounding pagan nations whose daughters the Israelites took in marriage, leading to idolatry and disobedience to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/intermarriage.htm">Intermarriage</a></b><br>The act of marrying outside the Israelite community, which led to the Israelites serving other gods.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry.htm">Idolatry</a></b><br>The worship of false gods, which was a direct violation of the first commandment and led to Israel's downfall.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judges.htm">Judges</a></b><br>Leaders raised by God to deliver Israel from oppression, often following periods of disobedience and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_compromise.htm">The Danger of Compromise</a></b><br>Compromising God's commands leads to spiritual decline and idolatry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Obedience to God's commands is crucial for maintaining a faithful relationship with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_against_idolatry.htm">Guarding Against Idolatry</a></b><br>Modern believers must be vigilant against anything that takes the place of God in their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_influence_of_relationships.htm">The Influence of Relationships</a></b><br>Relationships can significantly impact one's spiritual walk;

But now the fatal step was taken, and the predicted consequence immediately ensued: "they served their gods;.., they forgat the Lord their God, and served the Baalim and the Asheroth." <p> CHAPTER 3:7-11 This section introduces us into the actual narrative of the Book of Judges, the prefatory matter being now concluded. The whole book proceeds on the same model as this section does. The apostasy of Israel; their servitude under the oppressor sent to chastise them; their cry of distress and penitence; their deliverance by the judge raised up to save them; the rest which follows their deliverance. There is infinite variety in the details of the successive narratives, but they are all formed on the same plan. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/3-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And they took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1495;&#1448;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
