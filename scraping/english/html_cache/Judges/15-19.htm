The "hollow place" in Lehi refers to a geographical location, possibly a rock or a depression in the ground. This miraculous provision of water parallels other biblical instances where God provides water, such as when Moses struck the rock at Horeb (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>). The name "Lehi" means "jawbone," which is significant as it connects to the earlier event where Samson used a jawbone to defeat the Philistines (<a href="/judges/15-15.htm">Judges 15:15</a>).<p><b>and water came out of it</b><br>The provision of water is a recurring theme in Scripture, symbolizing God's sustenance and life-giving power. This event can be seen as a type of Christ, who offers "living water" (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>) to those who are spiritually thirsty. The miraculous nature of the water coming forth underscores God's ability to provide for His people in seemingly impossible situations.<p><b>When Samson drank, his strength returned, and he was revived</b><br>Samson's physical revival after drinking the water signifies the restoration and renewal that comes from God's provision. This can be compared to spiritual renewal found in Christ, who strengthens believers (<a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>). The act of drinking and being revived also echoes the spiritual refreshment and strength that believers receive through the Holy Spirit.<p><b>That is why he named it En-hakkore</b><br>The name "En-hakkore" means "Spring of the Caller" or "Spring of the One who Calls." This naming reflects Samson's acknowledgment of God's response to his cry for help. Naming places after divine interventions was a common practice in biblical times, serving as a memorial of God's faithfulness and power (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>, where Jacob names Bethel).<p><b>and it remains in Lehi to this day</b><br>This phrase indicates the lasting impact of God's miracle, suggesting that the site became a known landmark. The mention of its continued existence serves as a testament to the historical reliability of the account and God's enduring faithfulness. It also implies that the story of God's provision was passed down through generations, reinforcing the importance of remembering and recounting God's deeds.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his extraordinary strength, which was a gift from God.

God&#8217;s immediate response shows His attentiveness to prayer and His sovereignty over nature, just as He split the rock at Horeb for Israel (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-41.htm">Psalm 105:41</a>).<p>- The phrase underscores a literal act of divine power; no ordinary spring existed&#8212;God Himself &#8220;opened&#8221; the ground. That same power later raised Jesus from the dead (<a href="/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>), reminding us that the God who intervenes physically can also intervene spiritually for His people today.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And water came out of it</b><p>- A tangible, visible miracle: cool, fresh water in the very place where a battle had just raged. God turns a battlefield into a place of refreshment, echoing <a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2&#8211;3</a>, &#8220;He leads me beside still waters; He restores my soul.&#8221;<p>- This provision foreshadows the &#8220;living water&#8221; Christ offered (<a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37&#8211;38</a>). Just as Samson&#8217;s life depended on that spring, our eternal life depends on the saving water Jesus gives.<p>- The event also mirrors <a href="/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>, reinforcing that God consistently supplies His people&#8217;s needs&#8212;even when those needs arise from their own choices or circumstances.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When Samson drank, his strength returned, and he was revived</b><p>- The narrative makes clear that renewed strength came only after Samson received God&#8217;s provision. Physical refreshment parallels spiritual renewal promised in <a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29&#8211;31</a>: &#8220;Those who wait upon the LORD will renew their strength.&#8221;<p>- Similar moments appear when Jonathan tastes honey in battle (<a href="/1_samuel/14-27.htm">1 Samuel 14:27</a>) or when Elijah receives food and water in the wilderness (<a href="/1_kings/19-5.htm">1 Kings 19:5&#8211;8</a>). God&#8217;s pattern is to replenish His servants so they can continue His mission.<p>- Samson&#8217;s revival reminds believers that dependence on God is not weakness but the pathway to true power (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That is why he named it En-hakkore, and it remains in Lehi to this day</b><p>- Naming the spring establishes a lasting testimony, much like Abraham&#8217;s &#8220;The LORD Will Provide&#8221; at Moriah (<a href="/genesis/22-14.htm">Genesis 22:14</a>) or Moses&#8217; &#8220;The LORD Is My Banner&#8221; after Amalek (<a href="/exodus/17-15.htm">Exodus 17:15</a>). Each name marks a moment when God intervened.<p>- &#8220;It remains&#8230;to this day&#8221; anchors the account in real geography and history, underscoring Scripture&#8217;s reliability. The unchanged location invites every later visitor to recall God&#8217;s faithfulness.<p>- By commemorating the miracle, Samson shifts the spotlight from his own exploits to God&#8217;s mercy, reinforcing that deliverance ultimately comes from the LORD (<a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/15-19.htm">Judges 15:19</a> records a literal miracle in which God opened the ground at Lehi, produced water, restored Samson&#8217;s strength, and left a lasting memorial called En-hakkore. The verse teaches that God answers prayer, supplies physical and spiritual needs, revives His servants for continued service, and provides enduring reminders of His faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Clave an hollow place that was in the jaw.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the </span>(<span class= "ital">fountain called the</span>)<span class= "ital"> "socket," which is in Lehi. </span>The notion that God made a miraculous fountain in one of the tooth-sockets of the jawbone of the ass is one of the childish misinterpretations with which Scripture exegesis is constantly defaced.

Milton understood the passage rightly:--<p>"God, who caused a fountain at thy prayer<p><span class= "ital">From the dry ground to spring </span>thy thirst to allay."<p>For similar instances in the Bible, see <a href="/genesis/21-19.htm" title="And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.">Genesis 21:19</a> (Hagar); <a href="/exodus/17-6.htm" title="Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb; and you shall smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.">Exodus 17:6</a> (the smitten rock); <a href="/context/isaiah/41-17.htm" title="When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue fails for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.">Isaiah 41:17-18</a> ("When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them. I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys . . . I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water"). Josephus says that God caused to spring up for Samson "a plentiful fountain of sweet water at a certain rock." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span> (or, <span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="cmt_word">God clave</span>, etc. Cf. <a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>; <a href="/numbers/20-8.htm">Numbers 20:8, 11</a>. The A.V. (as the Septuagint and Vulgate seem to have done, and Luther and others) has quite misconceived the statement in the text, as if God had cloven a hollow place in the jawbone, and brought out the water thence; whereas the statement is quite clear that <span class="accented">God clave the hollow place which is in Lehi</span> (<span class="accented">hal-Lehi</span>, ver. 9, note), and that a spring of water came out, to which Samson gave the name <span class="accented">En-hakkorch</span>, the spring of him that called upon God, which name continued till the time of the writer. The spring apparently continued till the time of St. Jerome, and of other later writers, in the seventh, twelfth, and fourteenth centuries; but Robinson was unable to identify it with any certainty ('B.R.,' 2:64). The word translated the (not a) <span class="accented">hollow place</span> (ham-<span class="accented">maktesh</span>) means a <span class="accented">mortar</span>; also the <span class="accented">cavity in the jaw</span> from which the molar teeth grow. The hollow ground from which the spring rose, with which Samson quenched his thirst, from its shape and from the connection with <span class="accented">hal-Lechi</span> (the jawbone) was called <span class="accented">hammaktech.</span> In <a href="/zephaniah/1-11.htm">Zephaniah 1:11</a> it is also a proper name, apparently of some spot near Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">The name thereof</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the fountain, with which <span class="accented">thereof</span>, which is in the feminine gender, agrees. <span class="cmt_word">Which is in Lehi unto this day</span>. This punctuation does not agree with the Hebrew accents, which put a strong stop after <span class="accented">Lehi</span>. The Hebrew accents rather convey the sense that the name <span class="accented">En</span>-<span class="accented">kakkoreh</span> continued to be the name of the well unto the day of the writer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/15-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">opened up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1448;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#7687;&#183;qa&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
