The man, likely a local inhabitant, provided crucial intelligence to the Israelites, revealing the city's vulnerabilities. This act of showing the entrance suggests a breach in the city's defenses, which was common in ancient warfare. The city in question is Bethel, previously known as Luz, a significant location in Israel's history. The act of showing the entrance can be seen as a parallel to Rahab's assistance to the Israelite spies in Jericho (Joshua 2), where local knowledge was pivotal for Israel's success. This cooperation with the Israelites may reflect a recognition of God's power or a pragmatic choice for survival.<p><b>and they put the city to the sword</b><br>This phrase describes the complete destruction of the city, a common practice in ancient Near Eastern warfare, often referred to as herem or the ban. This involved the total destruction of a city and its inhabitants as an offering to God, signifying the removal of pagan influences and the establishment of Israelite control. The phrase echoes the conquest of Jericho (Joshua 6), where the city was similarly devoted to destruction. This act was part of God's command to the Israelites to take possession of the Promised Land and eliminate idolatry and corruption.<p><b>but released that man and all his family</b><br>The release of the man and his family highlights a theme of mercy and covenant faithfulness. This act mirrors the sparing of Rahab and her family in Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-25.htm">Joshua 6:25</a>) due to her assistance to the Israelite spies. It demonstrates the principle of reward for those who align themselves with God's people, even amidst judgment. This sparing of the man and his family can be seen as a type of salvation, prefiguring the deliverance offered through Jesus Christ to those who believe and align themselves with Him. It underscores the biblical theme of God's mercy and the possibility of redemption for individuals within a context of judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spies.htm">The Spies</a></b><br>These are the men from the tribe of Joseph who were sent to scout the city of Bethel (formerly Luz) to determine how to conquer it.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man</a></b><br>An unnamed inhabitant of Bethel who provided the spies with crucial information about the city's entrance, leading to its capture.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city_of_bethel.htm">The City of Bethel</a></b><br>Originally known as Luz, this city was strategically important and was conquered by the Israelites with the help of the insider information.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tribe_of_joseph.htm">The Tribe of Joseph</a></b><br>This tribe, representing the descendants of Joseph, was responsible for the conquest of Bethel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_conquest.htm">The Event of Conquest</a></b><br>The capture of Bethel was a significant event in the Israelites' campaign to take possession of the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_strategy_and_human_cooperation.htm">Divine Strategy and Human Cooperation</a></b><br>God often uses human cooperation to fulfill His divine plans.
