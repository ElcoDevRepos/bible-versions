This crossing over signifies a decisive action, indicating Jephthah's commitment to the task. The Ammonites were descendants of Lot, and their conflict with Israel had historical roots, as they claimed land that Israel had settled. This phrase highlights the geographical movement and the strategic military engagement. Jephthah's leadership is reminiscent of other judges who were raised by God to deliver Israel, such as Gideon and Deborah.<p><b>and the LORD delivered them into his hand</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine intervention in Israel's battles. The victory is attributed not to Jephthah's military prowess but to the LORD's sovereign will. This reflects a recurring theme in the Book of Judges, where God raises leaders to deliver Israel despite their weaknesses. The deliverance is a fulfillment of God's covenant promises to protect and preserve His people. This act of deliverance can be seen as a type of Christ, who ultimately delivers humanity from sin. The phrase also connects to other scriptural instances where God delivers His people, such as the Exodus from Egypt and David's victories over his enemies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, known for his leadership and vow.
