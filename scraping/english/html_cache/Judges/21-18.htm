The Israelites had vowed not to give their daughters to the Benjamites as wives, which was a significant oath in the context of ancient Israelite culture. Oaths were considered binding and sacred, often invoking God's name, and breaking them could bring divine judgment. This reflects the seriousness with which vows were taken, as seen in other parts of Scripture, such as Jephthah's vow in <a href="/judges/11.htm">Judges 11</a>. The cultural context of marriage in ancient Israel was also significant, as marriages were often arranged and involved family alliances.<p><b>For the Israelites had sworn,</b><br>The act of swearing an oath was a solemn commitment before God, often made in a public or communal setting. In the historical context of the Israelites, such oaths were not taken lightly, as they were believed to be binding before God. This reflects the communal nature of Israelite society, where decisions and vows were often made collectively. The Israelites' oath here is reminiscent of other collective oaths in the Bible, such as the covenant renewal ceremonies in <a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24</a>. The seriousness of oaths is further emphasized in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches about the importance of keeping one's word (<a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Cursed is he who gives a wife to a Benjamite.&#8221;</b><br>This curse highlights the severity of the Israelites' response to the sin of the Benjamites, which had led to the near destruction of the tribe. Curses in the biblical context were powerful pronouncements that invoked divine judgment or misfortune upon those who violated certain conditions. The use of a curse here underscores the gravity of the situation and the Israelites' desire to distance themselves from the Benjamites' actions. This reflects the broader biblical theme of blessings and curses, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where obedience to God brings blessings, and disobedience brings curses. The curse also serves as a reminder of the consequences of sin and the need for repentance and reconciliation, themes that are central to the message of the prophets and the teachings of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel who are dealing with the aftermath of a civil war against the tribe of Benjamin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamites.htm">Benjamites</a></b><br>The tribe of Benjamin, which was nearly annihilated in a civil conflict with the other Israelite tribes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mizpah.htm">Mizpah</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites gathered to discuss the situation and make decisions regarding the tribe of Benjamin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/oath.htm">Oath</a></b><br>A solemn promise made by the Israelites not to give their daughters in marriage to the Benjamites, which complicates the restoration of the tribe.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/civil_war.htm">Civil War</a></b><br>The conflict between the tribe of Benjamin and the other Israelite tribes, leading to the near extinction of the Benjamites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_weight_of_oaths.htm">The Weight of Oaths</a></b><br>Oaths are serious commitments before God and should not be made lightly.

Their dilemma frames <a href="/judges/21-18.htm">Judges 21:18</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;But we cannot give them our daughters as wives.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The elders see that Benjamin must be preserved, yet they state a hard limit: no Israelite daughter may be offered to the remnant.<p>&#8226; Their words echo <a href="/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12&#8211;16</a>, where intermarriage is forbidden when it leads to idolatry; here, though, the prohibition flows from a prior vow.<p>&#8226; The confession reveals sincerity&#8212;&#8220;we cannot&#8221;&#8212;not &#8220;we will not.&#8221; They recognize both the need for brides (<a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>) and the restraint imposed by their oath.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;For the Israelites had sworn&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a> teaches, &#8220;When a man makes a vow to the LORD &#8230; he must not break his word.&#8221; The nation has bound itself publicly before God, so the vow carries divine weight (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; The collective oath also recalls <a href="/joshua/9-15.htm">Joshua 9:15&#8211;20</a>, where Israel honored an ill-advised covenant with the Gibeonites because it had been sworn &#8220;by the LORD.&#8221; Even a rash promise is sacred once spoken.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Cursed is he who gives a wife to a Benjamite.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The wording parallels <a href="/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15&#8211;26</a>, where the Levites pronounce &#8220;Cursed is the one who&#8230;&#8221; and all Israel responds &#8220;Amen.&#8221; Such formulae invoke God&#8217;s own enforcement (<a href="/proverbs/26-2.htm">Proverbs 26:2</a>).<p>&#8226; By attaching a curse, Israel made personal participation costly. Anyone breaking the vow would invite divine discipline, much like Saul&#8217;s oath in <a href="/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24&#8211;28</a> that nearly trapped Jonathan.<p>&#8226; The severity underscores how seriously Israel viewed covenant purity after the moral collapse that led to civil war.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The tension between compassion and commitment</b><p>&#8226; Compassion: They long to rebuild Benjamin so &#8220;a tribe of Israel will not be cut off today&#8221; (<a href="/judges/21-6.htm">Judges 21:6</a>). God&#8217;s design from <a href="/genesis/49-28.htm">Genesis 49:28</a> is twelve tribes.<p>&#8226; Commitment: They will not violate an oath spoken to the LORD. <a href="/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a> praises one &#8220;who keeps his oath even when it hurts.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Result: Israel seeks alternative solutions&#8212;first the destruction of Jabesh-gilead to obtain virgin women (<a href="/judges/21-10.htm">Judges 21:10&#8211;14</a>), then permission for the Benjamites to seize dancers at Shiloh (<a href="/judges/21-19.htm">Judges 21:19&#8211;23</a>). Each maneuver avoids direct violation of the vow while exposing the tragic spiral of doing &#8220;what was right in his own eyes&#8221; (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lessons for today</b><p>&#8226; Guard the tongue: <a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5&#8211;10</a> warns how small words produce great flames.

The verse reveals a nation torn between compassion for a decimated tribe and unwavering commitment to a sacred oath.
