Abimelech's mother was a concubine from Shechem, and his maternal uncles played a crucial role in his rise to power. The use of family connections to gain political advantage is a recurring theme in the Bible, as seen in the stories of Joseph and his brothers or David and his family. This reflects the importance of kinship and loyalty within tribal communities.<p><b>in the presence of all the leaders of Shechem</b><br>Shechem was a significant city in the central hill country of Canaan, known for its historical and religious importance. It was a center for covenant renewal, as seen in <a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24</a>. The leaders of Shechem, likely elders or influential figures, held considerable sway over the city's decisions. This setting underscores the political maneuvering taking place, as Abimelech's relatives sought to secure his leadership by appealing to these local authorities.<p><b>their hearts were inclined to follow Abimelech</b><br>The phrase indicates a shift in allegiance, suggesting that the leaders were persuaded by the arguments presented. This inclination can be seen as a reflection of human nature's susceptibility to persuasion and familial loyalty. It also foreshadows the eventual consequences of their decision, as Abimelech's rule leads to turmoil and destruction, illustrating the biblical theme of the dangers of ungodly leadership.<p><b>for they said, &#8220;He is our brother.&#8221;</b><br>This statement emphasizes the power of kinship and identity in decision-making. The leaders of Shechem were swayed by the fact that Abimelech was one of their own, highlighting the tribal and familial loyalties that often influenced political decisions in ancient Israel. This mirrors other biblical narratives where familial ties play a crucial role, such as the story of Ruth and Boaz. It also serves as a cautionary tale about the potential pitfalls of prioritizing personal connections over righteous leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal) and his concubine from Shechem.

Here, ambition and tribal pride eclipse gratitude for Gideon&#8217;s deliverance.<p>&#8226; Contrast God&#8217;s intent that Israel look to Him for leadership (<a href="/numbers/27-16.htm">Numbers 27:16-17</a>); when hearts drift, they settle for the nearest human solution.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for they said, &#8220;He is our brother.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Blood ties outweigh covenant truth.
