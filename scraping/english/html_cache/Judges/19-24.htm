The host's offer to protect his guest at the expense of his own family members highlights the extreme measures taken to uphold this cultural norm. The mention of a "virgin daughter" and a "concubine" underscores the patriarchal society where women had limited rights and were often seen as property. This situation parallels the account in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, where Lot offers his daughters to protect his guests, illustrating a recurring theme of the depravity and moral decline in Israel during the time of the Judges.<p><b>and you can use them and do with them as you wish</b><br>This phrase reveals the depth of moral corruption and the devaluation of human life during this period. The willingness to sacrifice women to appease the demands of a violent mob reflects the societal breakdown and lack of justice prevalent in Israel at the time. This narrative serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of Israel's disobedience to God's laws, as outlined in Deuteronomy, where the protection of the vulnerable is emphasized. The phrase also foreshadows the eventual call for a king in Israel, as the repeated refrain in Judges, "In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes," highlights the need for righteous leadership.<p><b>But do not do such a vile thing to this man.</b><br>The host's plea to spare his guest underscores the gravity of the intended crime, which is described as "vile." This term indicates an act that is morally reprehensible and against God's commandments. The protection of the guest over the women reflects the distorted values of the time, where male honor and hospitality were prioritized over the dignity and safety of women. This plea can be seen as a desperate attempt to prevent a greater sin, echoing the biblical principle of protecting the innocent, as seen in the laws given to Israel in Exodus and Leviticus. The narrative ultimately points to the need for redemption and the coming of a just and righteous Savior, Jesus Christ, who upholds the dignity of all individuals and offers true protection and salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A central figure in this account, the Levite is traveling with his concubine and servant.

The verse stands as a mirror, warning that without God-given authority and hearts submitted to His Word, even His people can plunge into Sodom-like depravity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24, 25) <span class= "bld">Behold, here is my daughter . . .</span>--The main horror of these verses lies, and is meant to lie, in the nameless infamy to which these men had sunk, of whom we can only say,<p>"Non ragionam di lor ma guarda e passa."<p>But we must not omit to notice that the conduct of the old man and the Levite, though it is not formally condemned, speaks of the existence of a very rudimentary morality, a selfishness, and a low estimate of the rights and sacred dignity of women, which shows from what depths the world has emerged. If it was possible to frustrate the vile assault of these wretches in this way it must have been possible to frustrate it altogether. There is something terribly repulsive in the selfishness which could thus make a Levite sacrifice a defenceless woman, and that woman his wife, for a whole night to such brutalisation.
