In ancient Israel, being left-handed was less common and often seen as unusual. This detail highlights God's use of unexpected means to achieve His purposes. The tribe of Benjamin, to which Ehud belonged, is noted for having many left-handed warriors (<a href="/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>). This characteristic allowed Ehud to surprise Eglon, as guards would typically expect a weapon to be drawn with the right hand.<p><b>pulled the sword from his right thigh</b><br>The placement of the sword on Ehud's right thigh was strategic. In ancient times, a right-handed person would typically carry a weapon on the left side for ease of access. Ehud's left-handedness allowed him to conceal the weapon on his right thigh, avoiding detection. This act of concealment and surprise is a recurring theme in biblical narratives, where God often uses the element of surprise to deliver His people (e.g., David and Goliath, Gideon's army).<p><b>and plunged it into Eglon&#8217;s belly</b><br>The act of plunging the sword into Eglon's belly is a vivid depiction of divine judgment against the oppressors of Israel. Eglon, the Moabite king, had subjugated Israel for eighteen years. This act of deliverance is reminiscent of other instances where God raises a deliverer to free His people, such as Moses leading the Israelites out of Egypt. The graphic nature of the act underscores the seriousness of God's judgment and the lengths to which He will go to rescue His people. This event foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who defeats sin and death through His sacrificial act on the cross.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ehud.htm">Ehud</a></b><br>A left-handed judge of Israel from the tribe of Benjamin, chosen by God to deliver Israel from Moabite oppression.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/eglon.htm">Eglon</a></b><br>The king of Moab who oppressed the Israelites for eighteen years.
