The act of "taking her" refers to the marriage customs of the time, where a man would formally take a woman as his wife. This reflects the cultural practice of arranged marriages and the importance of family alliances. Samson's return signifies his commitment to the marriage, despite the potential conflict with his Nazirite vow and Israelite identity.<p><b>he left the road to see the lion&#8217;s carcass</b><br>Samson's diversion from the road to view the lion's carcass is significant. The lion, which he had previously killed with his bare hands, represents his extraordinary strength given by God. The act of leaving the road can symbolize a departure from the path of righteousness or divine instruction, as touching a dead body would defile a Nazirite according to <a href="/numbers/6-6.htm">Numbers 6:6-7</a>. This moment foreshadows Samson's struggles with temptation and his eventual downfall.<p><b>and in it was a swarm of bees, along with their honey</b><br>The presence of bees and honey in the carcass is unusual, as bees typically avoid dead bodies. This miraculous occurrence highlights God's sovereignty and the theme of bringing sweetness from death, which can be seen as a type of Christ, who brings life from death. Honey, often associated with abundance and blessing in the Bible (e.g., <a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>), contrasts with the uncleanliness of the carcass, symbolizing the tension between divine provision and human impurity. This event sets the stage for Samson's riddle at the wedding feast, which becomes a pivotal moment in his conflict with the Philistines.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his extraordinary strength, which was a gift from God.

Though the match violated Israel&#8217;s covenant boundaries (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-2.htm">1 Kings 11:2</a>), God was at work &#8220;seeking an occasion against the Philistines&#8221; (<a href="/judges/14-4.htm">Judges 14:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that the Lord can overrule even questionable choices for His larger purposes (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Samson&#8217;s confident stride back to Timnah shows no hesitation; he believes his strength places him beyond ordinary limits&#8212;a theme that will both elevate and haunt him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He left the road</b><p>Stepping off the main path suggests curiosity and self-interest rather than mission focus (<a href="/proverbs/4-25.htm">Proverbs 4:25&#8211;27</a>). Samson detours from his wedding plans to revisit his earlier triumph.<p>&#8226; This small choice foreshadows a pattern: private impulses often steer him more than public responsibilities (<a href="/judges/16-1.htm">Judges 16:1</a>; 16:4).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly warns that deviations, however slight, can open the door to greater compromise (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to see the lion&#8217;s carcass</b><p>Just days earlier, God had empowered Samson to tear the lion &#8220;as one tears a young goat&#8221; (<a href="/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>). Returning to the scene lets him relive the victory.<p>&#8226; A Nazirite was forbidden any contact with death (<a href="/numbers/6-6.htm">Numbers 6:6&#8211;7</a>). Even approaching the carcass courts defilement, signaling Samson&#8217;s casual attitude toward his vow.<p>&#8226; His fascination with the slain lion reflects how easily past victories can feed pride (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and in it was a swarm of bees</b><p>Finding live bees inside a decomposing animal is extraordinary, underscoring divine intervention.<p>&#8226; God transforms a symbol of death into a source of sweetness, echoing <a href="/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>&#8212;beauty for ashes.<p>&#8226; The scene sets up Samson&#8217;s riddle: &#8220;Out of the eater came something to eat, and out of the strong came something sweet&#8221; (<a href="/judges/14-14.htm">Judges 14:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The unexpected contrast invites meditation on how the Lord can draw blessing from brokenness (<a href="/psalms/30-11.htm">Psalm 30:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with their honey</b><p>Honey represents blessing and delight (<a href="/psalms/19-10.htm">Psalm 19:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/24-13.htm">Proverbs 24:13</a>). By scooping it out (<a href="/judges/14-9.htm">Judges 14:9</a>), Samson gains immediate pleasure yet further violates his consecration.<p>&#8226; He shares the honey with his parents without disclosing its origin, illustrating how private compromise can spill into others&#8217; lives (<a href="/galatians/5-9.htm">Galatians 5:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The incident previews Samson&#8217;s larger story: great strength, supernatural enablement, and God-given opportunities mishandled through self-gratification (<a href="/judges/16-20.htm">Judges 16:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/14-8.htm">Judges 14:8</a> captures a snapshot of Samson&#8217;s complex walk&#8212;chosen by God, empowered by the Spirit, yet repeatedly guided by impulse. Leaving the road to inspect the lion highlights curiosity that edges toward compromise. The bees and honey show the Lord&#8217;s surprising provision, turning death into sweetness, while also exposing Samson&#8217;s disregard for his vow. The verse invites us to trust God&#8217;s ability to bring good from unlikely places even as we guard our hearts from the small detours that can dull consecration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">After a time.</span>--There is nothing to show how long this time was.

But it is overlooked that the word "carcase" here means (as the Syriac renders it) "skeleton." The fierce sun of the East dries up all the animal moisture of a dead body, and reduces it to a skeleton with extreme rapidity, and bees have no dislike to dried bones as a place in which to swarm. Thus Herodotus tells us (v. 114) that when the Amathusians cut off the head of Onesilus, because he besieged them, and hung it over their gates, a swarm of bees filled the skull with their combs and honey. Rosenmller also quotes the authority of the physician Aldrovand for the story that swarms of bees built their combs between the skeletons of two sisters who were buried in the Church of Santa Croce, at Verona, in 1566.

But as a considerable time had elapsed, it is very possible that either the mere skeleton was left, or that the heat of the sun had dried up the body and reduced it to the state of a mummy without decomposition, as is said to happen often in the desert of Arabia. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/14-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When [Samson] returned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">later</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to take her,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;qa&#7717;&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3947.htm">Strong's 3947: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he left</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1505;&#1463;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;sar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5493.htm">Strong's 5493: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn aside</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the road to see</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(lir&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the lion&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;ar&#183;y&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_738.htm">Strong's 738: </a> </span><span class="str2">A lion</span><br /><br /><span class="word">carcass,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(map&#183;pe&#183;le&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4658.htm">Strong's 4658: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fall, decadence, a ruin, a carcase</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and in [it]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#7713;&#183;w&#238;&#183;ya&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1472.htm">Strong's 1472: </a> </span><span class="str2">A body, corpse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
