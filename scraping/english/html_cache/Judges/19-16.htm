Evening in ancient Israel was a time of transition, marking the end of the day's labor and the beginning of rest. It was also a time when travelers sought shelter, as night travel was dangerous. This sets the stage for the unfolding events, emphasizing the urgency and vulnerability of the situation.<p><b>an old man from the hill country of Ephraim</b><br>The hill country of Ephraim was a central region in Israel, known for its rugged terrain and significant biblical history. Ephraim was one of the tribes of Israel, descended from Joseph's son. The mention of the old man being from Ephraim highlights the tribal connections and tensions present in the narrative. It also suggests a sense of hospitality and kinship, as the old man might feel a connection to the Levite, who was also from Ephraim.<p><b>who was residing in Gibeah</b><br>Gibeah was a city in the territory of Benjamin, notorious for the events that unfold in this chapter. The old man's residence in Gibeah, despite being from Ephraim, indicates a possible displacement or migration, common in the period of the Judges when tribal boundaries were fluid. This detail foreshadows the conflict between the tribes of Israel and Benjamin that arises later.<p><b>(the men of that place were Benjamites)</b><br>The parenthetical note emphasizes the tribal identity of Gibeah's inhabitants. The Benjamites were one of the twelve tribes of Israel, known for their warrior skills. This detail is crucial for understanding the ensuing conflict, as the actions of the men of Gibeah lead to a civil war between the tribe of Benjamin and the other tribes of Israel.<p><b>came in from his work in the field</b><br>The old man's return from the field suggests a life of labor and simplicity, typical of agrarian societies in ancient Israel. Fields were essential for sustenance, and working them was a daily necessity. This detail underscores the normalcy and routine of life, contrasting sharply with the horrific events that follow. It also highlights the old man's industriousness and perhaps his isolation, as he is not part of the city's social fabric, which may explain his willingness to offer hospitality to the travelers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/old_man_from_ephraim.htm">Old Man from Ephraim</a></b><br>An elderly man who was originally from the hill country of Ephraim but was residing in Gibeah.
