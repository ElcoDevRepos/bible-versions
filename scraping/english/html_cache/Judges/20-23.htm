The act of going up suggests a movement towards a place of worship or a high place, often associated with seeking divine guidance. Weeping before the LORD signifies genuine repentance and a plea for divine intervention. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, communal lamentation was a common practice during times of distress. This reflects the Israelites' recognition of their need for God's guidance in a situation involving internal conflict. The evening time frame may symbolize the end of a day, suggesting a prolonged period of seeking God, which aligns with other biblical instances where evening is a time of reflection and prayer (e.g., <a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>).<p><b>inquiring of Him, &#8220;Should we again draw near for battle against our brothers the Benjamites?&#8221;</b><br>The Israelites' inquiry of the LORD demonstrates their dependence on divine direction for their actions. The phrase "draw near for battle" indicates a readiness to engage in conflict, yet the mention of "our brothers the Benjamites" highlights the painful reality of civil strife within the twelve tribes of Israel. This internal conflict is rooted in the events of <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>, where a grievous crime committed by the Benjamites led to national outrage. The Israelites' approach to God for guidance reflects a pattern seen throughout the Old Testament, where leaders and people seek divine will before making significant decisions (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a>). This inquiry also underscores the importance of seeking God's will in matters of justice and conflict resolution.<p><b>And the LORD answered, &#8220;Go up against them.&#8221;</b><br>The LORD's response is direct and authoritative, providing the Israelites with clear guidance. This divine instruction to "go up against them" affirms the necessity of addressing the sin and injustice perpetrated by the Benjamites. It reflects God's justice and the need for accountability within His covenant community. The command to engage in battle, despite the familial ties, underscores the seriousness of the offense and the importance of upholding righteousness. This directive can be seen as part of God's broader plan to purify and maintain the holiness of His people, a theme consistent throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5</a>). The response also highlights God's sovereignty in guiding the affairs of His people, ensuring that justice is served according to His divine purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel, excluding Benjamin, who are seeking guidance from God after suffering defeat in battle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_benjamites.htm">The Benjamites</a></b><br>The tribe of Benjamin, who are in conflict with the other tribes of Israel due to the grievous sin committed in Gibeah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whom the Israelites seek for guidance and direction in their conflict with the Benjamites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a></b><br>A city in the territory of Benjamin, where a heinous crime was committed, leading to the conflict between the tribes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_battle.htm">The Battle</a></b><br>The ongoing conflict between the Israelites and the Benjamites, which is a result of the moral and social breakdown in Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_god's_guidance.htm">Seeking God's Guidance</a></b><br>The Israelites' approach to seek God's will before acting is a model for believers today.

Like Samuel&#8217;s call for fasting and repentance at Mizpah, &#8220;They fasted that day and said, &#8216;We have sinned against the LORD&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/7-6.htm">1 Samuel 7:6</a>), this prolonged weeping shows genuine sorrow, not mere frustration.<p>&#8226; Their tears echo God&#8217;s invitation: &#8220;Return to Me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning&#8221; (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>). Grief over sin always precedes true guidance.<p>&#8226; By remaining &#8220;until evening,&#8221; they give God the whole day&#8212;an acknowledgment that divine counsel is worth lingering for, as Jehoshaphat did when &#8220;all Judah stood before the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-3.htm">2 Chronicles 20:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The LORD draws near to the contrite: &#8220;The LORD is near to the brokenhearted&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>). Their posture invites His answer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>inquiring of Him</b><p>&#8226; Sorrow turns into earnest petition. Earlier they asked simply, &#8220;Who shall go up first?&#8221; (<a href="/judges/20-18.htm">Judges 20:18</a>). After defeat, they recognize they need more than strategy&#8212;they need assurance.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently links seeking with finding: &#8220;David inquired of the LORD, &#8216;Shall I go and attack?&#8217; &#8230; and the LORD said, &#8216;Go&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a>).<p>&#8226; This pattern models <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>&#8212;trusting the LORD and acknowledging Him in all their ways.

Here He chooses to act through Israel&#8217;s army.<p>&#8226; The answer also reassures that earlier loss was not abandonment but preparation. By the third day (<a href="/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28-35</a>), victory will come, displaying that success flows from obedience, not numbers or might (cf. <a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2-5</a> at Jericho).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Israel&#8217;s second approach to God moves from tactical curiosity to heartfelt repentance.
