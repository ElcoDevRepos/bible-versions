Succoth was a city within the territory allotted to the tribe of Gad. The leaders' response reflects a cautious and pragmatic approach, likely due to fear of retribution from the Midianite kings if Gideon's campaign failed. This highlights the political and social dynamics of the time, where local leaders often had to navigate alliances carefully.<p><b>&#8220;Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your possession,</b><br>Zebah and Zalmunna were kings of Midian, a nomadic people who had oppressed Israel. The phrase "hands of" is a Hebrew idiom indicating capture or control. The leaders' question implies skepticism about Gideon's ability to defeat these kings. This reflects a lack of faith in God's deliverance through Gideon, contrasting with Gideon's earlier victories, which were divinely orchestrated.<p><b>that we should give bread to your army?&#8221;</b><br>Providing bread was a significant act of support and alliance. The refusal to provide sustenance to Gideon's men indicates a lack of solidarity and trust. This act of withholding aid can be seen as a failure to recognize God's chosen deliverer and a missed opportunity to participate in God's plan. The leaders' response contrasts with the hospitality and support expected in the cultural context of the ancient Near East, where providing for travelers and allies was a customary duty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

But what the exact shade of meaning is in this proverbial expression we do not know. Perhaps it is an allusion to the chained hands of captives.

Instead of aiding Gideon in his gallant enterprise for the deliverance of his country, they refused even food to his weary followers, for fear of the possibility of incurring the anger of the Midianites in ease Gideon should fail.
