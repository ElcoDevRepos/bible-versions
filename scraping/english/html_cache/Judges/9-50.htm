His journey to Thebez follows his violent campaign to establish himself as king, which began with the massacre of his seventy brothers. Thebez is a city in the region of Shechem, indicating Abimelech's continued efforts to consolidate power in the central hill country of Israel. Thebez is not frequently mentioned in the Bible, but its inclusion here highlights its strategic importance. The city's name means "brightness" or "whiteness," possibly referring to its geographical features or its significance in the region.<p><b>encamped against it</b><br>Abimelech's encampment signifies a military siege, a common tactic in ancient warfare. This action reflects his aggressive and ruthless nature, as he seeks to subdue Thebez just as he did with Shechem. The encampment would involve surrounding the city, cutting off supplies, and preparing for an assault. This tactic is reminiscent of other biblical sieges, such as the siege of Jericho (Joshua 6) and the siege of Jerusalem by the Babylonians (2 Kings 25).<p><b>and captured it</b><br>The capture of Thebez demonstrates Abimelech's initial success in his campaign. However, this victory is short-lived, as the subsequent verses reveal his downfall. The capture of cities was a common occurrence in the turbulent period of the Judges, characterized by cycles of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance. Abimelech's actions contrast with the deliverance typically provided by judges, as he seeks personal power rather than the liberation of Israel. This event foreshadows his demise, as his unchecked ambition ultimately leads to his death, fulfilling the biblical theme of divine justice and the consequences of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal) and a concubine from Shechem.

Scripture presents this movement as a literal military progression, showing the unchecked ambition of a self-appointed ruler.<p>&#8226; Thebez lay about thirteen miles northeast of Shechem (<a href="/judges/1-27.htm">Judges 1:27</a> speaks of its earlier survival among Canaanite strongholds).

In contrast, David &#8220;inquired of the LORD&#8221; before laying siege (<a href="/2_samuel/5-19.htm">2 Samuel 5:19</a>); Abimelech consults no one but himself.<p>&#8226; For believers, this snapshot warns how sin digs in: <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a> shows desire conceiving sin, then sin giving birth to death.

The verse showcases unchecked ambition moving from Shechem to Thebez, a calculated encampment, and an outwardly complete capture. Yet within the flow of Scripture, each step is a warning: prideful power can look unstoppable until God intervenes. What seems like success to Abimelech is only the calm before judgment, proving again that the Lord faithfully opposes the proud and upholds His righteous purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(50) <span class= "bld">Thebez.</span>--One of the cities in the league of "Baal of the Covenant," perhaps, <span class= "ital">Tubas, </span>ten miles north-east of Shechem, on a mound among the hills.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thebez</span>.
