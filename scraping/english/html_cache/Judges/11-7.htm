The elders of Gilead, representing the tribal leadership, sought him out during a time of crisis. This reflects the recurring theme in Judges of God using unexpected individuals to deliver Israel. Gilead was a region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and rugged terrain, often a place of refuge and conflict.<p><b>Did you not hate me and expel me from my father&#8217;s house?</b><br>Jephthah's question highlights the personal rejection and injustice he faced, being driven away due to his illegitimate birth. This expulsion reflects the cultural norms of inheritance and legitimacy in ancient Israel, where family lineage was crucial. His experience parallels Joseph's rejection by his brothers, and foreshadows Christ, who was also rejected by His own people (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>).<p><b>Why then have you come to me now,</b><br>The elders' return to Jephthah in their time of need underscores the theme of desperation leading to humility. It illustrates how God often uses human weakness to fulfill His purposes, as seen throughout the Bible. This situation is reminiscent of the Israelites' repeated cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance in the Book of Judges.<p><b>when you are in distress?</b><br>The distress refers to the threat from the Ammonites, who were oppressing Israel. This pattern of turning to God or His chosen deliverer in times of trouble is a central theme in Judges. It serves as a reminder of human tendency to seek divine help only in crisis, and points to the ultimate deliverance found in Jesus Christ, who offers salvation to those who call upon Him in their time of need (<a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A mighty warrior and the son of Gilead, born to a prostitute.

Jephthah puts the elders on the spot, reminding them of their open hostility (<a href="/judges/11-1.htm">Judges 11:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; The language mirrors other biblical moments when God&#8217;s chosen servant was despised by his own: Joseph by his brothers (<a href="/genesis/37-4.htm">Genesis 37:4</a>), David by Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/18-29.htm">1 Samuel 18:29</a>), and ultimately Christ by His own nation (<a href="/john/15-24.htm">John 15:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; This question exposes the elders&#8217; sin before any negotiation begins, just as Nathan exposed David&#8217;s sin before offering grace (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and expel me from my father&#8217;s house?</b><p>&#8226; Their hatred moved from feeling to action: they drove Jephthah away, cutting him off from inheritance and community (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-15.htm">Deuteronomy 21:15-17</a> shows how serious loss of inheritance was).<p>&#8226; The pattern repeats throughout Scripture&#8212;God&#8217;s instruments are often pushed out before they are called back: Moses fled from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/2-15.htm">Exodus 2:15</a>), David hid in the wilderness (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>), Paul was sent away to Tarsus (<a href="/acts/9-30.htm">Acts 9:30</a>).<p>&#8226;

Jephthah highlights their sudden change of heart. His question forces the elders to admit motive&#8212;desperation, not affection (compare <a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>).<p>&#8226; It underscores human tendency to seek help only when personal resources run out, as Israel repeatedly did with the LORD (<a href="/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9</a>; 4:3; 10:10).<p>&#8226; The scene foreshadows the way people later sought Jesus&#8217; miracles without embracing His message (<a href="/john/6-26.htm">John 6:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when you are in distress?</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Distress&#8221; points to the Ammonite threat (<a href="/judges/10-9.htm">Judges 10:9</a>). Crisis pushed the elders to the man they once rejected, just as famine drove Jacob&#8217;s sons to Joseph (<a href="/genesis/42-1.htm">Genesis 42:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; God often allows pressure so His people will recognize the deliverer He has already prepared (<a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/15-4.htm">2 Chronicles 15:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Jephthah&#8217;s question invites repentance. True deliverance in Scripture is tied to a heart shift, not mere relief (<a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>; <a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jephthah&#8217;s fourfold question exposes the elders&#8217; past sin, reveals their present motive, and sets the stage for God&#8217;s redemptive pattern: the rejected deliverer becomes the rescuer in Israel&#8217;s hour of need. The verse reminds us that God can turn rejection into preparation, that crisis can open eyes to the servant God has chosen, and that genuine repentance, not convenience, is what He seeks.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Did not ye hate me?</span>--The elders of Gilead must at least have permitted his expulsion by his brethren.<p><span class= "bld">Therefore.</span>--i.e., with the express desire to repair the old wrong.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Did not ye hate me</span>, etc. Jephthah's reproach to the "elders of Gilead" strongly favours the idea that "his brethren" in ver. 3, and the "father's house" in ver. 2, are to be taken in the wider sense of fellow-tribesmen and "house of fathers," and that his expulsion was not the private act of his own brothers training him out of the house they lived in, but a tribal act (taking <span class="accented">tribe in</span> the sense of <span class="accented">house of fathers</span>), in which the elders of Gilead bad taken a part.
