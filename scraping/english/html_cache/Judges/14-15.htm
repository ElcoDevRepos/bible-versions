In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the number four often symbolizes completeness or universality. The fourth day marks a turning point in the narrative, indicating the urgency and desperation of the Philistines. This timing also reflects the cultural practice of wedding feasts, which typically lasted seven days.<p><b>they said to Samson&#8217;s wife</b><br>Samson's wife was a Philistine, highlighting the tension between the Israelites and the Philistines. Her role is pivotal, as she becomes a tool for the Philistines to manipulate Samson. This reflects the broader theme of conflict and compromise between God's people and surrounding nations.<p><b>&#8220;Entice your husband to explain the riddle to us</b><br>The word "entice" suggests seduction or persuasion, indicating the Philistines' reliance on deceit rather than direct confrontation. This mirrors the serpent's temptation of Eve in Genesis, where persuasion leads to a fall. The riddle itself is a test of wisdom and strength, common in ancient literature.<p><b>or we will burn you and your father&#8217;s household to death</b><br>This threat reveals the brutal and violent nature of the Philistines. It underscores the stakes involved and the lengths to which they will go to maintain honor and avoid shame. The threat of fire is a recurring motif in Scripture, symbolizing judgment and destruction, as seen in Sodom and Gomorrah.<p><b>Did you invite us here to rob us?&#8221;</b><br>The accusation of being robbed points to the cultural importance of honor and reciprocity in ancient societies. The Philistines feel deceived and humiliated by the riddle, which they cannot solve. This reflects the broader biblical theme of human pride and the consequences of trying to outwit God's chosen instruments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God.

But all difficulty will disappear if we bear in mind the peculiarity of Hebrew narrative noticed in note to section vers. 1-6 of ch. 2, when we come to consider ver. 16. <span class="cmt_word">Entice thy husband</span>. Cf. <a href="/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That he may declare unto us</span>. If the text is sound, they must mean to say, <span class="accented">declare it unto you</span>, <span class="accented">that you may declare</span> it unto us, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> declare it unto us through you. But it is simpler either to read with the Septuagint, that he <span class="accented">may declare unto you</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span>, or to read, and <span class="accented">declare unto us</span>, <span class="accented">in</span> the imperative mood. Burn with fire. See ch. 12:1, and Judges 15:6. Have ye called us, etc., <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Did you invite us to this feast in order to impoverish us, to plunder us of our property? We shall conclude that you did so if you do not disclose to us the riddle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/14-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;
