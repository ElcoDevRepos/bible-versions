The Philistines, long-time enemies of Israel, finally capture Samson, symbolizing the triumph of pagan forces over God's chosen judge due to his personal failings.<p><b>gouged out his eyes</b><br>The act of gouging out Samson's eyes is both literal and symbolic. It represents the loss of his physical sight and the spiritual blindness that led to his downfall. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, blinding a captive was a common practice to humiliate and incapacitate them. This act also serves as a metaphor for Samson's inability to see the spiritual truths and consequences of his actions.<p><b>and brought him down to Gaza</b><br>Gaza was one of the five major Philistine cities and a place where Samson had previously demonstrated his strength (<a href="/judges/16.htm">Judges 16:1-3</a>). His being brought back to Gaza signifies a reversal of his earlier triumphs and underscores the Philistines' dominance over him. Gaza's location as a fortified city along the coastal plain made it a strategic and symbolic site for the Philistines.<p><b>where he was bound with bronze shackles</b><br>Bronze shackles indicate the severity of Samson's captivity. Bronze, a strong metal, symbolizes the strength of his bondage and the Philistines' determination to prevent any further threat from him. This imagery contrasts with Samson's previous freedom and strength, highlighting his complete subjugation.<p><b>and forced to grind grain in the prison</b><br>Grinding grain was typically a task for slaves or women, emphasizing Samson's humiliation and the loss of his status as a judge and leader of Israel. This menial labor in prison reflects his fall from a divinely empowered deliverer to a powerless captive. The image of grinding grain also foreshadows his eventual redemption and final act of strength, as it sets the stage for his ultimate sacrifice and victory over the Philistines.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God tied to his Nazirite vow.

His unchecked desire now costs him the very organs he used to rationalize disobedience.<p>&#8226; The removal of his sight forces him to look inward and upward; later we read that &#8220;his hair began to grow back&#8221; (<a href="/judges/16-22.htm">Judges 16:22</a>), signaling renewed dependence on God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Brought him down to Gaza</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and brought him down to Gaza&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>c)<p>&#8226; Gaza is where Samson earlier ripped off the city gates in triumph (<a href="/judges/16-1.htm">Judges 16:1-3</a>). Returning as a prisoner highlights how far he has fallen.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;brought him down&#8221; is geographical and moral; Scripture often speaks of descent when someone moves away from God&#8217;s blessing (<a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>; <a href="/luke/10-30.htm">Luke 10:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Gaza, a key Philistine stronghold (<a href="/judges/1-18.htm">Judges 1:18</a>), becomes the stage for God&#8217;s final act of judgment against their oppression (<a href="/judges/16-30.htm">Judges 16:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bound with bronze shackles</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;where he was bound with bronze shackles&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>d)<p>&#8226; Bronze symbolizes strength and endurance; the enemy intends to make escape impossible (cf. <a href="/psalms/107-10.htm">Psalm 107:10-16</a>, where bronze bonds illustrate captivity).<p>&#8226; Similar restraints appear when Israel&#8217;s kings fall&#8212;Zedekiah (<a href="/2_kings/25-7.htm">2 Kings 25:7</a>) and Manasseh (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>)&#8212;reminding us that sin&#8217;s wages are bondage.<p>&#8226; Samson once tore off ropes &#8220;as flax&#8221; (<a href="/judges/15-14.htm">Judges 15:14</a>).

Like Joseph prospering in confinement (<a href="/genesis/39-20.htm">Genesis 39:20-23</a>) or Paul writing letters from jail (<a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12-14</a>), God often uses prisons to refine and reposition His servants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a> records the immediate, literal fallout of Samson&#8217;s sin: capture, blindness, humiliation, and bondage. Each phrase shows a downward step&#8212;from freedom to slavery, from sight to darkness, from ruler to grinder. Yet even here God is not finished. The verse prepares us for Samson&#8217;s final prayer and God&#8217;s ultimate victory over the Philistines (<a href="/judges/16-28.htm">Judges 16:28-30</a>). It warns believers that unchecked compromise leads to costly consequences, while also assuring us that sincere repentance can turn even a prison into the doorway of redemption.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Put out his eyes.</span>--the margin, "bored out," is more correct.
