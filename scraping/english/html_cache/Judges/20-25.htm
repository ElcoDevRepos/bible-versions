The events are part of a larger narrative of civil war within Israel, highlighting the urgency and intensity of the situation. The repetition of battle on the same day underscores the relentless nature of the conflict and the determination of both sides.<p><b>the Benjamites came out against them from Gibeah</b><br>Gibeah was a significant city in the territory of Benjamin, known for the grievous sin that led to this conflict (Judges 19). The Benjamites' defense of their city reflects their loyalty to their tribe over the broader unity of Israel. This tribal allegiance is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often leading to internal strife. Gibeah's location and fortifications would have provided a strategic advantage in battle.<p><b>and cut down another 18,000 Israelites</b><br>The phrase "cut down" indicates a decisive and violent victory for the Benjamites. The number 18,000 signifies a substantial loss for the Israelites, emphasizing the severity of the defeat. This loss is part of a series of defeats that the Israelites suffer, which serves as a humbling experience and a call to seek God's guidance more earnestly.<p><b>all of them armed with swords</b><br>The mention of being "armed with swords" highlights the preparedness and military capability of the Israelite forces, making their defeat even more striking. This detail underscores the futility of relying solely on human strength and weapons without divine favor. The sword is a common biblical symbol for warfare and judgment, often used to illustrate the power of God's word (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_benjamites.htm">The Benjamites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel, descended from Benjamin, the youngest son of Jacob.
