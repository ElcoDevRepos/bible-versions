This is supported by the context in which the angel speaks with divine authority. Gideon, at this time, is threshing wheat in a winepress to hide from the Midianites, indicating the oppressive circumstances Israel faced. The appearance of the angel signifies divine intervention in a time of crisis, a recurring theme in the Book of Judges where God raises deliverers for Israel.<p><b>and said,</b><br>The act of speaking by the angel emphasizes the personal and direct communication from God to Gideon. This divine communication is a hallmark of God's relationship with His chosen leaders throughout the Old Testament, as seen with figures like Moses and Joshua. It underscores the importance of Gideon's role in the unfolding narrative of Israel's deliverance.<p><b>&#8220;The LORD is with you,</b><br>This assurance of God's presence is central to the biblical narrative, echoing promises made to patriarchs like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and leaders like Moses and Joshua. It is a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God's presence signifies protection, guidance, and empowerment. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament promise of Emmanuel, "God with us," fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<p><b>O mighty man of valor.&#8221;</b><br>This title is significant as it contrasts with Gideon's current situation, hiding from the enemy. It reflects God's perspective and potential for Gideon, rather than his present reality. This divine perspective is a common biblical theme, where God calls individuals based on His purpose and power rather than their circumstances or self-perception. It prefigures the transformative power of God's calling, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures like David and the apostles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A member of the tribe of Manasseh, Gideon is called by God to deliver Israel from the oppression of the Midianites.
