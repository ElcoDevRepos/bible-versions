Sihon was the king of the Amorites, a significant Canaanite tribe known for their fortified cities and military strength. The sending of messengers reflects a customary practice in the ancient Near East for negotiating passage or alliances. This event is also recorded in <a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-23</a>, emphasizing its importance in Israel's history. The Amorites were descendants of Canaan, and their land was part of the territory promised to Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p><b>who ruled in Heshbon</b><br>Heshbon was a major city and the capital of Sihon's kingdom. Archaeological evidence suggests it was a well-fortified city, strategically located on the King's Highway, a crucial trade route. The city's prominence is noted in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24-37</a>, where the conquest of Heshbon is detailed. The control of Heshbon was vital for Israel's access to the eastern side of the Jordan River and their eventual settlement in the land.<p><b>and said to him, &#8216;Please let us pass through your land into our own place.&#8217;</b><br>This request underscores Israel's intention to peacefully transit through Amorite territory without engaging in conflict. The phrase "into our own place" refers to the land promised to them by God, reinforcing the divine mandate behind their journey. The request for passage is reminiscent of similar appeals made to Edom (<a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>) and Moab (<a href="/judges/11-17.htm">Judges 11:17</a>), highlighting a consistent pattern of seeking peaceful passage. The refusal by Sihon, as later detailed in the narrative, led to a divinely sanctioned military confrontation, which resulted in Israel's victory and acquisition of the land, fulfilling part of God's promise to Abraham. This event foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises and can be seen as a type of Christ's victory over spiritual adversaries, securing the inheritance for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The collective name for the descendants of Jacob, also known as the Israelites.
