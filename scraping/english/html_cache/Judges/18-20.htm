The priest's joy in this context can be seen as a warning against prioritizing material or social advancement over faithfulness to God.<p><b>and took the ephod,</b><br>The ephod, a priestly garment, was often associated with seeking divine guidance. However, in this context, it is misused, symbolizing the corruption of true worship.

This reflects the spiritual decline in Israel, where even those in religious roles, like the priest, participate in idolatry. The presence of such images indicates a departure from the worship of Yahweh alone, a recurring issue throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>and went with the people.</b><br>The priest's decision to go with the Danites signifies a shift in allegiance, prioritizing personal benefit over spiritual integrity. This action foreshadows the establishment of a rival religious center in Dan, which becomes a stumbling block for Israel (<a href="/1_kings/12-29.htm">1 Kings 12:29-30</a>).
