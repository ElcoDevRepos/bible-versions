The most natural would be the Feast of Tabernacles. We see from <a href="/1_samuel/1-3.htm" title="And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.">1Samuel 1:3</a> that even among pious families the trying custom of going up to the Tabernacle three times a year had fallen into complete abeyance.<p><span class= "bld">A place which is on the north side of Beth-el . . .--</span>This elaborate description of the site of Shiloh, a place which is so often mentioned elsewhere without any addition, is extremely curious. There can be little doubt that it is due to the marginal gloss of some Masoretic scribe, perhaps in the editing of the sacred books by Ezra. That it is a gloss seems clear, because it comes in as a parenthesis in the speech of the elders, and, of course, in their day such a description was needless. Indeed, it was spoken at Shiloh itself, and the site was well known to all Israel. But by the time that the story was committed to writing in the days of the kings, or finally edited in the days of Ezra, Shiloh had long been desolate, and probably the very site was unknown to thousands. Hence this very valuable and interesting description was added, which has alone enabled us to identify Shiloh in the modern <span class= "ital">Seil-n.</span><p><span class= "bld">South of Lebonah.</span>--Lebonah, now <span class= "ital">Lubban, </span>is not mentioned elsewhere.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is a feast of the Lord in Shiloh yearly</span>. Compare the exactly similar description, <a href="/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3, 7</a>. There is a great difference of opinion among commentators as to what feast is here meant. Hengstenberg, Keil, Delitzsch, and others think it was the passover; Bishop Patrick and others think it was the feast of tabernacles, a more joyous feast; Rosenmuller and others think it was a festival peculiar to Shiloh, after the analogy of the yearly sacrifice of the family of Jesse at Bethlehem (<a href="/1_samuel/20-29.htm">1 Samuel 20:29</a>), and more or less in accordance with <a href="/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10-12</a>. It is not easy to say which view is right, but the last seems not improbable, <span class="cmt_word">In a place which is on the north side</span>, etc. The words <span class="accented">in a place</span> are not in the Hebrew, and do not seem to be implied by the context. But the description is that of the situation of Shiloh itself, which is very exact (see 'Palestine Exploration Fund,' Map of West Palestine). <span class="cmt_word">Lebonah</span> survives in el-Lubbun, about two miles north-west of Seilun, and to the west of the road to Shechem or Nablus. It seems strange that so particular a description of the situation of Shiloh should be given; but it may probably indicate that the writer lived after the tabernacle had been moved to Jerusalem, and Shiloh had relapsed into an obscure village (see <a href="/judges/20-27.htm">Judges 20:27</a>, note). The situation of the descriptive words in the Hebrew, with the pronoun <span class="accented">which</span>, separated from <span class="accented">Shiloh</span> by the word <span class="accented">yearly</span>, indicates that they are an explanation added by the narrator. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/21-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;But look,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1441;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
