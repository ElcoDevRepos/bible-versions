In the context of Judges, this refers to the aftermath of battle where the victorious army would take goods, livestock, and captives from the defeated. This practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/30-24.htm">1 Samuel 30:24-25</a>, where David establishes a statute regarding the division of spoil. It highlights the material motivations behind many ancient conflicts and the expectation of tangible rewards for warriors.<p><b>a girl or two for each warrior,</b><br>The mention of "a girl or two for each warrior" underscores the grim reality of ancient warfare, where women were often taken as captives and subjected to slavery or forced marriages. This reflects the cultural norms of the time, where women were considered part of the spoils of war. The dehumanizing aspect of this practice is evident, and it contrasts sharply with the biblical ideal of treating all individuals with dignity and respect, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>, where all humans are made in the image of God.<p><b>a plunder of dyed garments for Sisera,</b><br>Dyed garments were considered luxury items in the ancient Near East, often signifying wealth and status. The reference to "dyed garments for Sisera" indicates the high value placed on such items and suggests that Sisera, as a commander, would receive the choicest spoils. This is consistent with the historical context where leaders and kings would often claim the best of the plunder. The mention of dyed garments also connects to the broader biblical theme of wealth and its fleeting nature, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/23-5.htm">Proverbs 23:5</a>.<p><b>the spoil of embroidered garments for the neck of the looter?</b><br>Embroidered garments were even more valuable than dyed ones, often requiring significant time and skill to produce. The phrase "for the neck of the looter" suggests that these items were intended to adorn and elevate the status of those who took them. This reflects the human tendency to seek honor and recognition through material possessions. In a broader biblical context, this can be contrasted with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized storing up treasures in heaven rather than on earth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). The imagery of garments also appears in prophetic literature, such as <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>, where garments symbolize salvation and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sisera.htm">Sisera</a></b><br>A Canaanite commander defeated by the Israelites under Deborah and Barak.

Literally, <span class="accented">for the necks of spoil.</span> It is a difficult and obscure expression. The <span class="accented">spoil</span> may mean the camels, horses, or mules taken from the enemy, and the articles described may mean the housings and trappings for their necks. Or <span class="accented">the necks of spoil</span> might mean the necks of the beasts of burden laden with spoil. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/5-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8216;Are they not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">finding</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1456;&#1488;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(yim&#183;&#7779;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4672.htm">Strong's 4672: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come forth to, appear, exist, to attain, find, acquire, to occur, meet, be present</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and dividing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7717;al&#183;l&#601;&#183;q&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2505.htm">Strong's 2505: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be smooth, to apportion, separate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the spoil&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1431;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;l&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7998.htm">Strong's 7998: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prey, spoil, plunder, booty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a girl</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1444;&#1495;&#1463;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ra&#183;&#7717;am)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7356.htm">Strong's 7356: </a> </span><span class="str2">Compassion, the womb, a maiden</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[or] two</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1433;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ra&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#7791;a&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - fd<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7361.htm">Strong's 7361: </a> </span><span class="str2">A maiden</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for each</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;r&#333;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
