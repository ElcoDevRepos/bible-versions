Exhausted from battle and seeking refuge, he found himself in the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite. The Kenites were a nomadic tribe with connections to the Israelites through Moses' father-in-law, Jethro. Sisera's exhaustion symbolizes the complete defeat and vulnerability of those who oppose God's people.<p><b>Heber&#8217;s wife Jael took a tent peg</b><br>Jael's actions are significant in the cultural context of the time. Women were typically responsible for setting up tents, making Jael familiar with using a tent peg and hammer. Her choice of weapon is symbolic, as it represents using what is available and familiar to fulfill God's purposes. This act also highlights the unexpected ways God can deliver His people, using those who might seem unlikely or unqualified.<p><b>grabbed a hammer</b><br>The hammer, a tool of domestic life, becomes an instrument of divine justice. This reflects the theme throughout Scripture where God uses ordinary means and people to accomplish His extraordinary plans. The hammer and tent peg together symbolize the strength and decisiveness required to carry out God's will.<p><b>and went silently to Sisera</b><br>Jael's stealth and determination are crucial to the success of her mission. Her silence can be seen as a metaphor for the quiet yet powerful ways God often works behind the scenes. This moment of silence before the act of judgment parallels the calm before a storm, emphasizing the sudden and decisive nature of God's intervention.<p><b>She drove the peg through his temple and into the ground</b><br>This act of driving the peg through Sisera's temple is both literal and symbolic. It signifies the complete and utter defeat of the enemy, as well as the fulfillment of Deborah's prophecy that a woman would claim the victory over Sisera. The temple, a vulnerable part of the body, represents the vulnerability of those who oppose God's plans. The peg going into the ground signifies the finality and permanence of Sisera's defeat.<p><b>and he died</b><br>Sisera's death marks the end of Canaanite oppression over Israel, fulfilling God's promise of deliverance. This event foreshadows the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ. Just as Jael's unexpected role in delivering Israel points to God's sovereignty, Christ's victory through His death and resurrection demonstrates God's power to save through seemingly unlikely means.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jael.htm">Jael</a></b><br>The wife of Heber the Kenite, Jael is a pivotal figure in this account.

In the last clause put the full-stop after <span class="accented">asleep</span>, and read, <span class="accented">So he swooned and died.</span> It is impossible for us to view Jael's act in the same light as her contemporaries did, on account of its treachery and cruelty; but we can admire her faith in the God of Israel, her lave for the people of God, and her marvellous courage and strength of mind in carrying out her purpose, and make allowance for the age in which she lived. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/4-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But as he</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1469;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
