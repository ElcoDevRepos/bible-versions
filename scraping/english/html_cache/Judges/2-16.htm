This period follows the death of Joshua and precedes the establishment of the monarchy in Israel. The judges were not merely judicial figures but were often military leaders and spiritual guides. The raising up of judges signifies God's direct intervention in response to the Israelites' cries for help, demonstrating His mercy and covenant faithfulness despite their recurring disobedience. This cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance is a central theme in the Book of Judges.<p><b>who saved them from the hands of those who plundered them</b><br>The phrase highlights the primary role of the judges: to deliver Israel from foreign oppressors. The "plunderers" were often neighboring nations that God allowed to oppress Israel as a consequence of their idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness. These oppressors included the Moabites, Ammonites, Philistines, and others. The deliverance by the judges is a foreshadowing of the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who saves humanity from the bondage of sin. The cyclical nature of Israel's sin and deliverance underscores the need for a permanent solution, which is fulfilled in the New Testament through Christ's redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who intervenes in the lives of His people by raising up judges to deliver them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judges.htm">Judges</a></b><br>Leaders appointed by God to deliver Israel from oppression.

The verse showcases God&#8217;s faithfulness, His sovereign choice of imperfect human instruments, and His power to rescue&#8212;patterns that repeat throughout Judges and ultimately point to the greater deliverance found in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Nevertheless.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">And.</span><p><span class= "bld">The Lord raised up judges.</span>--<a href="/acts/13-20.htm" title="And after that he gave to them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.">Acts 13:20</a>; <a href="/context/1_samuel/12-10.htm" title="And they cried to the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.">1Samuel 12:10-11</a>.

Of the judges in this book some--<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Tola, Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon--are not said to have performed any warlike deeds. They <span class= "ital">may, </span>however, have been warriors, like Jair, whose exploits are only preserved in tradition. Samuel, though not himself a fighter, yet roused the military courage of his people. They received no salary, imposed no tributes, made no laws, but merely exercised, for the deliverance of Israel, the personal ascendency conferred upon them by "the Spirit of God." Perhaps they find their nearest analogy in the Greek <span class= "ital">Aisymnetai </span>(elective princes) or the Roman <span class= "ital">Dictators. </span>The name is evidently the same as that of the Ph?nician <span class= "ital">Suffetes, </span>who succeeded the kings and were the Doges of Tyre after its siege by Nebuchadnezzar. (Jos. <span class= "ital">100 Ap. i.</span> 21.) Livy tells us that the Suffetes of Carthage had a sort of consular power in the senate (Liv. 30:7; 28:57; 33:46; 34:61). So, too, in the Middle Ages, Spanish governors were called "judges," and this was the title of the chief officer of Sardinia. The judges of Israel, at any rate in their true ideal, were not only military deliverers (<a href="/judges/3-9.htm" title="And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.">Judges 3:9</a>), but also supporters of divine law and order (<a href="/genesis/18-25.htm" title="That be far from you to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from you: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?">Genesis 18:25</a>). The abeyance of normally constituted authority during this period is seen in the fact that one of the judges is the son of a "stranger" (<a href="/judges/11-2.htm" title="And Gilead's wife bore him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said to him, You shall not inherit in our father's house; for you are the son of a strange woman.">Judges 11:2</a>), another a woman (<a href="/judges/4-4.htm" title="And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.">Judges 4:4</a>), and not one of them (in this book) of priestly or splendid birth. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Raised up judges</span>.
