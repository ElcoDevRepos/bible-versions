The Israelites, led by Moses, sought peaceful passage through Edom, a land inhabited by the descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother. This request reflects the historical kinship between Israel and Edom, as both nations descended from Isaac. The use of messengers indicates a formal and respectful approach, adhering to ancient Near Eastern customs of diplomacy.<p><b>&#8216;Please let us pass through your land,&#8217;</b><br>The request to pass through Edom was practical, as it provided a direct route to the Promised Land. This plea underscores Israel's reliance on God&#8217;s promise and their journey towards Canaan. The request was humble and polite, showing Israel's intention to avoid conflict and respect Edom's sovereignty. This approach is consistent with God's instructions to Israel to avoid conflict with Edom (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4-5</a>).<p><b>but the king of Edom would not listen.</b><br>Edom's refusal to grant passage reflects the longstanding tension between the two nations, despite their shared ancestry. This decision forced Israel to take a longer, more arduous route. The refusal can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy given to Rebekah about the struggle between Jacob and Esau (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>). It also foreshadows future hostilities between Israel and Edom.<p><b>They also sent messengers to the king of Moab,</b><br>Israel's approach to Moab mirrors their strategy with Edom, seeking peaceful passage. Moab, descended from Lot, Abraham's nephew, had a complex relationship with Israel. This diplomatic effort shows Israel's consistent desire to avoid unnecessary conflict and adhere to God's guidance. Moab's location was strategic, and cooperation would have facilitated Israel's journey.<p><b>but he would not consent.</b><br>Moab's refusal, like Edom's, highlights the regional tensions and distrust towards Israel. This denial forced Israel to navigate around Moab, further delaying their journey. Moab's decision is significant, as it sets the stage for future interactions, including the story of Balaam and the eventual conflict with Moabite kings. It also reflects the fulfillment of God's plan, as Israel's detours were part of their divine testing and preparation.<p><b>So Israel stayed in Kadesh.</b><br>Kadesh was a significant location for Israel, serving as a base during their wilderness wanderings. It was here that key events occurred, such as the sending of the spies into Canaan and the rebellion of the Israelites. Staying in Kadesh represents a period of waiting and testing for Israel, emphasizing their dependence on God's timing and provision. This location also serves as a reminder of past failures and the need for faithfulness to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The collective name for the descendants of Jacob, also known as the Israelites.
