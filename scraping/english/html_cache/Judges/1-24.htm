The spies, likely sent by the tribe of Judah, are on a reconnaissance mission to gather intelligence about the city. The act of seeing a man coming out suggests a divine providence, as this encounter provides them with an opportunity to gain insider information. The city in question is Bethel, previously known as Luz, a significant location in Israel's history, associated with Jacob's dream (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>). The presence of spies reflects a common military tactic in ancient warfare, where intelligence gathering was crucial for successful conquests.<p><b>they said to him, &#8220;Please show us how to get into the city,</b><br>The request made by the spies is both strategic and diplomatic. They seek a way into the city, indicating that Bethel was fortified and not easily accessible. This reflects the common practice of cities being walled for protection against invaders. The use of "please" suggests a polite approach, possibly to gain the man's trust and cooperation. This interaction can be compared to the story of Rahab in <a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>, where spies also sought assistance from a local inhabitant. The request implies a promise of safety or reward, a common practice in espionage and warfare.<p><b>and we will treat you kindly.&#8221;</b><br>The promise of kindness is a form of negotiation, offering the man a reward for his assistance. This reflects the cultural practice of making covenants or agreements, which were binding and taken seriously in ancient times. The term "kindly" suggests a favorable outcome for the man, possibly sparing his life or offering him protection. This mirrors the covenant made with Rahab, where her cooperation led to her and her family's preservation (<a href="/joshua/6-25.htm">Joshua 6:25</a>). The offer of kindness can also be seen as a type of Christ, who offers grace and mercy to those who assist in His mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/spies.htm">Spies</a></b><br>These are the men sent by the tribe of Joseph to scout the city of Bethel.

God has already promised victory (<a href="/judges/1-2.htm">Judges 1:2</a>), so the spies are acting in confidence that the Lord will give them a way in. Similar moments appear in <a href="/numbers/13-1.htm">Numbers 13:1-2</a>, where Moses sends spies into Canaan, and in <a href="/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1</a> when two men are sent to Jericho. Each time, God&#8217;s people employ practical means&#8212;reconnaissance&#8212;while trusting the Lord&#8217;s appointment of circumstances. The &#8220;man&#8221; is a providentially placed key to open the city gates, illustrating <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>, &#8220;A man&#8217;s heart plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Coming out of the city</b><p>A resident exiting Bethel suggests he is familiar with its defenses and routes. By God&#8217;s design, the spies meet him outside, avoiding suspicion. <a href="/genesis/24-15.htm">Genesis 24:15</a> shows the same timing in Rebekah arriving at the well &#8220;before he had finished praying,&#8221; underlining that what appears random is orchestrated by God (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>). The openness of the countryside contrasts with the fortified city; outside its walls, the man is approachable, reinforcing <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>&#8212;there is &#8220;a time to every purpose under heaven.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Please show us how to get into the city</b><p>The request reveals the spies&#8217; humility and strategy. Instead of storming Bethel, they seek guidance, mirroring <a href="/joshua/8-14.htm">Joshua 8:14-17</a> where an ambush requires inside knowledge. Their plea, &#8220;Please,&#8221; reflects <a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>, &#8220;A gentle answer turns away wrath.&#8221; God&#8217;s people may use persuasion without compromising reliance on divine power. The method anticipates Christ&#8217;s counsel in <a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a> to be &#8220;wise as serpents and innocent as doves.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We will treat you kindly</b><p>The promise of kindness&#8212;literally &#8220;mercy&#8221; or &#8220;hesed&#8221; in parallel passages&#8212;echoes <a href="/joshua/2-12.htm">Joshua 2:12-14</a>, where Rahab is guaranteed safety for aiding the spies. <a href="/proverbs/11-17.htm">Proverbs 11:17</a> teaches, &#8220;A man who is kind benefits himself,&#8221; and here kindness is both strategy and righteousness. The commitment to spare the man anticipates <a href="/judges/1-25.htm">Judges 1:25</a>, where mercy is actually shown, illustrating <a href="/james/2-13.htm">James 2:13</a>, &#8220;Mercy triumphs over judgment.&#8221; God honors covenants of kindness; <a href="/2_samuel/9-3.htm">2 Samuel 9:3</a> records David keeping covenant mercy with Jonathan&#8217;s line.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/1-24.htm">Judges 1:24</a> highlights God&#8217;s sovereign guidance through ordinary encounters. The spies, confident in God&#8217;s promise, recognize providence in meeting a single citizen, request his help with courtesy, and bind themselves to mercy. Scripture consistently portrays such intersections of divine sovereignty and human responsibility, teaching believers to act wisely, speak graciously, and honor their word while trusting the Lord to open every necessary gate.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">The spies.</span>--Perhaps, rather, <span class= "ital">the scouts </span>of the blockading squadron.
