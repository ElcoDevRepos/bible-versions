Their presence in the land posed a challenge to the Israelites, who were commanded by God to drive out the inhabitants of Canaan. The tribe of Dan, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, struggled to secure their allotted territory due to the Amorites' resistance. This reflects the broader theme in Judges of Israel's incomplete conquest of the Promised Land, which led to ongoing conflicts and spiritual compromise. The hill country refers to the mountainous regions, which were less desirable for settlement compared to the fertile plains.<p><b>and did not allow them to come down into the plain.</b><br>The plains were agriculturally rich and strategically important, making them highly coveted. The Amorites' control over the plains prevented the Danites from accessing these resources, highlighting the Danites' failure to fully trust in God's promise and power to deliver their enemies into their hands. This situation foreshadows the later migration of the Danites to the north, as recorded in <a href="/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>, where they sought a more secure and prosperous territory. The inability to settle in the plains also serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and lack of faith, as God had promised victory if the Israelites remained faithful to His commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amorites.htm">Amorites</a></b><br>A group of ancient people living in Canaan, often seen as adversaries to the Israelites.

Long before Israel entered the land, God had warned that the Amorites&#8217; sin would eventually merit judgment (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>). Though Joshua defeated many Amorite kings (<a href="/joshua/24-8.htm">Joshua 24:8</a>), pockets of resistance remained, particularly in the rugged western foothills (<a href="/numbers/21-25.htm">Numbers 21:25&#8211;26</a>). <a href="/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34</a> shows that these remnants still wielded enough power to dominate a whole tribe.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>forced the Danites</b><p>The tribe of Dan had been allotted fertile territory along the coast (<a href="/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40&#8211;46</a>). Yet instead of forcing the Amorites out as God commanded (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>), Dan found itself pushed back. This reversal highlights two realities:<p>&#8226; Dan&#8217;s incomplete obedience and lack of faith (<a href="/judges/2-2.htm">Judges 2:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s warning that disobedience would lead to oppression (<a href="/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16&#8211;17</a>).<p>Later, Dan would abandon its inheritance altogether and migrate north (<a href="/judges/18-1.htm">Judges 18:1, 27</a>&#8211;29).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into the hill country</b><p>Driven from the coast, Dan took refuge in difficult highland terrain. Hills offered natural defense (cf. <a href="/judges/6-2.htm">Judges 6:2</a>, where Israelites hid from Midianites), but they also limited agriculture and trade. What should have been broad, fruitful lowlands became narrow, survival-oriented living. The scene foreshadows the contrast between life in God&#8217;s full promise and life marked by compromise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and did not allow them</b><p>This phrase paints a picture of ongoing, active control. The Amorites dictated where Dan could and could not go&#8212;an everyday reminder of lost freedom. God had intended Israel to be &#8220;the head and not the tail&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-13.htm">Deuteronomy 28:13</a>), yet here the roles are reversed because of unbelief (<a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>). The oppression was persistent until the house of Joseph later gained strength and pressed the Amorites into forced labor (<a href="/judges/1-35.htm">Judges 1:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to come down into the plain</b><p>The plains of the Shephelah were fertile, strategic, and ideal for iron chariots (<a href="/judges/1-19.htm">Judges 1:19</a>; <a href="/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>). Whoever controlled the lowlands controlled commerce and harvests. By barring Dan from the plains, the Amorites cut the tribe off from:<p>&#8226; Rich farmland that could sustain large populations.<p>&#8226; Major trade routes running north and south.<p>&#8226; A springboard for further conquest toward the coast, later dominated by the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/17-1.htm">1 Samuel 17:1</a>).<p>Dan&#8217;s inability to access the plains underscores the cost of partial obedience: loss of blessing and diminished influence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34</a> shows that when God&#8217;s people fail to drive out entrenched sin and opposition, that very opposition gains control. The Amorites&#8217; dominance over Dan illustrates the consequences of incomplete obedience&#8212;displacement, restriction, and forfeited blessing. God&#8217;s promises are real and literal, but they must be embraced in faith and action; otherwise, like Dan, we risk living on the margins of what He intended.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">The Amorites.</span>--They were the Highlanders of Palestine (<a href="/joshua/10-6.htm" title="And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not your hand from your servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.">Joshua 10:6</a>; <a href="/numbers/13-29.htm" title="The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.">Numbers 13:29</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-44.htm" title="And the Amorites, which dwelled in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even to Hormah.">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Forced.</span>--Literally "squeezed" or "pressed."<p><span class= "bld">Forced the children of Dan into the mountain.</span>--The condition of this tribe was, therefore, the worst of all.
