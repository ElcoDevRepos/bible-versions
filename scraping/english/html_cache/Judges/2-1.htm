Gilgal was a significant location for the Israelites, serving as their first encampment in the Promised Land and a place of covenant renewal (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19-24</a>). Bochim, meaning "weepers," is where the Israelites mourned after hearing the angel's message. This movement from Gilgal to Bochim symbolizes a transition from victory and covenant faithfulness to a place of sorrow and repentance.<p><b>and said, &#8220;I brought you up out of Egypt</b><br>This phrase recalls the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history, where God delivered His people from slavery. It emphasizes God's role as Redeemer and Deliverer, reminding the Israelites of His power and faithfulness. The Exodus is frequently referenced throughout Scripture as a demonstration of God's covenantal love and commitment to His people (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/5-6.htm">Deuteronomy 5:6</a>).<p><b>and led you into the land that I had promised to your fathers</b><br>This refers to the Abrahamic Covenant, where God promised the land of Canaan to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 15</a>:18-21). The fulfillment of this promise is a testament to God's faithfulness and serves as a reminder of His sovereign plan. The land is not just a physical inheritance but a symbol of God's blessing and presence with His people.<p><b>and I said, &#8216;I will never break My covenant with you&#8217;</b><br>God's covenant with Israel is unconditional, based on His character and promises rather than Israel's actions. This assurance of God's unbreakable covenant highlights His steadfast love and faithfulness, even when His people are unfaithful. This echoes the New Covenant through Christ, where believers are assured of God's eternal commitment (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, <a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger often seen as a theophany, or a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ, who delivers God's messages and commands.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilgal.htm">Gilgal</a></b><br>A significant location in Israel's history, where the Israelites first camped after crossing the Jordan River and where they renewed their covenant with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bochim.htm">Bochim</a></b><br>Meaning "weepers," this place is where the Israelites mourned after being rebuked by the Angel of the LORD for their disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land of bondage from which God delivered the Israelites, symbolizing God's power and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_covenant.htm">The Covenant</a></b><br>The solemn agreement between God and the Israelites, emphasizing God's unchanging faithfulness and the people's responsibility to obey His commands.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God is unwavering in His promises.

The verse introduces the tension governing Judges&#8212;the Lord&#8217;s unwavering faithfulness versus Israel&#8217;s wavering obedience&#8212;calling every reader to trust the God who never breaks His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">An angel of the Lord.</span>--The words "<span class= "ital">Maleak Jehovah</span>" are used of Haggai, in <a href="/haggai/1-13.htm" title="Then spoke Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message to the people, saying, I am with you, said the LORD.">Haggai 1:13</a>; of prophets in <a href="/isaiah/42-19.htm" title="Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD's servant?">Isaiah 42:19</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm" title="For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed.">Malachi 3:6</a>; of priests in <a href="/malachi/2-7.htm" title="For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 2:7</a>. Hence from very ancient times these words have been interpreted as, "a messenger of the Lord" (as in the margin of our Bible). The Targum paraphrases it by "a prophet with a message from Jehovah." R. Tanchum, from <a href="/judges/2-6.htm" title="And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.">Judges 2:6</a>, infers that it was Joshua himself. Kimchi and others have supposed that it was Phinehas. No indications are given of anything specially miraculous. On the other hand, there is much room to suppose that the writer intended "the Angel of the Presence," because ( 1 ) he constantly uses the phrase in this sense (<a href="/context/judges/6-11.htm" title="And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the wine press, to hide it from the Midianites.">Judges 6:11-12</a>; <a href="/context/judges/6-21.htm" title="Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.">Judges 6:21-22</a>; <a href="/judges/13-3.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold now, you are barren, and bore not: but you shall conceive, and bear a son.">Judges 13:3</a>; <a href="/judges/13-13.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Of all that I said to the woman let her beware.">Judges 13:13</a>; <a href="/judges/13-15.htm" title="And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, I pray you, let us detain you, until we shall have made ready a kid for you.">Judges 13:15</a>, &c.); (2) the same phrase occurs in this sense elsewhere, as in <a href="/genesis/16-7.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.">Genesis 16:7</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-11.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD called to him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.">Genesis 22:11</a>; <a href="/exodus/2-2.htm" title="And the woman conceived, and bore a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.">Exodus 2:2</a>; <a href="/exodus/2-6.htm" title="And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.">Exodus 2:6</a>; <a href="/exodus/2-14.htm" title="And he said, Who made you a prince and a judge over us? intend you to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.">Exodus 2:14</a>; <a href="/numbers/22-22.htm" title="And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his ass, and his two servants were with him.">Numbers 22:22</a>, &c; (3) the angel speaks in the first person, and does not introduce his words by "Thus saith Jehovah," as the prophets always do (but see below). It seems probable, therefore, that by "the angel of the Lord" the writer meant "the captain of the Lord's host," who appeared to Joshua at Jericho (<a href="/context/joshua/5-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?">Joshua 5:13-15</a>). Against this conclusion may be urged the fact that in no other instance does an angel appear to, or preach to, multitudes. Angels are sent to individuals, but prophets to nations. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An angel of the Lord</span>.
