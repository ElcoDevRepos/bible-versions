In the context of <a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20</a>, the tribes of Israel are responding to the grievous crime committed in Gibeah, a city of the tribe of Benjamin. The phrase "stood as one man" indicates a unanimous decision, reflecting a rare moment of national solidarity among the often-fractious tribes. This unity is significant in the biblical narrative, as it contrasts with the frequent disunity and infighting seen throughout the book of Judges. The concept of unity is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/133.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>, which speaks of the goodness and pleasantness of brethren dwelling together in unity. This unity can also be seen as a type of the unity that is found in the body of Christ, as described in the New Testament (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>and said, &#8220;Not one of us will return to his tent or to his house.</b><br>This declaration signifies a collective commitment to action and justice. The Israelites vow not to return to their homes until they have addressed the atrocity committed in Gibeah. This reflects a cultural and historical context where tribal and familial honor demanded a response to such an egregious act. The phrase "not one of us will return" underscores the seriousness of their vow and the urgency of their mission. It also highlights the communal nature of ancient Israelite society, where individual actions were often subordinate to the needs and decisions of the community. This determination to act can be compared to the resolve seen in other biblical narratives, such as Nehemiah's commitment to rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem (<a href="/nehemiah/4-6.htm">Nehemiah 4:6</a>) or the early church's dedication to spreading the gospel despite persecution (<a href="/acts/4-18.htm">Acts 4:18-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

Judges 20:8 Mean</div><b>Then</b><p>&#8226; The word signals immediate action following the Levite&#8217;s testimony at Mizpah (<a href="/judges/20-4.htm">Judges 20:4&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture reports events in a straightforward timeline; the tribes hear, assess, and promptly respond (cf. <a href="/joshua/24-24.htm">Joshua 24:24&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; Their reaction underscores the seriousness of covenant violation in Israel&#8212;justice cannot be delayed (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the people</b><p>&#8226;

fulfills God&#8217;s design for corporate accountability (<a href="/numbers/32-20.htm">Numbers 32:20&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; The collective nature foreshadows later national gatherings, such as at Samuel&#8217;s call to repentance (<a href="/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>stood as one man</b><p>&#8226; Physical stance reflects spiritual unity; they rise

(<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>). Here, that unity contrasts sharply with Benjamin&#8217;s isolation.<p>&#8226; The imagery anticipates New Testament calls for the church to be &#8220;of one mind&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>), showing continuity in God&#8217;s desire for unified obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said,</b><p>&#8226; Spoken commitment seals the resolve; words testify to intentions before God and each other (<a href="/numbers/30-1.htm">Numbers 30:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Public declaration removes room for later retreat, echoing Joshua&#8217;s &#8220;As for me and my house&#8230;&#8221; statement (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Verbal agreement also serves to summon accountability; every tribe hears the vow simultaneously (<a href="/deuteronomy/27-14.htm">Deuteronomy 27:14&#8211;26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Not one of us will return to his tent or to his house</b><p>&#8226; The pledge forbids personal comfort until justice is pursued, mirroring soldiers&#8217; wartime vows (<a href="/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Tent&#8221; and &#8220;house&#8221; cover both nomadic and settled dwellings, emphasizing total commitment across tribal lines (<a href="/genesis/25-27.htm">Genesis 25:27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-30.htm">Deuteronomy 5:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Such self-denial recalls the call to prioritize God&#8217;s righteousness over individual ease (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<p>&#8226; The literal refusal to go home sets the stage for the costly civil war that follows (<a href="/judges/20-20.htm">Judges 20:20&#8211;21</a>), revealing the severity of sin&#8217;s consequences when left unchecked.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/20-8.htm">Judges 20:8</a> records Israel&#8217;s immediate, unanimous, and vocal resolve to seek justice after the atrocity at Gibeah.
