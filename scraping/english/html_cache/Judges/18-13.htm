This area is characterized by its rugged terrain and strategic location, which made it a central hub for various events in Israel's history. The tribe of Ephraim was known for its strength and influence, as seen in passages like <a href="/joshua/17-17.htm">Joshua 17:17-18</a>. The hill country also served as a backdrop for many biblical narratives, including the story of Deborah and Barak in <a href="/judges/4.htm">Judges 4-5</a>. The journey to this region by the Danites reflects their search for a new territory, as their allotted land was insufficient or difficult to conquer (<a href="/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34</a>).<p><b>and came to Micah&#8217;s house</b><br>Micah's house is central to the narrative in <a href="/judges/17.htm">Judges 17-18</a>, where Micah, an Ephraimite, establishes a private shrine with an idol, ephod, and household gods. This reflects the period's religious syncretism and the Israelites' departure from pure worship of Yahweh, as outlined in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). Micah's actions illustrate the spiritual confusion and moral decline during the time of the Judges, a theme prevalent throughout the book. The presence of a Levite serving as a priest in Micah's house further underscores the era's religious disorder, as Levites were meant to serve in the tabernacle, not private shrines (<a href="/numbers/18.htm">Numbers 18:1-7</a>). This setting becomes pivotal as the Danites later seize Micah's idols and priest, highlighting the chaotic and lawless state of Israel during this period.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_danites.htm">The Danites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel seeking a new territory to inhabit, as their allotted land was insufficient or difficult to conquer.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hill_country_of_ephraim.htm">Hill Country of Ephraim</a></b><br>A central region in Israel, known for its rugged terrain and significant biblical events.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>An individual from the hill country of Ephraim who had established a shrine with idols and a personal priest.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah's_house.htm">Micah&#8217;s House</a></b><br>The location where the Danites stopped, which contained a shrine with idols and a Levite priest.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/levite_priest.htm">Levite Priest</a></b><br>A young Levite who served as a priest for Micah, despite the irregularity of his appointment and the idolatrous context.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>The account of Micah and the Danites serves as a cautionary tale about the subtlety and danger of idolatry, even among God&#8217;s people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_god's_guidance.htm">Seeking God&#8217;s Guidance</a></b><br>The Danites&#8217;

departure from Kiriath-jearim (<a href="/judges/18-12.htm">Judges 18:12</a>). It signals a real geographical move, reminding us that biblical narrative is rooted in historical locations, not myth (cf. <a href="/luke/2-1.htm">Luke 2:1-2</a>, where Luke names places and rulers to anchor events in history). Just as Israel&#8217;s wanderings in <a href="/bsb/numbers/33.htm">Numbers 33</a> are carefully logged, this short clause testifies to God&#8217;s sovereign oversight of every step His people take (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they traveled</b><p>Movement implies purpose. These five scouts are not wandering randomly; they are on mission to confirm a territory for the tribe of Dan (<a href="/judges/18-1.htm">Judges 18:1-6</a>). Their travel echoes earlier reconnaissance trips:<p>&#8226; <a href="/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17-20</a> &#8211; Moses&#8217; spies scout Canaan.<p>&#8226; <a href="/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1</a> &#8211; Joshua&#8217;s spies assess Jericho.<p>In each case, travel precedes decisive action, illustrating <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>: faith produces movement, not passivity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the hill country of Ephraim</b><p>The highlands of Ephraim provided strategic terrain and fertile soil (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-9</a>). Coming here takes the Danites through the heartland of Israel, where worship of the true God should have been strongest (<a href="/joshua/24-28.htm">Joshua 24:28-31</a>). Yet idolatry is entrenched&#8212;highlighting the moral decline described in <a href="/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>, &#8220;In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes&#8221;. The contrast warns that proximity to sacred places does not guarantee faithfulness (cf. <a href="/matthew/11-20.htm">Matthew 11:20-24</a>, where cities near Jesus remained unrepentant).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and came</b><p>The simple verb marks arrival, showing God&#8217;s providence in bringing them exactly where He intends (<a href="/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a>). Every arrival in Scripture carries consequence&#8212;Abram arriving in Canaan (<a href="/genesis/12-5.htm">Genesis 12:5-7</a>), Paul in Macedonia (<a href="/acts/16-10.htm">Acts 16:10-12</a>). Here, arrival sets the stage for a test: will they honor God&#8217;s covenant, or compromise?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Micah&#8217;s house</b><p>Micah&#8217;s home is already identified as a center of homemade religion (<a href="/judges/17-4.htm">Judges 17:4-13</a>). By stepping inside, the Danites confront a counterfeit priesthood, ephod, and teraphim masquerading as legitimate worship. <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/12-4.htm">Deuteronomy 12:4-5</a> forbid such images and private shrines, underscoring how far Israel has drifted. Their decision to seize Micah&#8217;s idols (<a href="/judges/18-18.htm">Judges 18:18-21</a>) shows the irony of stealing false gods to secure divine favor&#8212;a vivid illustration of <a href="/romans/1-22.htm">Romans 1:22-23</a>, exchanging the glory of the incorruptible God for man-made images.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/18-13.htm">Judges 18:13</a> records more than a change of scenery; it exposes a people in motion without moral compass. The Danites move decisively, but toward compromise. The hill country of Ephraim&#8212;once a place of covenant renewal&#8212;now hosts idolatry in Micah&#8217;s living room. The verse reminds us that every step and stop is under God&#8217;s gaze, calling us to walk in obedience, reject convenient syncretism, and uphold true worship grounded in His unchanging Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Unto the house of Micah.</span>--Probably the precincts of the new sanctuary gave their name to a sort of village--Beth-Micah.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/18-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And from there</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8033.htm">Strong's 8033: </a> </span><span class="str2">There, then, thither</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they traveled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#7687;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5674.htm">Strong's 5674: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pass over, through, or by, pass on</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the hill country</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(har-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2022.htm">Strong's 2022: </a> </span><span class="str2">Mountain, hill, hill country</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Ephraim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ep&#772;&#183;r&#257;&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_669.htm">Strong's 669: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ephraim -- a son of Joseph, also his descendants and their territory</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1430;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5704.htm">Strong's 5704: </a> </span><span class="str2">As far as, even to, up to, until, while</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Micah&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1499;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;&#183;&#7733;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4318.htm">Strong's 4318: </a> </span><span class="str2">Micah -- the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">house.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/judges/18-13.htm">Judges 18:13 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/judges/18-13.htm">Judges 18:13 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/judges/18-13.htm">Judges 18:13 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/judges/18-13.htm">Judges 18:13 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/judges/18-13.htm">Judges 18:13 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/judges/18-13.htm">Judges 18:13  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/judges/18-13.htm">Judges 18:13 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/judges/18-13.htm">Judges 18:13 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/judges/18-13.htm">Judges 18:13 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/judges/18-13.htm">Judges 18:13 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/judges/18-13.htm">OT History: Judges 18:13 They passed there to the hill country (Jd Judg.
