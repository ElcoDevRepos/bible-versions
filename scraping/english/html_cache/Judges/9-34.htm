The decision to move by night indicates a strategic approach, aiming to catch the city off guard. Night operations in ancient warfare were risky due to limited visibility, but they offered the element of surprise. This tactic reflects Abimelech's ruthless ambition and willingness to use deception, reminiscent of other biblical figures who acted under the cover of darkness, such as Judas Iscariot in the betrayal of Jesus (<a href="/john/13-30.htm">John 13:30</a>).<p><b>and lay in wait against Shechem</b><br>Shechem was a significant city in the central hill country of Canaan, with a rich history dating back to the time of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>). It was a city of refuge and a Levitical city, indicating its religious importance. Abimelech's choice to attack Shechem highlights the city's strategic and symbolic value. The act of laying in wait suggests a premeditated ambush, a common military tactic in ancient times, reflecting the treacherous nature of Abimelech's leadership. This mirrors the deceitful actions of other biblical characters, such as the ambush at Ai (<a href="/joshua/8-2.htm">Joshua 8:2</a>).<p><b>in four companies</b><br>Dividing his forces into four companies demonstrates Abimelech's tactical acumen, allowing for a coordinated and multifaceted attack. This division could symbolize completeness or totality, as the number four often represents in biblical numerology. The use of multiple companies would enable Abimelech to surround Shechem, cutting off escape routes and ensuring a comprehensive assault. This strategy is reminiscent of other biblical military campaigns, such as Gideon's division of his 300 men into three companies (<a href="/judges/7-16.htm">Judges 7:16</a>), showcasing a continuity of military tactics within the narrative of Judges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal), who sought to establish himself as king over Shechem and Israel.

His earlier murders of his seventy brothers (<a href="/judges/9-5.htm">Judges 9:5</a>) and his short-lived kingship (<a href="/judges/9-22.htm">Judges 9:22</a>) already signaled a path of violence that now drives this night raid.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently shows that leaders who disregard God&#8217;s covenant eventually reap judgment (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>; compare Saul&#8217;s downfall in <a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>), foreshadowing what will soon happen to Abimelech (<a href="/judges/9-53.htm">Judges 9:53-55</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all his troops</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and all his troops&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226;

<a href="/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10-19</a>).<p>&#8226; By gathering &#8220;all&#8221; of them, Abimelech commits everything to crushing Shechem, unlike Gideon who depended on the LORD with a reduced force (<a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>set out by night</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;set out by night&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226;

While godly leaders used darkness under divine direction, Abimelech acts on his own agenda, illustrating <a href="/proverbs/4-19.htm">Proverbs 4:19</a>, &#8220;The way of the wicked is like deep darkness.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Moving at night highlights stealth, secrecy, and a desire to catch Shechem unprepared&#8212;tactics that fit the deceptive spirit characterizing Abimelech&#8217;s reign (<a href="/judges/9-23.htm">Judges 9:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and lay in wait against Shechem</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and lay in wait against Shechem&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Shechem had earlier crowned Abimelech king (<a href="/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6</a>), yet now he turns on the very city that empowered him&#8212;an example of how sin betrays its own allies (Obadiah 7).<p>&#8226; Shechem was a covenant location where Joshua renewed Israel&#8217;s commitment to the LORD (<a href="/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1, 25</a>). Abimelech&#8217;s treachery in this sacred place demonstrates the depth of Israel&#8217;s spiritual decline during the judges&#8217; era (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Lying in ambush recalls the bandits Shechem had sponsored earlier against Abimelech&#8217;s supporters (<a href="/judges/9-25.htm">Judges 9:25</a>). God is allowing the city to taste its own medicine (<a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in four companies</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;in four companies.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Dividing the force shows military planning, similar to Gideon&#8217;s three companies (<a href="/judges/7-16.htm">Judges 7:16</a>) and Saul/Jonathan&#8217;s separation (<a href="/1_samuel/13-2.htm">1 Samuel 13:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Four groups can encircle the city from every side, cutting off escape&#8212;foreshadowing total judgment (compare <a href="/jeremiah/15-3.htm">Jeremiah 15:3</a>&#8217;s &#8220;four kinds of destroyers&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The structure also hints at counterfeit mimicry: Abimelech uses tactical wisdom that once served Israel well, yet without seeking God.
