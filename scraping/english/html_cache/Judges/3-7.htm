The "evil" refers to idolatry and disobedience to God's commandments. This cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance is central to the narrative of Judges. The phrase "in the sight of the LORD" emphasizes that their actions were not hidden from God, highlighting His omniscience and the moral accountability of the Israelites.<p><b>they forgot the LORD their God</b><br>Forgetting the LORD implies a deliberate neglect of their covenant relationship with God. This forgetfulness is not merely a lapse in memory but a willful disregard for God's laws and past acts of deliverance. It reflects a spiritual amnesia that leads to idolatry. The Israelites' forgetfulness contrasts with the repeated biblical exhortations to remember God's deeds and commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>, <a href="/psalms/78-11.htm">Psalm 78:11</a>).<p><b>and served the Baals and the Asherahs.</b><br>The Baals and Asherahs were Canaanite deities, representing fertility and nature. Baal was often depicted as a storm god, while Asherah was considered a mother goddess. Serving these gods involved rituals that were abhorrent to the LORD, including temple prostitution and possibly child sacrifice. This idolatry was a direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). The Israelites' adoption of Canaanite religious practices illustrates the danger of cultural assimilation and the influence of surrounding nations. This idolatry is a type of spiritual adultery, contrasting with the faithfulness of Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the law and resisted temptation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who repeatedly fall into cycles of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance throughout the Book of Judges.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is holy and just, and who desires faithfulness from His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/baals.htm">Baals</a></b><br>Canaanite deities associated with fertility and weather, often worshiped through idolatrous practices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/asherahs.htm">Asherahs</a></b><br>Canaanite goddesses, often represented by wooden poles or trees, associated with fertility and motherhood.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cycle_of_sin.htm">The Cycle of Sin</a></b><br>A recurring theme in Judges where Israel falls into sin, faces oppression, cries out to God, and is delivered by a judge.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_forgetfulness.htm">The Danger of Forgetfulness</a></b><br>Forgetting God leads to spiritual decline and idolatry.
