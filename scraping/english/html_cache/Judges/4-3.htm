It reflects the cyclical nature of Israel's relationship with God during this period: sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance. The act of crying out suggests a recognition of their need for divine intervention and a return to reliance on God. This is reminiscent of other instances in the Old Testament where the Israelites call upon God for help, such as in <a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-25</a> during their bondage in Egypt.<p><b>because Jabin had nine hundred chariots of iron</b><br>Jabin was the king of Canaan, and his possession of nine hundred chariots of iron signifies a formidable military advantage. Chariots were the cutting-edge military technology of the time, providing speed and power in battle. The mention of "iron" highlights the strength and durability of these chariots, making them a symbol of Jabin's oppressive power. This technological superiority would have been intimidating to the Israelites, who lacked such resources. The use of chariots is also seen in other biblical accounts, such as Pharaoh's army in <a href="/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>.<p><b>and he had harshly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years</b><br>The oppression by Jabin lasted for two decades, indicating a prolonged period of suffering and subjugation for the Israelites. This oppression is a consequence of Israel's disobedience and idolatry, as outlined earlier in Judges. The duration of twenty years emphasizes the severity and endurance of their plight, which ultimately leads them to seek God's deliverance. This period of oppression can be compared to other times of hardship in Israel's history, such as the Babylonian exile, where the people eventually turn back to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are in a cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance during the time of the Judges.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jabin.htm">Jabin</a></b><br>The king of Canaan who ruled in Hazor, oppressing the Israelites with his military might, symbolized by his nine hundred iron chariots.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/iron_chariots.htm">Iron Chariots</a></b><br>Represent the formidable military power of Jabin, highlighting the Israelites' helplessness and need for divine intervention.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, to whom the Israelites cry out for deliverance from their oppression.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/twenty_years_of_oppression.htm">Twenty Years of Oppression</a></b><br>A significant period during which the Israelites suffered under Jabin's harsh rule, leading them to seek God's help.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cycle_of_sin_and_deliverance.htm">The Cycle of Sin and Deliverance</a></b><br>The Israelites' repeated cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance serves as a warning and a lesson for believers today to remain faithful and avoid complacency in their spiritual walk.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_crying_out_to_god.htm">The Power of Crying Out to God</a></b><br>The Israelites' cry to the LORD demonstrates the importance of turning to God in times of trouble.

Each time Israel turns from God and suffers (<a href="/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18-19</a>; 3:9; 3:15; 6:6), He waits for their heartfelt plea before raising up deliverance.<p>- Crying out highlights relationship: God hears (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15-17</a>) and responds in covenant faithfulness (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-25</a>).<p>- The pattern reminds us that genuine repentance is the doorway to rescue (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because Jabin had nine hundred chariots of iron</b><p>- Iron chariots were the super-weapons of the age&#8212;fast, armored, and terrifying. Israel&#8217;s infantry felt helpless, much like they did against iron chariots at earlier encounters (<a href="/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16-18</a>).<p>- Scripture often notes overwhelming odds to magnify God&#8217;s eventual victory (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45-47</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-12.htm">2 Chronicles 20:12</a>).<p>- The specific number&#8212;nine hundred&#8212;underscores real, historical might, not exaggeration. When God later overcomes these chariots through Deborah and Barak (<a href="/judges/4-14.htm">Judges 4:14-16</a>), His sovereignty over human technology is unmistakable (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he had harshly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years</b><p>- &#8220;Harshly&#8221; (cf. <a href="/exodus/1-13.htm">Exodus 1:13-14</a>; <a href="/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1</a>) conveys relentless cruelty&#8212;forced labor, tribute, fear.<p>- Twenty years is long enough to break national morale but also long enough for God to cultivate readiness for change (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>).<p>- Extended oppression fulfills the warnings of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-47.htm">Deuteronomy 28:47-48</a> yet also sets the stage for deliverance, demonstrating that judgment and mercy operate together in God&#8217;s plan (<a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/4-3.htm">Judges 4:3</a> shows Israel at a low point: crippled by advanced enemy weaponry and two decades of severe domination.
