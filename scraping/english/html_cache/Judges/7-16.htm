This division is significant as it reflects a military tactic aimed at creating confusion and surprise among the Midianite army. The number three often symbolizes completeness or divine perfection in the Bible, seen in the Trinity and other scriptural instances. This division also highlights the theme of God using small numbers to achieve great victories, emphasizing reliance on divine power rather than human strength.<p><b>and gave each man a ram&#8217;s horn in one hand</b><br>The ram's horn, or shofar, is a significant instrument in Israelite culture, used for religious ceremonies, signaling, and warfare. Its use here is symbolic of divine intervention and the proclamation of God's presence. The shofar is also associated with the giving of the Law at Sinai and the fall of Jericho, linking Gideon's battle to God's past deliverances. The sound of the shofar would have been both a psychological weapon and a spiritual declaration, instilling fear in the enemy and confidence in the Israelites.<p><b>and a large jar in the other, containing a torch</b><br>The large jar, likely made of clay, served to conceal the torch's light until the right moment. This imagery can be seen as a metaphor for the hidden power of God, revealed at the appointed time. The breaking of the jars to reveal the torches parallels the breaking of barriers to reveal divine truth and light, reminiscent of the light of Christ breaking into the darkness of the world. The use of torches also connects to the theme of light overcoming darkness, a recurring biblical motif. This tactic would have created the illusion of a larger force, contributing to the panic and confusion among the Midianites.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>The judge of Israel chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the Midianites.

Strategically, it surrounds the Midianite camp (compare <a href="/1_samuel/11-11.htm">1 Samuel 11:11</a>, where Saul&#8217;s forces attack &#8220;in three companies,&#8221; and <a href="/2_kings/7-16.htm">2 Kings 7:16</a>, where a small number routs a vast army).<p>&#8226; The move underscores the principle that deliverance often comes through weakness (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>) and that God&#8217;s plans confound human calculations (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Faith-filled obedience replaces numerical confidence, echoing earlier judges like Ehud and Shamgar who acted with minimal resources yet maximum trust (<a href="/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and gave each man a ram&#8217;s horn in one hand</b><p>&#8226; The trumpet (ram&#8217;s horn) was a signaling instrument for worship and warfare (<a href="/numbers/10-9.htm">Numbers 10:9-10</a>).

The battle belongs entirely to the Lord (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15-22</a>, where singers lead the army).<p>&#8226; Sounding the horn proclaims victory in advance, paralleling <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a> where a trumpet heralds Christ&#8217;s ultimate triumph.<p>&#8226; The scene teaches that praise and proclamation can become powerful spiritual weapons (<a href="/psalms/149-6.htm">Psalm 149:6-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and a large jar in the other, containing a torch</b><p>&#8226; The torch provides light, but it is hidden until the jar is smashed.

The verse invites us to trust God&#8217;s unconventional methods, proclaim His greatness, and let His light blaze through our fragile lives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Into three companies.</span>--See <a href="/judges/9-43.htm" title="And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.">Judges 9:43</a>.
