This reflects the patriarchal structure of society at the time. The woman, later identified as Manoah's wife, demonstrates obedience and respect for her husband by sharing the encounter. This action also sets the stage for the involvement of Manoah in the divine plan, highlighting the importance of family unity in God's purposes.<p><b>A man of God came to me</b><br>The term "man of God" is often used in the Old Testament to describe prophets or individuals who are messengers of God, such as Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33:1</a>) and Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/17-18.htm">1 Kings 17:18</a>). This indicates that the visitor was perceived as a holy and authoritative figure. The phrase suggests a divine encounter, preparing the reader for the revelation of God's plan for Samson's birth and mission.<p><b>His appearance was like the angel of God, exceedingly awesome</b><br>The description of the visitor's appearance as "like the angel of God" suggests a theophany, a visible manifestation of God to humans. The term "exceedingly awesome" conveys a sense of overwhelming majesty and fear, often associated with divine encounters (e.g., <a href="/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5-6</a>). This aligns with other biblical instances where angels appear in radiant and awe-inspiring forms, such as the angel at Jesus' tomb (<a href="/matthew/28-3.htm">Matthew 28:3</a>).<p><b>I did not ask him where he came from</b><br>The woman's omission of questioning the visitor's origin reflects a common biblical theme where divine messengers are not interrogated about their heavenly origins, emphasizing the mystery and authority of God's messengers. This also parallels other biblical narratives where individuals are struck by awe and do not question the divine presence, such as Gideon's encounter with the angel of the Lord (<a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11-24</a>).<p><b>and he did not tell me his name</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, knowing someone's name was often associated with having power or authority over them. The angel's withholding of his name signifies the divine authority and mystery of the encounter. This is reminiscent of Jacob's wrestling with the angel, where the angel does not reveal his name (<a href="/genesis/32-29.htm">Genesis 32:29</a>). It underscores the idea that God's ways and messengers are beyond human comprehension and control.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman (Manoah's Wife)</a></b><br>She is the wife of Manoah and the mother of Samson.

Like Eve was created as a helper for Adam, here Manoah&#8217;s wife seeks unity with her husband by sharing what God revealed (cf. <a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-11.htm">Proverbs 31:11</a>).<p>- Spiritual experiences are meant to be processed in the covenant of marriage so that both partners can obey God together (cf. <a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>).<p>- Her immediate action contrasts with Eve&#8217;s solitary conversation with the serpent; instead of hiding the event, she brings it into the light (cf. <a href="/john/3-21.htm">John 3:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A man of God came to me</b><p>- &#8220;Man of God&#8221; ordinarily refers to prophets such as Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-1.htm">Deuteronomy 33:1</a>) or Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/9-6.htm">1 Samuel 9:6</a>). She recognizes prophetic authority even before realizing the visitor&#8217;s full identity.<p>- God often starts His deliverance through a &#8220;word&#8221; before the &#8220;deed,&#8221; signaling that revelation precedes salvation (cf. <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p>- Personal encounters with God&#8217;s messenger remind us that He meets people where they are&#8212;Manoah&#8217;s wife, though barren, is not overlooked (cf. <a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26&#8211;28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His appearance was like the angel of God, exceedingly awesome</b><p>- The description matches earlier Christophanies&#8212;manifestations of the pre-incarnate Christ&#8212;such as the &#8220;Angel of the LORD&#8221; in <a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11&#8211;22</a> and <a href="/genesis/22-11.htm">Genesis 22:11&#8211;15</a>.<p>- &#8220;Exceedingly awesome&#8221; aligns with reactions to divine glory: Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>) and John on Patmos (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>). Fear and awe confirm genuine heavenly visitation.<p>- God&#8217;s holiness produces reverence, underscoring that grace never diminishes His majesty (cf. <a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I did not ask him where he came from</b><p>- Her restraint shows reverence; she doesn&#8217;t probe into mysteries God hasn&#8217;t chosen to reveal (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>).<p>- Contrast with Gideon, who asked for signs (<a href="/judges/6-17.htm">Judges 6:17</a>). Faith expresses itself differently according to individual heart posture, yet God patiently guides each servant.<p>- Sometimes obedience begins without full understanding; we walk by faith, not by sight (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He did not tell me his name</b><p>- In Scripture, withholding a name signals divine transcendence (cf. <a href="/genesis/32-29.htm">Genesis 32:29</a>; <a href="/judges/13-18.htm">Judges 13:18</a>).<p>- Names convey authority&#8212;by not disclosing, the Angel asserts superiority while inviting trust.<p>- Ultimately, the name above every name is revealed in Jesus (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9&#8211;11</a>), but here the mystery points forward to that fuller revelation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/13-6.htm">Judges 13:6</a> records Manoah&#8217;s wife faithfully reporting her encounter with the Angel of the LORD. Her immediate testimony, recognition of prophetic authority, awe before divine holiness, humble restraint, and acceptance of mystery model a heart ready for God&#8217;s redemptive work. The verse teaches that genuine encounters with God inspire reverent communication, unity in marriage, and obedient faith even when many details remain unrevealed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">A man of God.</span>--Angels always appeared in human form, and Manoah's wife, though awe-struck by the majesty of the angel's appearance, did not know him to be other than a prophet.
