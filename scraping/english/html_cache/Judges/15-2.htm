The father's decision is based on his interpretation of Samson's actions, which he perceives as rejection. This reflects the patriarchal society where fathers had significant control over their daughters' marriages. The phrase also highlights the misunderstanding and lack of communication between Samson and his father-in-law, which is a recurring theme in Samson's narrative.<p><b>&#8220;so I gave her to one of the men who accompanied you.&#8221;</b><br>This action underscores the lack of agency women had in ancient times, as the daughter is given to another man without her consent. It also reflects the customs of the time, where a woman&#8217;s marital status could be changed by her father&#8217;s decision. The men who accompanied Samson were likely Philistines, indicating the complex relationships between the Israelites and Philistines during this period. This act of giving Samson's wife to another man sets the stage for further conflict between Samson and the Philistines.<p><b>&#8220;Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she?&#8221;</b><br>The father attempts to placate Samson by offering another daughter, which reflects the practice of polygamy and the view of women as commodities. The mention of beauty as a bargaining tool highlights the superficial values placed on women in that era. This also echoes the biblical theme of sibling rivalry and preference, seen in stories like Leah and Rachel (Genesis 29), where beauty and favor play significant roles in marital arrangements.<p><b>&#8220;Please take her instead.&#8221;</b><br>The father's plea indicates desperation and a desire to maintain peace with Samson, who is known for his strength and volatile nature. This offer can be seen as an attempt to rectify the situation and avoid Samson's wrath. It also reflects the cultural practice of substitution in marriage arrangements, where a younger sibling could replace an elder in certain circumstances. This plea foreshadows the continued tension and conflict in Samson's life, as his personal relationships often lead to broader national consequences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his extraordinary strength, which was a gift from God.
