His vow to the LORD reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of making vows to deities in exchange for divine favor. Vows were serious commitments, often involving significant personal sacrifice. In the context of Israel, vows to the LORD were binding and required fulfillment (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>). Jephthah's vow indicates his reliance on divine intervention for victory, highlighting the importance of faith and commitment in Israel's relationship with God.<p><b>If indeed You will deliver the Ammonites into my hand:</b><br>The Ammonites were a neighboring people often in conflict with Israel. Their territory was east of the Jordan River, in present-day Jordan. The conflict with the Ammonites in <a href="/judges/11.htm">Judges 11</a> arose from territorial disputes, as the Ammonites claimed land that Israel had settled after the Exodus. Jephthah's request for deliverance underscores the recurring theme of Israel's dependence on God for military success. This phrase also echoes the broader biblical narrative of God delivering His people from their enemies, as seen in the stories of Moses, Joshua, and David. The deliverance sought by Jephthah is a reminder of God's sovereignty and the belief that victory in battle is ultimately granted by Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, known for his leadership and military prowess.

This verse and the following go back to relate something which preceded his passing over to the children of Ammon, viz., his rash and unhappy vow. This is related, as so many things in Scripture are, without note or comment, and the reader must pass his own sentence upon the deed. That sentence can only be one of unreserved con- detonation on the part of any one acquainted with the spirit and letter of the word of God. Many attempts have been made to show that Jephthah only contemplated the offering of an animal in sacrifice; but the natural and indeed necessary interpretation of the words shows that he had a human victim in mind. He could not expect any but a human being to come forth from the doors of his house, nor could any but a human being come forth "to meet him" - a common phrase always spoken of men (<a href="/genesis/14-17.htm">Genesis 14:17</a>; <a href="/genesis/24-65.htm">Genesis 24:65</a>; <a href="/exodus/4-14.htm">Exodus 4:14</a>; <a href="/exodus/18-7.htm">Exodus 18:7</a>; <a href="/numbers/20-20.htm">Numbers 20:20</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/25-34.htm">1 Samuel 25:34</a>, etc., and below in ver. 34). Obviously, in the greatness of his danger and the extreme hazard of his undertaking (<a href="/judges/12-3.htm">Judges 12:3</a>), he thought to propitiate God's favour by a terrible and extraordinary vow. But if we ask how Jephthah came to have such erroneous notions of the character of God, the answer is not far to seek. Jephthah was "the son of a strange woman," probably, as we have seen, a Syrian (<a href="/judges/11-1.htm">Judges 11:1-11</a>, note), and had passed many years of his life as an exile in Syria. Now it is well known that human sacrifices were frequently practised in Syria, as they were also by the Ammonites, who made their children pass through the fire to Moloch, and it cannot surprise us that a man brought up as Jephthah was, and leading the life of a freebooter at the head of a band of Syrian outlaws, should have the common Syrian notion of the efficacy of human sacrifices in great emergencies. His language, indeed, about Jehovah and Chemosh in ver. 24 savoured of semi-heathenism. Nor is it any valid objection that we are told in ver. 29 that "the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah." The phrase does not mean that thenceforth he was altogether under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, so that all that he did was inspired by the Spirit of truth and wisdom, but that the Spirit of the Lord inspired him with extraordinary strength and power for the great task of leading Israel to battle against the Ammonites. <span class="cmt_word">And I will offer</span>. The rendering suggested by some, or I will offer, meaning, if the first. comer is a human being he shall be the Lord's, or if it is an animal I will offer it as a burnt offering, is wholly inadmissible. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/11-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Jephthah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1445;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(yip&#772;&#183;t&#257;&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3316.htm">Strong's 3316: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jephthah -- 'He opens', a Gileadite, also a city of Judah</span><br /><br /><span class="word">made</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yid&#183;dar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
