Their mention here highlights the ongoing conflict between Israel and Midian, which began earlier in the Book of Judges. The Midianites were nomadic and often raided Israel, leading to significant hardship for the Israelites.<p><b>&#8220;Get up and kill us yourself,</b><br>This statement reflects the ancient Near Eastern code of honor and warrior ethos. It was considered more honorable to be killed by a warrior of equal or greater status than by a subordinate. By challenging Gideon to kill them himself, Zebah and Zalmunna are appealing to this cultural norm.<p><b>for as the man is, so is his strength.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the belief that a person's strength and valor are reflective of their character and status. It implies that Gideon's strength as a leader and warrior should be demonstrated through his personal action in executing them, rather than delegating the task.<p><b>So Gideon got up and killed Zebah and Zalmunna,</b><br>Gideon's action here fulfills the role of a judge in Israel, delivering justice and demonstrating leadership. This act also serves as a culmination of his military campaign against the Midianites, which was divinely ordained. Gideon's obedience to God's call is a recurring theme in his narrative.<p><b>and he took the crescent ornaments from the necks of their camels.</b><br>The crescent ornaments were likely symbols of royalty or divinity, possibly linked to the worship of the moon god, which was common in the region. By taking these ornaments, Gideon not only claims victory but also symbolically strips the Midianite kings of their power and divine association. This act can be seen as a rejection of idolatry and a reaffirmation of the sovereignty of the God of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.
