The subjugation of Moab is a direct result of God's deliverance through Ehud, the judge He raised up. Historically, Moab was located east of the Dead Sea, and its subjugation signifies a reversal of fortunes for Israel, who had been under Moabite control for eighteen years. The phrase "under the hand of Israel" indicates a complete defeat and domination, suggesting that Israel had regained control and authority over Moab. This victory is a testament to God's faithfulness in delivering His people when they repent and cry out to Him, as seen throughout the cyclical pattern in the Book of Judges.<p><b>and the land had rest for eighty years</b><br>The "rest" mentioned here refers to a period of peace and stability following the turmoil of oppression. This rest is a divine blessing, a time when Israel could live without the threat of foreign domination. The duration of eighty years is significant, as it represents one of the longest periods of peace recorded in the Book of Judges. This extended period of rest underscores the effectiveness of Ehud's leadership and the completeness of the victory over Moab. It also highlights the cyclical nature of Israel's history during the time of the judges, where periods of peace follow deliverance, only to be disrupted by subsequent disobedience. Theologically, this rest can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate rest promised in Christ, who offers eternal peace and deliverance from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A nation descended from Lot, often in conflict with Israel.

Josephus (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 5, ? 1) seems to have read "eight years."<p>As to the moral aspect of the assassination committed by Ehud, it is only necessary to say that while his courage, and capacity, and readiness to sacrifice himself, if need be, for the deliverance of his country were thoroughly noble, the act by which he achieved his end was unjustifiable. To quote his example in defence of the principle of assassination is a gross abuse of Scripture. Those who defend the murder do so by assuming that the Divine call to Ehud to deliver his people sanctioned and possibly even suggested the <span class= "ital">means </span>by which it was accomplished. But such methods of inferential exegesis undermine the very bases of morals. It is not in the least surprising that, when adopted, they are liable to the grossest abuse, and made to cover the most horrible crimes. Thus, when Jacques Clement asked whether a priest might kill a tyrant, he was told that "<span class= "ital">it was not a mortal sin, but only an irregularity</span>"; and when Pope Paul V. heard of the murder of Henry IV. by Ravaillac, he said, "<span class= "ital">The God of nations did this, because he was given over to a reprobate mind." </span>If it has been always true that<p>"The devil can quote Scripture for his purpose,"<p>he has done so not rarely by the lips of those who have professed to teach it.
