This vow is detailed in <a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a> and signifies a life set apart for divine purposes. The vine often symbolizes abundance and blessing in Scripture (e.g., <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>), but here, abstaining from it represents a dedication to holiness and separation from worldly pleasures.<p><b>nor drink any wine or strong drink</b><br>Wine and strong drink were common in ancient Israelite culture, used in both daily life and religious ceremonies. However, for a Nazirite, abstaining from these beverages was a sign of self-discipline and devotion. This restriction highlights the importance of sobriety and clarity of mind in fulfilling God's purposes. <a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a> warns of the dangers of wine, emphasizing the need for wisdom and self-control.<p><b>nor eat anything unclean</b><br>The dietary laws in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a> outline what is considered clean and unclean for the Israelites. These laws were given to maintain ritual purity and to set the Israelites apart from other nations. For the mother of Samson, adhering to these laws was crucial, as her son was to be consecrated to God from the womb. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and the call to be distinct as God's people (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>).<p><b>She must do everything I have commanded her.</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands. In the context of <a href="/judges/13.htm">Judges 13</a>, the angel of the Lord delivers these instructions, emphasizing divine authority. Obedience is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, seen in the blessings promised for adherence to God's law (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>) and the consequences of disobedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>).

This mirrors the Nazirite vow in which a person was separated to God by abstaining from &#8220;wine, vinegar made from wine, and anything made from grapes&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/6-2.htm">Numbers 6:2-4</a>).<p>&#8226; By extending this rule to Samson&#8217;s mother before his birth, God stresses that the child&#8217;s consecration begins in the womb (cf. <a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Total avoidance of the vine symbolizes complete devotion; even permissible pleasures are laid aside so nothing competes with God&#8217;s calling (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>nor drink any wine or strong drink</b><p>Wine was common at meals, and &#8220;strong drink&#8221; referred to fermented beverages beyond grape wine.

God often sets apart His servants by asking them to surrender culturally accepted freedoms for a higher purpose (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>nor eat anything unclean</b><p>Beyond the Nazirite specifics, Manoah&#8217;s wife must observe the broader food laws spelled out in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>.<p>&#8226; Clean and unclean distinctions reminded Israel of God&#8217;s holiness and their unique identity (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; For Samson, whose mission would confront Philistine oppression, a lifestyle of purity underscored that his strength came from separation unto God, not from personal talent (<a href="/judges/16-17.htm">Judges 16:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The mother&#8217;s diet directly affected the child she carried, illustrating how parental choices shape future generations (<a href="/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She must do everything I have commanded her</b><p>The closing line gathers all instructions into one call to complete obedience.<p>&#8226; Selective compliance is never acceptable; &#8220;be careful to do what the LORD has commanded&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-17.htm">Deuteronomy 6:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience proves love (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>) and invites blessing (<a href="/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Samson&#8217;s later failures contrast sharply with the thorough obedience required at his beginning, warning us that a holy start needs continual faithfulness (<a href="/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/13-14.htm">Judges 13:14</a> lays out a prenatal Nazirite regimen for Samson&#8217;s mother, emphasizing separation from the fruit of the vine, abstinence from alcohol, avoidance of unclean foods, and wholehearted obedience.
