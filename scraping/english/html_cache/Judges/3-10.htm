The Spirit of the LORD coming upon someone signifies God's direct intervention and blessing, enabling them to accomplish tasks beyond human capability. This empowerment is seen in other judges like Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>) and Samson (<a href="/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>). It foreshadows the New Testament outpouring of the Holy Spirit on believers (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>).<p><b>and he became Israel&#8217;s judge</b><br>Othniel, the first judge mentioned in the Book of Judges, is raised by God to lead and deliver Israel. The role of a judge in this context is not merely judicial but also military and spiritual leadership. Judges were seen as deliverers and saviors, prefiguring the ultimate deliverer, Jesus Christ, who judges and saves His people (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>).<p><b>and went out to war</b><br>This phrase highlights the military aspect of Othniel's judgeship. The judges often led Israel in battle against oppressors. The act of going to war under divine guidance underscores the theme of God fighting for Israel, as seen in <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>. It also reflects the spiritual warfare believers face, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>.<p><b>And the LORD delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram into the hand of Othniel</b><br>The deliverance of Cushan-rishathaim, whose name means "double wickedness," signifies God's judgment against oppressors and His faithfulness to Israel. Aram, often associated with regions in modern-day Syria, was a significant threat. This victory demonstrates God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to use chosen leaders to fulfill His purposes, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/45.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a> with Cyrus.<p><b>who prevailed against him</b><br>Othniel's victory is attributed to divine intervention rather than human strength, emphasizing the biblical principle that success comes from the LORD (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>). This victory serves as a reminder of God's promise to deliver His people when they repent and turn to Him, a theme echoed throughout the Old Testament and fulfilled in Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit_of_the_lord.htm">The Spirit of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the divine presence and empowerment given by God to individuals for specific tasks or roles.
