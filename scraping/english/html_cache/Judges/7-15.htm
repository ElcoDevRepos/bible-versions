Dreams in the ancient Near East were often considered divine messages, and their interpretations were taken seriously. This moment is pivotal as it reassures Gideon of God's promise. Similar to Joseph and Daniel, who also interpreted dreams, this event underscores God's sovereignty and His ability to communicate His will through dreams.<p><b>he bowed in worship</b><br>Gideon's immediate response is worship, reflecting his recognition of God's power and faithfulness. Worship in the Old Testament often involved physical gestures such as bowing, which demonstrated reverence and submission to God. This act signifies Gideon's acknowledgment of God's presence and assurance, aligning with the biblical theme that true faith leads to worship.<p><b>He returned to the camp of Israel</b><br>Gideon's return to the Israelite camp signifies a transition from doubt to action. The camp of Israel, located near the Hill of Moreh in the Jezreel Valley, was strategically positioned for the upcoming battle. This geographical setting is significant as it was a fertile area often contested by various groups, including the Midianites, who were nomadic invaders.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Get up, for the LORD has delivered the camp of Midian into your hand.&#8221;</b><br>Gideon's command to "Get up" is a call to action, reflecting his newfound confidence in God's promise. The phrase "the LORD has delivered" indicates the certainty of victory, emphasizing God's role as the deliverer. This assurance is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God promises victory, such as in the battles led by Joshua. The deliverance of Midian into Israel's hand is a fulfillment of God's covenant promises, showcasing His faithfulness and power to save His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.
