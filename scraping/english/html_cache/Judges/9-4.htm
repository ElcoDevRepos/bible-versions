In biblical times, silver was a common medium of exchange, and the amount here suggests a substantial investment in Abimelech's cause. This act of giving silver highlights the corrupting influence of wealth and foreshadows the moral decay that follows. The number seventy may also symbolize completeness or totality, as seen in other biblical contexts, such as the seventy nations in <a href="/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>.<p><b>from the temple of Baal-berith</b><br>Baal-berith, meaning "Lord of the Covenant," was a Canaanite deity worshiped in Shechem. The use of funds from this temple underscores the syncretism and idolatry prevalent in Israel during the time of the Judges. This act of taking money from a pagan temple for political purposes reflects the spiritual decline and the blending of Canaanite practices with Israelite worship, which was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>).<p><b>with which Abimelech hired some worthless and reckless men</b><br>Abimelech's hiring of "worthless and reckless men" indicates his willingness to use unscrupulous means to achieve his ambitions. The term "worthless" often refers to individuals lacking moral integrity, while "reckless" suggests a propensity for violence and disorder. This choice of followers reveals Abimelech's character and foreshadows the chaos and bloodshed that will ensue. It also serves as a warning against aligning with those who lack godly principles.<p><b>to follow him</b><br>The phrase "to follow him" implies allegiance and support for Abimelech's claim to leadership. This following was not based on legitimate authority or divine appointment but rather on manipulation and force. It contrasts with the biblical ideal of leadership, which is characterized by service, humility, and obedience to God. Abimelech's actions can be seen as a perversion of the covenantal leadership model exemplified by figures like Moses and Joshua.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal) and a concubine from Shechem.

The treasures belonging to the temple of Apollo at Delphi were very great, and excited the cupidity of Xerxes, who sent an army to plunder the temple, but was foiled in the attempt. The Phocians are related to have seized 10,000 talents from the treasury of Delphi, nearly two and a half millions sterling. The temple of Diana at Ephesus had considerable treasures in money, as well as other valuable articles.
