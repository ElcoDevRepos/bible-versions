Samson, a judge of Israel, reveals his innermost secret to Delilah, a Philistine woman. This act of disclosure is significant as it shows Samson's emotional attachment and perhaps his overconfidence in his own invincibility. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect. This moment foreshadows betrayal, reminiscent of other biblical figures who faced consequences after revealing their hearts, such as Joseph with his brothers.<p><b>My hair has never been cut:</b><br>Samson's uncut hair is a symbol of his Nazirite vow, a special commitment to God that included abstaining from wine, avoiding contact with the dead, and not cutting one's hair (<a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>). The uncut hair is a physical manifestation of his dedication and separation unto God. This vow was a source of his supernatural strength, setting him apart for God's purposes. The cutting of hair in ancient cultures often symbolized a loss of identity or status, which is crucial in understanding the gravity of Samson's revelation.<p><b>because I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother&#8217;s womb:</b><br>Samson's Nazirite vow was unique as it was divinely appointed before his birth, as announced by the angel to his mother (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>). This lifelong dedication underscores the divine purpose and calling on Samson's life. The concept of being set apart from the womb is echoed in the lives of other biblical figures like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>) and John the Baptist (<a href="/luke/1-15.htm">Luke 1:15</a>), indicating a special mission ordained by God.<p><b>If I am shaved, my strength will leave me:</b><br>Samson's strength is directly linked to his Nazirite vow, symbolized by his uncut hair. The act of shaving would signify a breach of this vow, leading to the loss of divine empowerment. This connection between physical actions and spiritual consequences is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting the importance of obedience and faithfulness to God's commands. The conditional "if" suggests that Samson is aware of the consequences but perhaps underestimates the seriousness of his covenant with God.<p><b>and I will become as weak as any other man:</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the source of Samson's strength as divine rather than inherent. Without God's empowerment, Samson would be no different from any other person. This serves as a reminder of human dependency on God for strength and ability. The notion of becoming "as weak as any other man" also foreshadows the humbling of Samson, a theme prevalent in the lives of biblical leaders who rely on their own strength rather than God's, such as King Saul. It points to the ultimate need for reliance on God, a principle that finds its fulfillment in the New Testament through the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who exemplified perfect dependence on the Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God as part of his Nazirite vow.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/delilah.htm">Delilah</a></b><br>A woman from the Valley of Sorek who was used by the Philistines to discover the secret of Samson's strength.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazirite_vow.htm">Nazirite Vow</a></b><br>A special vow of dedication to God, which included abstaining from cutting one's hair, consuming wine, and avoiding contact with dead bodies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>The enemies of Israel during the time of the judges, who sought to subdue Samson and the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/valley_of_sorek.htm">Valley of Sorek</a></b><br>The location where Delilah lived and where Samson frequently visited, leading to his eventual downfall.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Samson's strength was tied to his obedience to the Nazirite vow.
