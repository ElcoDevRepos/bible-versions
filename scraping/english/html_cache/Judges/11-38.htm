Jephthah, a judge of Israel, had made a vow to the Lord that if he were victorious over the Ammonites, he would offer as a burnt offering whatever came out of his house to greet him. His daughter was the first to come out, leading to this tragic situation. The word "Go" indicates Jephthah's reluctant consent to her request, showing his adherence to the vow despite the personal cost. This highlights the seriousness with which vows were taken in ancient Israel, as seen in <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>, which emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's promises to God.<p><b>And he sent her away for two months.</b><br>Jephthah allows his daughter time to prepare for her fate, demonstrating a measure of compassion within the constraints of his vow. The two-month period signifies a time of reflection and mourning, which was customary in ancient cultures when facing impending loss. This time frame also underscores the gravity of the situation, as it was a period for both father and daughter to come to terms with the vow's consequences.<p><b>So she left with her friends</b><br>The mention of her friends accompanying her highlights the communal aspect of mourning and support in ancient Israelite society. It reflects the importance of community and relationships, especially in times of distress. This companionship provided emotional support and solidarity, which is a recurring theme in the Bible, as seen in the story of Ruth and Naomi (<a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16-17</a>).<p><b>and mourned her virginity</b><br>The focus on mourning her virginity rather than her impending death suggests the cultural significance of marriage and childbearing in ancient Israel. Virginity was highly valued, and the inability to marry and bear children was seen as a significant loss. This reflects the societal expectations and roles of women during that time, where lineage and inheritance were crucial. The emphasis on virginity also connects to the broader biblical theme of purity and dedication to God.<p><b>upon the mountains.</b><br>Mountains in biblical literature often symbolize places of encounter with God, reflection, and revelation. The choice of the mountains as the setting for her mourning may indicate a desire for solitude and closeness to God during this time of personal trial. Mountains are frequently depicted as places of significant spiritual events, such as Moses receiving the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai (Exodus 19) and Jesus' transfiguration on a high mountain (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-2</a>). This setting underscores the solemnity and gravity of her situation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A judge of Israel who made a vow to the Lord, which led to the events described in this passage.

Her line will end; her father&#8217;s legacy will not continue through her.<p>- The mountains provide privacy and symbolic elevation toward God, recalling Moses on Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-20.htm">Exodus 19:20</a>) and Jesus praying alone (<a href="/luke/6-12.htm">Luke 6:12</a>).<p>- Her mourning validates that following the LORD can involve real emotional pain (<a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>), yet her willingness shows faith greater than her grief (<a href="/hebrews/11-32.htm">Hebrews 11:32-34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/11-38.htm">Judges 11:38</a> portrays a young woman who, with her father&#8217;s blessing and her friends&#8217; support, takes two months to grieve the lifelong loss required by her father&#8217;s vow.
