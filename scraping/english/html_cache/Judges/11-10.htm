Gilead was a region known for its balm, a valuable commodity in ancient times. The elders approached Jephthah, a mighty warrior, to lead them against the Ammonites. This reflects the recurring theme in Judges of God raising unlikely leaders to deliver Israel. Jephthah, despite being an outcast due to his birth, was chosen, illustrating God's use of the marginalized to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>The LORD is our witness</b><br>Invoking the LORD as a witness was a solemn act, emphasizing the seriousness of their commitment. In ancient Israel, oaths and covenants were often made before God, who was seen as the ultimate judge and enforcer of promises. This reflects the cultural and religious practice of swearing by God's name to ensure truthfulness and accountability, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/genesis/31-50.htm">Genesis 31:50</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/12-5.htm">1 Samuel 12:5</a>.<p><b>if we do not do as you say</b><br>The elders promised to fulfill Jephthah's conditions for leadership, highlighting the importance of integrity and faithfulness in agreements.

Scripture is presenting one continuous narrative, showing how God orchestrates events (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Elders&#8221; points to recognized civic and spiritual leaders (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-12.htm">Deuteronomy 19:12</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/8-4.htm">1 Samuel 8:4</a>).
