His name, meaning "loathing" or "abhorrence," may foreshadow his role in the story. The mention of his brothers suggests a familial alliance, which was a common practice in ancient times to strengthen one's position. This familial support could indicate a potential threat to Abimelech's rule, as family units often acted as political factions. The presence of Gaal and his brothers in Shechem introduces a new dynamic, as they are outsiders entering a city with its own complex history and political tensions.<p><b>and crossed into Shechem</b><br>Shechem holds a prominent place in biblical history. It was a city of refuge and a significant location for covenant renewals, such as the one led by Joshua (Joshua 24). The city's strategic location in the hill country of Ephraim made it a central hub for trade and politics. Archaeological evidence suggests that Shechem was a fortified city during this period, which would have made it an attractive target for political maneuvering. Gaal's crossing into Shechem signifies a potential shift in power dynamics, as the city was already under the influence of Abimelech, who had familial ties to the region through his mother.<p><b>and the leaders of Shechem put their confidence in him</b><br>The leaders of Shechem, or "lords of Shechem," were likely the city's ruling elite, possibly including tribal elders and influential families. Their decision to place confidence in Gaal indicates dissatisfaction with Abimelech's rule. This shift in allegiance could be attributed to Abimelech's violent rise to power, which included the massacre of his seventy brothers (<a href="/judges/9-5.htm">Judges 9:5</a>). The leaders' support of Gaal suggests a desire for change and possibly a return to more traditional tribal leadership. This act of confidence can be seen as a political gamble, as aligning with Gaal could either restore stability or lead to further conflict. The leaders' decision reflects the broader theme of the cyclical nature of Israel's leadership struggles during the time of the Judges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gaal_son_of_ebed.htm">Gaal son of Ebed</a></b><br>A newcomer to Shechem who, along with his brothers, gains the trust of the city's leaders.

Three years of simmering resentment in Shechem have set the stage for the Lord&#8217;s judgment on Abimelech&#8217;s violent rise (cf. <a href="/judges/9-56.htm">Judges 9:56-57</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). The word &#8220;meanwhile&#8221; signals that God&#8217;s providence is always at work behind the scenes, orchestrating events&#8212;even rebels, conspiracies, and civic unrest&#8212;to accomplish His righteous purposes (<a href="/proverbs/16-4.htm">Proverbs 16:4</a>; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Gaal son of Ebed came with his brothers</b><p>&#8226; Gaal arrives as an outsider, yet he brings a ready-made support base&#8212;his brothers&#8212;hinting at clan influence and muscle (<a href="/judges/9-3.htm">Judges 9:3</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-10.htm">2 Samuel 15:10</a>).<p>&#8226; His name means &#8220;loathing&#8221; or &#8220;abhorred,&#8221; foreshadowing the chaos he will breed. In Scripture, such personal details often preview the role a character will play (<a href="/1_samuel/25-25.htm">1 Samuel 25:25</a>).<p>&#8226; By coming &#8220;with his brothers,&#8221; Gaal mirrors Abimelech&#8217;s earlier tactic of gathering relatives to seize power (<a href="/judges/9-1.htm">Judges 9:1-2</a>). The pattern repeats: a charismatic strongman appeals to family loyalty to stir up political revolt (<a href="/james/3-16.htm">James 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; This repetition underlines the cycle of sin in Judges: Israel keeps replacing one self-styled savior with another, instead of turning back to the Lord (<a href="/judges/2-19.htm">Judges 2:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and crossed into Shechem</b><p>&#8226; Shechem, a covenant city where Israel once renewed faithfulness to God (<a href="/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>; 24:25-27), now hosts treachery&#8212;a stark reminder of how far the people have drifted (<a href="/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Crossed into&#8221; suggests deliberate entry, not a casual visit. Gaal positions himself strategically in a place already disillusioned with Abimelech&#8217;s rule (<a href="/judges/9-23.htm">Judges 9:23-25</a>).<p>&#8226; The move fulfills the divine warning that disobedience would bring turmoil &#8220;within your gates&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15, 52</a>). God is allowing internal conflict to expose Israel&#8217;s covenant unfaithfulness.<p>&#8226; Shechem&#8217;s gates, once symbols of justice, become the stage for intrigue, proving that a city without godly leadership quickly trades covenant identity for political expediency (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the leaders of Shechem put their confidence in him</b><p>&#8226; The city&#8217;s elites shift allegiance at the first promising challenger, revealing hearts &#8220;unstable in all their ways&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-8.htm">James 1:8</a>). Their earlier covenant with Abimelech (<a href="/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6</a>) is now discarded.<p>&#8226; Trusting Gaal exposes their deeper issue: they no longer trust the Lord. &#8220;It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in princes&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/118-9.htm">Psalm 118:9</a>).<p>&#8226; By empowering Gaal, they invite yet another season of violence, for &#8220;when the wicked rule, the people groan&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse sets up the Lord&#8217;s impending judgment: He will use the very alliances people craft in pride to bring about their downfall (<a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-3</a>; <a href="/judges/9-42.htm">Judges 9:42-49</a>).<p>&#8226; Ultimately, their misplaced confidence contrasts with Gideon&#8217;s earlier dependence on God (<a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2-7</a>). Human saviors cannot replace divine deliverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/9-26.htm">Judges 9:26</a> captures a pivotal moment in Israel&#8217;s downward spiral: a new would-be leader marches into a covenant city, and its restless rulers eagerly embrace him. Each clause exposes layers of human ambition, fickle loyalty, and covenant forgetfulness, while simultaneously showcasing God&#8217;s unseen hand turning even rebellious schemes toward His just ends. The verse warns against trusting charismatic figures over the Lord and reminds us that God&#8217;s purposes stand, even when His people trade covenant faithfulness for political security.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Gaal the son of Ebed.</span>--We are not told any further who he was; but the context leads us to infer that he was one of these freebooters, and probably belonged to the Canaanite population.
