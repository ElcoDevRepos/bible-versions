The Midianites had oppressed Israel for seven years, as described earlier in Judges, and their defeat was a significant turning point. This victory was achieved not by Israel's might but through God's intervention, emphasizing the theme of divine deliverance. The Midianites' defeat is reminiscent of other instances where God delivered Israel from their enemies, such as the Egyptians in Exodus. The phrase "subdued before the Israelites" indicates a complete and decisive victory, ensuring that Midian would no longer pose a threat.<p><b>and did not raise its head again.</b><br>This phrase signifies the totality of Midian's defeat. The imagery of not raising its head suggests that Midian was utterly crushed and unable to recover or retaliate. This is consistent with the biblical theme of God granting His people peace from their enemies when they are obedient to Him. Historically, this defeat would have significantly weakened Midian's power and influence in the region, preventing them from oppressing Israel again during Gideon's lifetime.<p><b>So the land had rest for forty years</b><br>The "rest" mentioned here is a period of peace and stability, free from foreign oppression. The number forty is significant in biblical literature, often symbolizing a generation or a period of testing and renewal. This rest is a direct result of Gideon's leadership and God's deliverance. It parallels other periods of rest in the Book of Judges, such as the forty years of peace after Deborah and Barak's victory. This rest is a temporary reprieve, highlighting the cyclical nature of Israel's faithfulness and apostasy throughout Judges.<p><b>in the days of Gideon.</b><br>Gideon's leadership is central to this period of rest. He is one of the judges raised by God to deliver Israel, and his story is a testament to God's power working through unlikely individuals. Gideon's days were marked by both faithfulness and failure, as seen in his later actions, which led Israel into idolatry. This phrase underscores the importance of godly leadership and the impact it can have on a nation's peace and prosperity. Gideon's life also serves as a type of Christ, as he was a deliverer and judge, though imperfect, pointing to the ultimate deliverer, Jesus Christ, who brings eternal peace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/midian.htm">Midian</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe that oppressed Israel for seven years.

The verse now looks back and sums up God&#8217;s complete victory:<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;in this way&#8221; points to the whole series of God-directed steps&#8212;paring Israel&#8217;s forces down (<a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2-7</a>), confusing Midian in the night attack (<a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>), and energizing the Ephraimites and other tribes to cut off the retreat (<a href="/judges/7-24.htm">Judges 7:24-25</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Subdued&#8221; reminds us of earlier promises that Yahweh Himself would drive out enemies (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>; <a href="/joshua/23-3.htm">Joshua 23:3</a>). Midian&#8217;s power is literally broken; they no longer tyrannize Israel as in <a href="/judges/6-1.htm">Judges 6:1-6</a>.<p>&#8226; Gideon&#8217;s victory mirrors earlier deliverances under Othniel (<a href="/judges/3-10.htm">Judges 3:10-11</a>) and Deborah/Barak (<a href="/judges/4-23.htm">Judges 4:23-24</a>).

Crops are safe, worship resumes, families thrive.<p>&#8226; Yet the peace is &#8220;in the days of Gideon.&#8221; Judges repeatedly shows rest tied to the faithfulness of a judge; once he dies, relapse follows (<a href="/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18-19</a>).
