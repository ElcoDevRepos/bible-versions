This also reflects Gideon's leadership ability, as he could command and organize a group to assist him. The number ten can symbolize completeness or responsibility in biblical terms, suggesting the thoroughness of Gideon's obedience.<p><b>and did as the LORD had told him.</b><br>This phrase highlights Gideon's obedience to God's command, which is a central theme in the narrative. It reflects the importance of following divine instructions despite personal fears or societal pressures. Gideon's actions are a precursor to his role as a judge and deliverer of Israel, showing his initial steps of faith and trust in God.<p><b>But because he was too afraid of his father&#8217;s household and the men of the city,</b><br>Gideon's fear of his father's household and the men of the city underscores the cultural and familial pressures of the time. His father's household likely included idol worship, as indicated by the altar to Baal that Gideon was commanded to destroy. The men of the city represent societal norms and expectations that were contrary to God's commands. This fear reflects the tension between following God and facing potential backlash from one's community.<p><b>he did it by night rather than in the daytime.</b><br>Gideon's decision to act at night reveals his cautious approach to fulfilling God's command. This action can be seen as both a strategic move to avoid immediate confrontation and a sign of his initial lack of confidence. The nighttime setting also symbolizes the spiritual darkness of Israel during this period, with Gideon's actions serving as a light breaking through. This act of obedience, despite fear, foreshadows the deliverance and victory that God would bring through Gideon, pointing to the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who is often associated with light overcoming darkness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.
