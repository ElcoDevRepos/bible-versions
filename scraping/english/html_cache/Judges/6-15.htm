The term "my Lord" indicates recognition of authority, though Gideon is unsure of the divine nature of his visitor. This reflects the common biblical theme of God choosing unlikely individuals for His purposes, as seen with Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-11.htm">Exodus 3:11</a>.<p><b>&#8220;how can I save Israel?&#8221;</b><br>Gideon's question reveals his doubt and sense of inadequacy. This echoes the sentiment of other biblical figures like Moses and Jeremiah, who also questioned their ability to fulfill God's calling. It highlights the theme of divine empowerment, where God often chooses the weak to accomplish His purposes, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>.<p><b>Indeed, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh,</b><br>Manasseh was one of the tribes of Israel, descended from Joseph's son. Gideon's reference to his clan's weakness underscores the socio-political structure of Israel at the time, where tribal and clan affiliations determined status and power. This statement emphasizes God's pattern of using the humble and lowly, as seen in the selection of David, the youngest son of Jesse, in <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16</a>.<p><b>and I am the youngest in my father&#8217;s house.&#8221;</b><br>Being the youngest often implied having the least authority or inheritance rights, as seen in the story of David. Gideon's self-assessment highlights the cultural context where birth order influenced one's role and responsibilities. This further illustrates the biblical theme of God elevating the humble, as Jesus later teaches in <a href="/matthew/23-12.htm">Matthew 23:12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

Gideon&#8217;s honest question prepares the stage for the reassuring promise that follows: &#8220;Surely I will be with you&#8221; (<a href="/judges/6-16.htm">Judges 6:16</a>), turning a hesitant farmer into a mighty warrior by the power of God alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Oh my Lord.</span>--Here our version deliberately adopts the reading <span class= "ital">adoni, as </span>in <a href="/judges/6-13.htm" title="And Gideon said to him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD has forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.">Judges 6:13</a>, and the reason for this reading is that Gideon does not appear <span class= "ital">to </span>have fully recognised the angel till his disappearance (<a href="/judges/6-22.htm" title="And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.">Judges 6:22</a>).
