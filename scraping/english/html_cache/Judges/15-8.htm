The term "ruthlessly" indicates the severity and intensity of Samson's actions, reflecting the cycle of violence between the Israelites and the Philistines. The "great slaughter" signifies a significant victory for Samson, who was empowered by the Spirit of the Lord (<a href="/judges/14-19.htm">Judges 14:19</a>). This act of vengeance is part of the larger narrative of Samson's judgeship, where he is often seen as a flawed deliverer of Israel, prefiguring the ultimate deliverance through Christ, who would conquer sin and death.<p><b>and then went down and stayed in the cave at the rock of Etam</b><br>The "rock of Etam" is a geographical location in the territory of Judah. Caves were often used as places of refuge or hiding in ancient times, as seen in other biblical accounts (<a href="/1_samuel/22.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>, <a href="/1_kings/19-9.htm">1 Kings 19:9</a>). Samson's retreat to the cave may symbolize a temporary withdrawal from conflict, reflecting a pattern of seeking solitude after significant events, similar to how Jesus withdrew to pray (<a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>). The rock of Etam's exact location is uncertain, but it is believed to be in the hill country of Judah, emphasizing the strategic and protective nature of such sites. This setting underscores the tension between Samson's role as a judge and his personal struggles, highlighting the need for a perfect deliverer, fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, given by God, and his Nazirite vow.

Having vowed in <a href="/judges/15-7.htm">Judges 15:7</a> to avenge their cruelty, he now fulfills that promise. His action is not impulsive rage but the divinely empowered deliverance God had begun to work through him (<a href="/judges/14-4.htm">Judges 14:4</a>; 14:19). Scripture often depicts God raising up a deliverer who meets oppression head-on&#8212;compare Ehud in <a href="/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15&#8211;30</a> or David facing Goliath in <a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45&#8211;47</a>. Samson&#8217;s ruthlessness underlines that he is God&#8217;s appointed judge, wielding God&#8217;s judgment against Israel&#8217;s enemies (<a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-34.htm">Psalm 18:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with a great slaughter</b><p>The phrase highlights both scale and finality. &#8226; Earlier, Samson had killed thirty Philistines at Ashkelon (<a href="/judges/14-19.htm">Judges 14:19</a>); here the text stresses an even broader defeat. &#8226; Soon after, he will slay a thousand more with the jawbone of a donkey (<a href="/judges/15-15.htm">Judges 15:15</a>). The pattern shows escalating victories that weaken Philistine dominance and remind Israel that &#8220;salvation belongs to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>). Such &#8220;great slaughters&#8221; recur throughout Judges (e.g., Gideon in <a href="/judges/8-10.htm">Judges 8:10</a>; Jephthah in <a href="/judges/11-33.htm">Judges 11:33</a>), each time reaffirming that God&#8217;s power is not limited by the number or strength of the enemy (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and then went down</b><p>The physical descent signals a strategic withdrawal, not defeat. Samson often &#8220;goes down&#8221; after major exploits&#8212;he went down to Ashkelon (<a href="/judges/14-19.htm">Judges 14:19</a>) and later goes down to Gaza (<a href="/judges/16-1.htm">Judges 16:1</a>). By moving away, he avoids immediate retaliation and positions himself for God&#8217;s next assignment. The pattern fits biblical wisdom that there is &#8220;a time to fight and a time to refrain&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and stayed in the cave at the rock of Etam</b><p>&#8226; Caves regularly serve as refuges for God&#8217;s servants&#8212;David at Adullam (<a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>), Elijah at Horeb (<a href="/1_kings/19-9.htm">1 Kings 19:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;rock of Etam&#8221; provides both physical shelter and symbolic assurance: God Himself is the believer&#8217;s rock (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>). Samson may appear isolated, yet he is exactly where the Lord wants him, preparing for the next deliverance recorded in <a href="/judges/15-9.htm">Judges 15:9-20</a>. Even in hiding, God&#8217;s purposes advance, echoing <a href="/hebrews/11-32.htm">Hebrews 11:32</a>, which lists Samson among the faithful who &#8220;conquered kingdoms&#8221; by faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/15-8.htm">Judges 15:8</a> portrays Samson fulfilling his vow of vengeance with decisive, Spirit-empowered judgment on the Philistines, executing a &#8220;great slaughter&#8221; that weakens enemy oppression. His subsequent retreat to the cave at Etam is a tactical pause in God&#8217;s ongoing plan, illustrating that the Lord provides both victory and refuge for His chosen deliverer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Hip and thigh.</span>--There is no doubt that the expression intensifies the words "with a great slaughter;" but the origin of the phrase is a matter of conjecture. It may be purely general, like the German expression "<span class= "ital">Arm und Bein," </span>or "<span class= "ital">er hieb den Feind in die Pfanne," </span>or "in <span class= "ital">Kochstcke</span>" ("A blow strikes a fugitive on the hip, and that would be enough; another blow on the thigh ends him"). "Hence," says Ewald, "it means thigh over and above"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>besides the hip. It cannot possibly mean "cavalry and infantry," as the Chaldee renders it, or be a reference to wrestling (Greek, <span class= "ital">huposkelizein</span>)<span class= "ital">; </span>nor is it likely to have a sacrificial origin ("good and bad pieces"). It is hard to see what St. Jerome means by his gloss "<span class= "ital">ita ut slupentes suram femori imponerent." </span>Literally it is, <span class= "ital">thigh upon hip, </span>or <span class= "ital">leg upon thigh </span>(LXX., <span class= "greekheb">?????? ??? ?????</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>May it not have had its origin in some such fierce custom as that known to the Greeks as <span class= "ital">akroteriasmos, </span>or <span class= "ital">maschalismos, </span>in which the extremities of a corpse were cut off and placed under the arm-pits? ('sch. <span class= "ital">Cho. </span>439; Soph. <span class= "ital">El. </span>445.) Thus in Hesychius and Suidas <span class= "ital">maschalismata </span>means "mutilated limbs," and also "the flesh of the shoulders laid on the haunches at sacrifices."<p><span class= "bld">With a great slaughter.</span>--It is not said, nor is it necessarily implied (any more than in the case of Shamgar), that Samson was absolutely alone in these raids. There is nothing either in the narrative or in the ordinary style of Hebrew prose which makes any such inference necessary, nor, indeed, is there any such inference drawn in many similar passages (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Judgesi. 20, &c.).<p><span class= "bld">In the top of the rock Etam.</span>--It should undoubtedly be <span class= "ital">in a ravine </span>(or cave) <span class= "ital">of the cliff Etam. </span>For instance, in <a href="/judges/15-11.htm" title="Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Know you not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that you have done to us? And he said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them.">Judges 15:11</a> the men of Judah could not go <span class= "ital">down </span>to the top of a rock, and the same word is rendered "cleft" in <a href="/isaiah/57-5.htm" title="Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks?">Isaiah 57:5</a>, and should be so rendered for "top" in <a href="/isaiah/3-21.htm" title="The rings, and nose jewels,">Isaiah 3:21</a> (LXX., "in a hole of the rock," and "in the cave of Etam;" Vulg., <span class= "ital">in spelunca petrae</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>This explains the expression "went down" in this verse, and "brought him up" in <a href="/judges/15-13.htm" title="And they spoke to him, saying, No; but we will bind you fast, and deliver you into their hand: but surely we will not kill you. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.">Judges 15:13</a>. Such cliff-caves are the natural refuge of oppressed peoples (<a href="/judges/6-2.htm" title="And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.">Judges 6:2</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/13-6.htm" title="When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.">1Samuel 13:6</a>; <a href="/1_kings/18-13.htm" title="Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?">1Kings 18:13</a>). These caves, like the cave of Aduliam, are often supplied with water by natural springs, and one man may defend them against a multitude. The LXX. (Cod. A) add the words "by the torrent." The site of Etam is uncertain; but it is in the tribe of Judah, which Samson only enters once, or, possibly (<a href="/judges/16-3.htm" title="And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.">Judges 16:3</a>), twice, and then only as a fugitive. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He smote them hip and thigh</span>, etc. A proverbial expression, the origin of which is uncertain; it means, he smote them with a great and complete slaughter.
