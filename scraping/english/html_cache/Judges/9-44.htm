His actions reflect the chaotic period of the Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). The term "rushed forward" indicates a sudden and aggressive military maneuver, typical of ancient warfare tactics. This phrase highlights Abimelech's determination and the urgency of his campaign to consolidate power.<p><b>and took their stand at the entrance of the city gate</b><br>The city gate was a strategic location in ancient cities, serving as a place of defense, commerce, and legal matters. By taking a stand at the gate, Abimelech aimed to control access to the city, a common military strategy to assert dominance and cut off reinforcements or escape routes. This action underscores the importance of the city gate in biblical times, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/15-2.htm">2 Samuel 15:2</a>.<p><b>The other two companies rushed against all who were in the fields</b><br>Abimelech's forces were divided into companies, a tactical decision to maximize their impact. The fields surrounding a city were vital for agriculture and sustenance, and attacking those in the fields would disrupt the city's food supply and economy. This tactic reflects the harsh realities of ancient warfare, where civilian areas were often targeted to weaken the enemy's resources and morale.<p><b>and struck them down</b><br>This phrase indicates the violent and ruthless nature of Abimelech's campaign. The act of striking down those in the fields demonstrates the brutality of his rule and the lengths he would go to secure his power. It also serves as a reminder of the consequences of Israel's disobedience to God, as the period of the Judges was marked by cycles of sin, oppression, and deliverance. This violence foreshadows the eventual downfall of Abimelech, as divine justice is a recurring theme throughout the book of Judges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal) and a concubine from Shechem.
