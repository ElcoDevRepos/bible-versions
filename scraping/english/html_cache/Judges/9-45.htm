The phrase "all that day" indicates a prolonged and determined assault, reflecting Abimelech's relentless ambition and the intensity of the conflict. This battle is part of the broader narrative of Abimelech's violent rise to power, which contrasts with the leadership of his father, Gideon, who was called by God to deliver Israel.<p><b>until he had captured it and killed its people.</b><br>The capture and subsequent massacre of the city's inhabitants highlight the brutal nature of Abimelech's rule. This act of violence fulfills Jotham's curse (<a href="/judges/9-20.htm">Judges 9:20</a>), which predicted destruction for both Abimelech and the men of Shechem due to their treachery. The killing of the people underscores the theme of divine retribution and justice, as Abimelech's actions lead to his eventual downfall.<p><b>Then he demolished the city</b><br>The destruction of Shechem serves as a physical manifestation of Abimelech's wrath and a warning to others who might oppose him. In biblical times, demolishing a city was a common practice to ensure it could not be easily rebuilt or used as a base for rebellion. This act also symbolizes the complete eradication of opposition and the consequences of turning away from God, as Shechem had done by supporting Abimelech.<p><b>and sowed it with salt.</b><br>Sowing a city with salt was a symbolic act meant to curse the land, rendering it barren and uninhabitable. This practice is mentioned in other ancient Near Eastern texts and signifies total desolation. The use of salt here can be seen as a fulfillment of divine judgment, as salt is often associated with covenant and purity in Scripture (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>). This act foreshadows the ultimate futility of Abimelech's reign, as his kingdom, like the salted land, would not endure.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal) and a concubine from Shechem.

The city made an obstinate defence notwithstanding, but was taken before night, and all the inhabitants were put to the sword. The walls were then razed to the ground, and the site was sown with salt to express the wish that it might be barren and uninhabited for ever (cf. <a href="/psalms/107-34.htm">Psalm 107:34</a>, marg.; <a href="/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a>).
