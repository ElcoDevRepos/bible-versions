It suggests a specific method or manner in which God's judgment is executed. The context of <a href="/judges/9.htm">Judges 9</a> reveals a series of events orchestrated by God to bring about justice, emphasizing His sovereignty and the certainty of divine retribution.<p><b>God repaid</b><br>The concept of divine retribution is central here. It underscores the biblical principle that God is just and will repay evil according to His righteousness. This reflects the broader biblical theme found in passages like <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>, where believers are reminded that vengeance belongs to the Lord.<p><b>the wickedness that Abimelech had done</b><br>Abimelech's actions are characterized as wickedness, highlighting the moral depravity of his deeds. His ambition led him to commit fratricide, a grave sin in biblical terms. This wickedness is not only a personal sin but also a violation of familial and societal norms, reflecting the broader theme of sin's destructive impact.<p><b>to his father</b><br>This phrase refers to Gideon, also known as Jerubbaal, Abimelech's father. The mention of his father emphasizes the betrayal and the violation of familial loyalty. It also serves as a reminder of Gideon's legacy and the tragic consequences of his son&#8217;s actions, contrasting Gideon's role as a judge with Abimelech's usurpation.<p><b>in murdering his seventy brothers</b><br>The murder of his seventy brothers is a heinous act of fratricide, illustrating the extent of Abimelech's ambition and moral corruption. This act is reminiscent of other biblical accounts of sibling rivalry and murder, such as Cain and Abel, and serves as a stark warning against the destructive power of unchecked ambition and sin. The number seventy may symbolize completeness, indicating the totality of Abimelech's crime.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal) and a concubine from Shechem.
