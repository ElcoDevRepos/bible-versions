Hospitality was a sacred duty, especially in a time when inns were rare and travel was perilous. The host's willingness to bring a stranger into his home reflects the values seen in other biblical narratives, such as Abraham's hospitality to the three visitors in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>. This act of kindness is a stark contrast to the inhospitable and dangerous environment of Gibeah, where the Levite initially found no one willing to take him in.<p><b>and fed his donkeys.</b><br>Providing for the donkeys indicates a comprehensive hospitality that extends beyond the human guests to their animals. In the agrarian society of ancient Israel, animals were valuable assets, essential for travel and work. This care for the donkeys underscores the host's generosity and thoroughness in ensuring the well-being of his guests. It also reflects the biblical principle of stewardship over creation, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>, which states, "A righteous man cares for the needs of his animal."<p><b>And they washed their feet</b><br>Foot washing was a common practice in the ancient Near East due to the dusty roads and the use of sandals. It was a gesture of welcome and comfort, often performed by servants. This act symbolizes cleansing and refreshment, preparing the guests for rest and fellowship. In the New Testament, Jesus washing the disciples' feet in <a href="/john/13.htm">John 13</a> serves as a profound example of humility and service, echoing the hospitality shown here.<p><b>and ate and drank.</b><br>Sharing a meal signifies fellowship and peace. In biblical times, eating together was a sign of acceptance and community. This meal contrasts with the violence and immorality that later unfolds in the narrative, highlighting the initial peace and safety within the host's home. The act of eating and drinking together is a recurring theme in Scripture, symbolizing covenant relationships, as seen in the Last Supper (<a href="/matthew/26-26.htm">Matthew 26:26-29</a>), where Jesus establishes the New Covenant with His disciples.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A central figure in this account, the Levite is traveling with his concubine and servant.

His actions contrast with the inhospitable and wicked behavior of the townspeople.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a></b><br>A town in the territory of Benjamin, Gibeah becomes the setting for the unfolding tragedy. It serves as a backdrop for examining the moral state of Israel during this period.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_concubine.htm">The Concubine</a></b><br>The Levite's concubine is a pivotal character whose tragic fate underscores the themes of violence and the breakdown of social order.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_donkeys.htm">The Donkeys</a></b><br>While seemingly minor, the mention of the donkeys being fed highlights the completeness of the old man's hospitality, extending care to both man and beast.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_hospitality.htm">The Importance of Hospitality</a></b><br>Hospitality is a recurring biblical theme, reflecting God's love and care.
