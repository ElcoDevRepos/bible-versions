The act of calling out indicates a confrontation, a common practice in ancient times when seeking justice or resolution. This reflects the tribal and familial tensions prevalent in the period of the Judges, where personal and communal grievances often led to direct confrontations.<p><b>the Danites turned to face them</b><br>The Danites, one of the tribes of Israel, were in the process of relocating due to their inability to secure their allotted territory. Their turning to face Micah's group shows a readiness to defend their actions, highlighting the lawlessness and moral ambiguity of the time. This moment underscores the chaotic period of the Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><b>and said to Micah</b><br>Micah, a man from the hill country of Ephraim, had established a shrine with idols and a personal priest. His interaction with the Danites reveals the syncretism and idolatry that plagued Israel during this era. The mention of Micah by name personalizes the narrative, emphasizing the individual stories that contribute to the larger narrative of Israel's spiritual decline.<p><b>&#8220;What is the matter with you</b><br>This question from the Danites can be seen as dismissive, indicating their lack of concern for the wrong they had done to Micah. It reflects the moral relativism of the time, where personal gain often trumped communal or covenantal responsibilities. This attitude is indicative of the broader spiritual and social decay in Israel during the Judges period.<p><b>that you have called out such a company?&#8221;</b><br>The "company" refers to the group of men Micah gathered to pursue the Danites. This phrase highlights the seriousness of Micah's grievance, as assembling a group for pursuit was not a trivial matter. It also underscores the communal nature of justice and retribution in ancient Israel, where personal disputes often involved the wider community. The Danites' question reveals their surprise or disdain at Micah's response, further illustrating the breakdown of social and religious order during this time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/danites.htm">Danites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel seeking a new territory to settle.

The posture recalls Abner turning to confront Asahel (<a href="/2_samuel/2-19.htm">2 Samuel 2:19&#8211;23</a>), signaling, &#8220;We&#8217;re ready to do more than talk.&#8221;<p>&#8226;The tribe&#8217;s readiness for confrontation exposes a heart hardened by sin. <a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a> contrasts the righteous and the wicked: &#8220;The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.&#8221; Here the roles are reversed&#8212;Micah is unarmed and pleading, while the wrongdoers stand bold.<p>&#8226;Their turning shows how far they have strayed from the brotherly kindness commanded in <a href="/leviticus/19-17.htm">Leviticus 19:17&#8211;18</a>; they prefer intimidation to reconciliation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said to Micah</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and said to Micah&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/judges/18-23.htm">Judges 18:23</a>c)<p>&#8226;The spokesman singles out Micah, ignoring the villagers with him.

Micah&#8217;s earnest cry for justice meets a tribe emboldened by might, not by obedience. The Danites&#8217; turning, their personal address, and their mocking question highlight a heart indifferent to God&#8217;s law and to brotherly compassion. The verse stands as a living snapshot of a society where moral authority has inverted, foreshadowing the deeper idolatry and conflict that will follow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">What aileth thee?</span>--There is again a certain grim humour in the narrative, with some sense of irony for the total discomfiture and pathetic outcries of Micah.

Just as <span class="accented">Israel</span> or <span class="accented">Judah</span> designates the whole nation, or the whole tribe, under the name of their patriarch, so here Micah would include all the clan who dwelt in Micah's house;
