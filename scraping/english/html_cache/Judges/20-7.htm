The term "Israelites" refers to the descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, and highlights their covenant relationship with God. This collective identity is crucial in the context of Judges, where tribal divisions often lead to conflict. The call to the Israelites underscores the need for national unity in addressing the moral and social issues facing the nation.<p><b>give your advice</b><br>The request for advice indicates a communal decision-making process, which was common in ancient Israelite society. This reflects the tribal confederation system where leaders and elders would gather to deliberate on important matters. The need for advice suggests a situation requiring wisdom and discernment, echoing the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, "Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety."<p><b>and verdict</b><br>The term "verdict" implies a judicial decision, highlighting the legal and moral dimensions of the issue at hand. In the context of Judges, this reflects the role of the Israelites as enforcers of God's law, tasked with upholding justice and righteousness. The need for a verdict also points to the seriousness of the situation, requiring a definitive and authoritative resolution.<p><b>here and now.</b><br>The urgency of "here and now" underscores the immediate need for action and resolution. This reflects the pressing nature of the crisis in the narrative, where delay could lead to further moral decay or social unrest. The immediacy of the call to action is reminiscent of other biblical instances where prompt obedience to God's commands is required, such as in <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>, where Joshua urges the Israelites to choose whom they will serve.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel, who are gathered to address a grievous sin committed in the tribe of Benjamin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_benjamin.htm">Tribe of Benjamin</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, which is at the center of the conflict due to the heinous crime committed by some of its members.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/levite_and_his_concubine.htm">Levite and His Concubine</a></b><br>The Levite's concubine was brutally abused and murdered by men from Gibeah, a city in Benjamin, which led to the assembly of the tribes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a></b><br>A city in the territory of Benjamin where the crime took place, sparking outrage among the other tribes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/assembly_at_mizpah.htm">Assembly at Mizpah</a></b><br>The gathering of the Israelite tribes at Mizpah to deliberate on the response to the crime committed in Gibeah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/communal_responsibility.htm">Communal Responsibility</a></b><br>The Israelites' gathering to address the sin in Benjamin underscores the importance of communal responsibility in dealing with sin.

The Levite has related the crime committed in Gibeah (<a href="/bsb/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>), and now he summons Israel to look squarely at the situation.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Behold&#8221; also underscores that God&#8217;s covenant people cannot ignore sin in their midst (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>; <a href="/joshua/7-13.htm">Joshua 7:13</a>). The call is not to casual observation but to moral engagement.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All you Israelites</b><p>&#8226; The appeal is collective: &#8220;all you Israelites.&#8221; No tribe is exempt, for the outrage in Benjamin threatens the holiness and unity of the whole nation (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12-18</a>; <a href="/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently teaches corporate responsibility. When Achan sinned, all Israel suffered (<a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1-12</a>). When one member rejoices or weeps, the whole body shares in it (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds believers today that the church is likewise a covenant community called to address sin together in love and truth (<a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Give your advice and verdict</b><p>&#8226; The Levite&#8217;s charge, &#8220;give your advice and verdict,&#8221; invites thoughtful counsel and righteous judgment.

Leaders and people alike are to seek wisdom, listen to testimony, and decide in accordance with God&#8217;s law (<a href="/exodus/18-19.htm">Exodus 18:19-22</a>; <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Note the balance: zeal without due process becomes vengeance, while endless deliberation without action enables evil. God calls for both deliberation and decisive righteousness (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Here and now</b><p>&#8226; Finally, the phrase &#8220;here and now&#8221; presses for immediate obedience.

Faithfulness requires timely, concrete steps that reflect God&#8217;s character (<a href="/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-15.htm">Hebrews 3:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/20-7.htm">Judges 20:7</a> summons God&#8217;s people to pause (&#8220;Behold&#8221;), to unite (&#8220;all you Israelites&#8221;), to deliberate under Scripture&#8217;s authority (&#8220;give your advice and verdict&#8221;), and to act without delay (&#8220;here and now&#8221;).
