Their role was crucial in maintaining order and addressing issues that arose among the tribes. This reflects the communal leadership structure in ancient Israel, where elders held significant authority and were expected to act with wisdom and discernment.<p><b>&#8220;What should we do about wives for those who remain,</b><br>This question arises from a crisis following the civil war between the tribe of Benjamin and the other Israelite tribes. The conflict, detailed in the preceding chapters, resulted in the near annihilation of the Benjamite men and the destruction of their cities, including the women. The elders are seeking a solution to preserve the tribe of Benjamin, as the lack of wives would lead to its extinction. This reflects the cultural importance of marriage and family lineage in ancient Israel, where continuity of the tribe was vital.<p><b>since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?&#8221;</b><br>The destruction of the women of Benjamin was a consequence of the war, highlighting the severe impact of inter-tribal conflict. This phrase underscores the gravity of the situation, as the loss of women meant the potential end of the tribe. It also reflects the harsh realities of ancient warfare, where entire communities could be decimated. The elders' concern for finding wives for the remaining Benjamites is not only about survival but also about restoring the social and familial structures that were integral to Israelite society. This situation also foreshadows the need for redemption and restoration, themes that are prevalent throughout the Bible and find their ultimate fulfillment in the redemptive work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders_of_the_congregation.htm">Elders of the Congregation</a></b><br>These are the leaders of the Israelite tribes who are responsible for making decisions and providing guidance to the people.

This tension between a hasty oath and genuine compassion sets the stage for the chapter&#8217;s difficult choices (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?</b><p>The catastrophic slaughter detailed in <a href="/judges/20-48.htm">Judges 20:48</a> left the tribe bereft of its women and children.

Similarly in Herodotus (iv. 154), Themison having sworn to throw Phronima into the sea--the <span class= "ital">intention </span>having been that she should be drowned--feels himself bound to throw her into the sea, but has her drawn out of it again. Their want of moral enlightenment revealed itself in this way, and still more in having ever taken this horrible oath, which involved the butchery of innocent men, and of still more innocent women and children. In point of fact, the <span class= "ital">cherem </span>often broke down under the strain which it placed on men's best feelings (<a href="/1_samuel/14-45.htm" title="And the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel?

So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.">1Samuel 14:45</a>) as well as on their lower temptations. The guilt of breaking a guilty vow is only the original guilt of ever having made it. What the Israelites should have done was not to bathe their hands in more rivers of fraternal blood, but to pray to God to forgive the brutal vehemence which disgraced a cause originally righteous, and to have allowed the remnant of the Benjamites to intermarry with them once more. As it was, they were led by ignorance and rashness into several vows which could not be fulfilled without horrible cruelty and bloodshed, and the fulfilment of which they after all casuistically evaded, and that at the cost of still more bloodshed. As all these events took place under the guidance of Phinehas, they give us a high estimate indeed of the zeal which was his noblest characteristic (<a href="/psalms/106-30.htm" title="Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.">Psalm 106:30</a>), yet a very low estimate of his state of spiritual insight; and clearly to such a man the fulfilment of Jephthah's <span class= "ital">cherem </span>by sacrificing his daughter (see Note on <a href="/judges/11-39.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man.

But why should we suppose that the grandson of Aaron, in such times as these--when all was anarchy, idolatry, and restlessness, against which he either did not strive or strove most ineffectually--should stand on so much higher a level than his schismatical and semi-idolatrous cousin, the wandering grandson of Moses?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seeing the women</span>.
