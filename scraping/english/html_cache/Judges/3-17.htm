Eglon, the king of Moab, had subjugated Israel, and they were required to pay tribute, a common practice in the ancient Near East where a vassal state paid goods or money to a dominant power. This tribute was a symbol of Israel's subjugation and a reminder of their need for deliverance. Moab, located east of the Dead Sea, was a frequent adversary of Israel. The act of bringing tribute highlights the political and economic control Eglon had over Israel, reflecting the consequences of Israel's disobedience to God.<p><b>who was an obese man</b><br>Eglon's obesity is noted specifically, which is unusual in biblical descriptions, suggesting it has significance. In ancient cultures, obesity could symbolize wealth, power, and indulgence, as only those with abundant resources could afford to be overweight. This detail may also serve to emphasize the decadence and corruption of Eglon's rule. Additionally, it sets the stage for the narrative of Ehud's assassination of Eglon, where his physical size plays a crucial role in the story's outcome. The mention of Eglon's obesity could also be seen as a form of divine irony, where the seemingly powerful and imposing king is ultimately vulnerable and defeated by God's chosen deliverer, Ehud.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ehud.htm">Ehud</a></b><br>A left-handed judge of Israel from the tribe of Benjamin, chosen by God to deliver Israel from Moabite oppression.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/eglon.htm">Eglon</a></b><br>The king of Moab, who had oppressed Israel for eighteen years.
