A shekel was a unit of weight, approximately 11.4 grams, making the total weight around 19.38 kilograms or 42.7 pounds. This substantial amount of gold indicates the wealth accumulated from the victory over the Midianites. In biblical times, gold was a symbol of wealth and power, often used in the construction of idols or religious artifacts, as seen later in the creation of the ephod by Gideon (<a href="/judges/8-27.htm">Judges 8:27</a>). The collection of gold earrings also reflects the cultural practice of wearing earrings, which was common among the Ishmaelites and Midianites (<a href="/judges/8-24.htm">Judges 8:24</a>).<p><b>in addition to the crescent ornaments</b><br>Crescent ornaments were likely decorative items worn by the Midianites, possibly as symbols of their gods or as status symbols. The crescent shape may have had religious significance, possibly linked to moon worship, which was prevalent in ancient Near Eastern cultures. These ornaments, taken as spoils, signify the complete defeat and humiliation of the Midianite kings, stripping them of their symbols of power and divine favor.<p><b>the pendants</b><br>Pendants were likely valuable items worn as jewelry, signifying wealth and status. In the ancient world, such items were often crafted with intricate designs and could be made of precious metals or stones. The mention of pendants alongside other valuable items underscores the richness of the spoils taken from the Midianites, further emphasizing the totality of Gideon's victory.<p><b>the purple garments of the kings of Midian</b><br>Purple garments were a sign of royalty and wealth, as purple dye was rare and expensive, extracted from the murex snail. The capture of these garments symbolizes the overthrow of Midianite royalty and the transfer of their wealth and status to the Israelites. This act of taking royal garments is reminiscent of other biblical narratives where the spoils of war include the clothing of defeated kings, highlighting the theme of divine justice and reversal of fortunes.<p><b>and the chains from the necks of their camels</b><br>Camels were valuable assets in the ancient Near East, used for transportation and trade. The chains around their necks were likely decorative, indicating the wealth and status of their owners. By taking these chains, Gideon not only acquired material wealth but also demonstrated the complete subjugation of the Midianites. This detail underscores the thoroughness of the victory and the transfer of wealth from the oppressors to the Israelites, fulfilling God's promise of deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel who led the Israelites to victory over the Midianites.

Gideon gathered earrings stripped from Midianite soldiers; the narrative notes, &#8220;They each had gold earrings, because they were Ishmaelites&#8221; (<a href="/judges/8-24.htm">Judges 8:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Spoils of war often took the form of jewelry, as seen when Israel offered earrings for the golden calf (<a href="/exodus/32-2.htm">Exodus 32:2&#8211;4</a>) and when Jacob buried household gods and earrings at Shechem (<a href="/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The mention of weight signals significant value, reminding us how Israel once plundered Egypt of &#8220;articles of gold and silver&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35&#8211;36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he had requested</b><p>&#8226; Gideon&#8217;s request comes after the Lord&#8217;s victory; he does not seize the spoils by force but asks voluntarily (<a href="/judges/8-24.htm">Judges 8:24</a>).<p>&#8226; This mirrors Abraham refusing spoil from Sodom&#8217;s king (<a href="/genesis/14-22.htm">Genesis 14:22&#8211;23</a>) yet contrasts with Saul&#8217;s disobedient plunder of Amalek (<a href="/1_samuel/15-19.htm">1 Samuel 15:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The request highlights Gideon&#8217;s leadership influence, pointing to how a judge could sway Israel even before it had kings (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was 1,700 shekels</b><p>&#8226;

The sheer weight anticipates Solomon&#8217;s later gold influx (<a href="/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14</a>), showing how Israel repeatedly received wealth through God&#8217;s providence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in addition to the crescent ornaments</b><p>&#8226;

Their removal reflects <a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25&#8211;26</a>: &#8220;You are to burn the carved images of their gods,&#8221; stripping idolatry from the land after conquest.<p>&#8226;

These items demonstrate that even ornamental wealth bows before Yahweh&#8217;s victory, fulfilling <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>: &#8220;the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous.&#8221;<p>&#8226;

Each item underscores the completeness of God&#8217;s triumph over Midian and His ability to transfer resources from pagan oppressors to His people. While the passage celebrates victory, it also foreshadows the danger of misusing blessings, urging us to honor the Lord with every gain and remember that He alone is the true King.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">A thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold.</span>--About seventy pounds of gold. This would imply a very large number of nose-rings or earrings (<a href="/genesis/24-22.htm" title="And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;">Genesis 24:22</a>), and therefore a slaughter of many leading Midianites. It is analogous to the "three bushels of knights' rings" which Mago carried to Carthage, and emptied upon the floor of the Carthaginian Senate, after the massacre of the Romans at Cannae (Liv. xxiii. 12).<p><span class= "bld">Beside ornaments.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">beside the golden crescents </span>(<a href="/judges/8-21.htm" title="Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise you, and fall on us: for as the man is, so is his strength.

Gideon seems to have gratified his love of vengeance, as goel, before he thought of booty.<p><span class= "bld">And collars.</span>--Marg., <span class= "ital">sweet jewels. </span>Rather, <span class= "ital">and the eardrops </span>(<span class= "ital">netiphoth, </span><a href="/isaiah/3-19.htm" title="The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,">Isaiah 3:19</a>).

If the rings, like that given to Rebekah (<a href="/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a>), weighed each half a shekel, they would be the spoil of 3400 dead bodies. If they each weighed less it would of course imply a larger number of slain. The ornaments, as in ver. 21, <span class="accented">the collars.</span> The word so rendered seems rather to mean <span class="accented">drops</span> or <span class="accented">pendants.</span> When worn by women (<a href="/isaiah/3-19.htm">Isaiah 3:19</a>, <span class="accented">chains</span>, A.V.) they were often of single pearls. The purple raiment, the famous Tyrian purple, made from the juice of a shellfish which is found in the Mediterranean, which was the distinctive colour of royal and imperial raiment. Chains. Perhaps the <span class="accented">ornaments</span> mentioned in ver. 21 as on the camels' necks were suspended to these chains. In <a href="/songs/4-9.htm">Song of Solomon 4:9</a> the <span class="accented">chain</span> is mentioned as an ornament of a woman's neck; in <a href="/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a> of a man's neck. Many interpreters understand these last-mentioned articles as not being part of Gideon's spoil, but being the people's portion. But it seems much more probable that the spoil of the kings should be Gideon's portion, as indeed ver. 21 implies. It is best, therefore, to take all these articles as being the property of the kings, and to understand the writer to tell us that Gideon had the rings, which were the people's spoil, in addition to all the spoil which naturally fell to his own share. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/8-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The weight</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1438;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;qal)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4948.htm">Strong's 4948: </a> </span><span class="str2">Weight, weighing</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the gold</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1489;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;z&#257;&#183;h&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
