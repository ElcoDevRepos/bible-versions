The act of preparing a goat signifies a gesture of respect and honor, often reserved for special guests. This aligns with the biblical tradition of offering sacrifices, as seen in <a href="/genesis/18-7.htm">Genesis 18:7-8</a>, where Abraham prepares a calf for his divine visitors. The young goat also foreshadows the sacrificial system later established in the Mosaic Law, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.<p><b>and unleavened bread</b><br>Unleavened bread, made without yeast, is significant in biblical history, symbolizing purity and the absence of sin. It is reminiscent of the Passover meal (<a href="/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8</a>), where unleavened bread was eaten in haste as the Israelites prepared to leave Egypt. This connection underscores themes of deliverance and divine intervention, which are central to Gideon's story as he is called to deliver Israel from Midianite oppression.<p><b>and an ephah of flour</b><br>An ephah is a unit of dry measure, roughly equivalent to 22 liters or about half a bushel. The use of an ephah of flour indicates a substantial offering, demonstrating Gideon's generosity and reverence. This act of giving aligns with the principle of offering one's best to God, as seen in the sacrificial laws of Leviticus. It also prefigures the abundant provision of Christ, the Bread of Life, who offers Himself fully for the salvation of humanity.<p><b>He placed the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot</b><br>The separation of meat and broth into different vessels reflects the careful preparation and presentation of the offering. This attention to detail highlights the importance of order and reverence in worship. The use of a basket and pot may also suggest a practical approach to serving, ensuring that each element of the meal is preserved and presented appropriately. This mirrors the meticulous nature of Old Testament sacrifices and the orderly worship prescribed in the Law.<p><b>and brought them out to present to Him under the oak</b><br>The oak tree serves as a significant location, often associated with divine encounters in the Old Testament. Oaks were considered sacred spaces, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6-7</a>, where Abram builds an altar to the Lord at the oak of Moreh. Presenting the offering under the oak signifies a place of meeting with God, emphasizing the sacredness of the encounter. This setting foreshadows the cross, another tree, where the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ would be made for the redemption of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.
