Gibeah was a city in the territory of Benjamin, and the crime involved the brutal assault and murder of a Levite's concubine, as detailed in <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>. The demand for justice reflects the communal responsibility in ancient Israel to uphold righteousness and the law, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5</a>, which calls for the removal of evil from among the people.<p><b>so we can put them to death</b><br>The call for capital punishment aligns with the Mosaic Law, which prescribed death for certain offenses to maintain holiness and justice within the community (<a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>). This reflects the seriousness with which sin and its consequences were regarded in Israelite society. The death penalty was seen as a means to deter further sin and to uphold the covenant relationship with God.<p><b>and purge Israel of this evil.&#8221;</b><br>The concept of purging evil is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, emphasizing the need to remove sin to maintain the purity and sanctity of the nation (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-7.htm">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>). This reflects the covenantal understanding that Israel was to be a holy nation, set apart for God&#8217;s purposes. The failure to address sin could lead to communal guilt and divine judgment, as seen in the story of Achan in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>.<p><b>But the Benjamites refused to heed the voice of their fellow Israelites.</b><br>The refusal of the Benjamites to surrender the guilty men highlights tribal loyalty and the potential for division within the nation. This decision led to a civil war, illustrating the destructive consequences of sin and disobedience. The Benjamites' defiance can be seen as a rejection of communal justice and a failure to uphold the covenantal laws. This incident foreshadows the later divisions in Israel, culminating in the split of the kingdom after Solomon's reign (1 Kings 12).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The collective tribes of Israel, excluding Benjamin, who are seeking justice for the crime committed in Gibeah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_benjamites.htm">The Benjamites</a></b><br>The tribe of Benjamin, who are protecting the men of Gibeah and refusing to hand them over for judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_men_of_gibeah.htm">The Men of Gibeah</a></b><br>The perpetrators of a grievous crime, whose actions have led to a call for justice from the other tribes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeah.htm">Gibeah</a></b><br>A city in the territory of Benjamin where the crime took place, leading to the conflict between the tribes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crime.htm">The Crime</a></b><br>The heinous act committed by the men of Gibeah, which is not detailed in this verse but is the catalyst for the demand for justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_justice.htm">The Importance of Justice</a></b><br>The Israelites' demand for the wicked men of Gibeah to be handed over underscores the necessity of justice in maintaining societal order and righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/tribal_loyalty_vs._righteousness.htm">Tribal Loyalty vs. Righteousness</a></b><br>The Benjamites' refusal to surrender the guilty men highlights the tension between loyalty to one's own group and adherence to God's standards of righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purging_evil.htm">Purging Evil</a></b><br>The call to "purge this evil from Israel" reflects a biblical principle of removing sin from the community to maintain holiness and prevent further corruption.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_disobedience.htm">Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The Benjamites' decision not to heed the call for justice leads to severe consequences, illustrating the dangers of disobedience to God's commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>This passage emphasizes the responsibility of the community to address sin and uphold justice, a principle that applies to the church today.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Judges_20_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Judges 20:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Judges_20_13_Justice_in_community.htm">How does Judges 20:13 emphasize the importance of justice within a community?
