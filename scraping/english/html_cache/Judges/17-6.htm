The period of the Judges was marked by a lack of centralized leadership in Israel. After the death of Joshua, Israel was led by judges, who were regional leaders rather than national rulers. This absence of a king is significant because it highlights the political and spiritual instability of the time. The Israelites were meant to be a theocracy, with God as their king, but they often failed to follow His commandments. This phrase foreshadows the eventual demand for a human king, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/8.htm">1 Samuel 8</a>, when the Israelites ask Samuel to appoint a king to lead them like other nations.<p><b>everyone did what was right in his own eyes.</b><br>This phrase underscores the moral and spiritual chaos prevalent during the time of the Judges. Without a central authority or adherence to God's law, people acted according to their own subjective standards. This led to a cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance, as depicted throughout the Book of Judges. The phrase reflects the human tendency to stray from divine guidance when left to personal judgment, echoing the warning in <a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>, "There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death." This period of moral relativism contrasts with the biblical call for obedience to God's commandments, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-8.htm">Deuteronomy 12:8</a>, where the Israelites are instructed not to do what is right in their own eyes but to follow God's statutes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A man from the hill country of Ephraim who creates a shrine and hires a Levite to be his priest, illustrating the spiritual confusion and idolatry prevalent in Israel during this time.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>A region in Israel where Micah lived, representing the broader context of Israel's tribal society without centralized leadership.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/levite.htm">Levite</a></b><br>A young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah who becomes a personal priest for Micah, highlighting the misuse of religious roles and the lack of adherence to God's law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of God's chosen people, who during this period, lacked a central authority and were often led astray by their own desires and interpretations of right and wrong.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry.htm">Idolatry</a></b><br>The event of Micah creating a shrine and idols, which signifies the spiritual decline and moral relativism in Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_moral_relativism.htm">The Danger of Moral Relativism</a></b><br>Without a standard of truth, society falls into chaos. <a href="/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a> illustrates the consequences of everyone doing what is right in their own eyes, leading to spiritual and moral decay.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_need_for_godly_leadership.htm">The Need for Godly Leadership</a></b><br>The absence of a king in Israel points to the need for godly leadership.
