Iron chariots were formidable in ancient warfare, providing speed and protection. This detail emphasizes the daunting challenge faced by the Israelites, who lacked such advanced weaponry. The number "nine hundred" signifies a large and intimidating force, underscoring the power of the Canaanite army. This sets the stage for a miraculous victory by God, as humanly speaking, the Israelites were outmatched.<p><b>and all the men with him</b><br>Sisera's summoning of "all the men with him" indicates a full mobilization of his forces, suggesting the seriousness of the threat posed by the Israelites under Deborah and Barak. This comprehensive gathering of troops reflects the strategic importance of the battle and Sisera's confidence in his military might. It also highlights the unity and organization of the Canaanite forces, contrasting with the often fragmented tribes of Israel.<p><b>from Harosheth-hagoyim</b><br>Harosheth-hagoyim is identified as Sisera's base of operations. The name suggests a location associated with Gentiles or non-Israelite peoples, indicating a center of Canaanite power. Archaeological evidence points to a site in the northern part of Israel, possibly near the modern-day Kishon River. This location served as a strategic military hub, allowing Sisera to control the surrounding region and project power.<p><b>to the River Kishon</b><br>The River Kishon is a significant geographical feature in the narrative. It runs through the Jezreel Valley, a fertile and strategically important area in ancient Israel. The river's mention foreshadows the role it will play in the battle, as it becomes a tool of divine intervention. In the subsequent verses, God uses the river to defeat Sisera's forces, turning the natural landscape into an instrument of deliverance for Israel. This event echoes other biblical instances where God uses nature to achieve His purposes, such as the parting of the Red Sea.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sisera.htm">Sisera</a></b><br>The commander of the Canaanite army under King Jabin of Hazor.
