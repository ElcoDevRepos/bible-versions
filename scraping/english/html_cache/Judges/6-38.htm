It underscores the reliability of God's word and His willingness to confirm His promises. This moment is a testament to God's patience and understanding of human doubt, as seen in other biblical narratives where God provides signs, such as with Moses and the burning bush (Exodus 3).<p><b>When Gideon arose the next morning,</b><br>Gideon's actions take place in the early morning, a time often associated with new beginnings and divine encounters in Scripture. The morning signifies a fresh start and the fulfillment of God's promises, reminiscent of the resurrection of Christ, which also occurred at dawn (<a href="/matthew/28.htm">Matthew 28:1</a>).<p><b>he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew&#8212;</b><br>The fleece, a piece of wool, serves as a tangible medium for God's sign. Wool is significant in biblical symbolism, often representing purity and sacrifice, as seen in the sacrificial system. The act of squeezing and wringing out the dew demonstrates the physical manifestation of God's power and assurance, similar to the tangible signs given to other biblical figures like Elijah with the rain (<a href="/1_kings/18-41.htm">1 Kings 18:41-45</a>).<p><b>a bowlful of water.</b><br>The abundance of water collected in the bowl signifies the overflowing nature of God's provision and confirmation. Water in Scripture often symbolizes life, cleansing, and the Holy Spirit, as seen in Jesus' conversation with the Samaritan woman (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>). This abundance prefigures the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the living water offered by Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

The phrase echoes back to Gideon&#8217;s request in <a href="/judges/6-37.htm">Judges 6:37</a>, underscoring that God fulfilled exactly what Gideon had asked for, with no delay or hesitation (cf. <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-29.htm">1 Samuel 15:29</a>).<p>&#8211; It highlights the reliability of the Lord&#8217;s word; when He promises a sign, He brings it to pass (cf. <a href="/exodus/4-1.htm">Exodus 4:1&#8211;9</a> where God gives signs to Moses; <a href="/2_kings/20-8.htm">2 Kings 20:8&#8211;11</a> with Hezekiah&#8217;s sign).<p>&#8211; The text invites confidence: if God kept His word to Gideon in a field at night, He will keep His word to us in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When Gideon arose the next morning</b><p>&#8211; Gideon&#8217;s rising &#8220;the next morning&#8221; shows eager anticipation and obedience (cf. <a href="/judges/6-27.htm">Judges 6:27</a> when he acted &#8220;that night&#8221;).<p>&#8211; Morning symbolizes new mercies (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22&#8211;23</a>) and fresh revelation; Gideon steps into daylight to witness God&#8217;s faithfulness tangibly.<p>&#8211; The detail grounds the narrative in real time and space, emphasizing historicity rather than myth (cf. <a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a> describing exact timing of the Jordan crossing).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He squeezed the fleece</b><p>&#8211; Gideon applies a simple, verifiable test&#8212;something anyone could replicate&#8212;underscoring the physical reality of the miracle (cf. <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>, &#8220;what our hands have touched&#8221;).<p>&#8211; The fleece belonged to Gideon; God meets him in his ordinary belongings, reminding us that He uses everyday objects for extraordinary confirmation (cf. <a href="/2_kings/4-2.htm">2 Kings 4:2</a> with the widow&#8217;s oil).<p>&#8211; By handling the fleece himself, Gideon personally engages with God&#8217;s sign, strengthening his faith for the coming battle (<a href="/judges/7-9.htm">Judges 7:9&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and wrung out the dew&#8212;a bowlful of water</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;A bowlful&#8221; (some translations say &#8220;a full bowl&#8221;) stresses abundance; the sign wasn&#8217;t marginal moisture but undeniable overflow (cf. <a href="/john/2-7.htm">John 2:7&#8211;10</a> where water becomes wine in abundance).<p>&#8211; Dew normally disperses evenly, so a drenched fleece on dry ground breaks natural expectations, pointing to divine intervention (<a href="/job/38-12.htm">Job 38:12&#8211;13, 28</a>).<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s patience shines: He accommodates Gideon&#8217;s need without rebuke, revealing His fatherly heart (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13&#8211;14</a>; <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p>&#8211; The overflowing water foreshadows the complete victory and provision God will give Israel through Gideon (<a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/6-38.htm">Judges 6:38</a> shows the Lord answering Gideon&#8217;s request with precise, abundant proof. Overnight God saturates the fleece while keeping the ground dry, confirming His call on Gideon&#8217;s life and demonstrating that He rules over creation itself. The verse reassures believers that God gladly strengthens faltering faith, responds faithfully to sincere requests, and provides unmistakable evidence of His presence when His people step forward in obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">A bowl full of water.</span>--The word used for bowl is <span class= "ital">sephel, </span>as in <a href="/judges/5-25.htm" title="He asked water, and she gave him milk;
