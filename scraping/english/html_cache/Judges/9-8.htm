The use of trees in this parable is symbolic, representing the leaders or people of Israel. The act of anointing a king reflects the desire for centralized leadership, a theme that recurs throughout Israel's history, culminating in the anointing of Saul as the first king. The parable serves as a critique of Abimelech's illegitimate kingship, highlighting the dangers of self-appointed leadership. The imagery of trees seeking a king underscores the unnaturalness of their quest, as trees do not require a king, just as Israel was meant to be led by God rather than a human monarch.<p><b>They said to the olive tree, &#8216;Reign over us.&#8217;</b><br>The olive tree is a significant symbol in the Bible, often representing peace, prosperity, and the presence of the Holy Spirit. It was a valuable resource in ancient Israel, providing oil for anointing, cooking, and lighting. By asking the olive tree to reign, the parable suggests that the people sought a leader who could bring prosperity and blessing. However, the olive tree's refusal in the subsequent verses highlights the idea that those who are truly valuable and productive may not seek or accept positions of power. This reflects the biblical principle that true leadership is characterized by service and humility, as exemplified by Jesus Christ, who came not to be served but to serve.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_trees.htm">The Trees</a></b><br>Symbolic representation of the people of Shechem seeking a leader or king.

Jotham, the lone surviving brother, climbs Mount Gerizim and tells a parable about trees choosing a ruler. His story exposes the hollowness of Abimelech&#8217;s kingship and warns those who embraced it, echoing earlier cautions against ungodly leadership (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/8-10.htm">1 Samuel 8:10-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;One day&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The phrase signals an historical anchor&#8212;Jotham speaks on a real day, to real listeners, about real consequences (<a href="/judges/9-7.htm">Judges 9:7</a>).<p>&#8226; It also works as a literary device, inviting hearers to picture an unfolding tale much like Nathan&#8217;s parable to David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; By starting &#8220;one day,&#8221; Jotham stresses that swift decisions can set a nation&#8217;s course for years, a truth Proverbs frequently underlines (<a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>; 16:12).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;the trees set out to anoint a king for themselves&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The trees symbolize Israel; seeking &#8220;a king for themselves&#8221; mirrors the people&#8217;s later cry, &#8220;Now appoint a king to judge us like all the other nations&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>).<p>&#8226; They move first, not God. Scripture warns against self-chosen authority that ignores divine appointment (<a href="/hosea/8-4.htm">Hosea 8:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;for themselves&#8221; highlights self-interest over covenant faithfulness&#8212;contrast Israel under Moses, who waited for God&#8217;s chosen leader (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;They said to the olive tree, &#8216;Reign over us.&#8217;&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The olive tree represents a worthy, fruitful candidate&#8212;olive oil in Scripture signifies blessing, light, and consecration (<a href="/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-11.htm">Zechariah 4:11-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Approaching the olive tree first implies Israel knew better options existed than Abimelech, just as they later recognized David&#8217;s quality over Saul&#8217;s (<a href="/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet even good symbols refuse kingship in this parable (v.9), underscoring that the real issue is the people&#8217;s misguided demand, not the candidate&#8217;s ability.<p>&#8226; The request, &#8220;Reign over us,&#8221; reveals hearts ready to trade God&#8217;s direct rule for human oversight, a pattern repeated from the wilderness onward (<a href="/numbers/14-4.htm">Numbers 14:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8</a> opens Jotham&#8217;s parable with a picture of trees&#8212;Israel&#8212;deciding on their own to crown a king. By spotlighting the initiative (&#8220;one day&#8221;), the motive (&#8220;for themselves&#8221;), and the approach to a fruitful olive tree, the verse exposes the folly of human self-rule divorced from God&#8217;s leading. It reminds readers, then and now, that true leadership is received from the Lord, not seized by popular demand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">The trees went forth.</span>--As in this chapter we have the first Israelite "king" and the first massacre of brethren, so here we have the first fable. Fables are extremely popular in the East, where they are often current, under the name of the slave-philosopher Lokman, the counterpart of the Greek 'sop. But though there are many apologues and parables in Scripture (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in the Old Testament, "the ewe lamb," <a href="/context/2_samuel/12-1.htm" title="And the LORD sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.">2Samuel 12:1-4</a>; Psalms 80; <a href="/context/isaiah/5-1.htm" title="Now will I sing to my well beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My well beloved has a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:">Isaiah 5:1-6</a>, &c), there is only one other "fable," and that is one closely akin to this (<a href="/2_kings/14-9.htm" title="And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and stepped down the thistle.">2Kings 14:9</a>). St. Paul, however, in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/12-14.htm" title="For the body is not one member, but many.">1Corinthians 12:14-19</a>, evidently refers to the ancient fable of Menenius Agrippa, about the belly and the members (Liv. 2:30). A "fable" is a fanciful story, to inculcate prudential morality. In the Bible "trees" seem to be more favourite <span class= "ital">dramatis person? </span>than the talking birds and beasts of other nations. "Went forth" is the emphatic phrase "going, they went." The scenery immediately around Jotham would furnish the most striking illustration of his words, for it is more umbrageous than any other in Palestine, and Shechem seems to rise out of a sea of living verdure. The aptitude for keen and proverbial speech seems to have been hereditary in his family (Joash, <a href="/judges/6-31.htm" title="And Joash said to all that stood against him, Will you plead for Baal? will you save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one has cast down his altar.">Judges 6:31</a>; Gideon, <a href="/judges/8-2.htm" title="And he said to them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?">Judges 8:2</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The trees</span>, etc. This is the earliest example of a <span class="accented">fable</span> in Scripture; indeed the only one except that in <a href="/2_kings/14-9.htm">2 Kings 14:9</a>. It is remarked that in the Indian and Greek fables the animals are the <span class="accented">dramatis personae</span>, the fox, the lion, the ass, etc.; whereas in the only two specimens of Hebrew fable remaining to us, the members of the vegetable kingdom, the olive, the fig, the vine, the bramble, the cedar, the thistle, are the actors and speakers. The <span class="accented">parable</span>, of which <a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a> is a beautiful example, is quite different in its structure. Like the inimitable parables of our Saviour in the New Testament, it sets forth Divine troth under an image, but the image and all its parts are in strict accordance with nature. In the Scripture <span class="accented">allegory</span> real persons and their actions prefigure the actions and the persons which they are intended to represent (see <a href="/matthew/12-39.htm">Matthew 12:39, 40</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-21.htm">Galatians 4:21-31</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-19.htm">Hebrews 11:19</a>). Allegorical personages may, however, be fictitious, as in the 'Pilgrim's Progress.' The general meaning of this fable is clear. The trees worthy to reign for their intrinsic excellence refused the proffered kingdom one after another. The vilest and most unworthy accepted it. The result would be that a fire would burst out from the despicable bramble, and set fire to the lofty cedar tree. Thus Gideon refused the kingdom, and his sons had virtually refused it likewise. The base-born Abimelech had accepted it, and the result would be a deadly strife, which would destroy both the ungrateful subjects and the unworthy ruler. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/9-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">One day the trees</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1461;&#1510;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;&#7779;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
