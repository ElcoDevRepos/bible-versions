The absence of a king signifies a lack of centralized leadership and authority. This period is marked by a cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance, as described throughout the Book of Judges. The lack of a king also highlights Israel's failure to recognize God as their ultimate ruler, as He was intended to be their King (<a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>). The longing for a human king foreshadows the eventual anointing of Saul and later David, who is a type of Christ as the shepherd king.<p><b>everyone did what was right in his own eyes.</b><br>This phrase underscores the moral and spiritual chaos prevalent during the time. Without a king or centralized authority, moral relativism prevailed, leading to societal disorder and idolatry. This reflects the human tendency to stray from God's commandments when left to personal judgment, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21-2.htm">Proverbs 21:2</a>, which states, "Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but the LORD weighs the heart." The phrase also serves as a warning against the dangers of subjective morality and the need for divine guidance. It points to the ultimate need for a righteous king, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who provides the perfect example of living according to God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of God's chosen people, who during this period were a confederation of tribes rather than a unified kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judges.htm">Judges</a></b><br>Leaders raised by God to deliver Israel from oppression and lead them, though not in a centralized or consistent manner.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribal_confederation.htm">Tribal Confederation</a></b><br>The twelve tribes of Israel, each operating semi-independently, often leading to disunity and moral chaos.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moral_relativism.htm">Moral Relativism</a></b><br>The prevailing attitude during this time, where individuals determined their own standards of right and wrong.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/absence_of_a_king.htm">Absence of a King</a></b><br>The lack of centralized leadership, which contributed to the moral and social chaos described in the book of Judges.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_moral_relativism.htm">The Danger of Moral Relativism</a></b><br>Without a standard of truth, society descends into chaos.
