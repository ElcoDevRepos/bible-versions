The name means "Let Baal contend," indicating a challenge to the Canaanite god Baal. This renaming signifies Gideon's role as a leader who opposes idolatry and stands for the worship of Yahweh. The act of renaming is common in the Bible, often reflecting a change in character or mission, similar to Abram becoming Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>) or Simon becoming Peter (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>).<p><b>that is to say, &#8220;Let Baal contend with him,&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the challenge posed to Baal, a prominent deity in Canaanite religion, often associated with fertility and storms. By tearing down Baal's altar, Gideon directly confronts the false god, inviting Baal to defend his own honor. This reflects the biblical theme of the impotence of idols compared to the power of the true God, as seen in Elijah's confrontation with the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-20.htm">1 Kings 18:20-40</a>).<p><b>because he had torn down Baal&#8217;s altar</b><br>Gideon's act of tearing down the altar is a bold declaration against idolatry, aligning with the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This action is a physical manifestation of spiritual reformation, a common theme in the Old Testament where leaders like Hezekiah and Josiah also destroy idols to restore true worship (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>, <a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4-20</a>). Archaeological evidence of Canaanite altars and high places provides context for the prevalence of such worship practices in ancient Israel. Gideon's actions foreshadow Christ's cleansing of the temple (<a href="/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13-16</a>), symbolizing the removal of corruption and the restoration of true worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

language marks decisive turning points: David facing Goliath &#8220;this day&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-46.htm">1 Samuel 17:46</a>) and Elijah&#8217;s Mount Carmel showdown &#8220;at the time of the evening sacrifice&#8221;

immediately ties Gideon to a confrontation with idolatry, foreshadowing the larger battle he will lead against Midian (<a href="/bsb/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>).<p>- Receiving the name from the townspeople&#8212;even those who first wanted to execute him&#8212;demonstrates how God can turn hostility into testimony (cf. <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a> &#8220;You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that is to say</b><p>- Scripture itself pauses to interpret the name, ensuring no one misses the point.<p>- Other places where the Bible explains a name on the spot include &#8220;Immanuel&#8212;God with us&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>) and &#8220;Cephas, which means Peter&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>).<p>- This built-in commentary affirms the clarity and sufficiency of God&#8217;s Word;

nothing happens to Gideon (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9&#8211;20</a>).<p>- <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a> echoes the same confidence centuries later: &#8220;If God is for us, who can be against us?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because he had torn down Baal&#8217;s altar</b><p>- Gideon&#8217;s obedience in the secret night hours (<a href="/judges/6-27.htm">Judges 6:27</a>) becomes public evidence of true repentance and covenant faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-5.htm">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>).<p>- The broken altar exposes the spiritual compromise that had invited Midianite oppression in the first place (<a href="/judges/6-1.htm">Judges 6:1</a>).<p>- New Testament believers are likewise called to tear down &#8220;strongholds&#8221;

The freshly minted name &#8220;Jerubbaal&#8221; becomes a standing reminder that idols are powerless and the Lord alone defends His servants. What began as a death sentence is flipped into a testimony of God&#8217;s supremacy, setting the stage for Israel&#8217;s deliverance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">He called him.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">people called him, he got the name of. </span>The phrase is impersonal.

If in <a href="/2_samuel/11-21.htm" title="Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone on him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went you near the wall? then say you, Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.">2Samuel 11:21</a> we find the name <span class= "ital">Jerubbesheth, </span>this is only due to the fondness of the Jews for avoiding the names of idols, and changing them into terms of insult. It was thus that they literally interpreted the law of <a href="/exodus/23-13.htm" title="And in all things that I have said to you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of your mouth.">Exodus 23:13</a> (comp. <a href="/joshua/23-7.htm" title="That you come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves to them:">Joshua 23:7</a>). It was a part of that <span class= "ital">contumelia numinum </span>with which the ancients charged them (Plin. xiii. 9). I have adduced other instances in <span class= "ital">Language and Languages, </span>p. 232. (Longmans.) Bosheth means "shame," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"that shameful thing," and was a term of scorn for Baal (<a href="/hosea/9-10.htm" title="I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at her first time: but they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves to that shame; and their abominations were according as they loved.">Hosea 9:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/11-13.htm" title="For according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.">Jeremiah 11:13</a>). We have two other instances of this change in the case of the sons of Saul. Whether from a faithless syncretism, or a tendency to downright apostasy, he called one of his sons Esh-baal, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"man of Baal," and another Merib-baal (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/8-33.htm" title="And Ner begat Kish, and Kish begat Saul, and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.">1Chronicles 8:33-34</a>); but the Jews angrily and contemptuously changed these names into Ishbosheth and Mephibosheth (<a href="/2_samuel/2-10.htm" title="Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.">2Samuel 2:10</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/4-4.htm" title="And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.">2Samuel 4:4</a>). Ewald, however, and others have conjectured that both Baal and Bosheth may, at one time, have had more harmless associations (see especially <a href="/2_samuel/5-20.htm" title="And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD has broken forth on my enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.">2Samuel 5:20</a>), and it appears that there was a Baal among the ancestors of Saul (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-30.htm" title="And his firstborn son Abdon, and Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Nadab,">1Chronicles 8:30</a>). The LXX. write the name Hierobalos; and Eusebius (Praep. Evang. i. 9), quoting from Philo Byblius, tells us that a Gentile historian named Sanchoniatho, of Berytus, whom he praises for his accuracy in Jewish history and geography, had received assistance "from Hierombalos, the priest of the god Iao."
