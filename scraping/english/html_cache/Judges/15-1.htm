This timing is significant as it was a period of celebration and abundance, often associated with the Feast of Weeks (Shavuot), a time of thanksgiving for the harvest. The mention of the wheat harvest sets the stage for the events that follow, indicating a time of agricultural prosperity and community activity. This context highlights the contrast between the expected joy of the season and the personal conflict Samson faces.<p><b>Samson took a young goat</b><br>Bringing a young goat was a customary gift, symbolizing peace and goodwill. It was common in ancient Near Eastern cultures to present such gifts when visiting family or seeking reconciliation. This gesture by Samson suggests his intention to make amends or to reaffirm his relationship with his wife, despite previous conflicts. The young goat as a gift also reflects the agrarian lifestyle and the importance of livestock in the economy and social customs of the time.<p><b>and went to visit his wife</b><br>Samson's visit to his wife indicates his desire to resume marital relations, which had been disrupted. In the context of <a href="/judges/14.htm">Judges 14</a>, Samson's wife had been given to another man by her father, which Samson was unaware of. This visit is an attempt to restore his marriage, highlighting the personal and familial tensions that are central to the narrative. The act of visiting one's wife also underscores the patriarchal structure of ancient Israelite society, where the husband had the right to claim his wife.<p><b>&#8220;I want to go to my wife in her room,&#8221; he said</b><br>Samson's request to go to his wife's room signifies his intention to reestablish intimacy and conjugal rights. The phrase reflects the private nature of marital relationships and the expectation of privacy within the household. This request also underscores the personal nature of Samson's mission, driven by his emotional and physical desires. The mention of "her room" indicates the domestic setting and the cultural norms surrounding marriage and family life in ancient Israel.<p><b>But her father would not let him enter</b><br>The refusal by the father-in-law to let Samson enter reveals the underlying conflict and betrayal. In <a href="/judges/14.htm">Judges 14</a>, Samson's wife was given to another man, which was a significant breach of trust and social custom. This act of barring Samson highlights the tension between personal relationships and familial obligations. It also sets the stage for the ensuing conflict and Samson's subsequent actions. The father's decision reflects the complex dynamics of honor, shame, and familial authority in the ancient Near Eastern context.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his extraordinary strength, which was a gift from God.

<a href="/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>), underscoring the irony that conflict, not celebration, is about to unfold.<p>&#8226; Samson&#8217;s timing highlights God&#8217;s sovereignty&#8212;events that seem ordinary (harvest) become the stage for divine purposes (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Samson took a young goat</b><p>&#8226; A young goat was a customary gift of goodwill or affection (<a href="/genesis/38-17.htm">Genesis 38:17</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-20.htm">1 Samuel 16:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Samson brings tangible proof of reconciliatory intent after the earlier fallout with the Philistines (<a href="/judges/14-19.htm">Judges 14:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; The gift signals peace, yet God will turn this attempt at peace into a confrontation that advances Israel&#8217;s deliverance (<a href="/judges/15-3.htm">Judges 15:3&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He went to visit his wife</b><p>&#8226;

in Israel, a husband visiting his bride in her family home was normal until full household establishment (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/20-7.htm">Deuteronomy 20:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The setting underscores Samson&#8217;s personal desire versus God&#8217;s larger mission; Samson seeks domestic resolution, but God will use his journey for national deliverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I want to go to my wife in her room,&#8221; he said</b><p>&#8226; Samson claims legitimate conjugal rights; the &#8220;room&#8221; (inner chamber) is private space reserved for the husband (Songs 1:4).<p>&#8226; His straightforward request contrasts with Philistine treachery; transparency meets deceit.<p>&#8226; The statement also spotlights covenant versus convenience: Samson views the marriage as binding (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>), while the Philistines treat it as expendable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But her father would not let him enter</b><p>&#8226; Refusal exposes a broken agreement; the bride&#8217;s father had already given her to Samson&#8217;s companion (<a href="/judges/14-20.htm">Judges 14:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene prefigures further rejection: God&#8217;s appointed deliverer is barred by Philistines, just as Israel&#8217;s Deliverer would later be refused by His own (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Human obstruction cannot thwart God&#8217;s plan; the denial sparks the chain of events leading to Samson&#8217;s exploits (<a href="/judges/15-4.htm">Judges 15:4&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/15-1.htm">Judges 15:1</a> depicts Samson returning during the joyous wheat harvest with a peace offering, earnestly intending to consummate his marriage. His gift and request are honorable, yet his father-in-law&#8217;s refusal reveals Philistine unfaithfulness and ignites the next phase of God&#8217;s deliverance through Samson.
