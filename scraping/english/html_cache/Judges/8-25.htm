The context here is Gideon's request for the gold earrings taken as plunder from the Midianites. The Israelites' readiness to give can be seen as a sign of respect and gratitude towards Gideon, who had delivered them from oppression. This willingness to give is reminiscent of the Israelites' contributions for the building of the Tabernacle in <a href="/exodus/35-21.htm">Exodus 35:21-29</a>, where the people gave freely and generously. It also highlights a communal spirit and unity among the people, which is significant in the narrative of Judges, a time often marked by division and disobedience.<p><b>So they spread out a garment,</b><br>The act of spreading out a garment serves as a practical method for collecting the earrings. In ancient times, garments were often used for various purposes beyond clothing, such as carrying goods or serving as makeshift containers. This imagery of spreading out a garment can also be seen in other biblical contexts, such as in <a href="/2_kings/9-13.htm">2 Kings 9:13</a>, where garments are spread under Jehu as a sign of respect and allegiance. The use of a garment here underscores the communal and organized nature of the collection process.<p><b>and each man threw an earring from his plunder onto it.</b><br>The earrings mentioned were likely part of the spoils taken from the defeated Midianites, who were known for wearing gold ornaments. This act of each man contributing an earring signifies individual participation in a collective effort. It reflects the cultural practice of sharing spoils of war, which was common in ancient Near Eastern societies. The earrings, being made of gold, also symbolize wealth and the tangible rewards of victory. This collection of gold would later be used by Gideon to create an ephod, which unfortunately became a snare to him and his family, as noted in <a href="/judges/8-27.htm">Judges 8:27</a>. This serves as a cautionary tale about the potential for material wealth to lead to idolatry and spiritual downfall, echoing the warnings found throughout Scripture about the dangers of wealth and idolatry, such as in <a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9-10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel who led the Israelites to victory over the Midianites.

The verse invites us to examine whether our giving honors the Deliverer (God) or merely the human instrument.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So they spread out a garment</b><p>&#8226; A large cloak becomes the makeshift &#8220;offering plate,&#8221; practical yet symbolic of honor. Similar gestures&#8212;spreading garments before a leader&#8212;mark moments of acclaim (<a href="/2_kings/9-13.htm">2 Kings 9:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-8.htm">Matthew 21:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The act is public. Everyone can see who is participating, reinforcing unity but also applying subtle social pressure. Unlike the prescribed, private offerings of Leviticus, this collection centers on Gideon&#8217;s personal request, not divine command.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and each man threw an earring from his plunder onto it</b><p>&#8226; Gold earrings were abundant because the defeated Midianites &#8220;were Ishmaelites&#8221; (<a href="/judges/8-24.htm">Judges 8:24</a>). By handing over personal trophies of war, the men transfer glory&#8212;and wealth&#8212;from themselves to Gideon.<p>&#8226; The scene echoes <a href="/exodus/32-2.htm">Exodus 32:2-3</a>, where earrings became the raw material for the golden calf. History is repeating: surrendered gold, good intentions, looming idolatry.<p>&#8226; Individual participation&#8212;&#8220;each man&#8221;&#8212;shows corporate responsibility. When Gideon later fashions an ephod that &#8220;became a snare&#8221; (<a href="/judges/8-27.htm">Judges 8:27</a>), no one can claim innocence; they all financed it. Compare <a href="/judges/17-3.htm">Judges 17:3-5</a>, where household silver funds another idol.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/8-25.htm">Judges 8:25</a> captures a well-meant but spiritually risky offering. The people gladly part with their gold, honoring Gideon for God&#8217;s victory. A cloak on the ground gathers the gifts, a visible symbol of collective devotion. Yet the same generosity paves the way for future idolatry, reminding us that even cheerful giving must stay anchored to God&#8217;s clear commands, lest our blessings become snares.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">We will willingly give.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">giving, we will give.</span><p><span class= "bld">They spread.</span>--Perhaps the true reading should be "<span class= "ital">he </span>spread," as in the LXX.
