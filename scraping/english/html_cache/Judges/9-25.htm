It held historical importance as a center of covenant renewal (Joshua 24) and was a city of refuge (<a href="/joshua/21-21.htm">Joshua 21:21</a>). The leaders, or "lords," of Shechem were likely influential figures or elders who governed the city. Their decision to set an ambush reflects internal strife and dissatisfaction with Abimelech's rule, highlighting the political instability of the time.<br><br>Set up an ambush: This act of rebellion indicates a breach of trust and alliance. Ambushes were common military tactics in ancient warfare, often used to surprise and overpower an enemy. The leaders' choice to ambush Abimelech suggests a strategic move to weaken his power and possibly incite a larger revolt.<br><br>Against Abimelech: Abimelech, the son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal), had declared himself king after the death of his father, despite Israel not having a monarchy at that time. His rule was marked by violence and treachery, including the murder of his seventy brothers (<a href="/judges/9-5.htm">Judges 9:5</a>). The ambush against him reflects the consequences of his ruthless rise to power and the divine retribution for his actions.<br><br>On the hilltops: The geographical setting of the hilltops provided a strategic advantage for the ambushers, offering a vantage point to observe and attack unsuspecting travelers. The terrain of Shechem, surrounded by hills, made it an ideal location for such tactics. This setting also symbolizes the high places often associated with rebellion and idolatry in Israel's history.<p><b>And they robbed all who passed by them on the road</b><br>And they robbed: The act of robbery indicates lawlessness and a breakdown of social order under Abimelech's rule. It reflects the moral decay and chaos that ensued when leaders acted out of self-interest rather than justice and righteousness.<br><br>All who passed by them on the road: The road was likely a major trade route, essential for commerce and communication. By robbing travelers, the leaders of Shechem disrupted economic activity and spread fear, further destabilizing the region. This action also highlights the broader impact of Abimelech's tyrannical leadership on the community.<p><b>So this was reported to Abimelech</b><br>So this was reported: The report reaching Abimelech suggests that there were still those loyal to him or fearful of his retribution. It underscores the tension and division within the region, as well as the challenges of maintaining control over a rebellious populace.<br><br>To Abimelech: The notification to Abimelech sets the stage for the subsequent conflict and his eventual downfall. It serves as a turning point in the narrative, where Abimelech's oppressive rule begins to unravel, fulfilling the divine justice for his earlier crimes. This moment foreshadows the ultimate judgment and the principle that those who live by violence often fall by it.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal) and a concubine from Shechem.

confront Abimelech openly. <a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a> states, &#8220;The wicked flee when no one pursues.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The hills once symbolized blessing (<a

The same Shechemite leaders who empowered Abimelech now betray him, fulfilling God&#8217;s word that wicked partnerships self-destruct. Their hilltop ambush and roadside robbery showcase the collateral damage of sin, while the swift exposure of their plot highlights divine justice at work. The verse teaches that human schemes cannot outmaneuver the Lord, that sin inevitably harms the innocent, and that God faithfully repays violence with violence until His righteousness prevails.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Set liers in wait for him.</span>--The "for him" does not necessarily mean "to seize him," but to his disadvantage. The disaffection began to show itself, as has so often been the case in Palestine from the days of Saul to those of Herod, by the rise of brigandage, rendering all government precarious, and providing a refuge tor all dangerous and discontented spirits. Josephus says that Abimelech was expelled from Shechem, and even from the tribe of Ephraim (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 1, ? 3).<p><span class= "bld">In the top of the mountains.</span>--Especially Ebal and Gerizim.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The men of Shechem</span>, etc. The narrative now gives the details of that "treacherous dealing" on the part of the Shechemites which was spoken of in the gross in ver. 23. Their disaffection first showed itself in acts of brigandage "against the peace of their lord the king," to use the language of our own mediaeval lawyers. The road to Shechem was no longer safe; lawless freebooters, in defiance of Abimelech's authority, stopped and robbed all travellers that passed that way, probably including Abimelech's own officers and servants. <span class="cmt_word">For him</span>.
