Gideon, a judge chosen by God, is often seen as a type of Christ, as he delivers Israel from oppression. This communication underscores the importance of divine instruction in leadership and decision-making.<p><b>You have too many men for Me to deliver Midian into their hands</b><br>God's statement here is a strategic move to ensure that the victory over the Midianites is attributed to divine intervention rather than human strength. This reflects a recurring biblical theme where God uses the weak or the few to accomplish His purposes, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>. The reduction of Gideon's army serves to magnify God's power and sovereignty.<p><b>lest Israel glorify themselves over Me</b><br>This phrase warns against the sin of pride and self-reliance. Throughout the Old Testament, Israel is reminded to attribute their successes to God, not to their own abilities (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-17.htm">Deuteronomy 8:17-18</a>). This serves as a cautionary note against idolatry of self, which is a recurring issue for Israel and humanity at large.<p><b>saying, &#8216;My own hand has saved me.&#8217;</b><br>The potential for Israel to claim credit for their deliverance highlights the human tendency to forget God's role in their victories. This phrase serves as a reminder of the necessity of humility and recognition of God's providence.

This shows that victory begins with divine direction, not human planning (cf. <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7&#8211;10</a>, where God speaks first to Moses; <a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>, where the Lord calls Samuel). Gideon does not hatch a strategy and ask God to bless it; instead, he listens. When God speaks, His authority is absolute and His purposes certain (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The repeated phrase &#8220;the LORD said&#8221; throughout Judges underscores God&#8217;s ongoing involvement in Israel&#8217;s history despite their cycles of rebellion (<a href="/judges/2-16.htm">Judges 2:16</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s word is the decisive factor that moves events forward&#8212;echoed later when the &#8220;word of the LORD&#8221; guides prophets and apostles alike (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4</a>; <a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have too many men</b><p>At first glance, more soldiers look like an advantage, yet God identifies the surplus as a problem. Numbers that seem impressive to humans can actually hinder faith. <a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a> reminds us, &#8220;No king is saved by his vast army; no warrior is delivered by great strength&#8221;. By flagging the oversized force, God begins to reshape Gideon&#8217;s perspective from counting heads to trusting His hand.<p>&#8226; Human resources often masquerade as security. <a href="/deuteronomy/8-17.htm">Deuteronomy 8:17</a> warns against saying, &#8220;My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, God chooses unconventional means&#8212;David&#8217;s sling (<a href="/1_samuel/17-40.htm">1 Samuel 17:40</a>) or five loaves and two fish (<a href="/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9</a>)&#8212;so that reliance rests on Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for Me to deliver Midian into their hands</b><p>The phrase highlights God as the true warrior. Israel&#8217;s victory is not self-manufactured; it is &#8220;the LORD who delivers&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>). Gideon&#8217;s army is merely the instrument. By setting the stage this way, God emphasizes His sovereignty over battle outcomes (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>: &#8220;Victory rests with the LORD&#8221;).<p>&#8226; In <a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>, Jahaziel told Jehoshaphat, &#8220;The battle is not yours, but God&#8217;s.&#8221; Gideon receives the same assurance.<p>&#8226; This deliverance continues the pattern established in <a href="/judges/6-14.htm">Judges 6:14</a>, where God said, &#8220;Go in the strength you have&#8230;Have I not sent you?&#8221; The sender guarantees success.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>lest Israel glorify themselves over Me</b><p>Pride is the lurking danger. God foresees the temptation to shift the spotlight from His grace to Israel&#8217;s prowess. <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a> cautions that &#8220;pride goes before destruction,&#8221; and God acts pre-emptively to keep Israel from that ruinous path.<p>&#8226; The entire book of Judges chronicles a cycle of deliverance followed by self-reliance and eventual downfall (<a href="/judges/2-19.htm">Judges 2:19</a>). God interrupts the cycle here by trimming the army before victory.<p>&#8226; Paul echoes this principle: &#8220;So that no one may boast in His presence&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-29.htm">1 Corinthians 1:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying, &#8216;My own hand has saved me.&#8217;</b><p>Left unchecked, Israel would rewrite the story, claiming credit for salvation. God knows the human heart (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>) and orchestrates circumstances to make such boasting impossible. The drastic reduction to 300 soldiers (<a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>) ensures that the only plausible headline after the battle will be &#8220;The LORD saved us.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/44-6.htm">Psalm 44:6&#8211;7</a> captures the intended attitude: &#8220;For I do not trust in my bow&#8230;But You give us victory over our enemies.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8&#8211;9</a> applies the same truth spiritually: salvation is &#8220;not by works, so that no one can boast.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2</a> teaches that God deliberately strips away human props so His people rely solely on Him. He speaks, identifies the excess we trust, ensures victory is unmistakably His work, and protects us from pride that would steal His glory. The verse invites believers to rest in God&#8217;s sufficiency rather than numbers, resources, or personal strength, confident that when deliverance comes, all honor rightly returns to the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">The people that are with thee are too many for me.</span>--This must have put the faith of Gideon to a severe trial, since the Midianites were 135,000 in number (<a href="/judges/8-10.htm" title="Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.">Judges 8:10</a>), and Gideon's forces only 32,000 (<a href="/judges/7-4.htm" title="And the LORD said to Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down to the water, and I will try them for you there: and it shall be, that of whom I say to you, This shall go with you, the same shall go with you; and of whomsoever I say to you, This shall not go with you, the same shall not go.">Judges 7:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Lest Israel vaunt themselves.</span>--See <a href="/deuteronomy/8-17.htm" title="And you say in your heart, My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth.">Deuteronomy 8:17</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said</span>, etc. It must be remembered that this whole movement was essentially a religious one.
