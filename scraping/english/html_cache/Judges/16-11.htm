It highlights the ongoing dialogue between them, showcasing the tension and manipulation in their relationship. Samson's responses are part of a pattern where he toys with Delilah, reflecting his overconfidence and disregard for the danger he is in.<p><b>&#8220;If they tie me up with new ropes that have never been used,</b><br>The mention of "new ropes" suggests strength and reliability, as unused ropes would be at their strongest. This is the second deception Samson offers Delilah, following his previous false claim about being bound with fresh bowstrings. The use of ropes is significant in the biblical narrative, often symbolizing bondage or captivity, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/judges/15-13.htm">Judges 15:13</a>, where Samson is bound by the men of Judah. The emphasis on "never been used" underscores the idea of purity and untapped potential, which Samson implies is necessary to restrain him.<p><b>I will become as weak as any other man.&#8221;</b><br>Samson's statement here is a direct contrast to his Nazarite vow, which set him apart with supernatural strength. His claim of becoming "as weak as any other man" foreshadows his eventual downfall when he reveals the true source of his strength to Delilah. This phrase also highlights the theme of human frailty and the consequences of disobedience to God. Samson's strength was a gift from God, contingent upon his faithfulness to his vow, and this statement reflects his growing vulnerability and the impending loss of his divine empowerment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God tied to his Nazirite vow.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/delilah.htm">Delilah</a></b><br>A woman from the Valley of Sorek who was used by the Philistines to discover the secret of Samson's strength.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>The enemies of Israel during the time of the Judges, who sought to subdue Samson.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/valley_of_sorek.htm">Valley of Sorek</a></b><br>The location where Delilah lived and where Samson frequently visited her.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/new_ropes.htm">New Ropes</a></b><br>Symbolic of Samson's attempts to mislead Delilah about the source of his strength.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_compromise.htm">The Danger of Compromise</a></b><br>Samson's willingness to entertain Delilah's questions shows the peril of compromising one's values and commitments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_deceptive_nature_of_sin.htm">The Deceptive Nature of Sin</a></b><br>Just as Samson was deceived by Delilah, sin often presents itself in attractive forms but leads to destruction.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_spiritual_discernment.htm">The Importance of Spiritual Discernment</a></b><br>Samson's lack of discernment in his relationship with Delilah serves as a warning to seek God's wisdom in our relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_strength_in_our_weakness.htm">God's Strength in Our Weakness</a></b><br>Despite Samson's failures, God used him to fulfill His purposes, reminding us that God can work through our weaknesses.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_the_source_of_our_strength.htm">Guarding the Source of Our Strength</a></b><br>Samson's strength was tied to his Nazirite vow; similarly, we must guard our spiritual commitments and relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Judges_16_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Judges 16:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Samson_s_self-reliance_in_Judges_16_11.htm">How does Judges 16:11 illustrate Samson's trust in his own strength?

His words are a conscious answer, not an off-hand remark.<p>- Already twice (<a href="/judges/16-6.htm">Judges 16:6-10</a>) Delilah has pressed him for the secret of his strength; each time he has misled her. This third response shows a continued willingness to toy with danger while still keeping the real truth hidden.<p>- Cross reference: <a href="/proverbs/13-3.htm">Proverbs 13:3</a>, &#8220;He who guards his mouth protects his life, but the one who opens his lips invites ruin&#8221;. Samson&#8217;s careless speech contrasts sharply with the wisdom urged elsewhere in Scripture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If they tie me up with new ropes</b><p>- Samson chooses &#8220;new ropes&#8221; as the next phony condition. Earlier, the men of Judah had bound him with &#8220;two new ropes&#8221; (<a href="/judges/15-13.htm">Judges 15:13</a>); he snapped those easily. By repeating the same material, Samson proves that he remembers the past yet assumes Delilah will not.<p>- The statement hints that Samson sees his own deliverance as automatic, taking God&#8217;s empowerment for granted (<a href="/judges/15-14.htm">Judges 15:14-15</a>).<p>- Cross reference: <a href="/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1-2</a> warns against assuming continued grace while persisting in reckless behavior: &#8220;Shall we continue in sin so that grace may increase? Certainly not!&#8221;. Samson is skirting that line.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that have never been used</b><p>- &#8220;Never been used&#8221; stresses freshness and supposed unbreakability. Culturally, objects set apart for a single purpose often carried special significance (<a href="/numbers/19-2.htm">Numbers 19:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-3.htm">Deuteronomy 21:3</a>).<p>- Delilah will interpret this as a legitimate vulnerability. Samson counts on God&#8217;s past miracles and assumes a mere object&#8212;new ropes&#8212;cannot hold him.<p>- Cross reference: <a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a> reminds, &#8220;No king is saved by his great army; a warrior is not delivered by his great strength.&#8221; Depending on ritual novelty rather than the Lord always fails.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will become as weak as any other man</b><p>- Samson&#8217;s claim is a lie, yet it foreshadows what will shortly happen when he reveals his Nazarite vow (<a href="/judges/16-17.htm">Judges 16:17</a>). The phrase &#8220;as weak as any other man&#8221; underscores the truth that Samson&#8217;s strength is entirely from God, not innate.<p>- His casual mention of weakness shows how lightly he holds the sacred trust placed on him from birth (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>).<p>- Cross reference: <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>, &#8220;Apart from Me you can do nothing,&#8221; echoes the principle that divine power, not human might, sustains God&#8217;s servants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Samson&#8217;s third deceptive answer to Delilah highlights a man trifling with holy gifts. He speaks carelessly, leans on God&#8217;s past deliverances, and imagines he controls the outcome. <a href="/judges/16-11.htm">Judges 16:11</a> warns believers against presuming upon grace, cherishing secret sin, and flirting with temptation. Real strength comes from humble dependence on the Lord, not from clever words or outward symbols.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">New ropes.</span>--As in <a href="/judges/15-13.htm" title="And they spoke to him, saying, No; but we will bind you fast, and deliver you into their hand: but surely we will not kill you.
