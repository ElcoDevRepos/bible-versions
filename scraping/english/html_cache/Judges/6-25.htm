The timing "on that very night" suggests a direct and personal communication from God, highlighting Gideon's role as a chosen leader. This encounter is part of a pattern where God directly intervenes in the lives of the judges to deliver Israel (<a href="/judges/2-16.htm">Judges 2:16-18</a>). It underscores the theme of divine initiative in the deliverance of His people.<p><b>Take your father&#8217;s young bull</b><br>The young bull represents a valuable asset, indicating a significant sacrifice. Bulls were often used in sacrifices and as symbols of strength and fertility. This command challenges Gideon to confront familial and cultural ties to idolatry, as his father, Joash, was involved in Baal worship. The act of taking the bull signifies a break from the past and a commitment to God's covenant.<p><b>and a second bull seven years old</b><br>The specification of a "second bull seven years old" is significant. The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible, possibly indicating the completeness of the idolatry that had taken hold of Israel. The use of two bulls may also symbolize a complete offering to God, contrasting the worship of Baal with the worship of Yahweh. This act foreshadows the complete deliverance God will bring through Gideon.<p><b>tear down your father&#8217;s altar to Baal</b><br>Baal was a Canaanite deity associated with fertility and storms, and his worship was prevalent among the Israelites during the time of the Judges. The command to tear down the altar signifies a direct confrontation with idolatry and a call to return to the worship of the one true God. This act of destruction is a physical representation of repentance and a rejection of false gods, aligning with the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p><b>and cut down the Asherah pole beside it</b><br>The Asherah pole was a wooden symbol associated with the goddess Asherah, often placed beside altars to Baal. Cutting it down represents the removal of idolatrous practices and the purification of worship. This action is a call to holiness and a return to the exclusive worship of Yahweh. The removal of the Asherah pole is symbolic of the need to eliminate all forms of idolatry, as seen in other biblical reforms (<a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

It is useless, and therefore undesirable, to speculate as to the exact manner in which the Divine intimation came to him. When God speaks it is not possible for man to mistake His voice. It was distinctly revealed to Gideon that he must be an iconoclast before he could be a deliverer.<p><span class= "bld">Even the second bullock.</span>--It has been disputed whether the true rendering is "<span class= "ital">even" </span>or "and." Ewald makes it mean "even," and explains <span class= "ital">shani </span>(second) to mean "old" (<span class= "ital">Gesch. </span>ii.498). The LXX., the Vulgate, Luther, &c, render it "<span class= "ital">and," </span>as in the margin of our version. This seems to be the right rendering; for (1) the labour of two bullocks would not be too much for the task before Gideon; (2) a bullock (<span class= "ital">shor</span>) of seven years old would hardly be called a <span class= "ital">young </span>bullock: literally, "a heifer (<span class= "ital">par</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>son of an ox."<p><span class= "bld">Of seven years old.</span>--The Chaldee renders it, "which has been fattened for seven years," and there is very possibly an allusion to the seven years of the Midianite oppression (<a href="/judges/6-1.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.">Judges 6:1</a>). The law had not prescribed any fixed age for burnt offerings. Why the bullock is called <span class= "ital">"</span>the second bullock" is very uncertain, but this minute and unexplained detail shows that we are not moving in the region of legend. The first bullock is said to belong to Joash, and we must, therefore, probably suppose that the second was Gideon's own. Possibly in this circumstance we may see an explanation of these minute directions, and the significance which they were intended to bear. The first bullock had been intended by Joash as a sacrifice to Baal, and <span class= "ital">is </span>used in the destruction of his altar; the <span class= "ital">second </span>had, perhaps, been reserved by Gideon as a sacrifice to the Lord when better times should come--a votive offering, which was being fattened for the longed-for day of deliverance. This bullock is sacrificed to Jehovah, and the fact that it, too, has been used for the destruction of the Canaanite idols is a sign to Gideon that the day for which he had hoped has come.<p><span class= "bld">Throw down.</span>--As commanded in <a href="/exodus/32-13.htm" title="Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.">Exodus 32:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-5.htm" title="But thus shall you deal with them; you shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The altar of Baal.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">of the Baal, i.e., </span>of that particular Ph?nician idol which your father worships.
