Joshua, the successor of Moses, led the Israelites into the Promised Land and oversaw the initial conquests. His leadership was pivotal in uniting the tribes and establishing them in Canaan. With his passing, the Israelites faced a leadership vacuum, highlighting the need for continued reliance on God. This period is characterized by a lack of centralized leadership, setting the stage for the cyclical pattern of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance seen throughout the Book of Judges.<p><b>the Israelites inquired of the LORD</b><br>This phrase indicates the Israelites' dependence on divine guidance, a practice rooted in their covenant relationship with God. Inquiring of the LORD often involved consulting the Urim and Thummim, sacred lots used by the high priest to discern God's will (<a href="/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>). This act of seeking God's direction underscores the importance of divine guidance in decision-making and reflects a moment of faithfulness before the recurring apostasy in Judges.<p><b>&#8220;Who will be the first to go up and fight for us against the Canaanites?&#8221;</b><br>The Canaanites were the inhabitants of the land promised to the Israelites, representing both a physical and spiritual challenge. The question reflects the ongoing struggle to fully possess the land, as commanded by God (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). This inquiry also foreshadows the tribal conflicts and the need for unity among the Israelites. The request for a leader to initiate the battle can be seen as a type of Christ, who leads His people in spiritual warfare. The struggle against the Canaanites symbolizes the Christian's battle against sin and the forces of evil, with victory assured through faith and obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel who succeeded Moses and led the Israelites into the Promised Land.
