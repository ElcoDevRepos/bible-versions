The number "hundred" signifies a small, divinely chosen group, emphasizing God's power rather than human strength. This reflects the biblical theme of God using the weak to confound the strong (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p><b>reached the outskirts of the camp</b><br>The Midianite camp was located in the Valley of Jezreel, a strategic location in ancient Israel. The Israelites' approach to the camp's outskirts signifies a tactical move, allowing them to surprise the enemy. This mirrors other biblical accounts where God leads His people to victory through unexpected means (<a href="/joshua/6-15.htm">Joshua 6:15-20</a>).<p><b>at the beginning of the middle watch</b><br>The middle watch was a period during the night, typically from 10 PM to 2 AM, when soldiers would be most vulnerable due to fatigue. This timing highlights God's strategic planning, ensuring the element of surprise. It also connects to other biblical narratives where God acts during the night (<a href="/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29-30</a>).<p><b>just after the changing of the guard</b><br>The changing of the guard was a routine military procedure, and attacking at this time would cause confusion and disarray among the Midianites. This reflects God's wisdom in using human practices to achieve His purposes, as seen in other biblical battles (<a href="/1_samuel/14-16.htm">1 Samuel 14:16-20</a>).<p><b>They blew their horns</b><br>The blowing of horns, or shofars, was a common practice in Israelite warfare, symbolizing God's presence and the call to battle. This act is reminiscent of the fall of Jericho, where the sound of trumpets preceded victory (<a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a>). It also signifies divine intervention and the proclamation of God's power.<p><b>and broke the jars that were in their hands</b><br>The breaking of jars served as a psychological tactic, creating noise and confusion. The jars likely concealed torches, and their breaking revealed the light, symbolizing the revelation of God's power and truth. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the light of the world (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), breaking through darkness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the Midianites.

"just in rousing they roused the watch." The attack took place at the moment of confusion caused by changing the watch.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The middle watch</span>. The ancient Israelites divided the night into three watches of four hours each, from sunset to sunrise, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from six p.m. to six a.m. The first watch, from six to ten, is not mentioned in the Old Testament; but we have the <span class="accented">middle</span> watch mentioned here (from ten to two), and the <span class="accented">morning watch</span> (from two till six): <a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/11-11.htm">1 Samuel 11:11</a>. According to this, Gideon's attack would have taken place soon after ten p.m., or towards eleven, the time when the sleep would be the deepest, the watchmen of the first watch having lately fallen into their first sleep. The later Israelites adopted the Roman division of the night into four watches (<a href="/matthew/14-25.htm">Matthew 14:25</a>; <a href="/mark/6-48.htm">Mark 6:48</a>; cf. <a href="/luke/12-38.htm">Luke 12:38</a>;
