The mention of singers here suggests a celebration or recounting of significant events. Singing was a common way to remember and pass down stories and history, as seen in other biblical passages like <a href="/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15:1-21</a>, where Moses and Miriam lead the Israelites in song after crossing the Red Sea. This phrase indicates a communal acknowledgment of God's deliverance and blessings, similar to the role of psalms in worship.<p><b>There they shall recount the righteous acts of the LORD</b><br>Recounting the acts of the LORD emphasizes the importance of remembering and proclaiming God's faithfulness and intervention in Israel's history. This practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>, where the psalmist recounts God's deeds to encourage faithfulness among the people. The righteous acts refer to God's deliverance of Israel from their enemies, highlighting His justice and mercy.<p><b>the righteous deeds of His villagers in Israel</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the role of ordinary Israelites in God's plan. The villagers' deeds are considered righteous because they align with God's will and contribute to the nation's deliverance. This reflects the biblical theme that God often uses humble and seemingly insignificant people to achieve His purposes, as seen in the stories of Gideon (Judges 6-8) and David (1 Samuel 16).<p><b>Then the people of the LORD went down to the gates</b><br>The gates of a city were significant in ancient times as places of judgment, commerce, and public assembly. The phrase suggests a return to normalcy and order after a period of chaos or conflict. It implies that the people, having recounted God's deeds, are now empowered and unified to resume their societal roles. This mirrors the restoration and peace that follows divine intervention, as seen in the return from exile in <a href="/nehemiah/8.htm">Nehemiah 8</a>, where the people gather at the Water Gate to hear the Law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/deborah.htm">Deborah</a></b><br>A prophetess and judge of Israel who, along with Barak, led Israel to victory over the Canaanite army.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/barak.htm">Barak</a></b><br>The military leader who, under Deborah's guidance, led the Israelites to defeat Sisera, the commander of the Canaanite army.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sisera.htm">Sisera</a></b><br>The commander of the Canaanite army defeated by the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_watering_places.htm">The Watering Places</a></b><br>Locations where people gathered, often serving as community centers for sharing news and recounting events.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gates.htm">The Gates</a></b><br>Symbolic of the place of authority and decision-making in ancient cities, where leaders and elders would meet.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_testimony.htm">The Power of Testimony</a></b><br>Sharing accounts of God's righteous acts strengthens faith and community.

In the aftermath of victory over Sisera, those once silent for fear now sing openly.<p>&#8226; Watering places symbolize refreshment. God&#8217;s salvation brings both physical safety and spiritual renewal (<a href="/isaiah/12-3.htm">Isaiah 12:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Worship erupts in public, not hidden away. Just as Miriam led singing after the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20-21</a>), Deborah celebrates a fresh deliverance.

At the wells, parents retell how God routed iron chariots with a storm (<a href="/judges/4-14.htm">Judges 4:14-16</a>; 5:20-21).<p>&#8226; The focus is Yahweh&#8217;s righteousness&#8212;His faithfulness to covenant promises (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>).

The meaning is highly uncertain. The "they that are delivered" is a conjectural addition of our version. The Hebrew only has "from the noise." The Vulgate renders it, "where the chariots clashed together, and the army of the enemy was strangled." The LXX. (some MSS.) connect the clause with the last verse: "Sing;" or "tell it from (<span class= "ital">i.e. </span>by) the voice of those who strike up their tunes in the midst of the water-drawers." The Chaldee is here utterly vague. Ewald renders it, "from the shoutings of the spoil-dividers between the water-troughs." Amid these uncertainties we have nothing better to offer than the conjecture of our translators.<p><span class= "bld">Righteous acts.</span>--Where these words first occur, the Hebrew is <span class= "ital">Tsidkoth; </span>but in the second recurrence of the English words, "even the righteous acts towards the inhabitants of the villages"--in which they are guided by the Chaldee Targum--we have only the Hebrew words, <span class= "ital">Tsidkoth pirzono. </span>Here, as in <a href="/judges/5-7.htm" title="The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.">Judges 5:7</a>, the versions were perplexed by the word p<span class= "ital">erazon; </span>but it is now generally agreed that the meaning is either "the righteous acts of his governance in Israel" (Ewald), or "towards the leaders in Israel" (Rosenmller, &c.).<p><span class= "bld">Then shall the people of the Lord go down to the gates.</span>--After singing the just deeds of God, they resumed their usual pursuits, unabashed and un-terrified.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - A very difficult verse, and very variously rendered.
