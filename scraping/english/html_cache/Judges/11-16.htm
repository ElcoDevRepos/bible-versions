This event is foundational in Israel's history, marking the beginning of their journey to the Promised Land. It is a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>) and is frequently referenced throughout Scripture as a demonstration of God's power and faithfulness (<a href="/exodus/12-41.htm">Exodus 12:41</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/6-21.htm">Deuteronomy 6:21</a>). The Exodus is also a type of Christ's deliverance of believers from the bondage of sin (<a href="/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-4</a>).<p><b>they traveled through the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness journey was a period of testing and reliance on God, lasting 40 years due to Israel's disobedience and lack of faith (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>). This time in the wilderness is symbolic of the Christian life, where believers are called to trust in God's provision and guidance. The wilderness also served as a place of preparation and transformation for the Israelites, shaping them into a people ready to enter the Promised Land.<p><b>to the Red Sea</b><br>The crossing of the Red Sea is one of the most dramatic miracles in the Bible, where God parted the waters to allow the Israelites to escape Pharaoh's pursuing army (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>). This event is a powerful testament to God's sovereignty and protection. It is often seen as a type of baptism, symbolizing the believer's passage from death to life (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-2.htm">1 Corinthians 10:2</a>).<p><b>and came to Kadesh</b><br>Kadesh, also known as Kadesh-barnea, was a significant location during the Israelites' wilderness wanderings. It was here that the Israelites first attempted to enter the Promised Land, but their lack of faith led to their prolonged journey (<a href="/numbers/13-26.htm">Numbers 13:26, 14</a>:29-30). Kadesh served as a base for several key events, including the sending of the twelve spies and the rebellion of Korah.
