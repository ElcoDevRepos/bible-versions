The wilderness journey is a significant part of Israel's history, symbolizing a period of testing and reliance on God. It reflects the broader biblical theme of God's people being led through trials to reach a place of promise.<p><b>and bypassed the lands of Edom and Moab.</b><br>Edom and Moab were nations descended from Esau and Lot, respectively. Israel's decision to bypass these lands demonstrates obedience to God's command not to engage in conflict with these relatives (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4-9</a>). This action highlights the importance of respecting God's instructions and the boundaries He sets, even when it involves restraint and patience.<p><b>They came to the east side of the land of Moab</b><br>This geographical detail situates Israel on the eastern border of Moab, emphasizing their strategic movement around hostile territories. The east side of Moab is significant as it positions Israel for their eventual crossing into the Promised Land. This location also sets the stage for future interactions with Moab, including the story of Balaam and Balak (Numbers 22-24).<p><b>and camped on the other side of the Arnon.</b><br>The Arnon River served as a natural boundary between Moab and the Amorite territories. Camping on the other side of the Arnon indicates Israel's careful navigation of political boundaries. This strategic positioning reflects God's guidance in leading Israel safely through potentially hostile regions.<p><b>But they did not enter the territory of Moab,</b><br>This phrase underscores Israel's obedience to God's command not to provoke Moab (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9</a>). It highlights the importance of respecting God's directives and the sovereignty of other nations. This restraint is a testament to Israel's reliance on God's timing and provision.<p><b>since the Arnon was its border.</b><br>The Arnon River as a border signifies a divinely established boundary that Israel respected. This respect for boundaries is a recurring biblical theme, emphasizing the importance of recognizing and honoring God's established limits. It also foreshadows the future territorial boundaries that God would establish for Israel in the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, located south of the Dead Sea.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A nation descended from Lot, located east of the Dead Sea.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert area through which the Israelites traveled during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/arnon.htm">Arnon</a></b><br>A river that served as a boundary between Moab and the Amorite territory.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_boundaries.htm">Respect for Boundaries</a></b><br>The Israelites respected the territorial boundaries of Edom and Moab, demonstrating obedience to God's instructions.
