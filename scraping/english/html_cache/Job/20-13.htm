In the context of Job, Zophar is speaking about the wicked who cling to their iniquity. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of sin's enticement and the difficulty of repentance, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/5-3.htm">Proverbs 5:3-4</a>, where the allure of sin is compared to honey, sweet at first but ultimately bitter. The imagery suggests an internal battle, highlighting the human tendency to hold onto sin despite knowing its destructive end.<p><b>and keeps it in his mouth</b><br>The metaphor of keeping something in the mouth suggests savoring or relishing sin, akin to how one might enjoy a tasty morsel. This imagery is used to describe the temporary pleasure derived from sin, which is ultimately fleeting and unsatisfying. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, oral imagery often conveyed ideas of consumption and satisfaction, emphasizing the intimate and personal nature of sin. This can be paralleled with <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>, where desire, when conceived, gives birth to sin, and sin, when fully grown, brings forth death. The phrase underscores the deceptive nature of sin, which promises satisfaction but leads to spiritual decay.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zophar_the_naamathite.htm">Zophar the Naamathite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.
