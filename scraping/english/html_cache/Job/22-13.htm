Eliphaz is suggesting that Job has questioned God's knowledge and justice. This reflects the ongoing debate between Job and his friends about the nature of suffering and divine justice. The friends believe that suffering is a direct result of sin, while Job maintains his innocence.<p><b>&#8216;What does God know?:</b><br>This rhetorical question implies skepticism about God's omniscience. In the context of the ancient Near East, gods were often seen as distant and uninvolved in human affairs. However, the God of Israel is portrayed throughout the Bible as all-knowing and intimately involved with His creation (<a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>). This question challenges the belief in God's comprehensive understanding and oversight of human actions.<p><b>Does He judge through thick darkness?:</b><br>The imagery of "thick darkness" suggests a barrier to vision and understanding. In biblical literature, darkness often symbolizes ignorance or evil (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>). Eliphaz is accusing Job of suggesting that God cannot see or judge clearly because of this darkness. However, other scriptures affirm that God sees all, even in darkness (<a href="/psalms/139-11.htm">Psalm 139:11-12</a>). This phrase also touches on the theme of divine justice, questioning whether God can administer justice if He is obscured by darkness. This reflects a misunderstanding of God's nature, as He is described as light and truth (1 <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

The psalmist implies that many men so thought (<a href="/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-11.htm">Psalm 73:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/94-7.htm">Psalm 94:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Can he judge through the dark cloud?</span> rather, <span class="accented">through the thick darkness.</span> God was supposed to dwell remote from man, in the highest heaven, and, according to many, "clouds and darkness were round about him" (<a href="/psalms/97-2.htm">Psalm 97:2</a>) - he "dwelt in the thick darkness" (<a href="/1_kings/8-12.htm">1 Kings 8:12</a>) - he "made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him was waters, and thick clouds of the skies" (<a href="/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>). The imagery was, no doubt, at first used in reference to man's inability to see and know God; but when men became familiar with it, they turned the metaphor round, and questioned God's ability to see and know anything about man. Job had not really ever shared in these doubts; but it suits Eliphaz's purpose to malign and misrepresent him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/22-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Yet you say:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1469;&#1453;&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;What</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mah-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">does God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_410.htm">Strong's 410: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strength -- as adjective, mighty, the Almighty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">know?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1491;&#1463;&#1469;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Does He judge</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1496;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#353;&#183;p&#333;&#183;w&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8199.htm">Strong's 8199: </a> </span><span class="str2">To judge, pronounce sentence, to vindicate, punish, to govern, to litigate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">through</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#7687;&#183;&#8216;a&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1157.htm">Strong's 1157: </a> </span><span class="str2">In up to, over against, at, beside, among, behind, for</span><br /><br /><span class="word">thick darkness?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1508;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;r&#257;&#183;p&#772;el)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6205.htm">Strong's 6205: </a> </span><span class="str2">Cloud, heavy cloud</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/22-13.htm">Job 22:13 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/22-13.htm">Job 22:13 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/22-13.htm">Job 22:13 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/22-13.htm">Job 22:13 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/22-13.htm">Job 22:13 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/22-13.htm">Job 22:13  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/22-13.htm">Job 22:13 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/22-13.htm">Job 22:13 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/22-13.htm">Job 22:13 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/22-13.htm">Job 22:13 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/22-13.htm">OT Poetry: Job 22:13 You say 'What does God know?
