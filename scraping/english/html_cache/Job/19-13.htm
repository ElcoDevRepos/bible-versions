In the ancient Near Eastern culture, family ties were crucial for social and economic stability. The term "brothers" can refer to both literal siblings and close kin, emphasizing the depth of Job's isolation. This estrangement can be seen as a reflection of Job's perceived divine abandonment, as he attributes this removal to God. Theologically, this foreshadows the suffering of Christ, who was also forsaken by His closest followers (<a href="/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a>).<p><b>my acquaintances have abandoned me.</b><br>Job's mention of acquaintances highlights the broader social alienation he experiences. In the context of the ancient world, community relationships were vital for survival and support. The abandonment by acquaintances signifies a complete social breakdown, leaving Job without any human comfort. This mirrors the prophetic suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, who is "despised and rejected by men." It also parallels Jesus' experience on the cross, where He felt forsaken (<a href="/mark/15-34.htm">Mark 15:34</a>), underscoring the theme of righteous suffering and ultimate redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

The verse reveals both the depth of Job&#8217;s isolation and the steadfastness of God, who remains when every human relationship falters. It reminds believers that earthly bonds, though precious, are not ultimate; God alone is the unfailing companion who uses every circumstance to draw His people nearer to Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">He hath put my brethren far from me.</span>--The Psalmist has apparently copied this in <a href="/psalms/88-8.htm" title="You have put away my acquaintance far from me; you have made me an abomination to them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.">Psalm 88:8</a>. The sense of human desertion is hardly less terrible than that of being forsaken by God, and this has been added to him. It is not easy to read these sad complaints of Job without seeing how fitly they apply to the sorrows of the Man of sorrows. Those who, with the present writer, believe in the overruling presence of the Holy Ghost will adore His wisdom in this fitness; but at all events it shows how completely Christ entered into the very heart of human suffering, in that the deepest expressions of suffering inevitably remind us of Him, whether those expressions are met with in the Book of Job, in the Psalms of David, or in the Lamentations of Jeremiah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath put my brethren far from me</span>.

Their alienation from him during the period of his afflictions he here regards as among the trials laid upon him by God.
