In the context of the Book of Job, Job was a man of great wealth and piety, known for his righteousness (<a href="/job/1.htm">Job 1:1-3</a>). The "trouble" refers to the series of calamities that have befallen him, including the loss of his children, wealth, and health (<a href="/job/1-13.htm">Job 1:13-19, 2</a>:7). This reflects the theme of the unpredictability of life and the testing of faith. Theologically, it raises questions about the nature of suffering and divine justice, a central theme in the book.<p><b>and you are weary</b><br>The weariness mentioned here is both physical and emotional, as Job grapples with immense loss and suffering. This weariness can be seen as a test of Job's faith and endurance. In the broader biblical context, weariness is often associated with trials and the need for divine strength (<a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29-31</a>). It also reflects the human condition and the limitations of human strength without reliance on God.<p><b>It strikes you</b><br>The use of "strikes" suggests a sudden and forceful impact, emphasizing the severity of Job's afflictions. This can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual and emotional blows Job is experiencing. In the narrative, these strikes are allowed by God but executed by Satan (<a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12, 2</a>:6), raising complex questions about the role of God in human suffering. This phrase can also be connected to the idea of spiritual warfare, where believers face trials as part of their faith journey (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p><b>and you are dismayed</b><br>Dismay here captures Job's emotional turmoil and confusion in the face of his suffering. It reflects a common human reaction to unexpected and overwhelming adversity. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, suffering was often seen as a result of divine displeasure, which adds to Job's confusion given his righteousness. This dismay can be linked to the broader biblical theme of lament, where individuals express their anguish and seek understanding from God (Psalms 13, 22). It also foreshadows the eventual restoration and deeper understanding that comes through enduring faith (<a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Scripture never hides the fact that believers can face severe, unexpected hardship.<p>- <a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a> reminds us, &#8220;Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him out of them all.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-3</a> urges, &#8220;Consider it pure joy, my brothers, when you encounter trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance.&#8221;<p>Eliphaz sees Job&#8217;s suffering as evidence that trouble has finally knocked on his door. While Eliphaz&#8217;s tone is lacking in compassion, the sentence still underscores a universal reality: trials do come, even to the godly (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you are weary</b><p>Suffering drains energy. Job has lost children, health, and wealth; no wonder he is exhausted.<p>- <a href="/isaiah/40-30.htm">Isaiah 40:30-31</a> notes that &#8220;Even youths grow weary and faint&#8230; but those who wait upon the LORD will renew their strength.&#8221;<p>- Jesus calls the worn-out to Himself: &#8220;Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>).<p>Eliphaz interprets Job&#8217;s weariness as weakness. Yet Scripture treats weariness as an expected human response in need of divine renewal (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It strikes you</b><p>Calamity feels like a blow, a sudden strike that leaves bruises.<p>- <a href="/job/1-13.htm">Job 1:13-19</a> records how disaster &#8220;struck&#8221; Job in rapid succession.<p>- <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:12</a> observes, &#8220;Man does not know his time&#8230; like fish caught in a cruel net.&#8221;<p>Eliphaz uses the language of impact: suffering hits; it does not politely ask permission. God&#8217;s Word prepares us for this reality so that we are not surprised (<a href="/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you are dismayed</b><p>Dismay is deeper than weariness; it is a shaken heart, a mind flooded with confusion.<p>- <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a> commands, &#8220;Do not be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.&#8221;<p>- Paul admits, &#8220;We are hard pressed on every side, yet not crushed; perplexed, yet not in despair&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8</a>).<p>Eliphaz criticizes Job for being rattled, forgetting that even strong believers can be momentarily overwhelmed (<a href="/psalms/143-4.htm">Psalm 143:4</a>). The remedy is not rebuke alone but renewed trust in God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/4-5.htm">Job 4:5</a> captures a snapshot of suffering: trouble arrives, strength wanes, the blow lands, and dismay follows. Eliphaz&#8217;s words are blunt and short on tenderness, yet the verse accurately describes the sequence many believers experience. Scripture neither denies the weight of trials nor excuses despair; instead, it points us to the Lord who delivers, renews, shields, and steadies every heart that turns to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest</span>. Now it is <span class="accented">thy</span> turn - calamity has come upon <span class="accented">thee</span> and all that thou weft wont to say to others is forgotten. The wise physician cannot heal himself. Instead of receiving thy chastisement in a right spirit, thou "faintest," or rather, "thou art angry, art offended" - as the same verb is also to be translated in the second verse. There is a tone of sarcasm about these remarks, which implies a certain hardness and want of real affection in the speaker, and which cannot but have been perceived by Job, and have detracted from the force of what Eliphaz urged. If one has to rebuke a friend, it should be done with great delicacy. Our "precious balms" should not be allowed to "break his head" (<a href="/psalms/141-6.htm">Psalm 141:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled</span>; or, <span class="accented">perplexed -</span> "confounded." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/4-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;
