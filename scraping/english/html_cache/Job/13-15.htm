Job acknowledges God's sovereignty and power over life and death, reminiscent of Abraham's faith in God's promises (<a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22:1-14</a>). The idea of God "slaying" is not literal but expresses the depth of Job's trials. This phrase can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's submission to the Father's will, even unto death (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>).<p><b>I will hope in Him</b><br>Job's declaration of hope in God, despite his circumstances, highlights his unwavering faith. This hope is not based on immediate deliverance but on a deeper trust in God's ultimate justice and righteousness. It parallels the hope expressed in Psalms, where the psalmists often cry out in distress yet reaffirm their trust in God (<a href="/psalms/42-11.htm">Psalm 42:11</a>). This hope is a precursor to the New Testament's emphasis on hope in Christ (<a href="/romans/5-5.htm">Romans 5:5</a>).<p><b>I will still defend my ways to His face</b><br>Job's insistence on defending his ways indicates his belief in his own integrity and righteousness. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, presenting one's case before a deity was a serious matter, often involving a formal declaration of innocence. Job's desire to "defend" himself before God shows his confidence in his moral standing, similar to the psalmist's plea for vindication (<a href="/psalms/26.htm">Psalm 26:1</a>). This also prefigures the believer's confidence in Christ as an advocate before God (1 <a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

His friends see suffering as proof of hidden sin, but Job recognizes God&#8217;s sovereign right over life and death, echoing themes found in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/2-6.htm">1 Samuel 2:6</a>.<p>- By saying &#8220;slay,&#8221; Job acknowledges that even the most painful loss can come through the Lord&#8217;s permissive will, just as he earlier confessed, &#8220;The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away&#8221; (<a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>).<p>- Job does not accuse God of injustice here; he simply accepts that his life rests entirely in God&#8217;s hand, a truth reinforced in <a href="/lamentations/3-38.htm">Lamentations 3:38</a> where both calamity and good proceed from the mouth of the Most High.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will hope in Him</b><p>- Hope stands in deliberate contrast to the threat of death. Job&#8217;s confidence mirrors the heart cry of <a href="/psalms/42-11.htm">Psalm 42:11</a>&#8212;&#8220;Put your hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him.&#8221;<p>- This hope is not vague optimism; it is fixed on God&#8217;s character. <a href="/psalms/62-5.htm">Psalm 62:5&#8211;6</a> declares, &#8220;Find rest, O my soul, in God alone&#8230; He is my fortress; I will not be shaken.&#8221; Job shares that settled assurance.<p>- Even in confusion, Job anticipates a Redeemer: &#8220;I know that my Redeemer lives&#8221; (<a href="/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25</a>). That forward-looking faith aligns with <a href="/romans/5-5.htm">Romans 5:5</a>, where hope &#8220;does not disappoint, because God&#8217;s love has been poured into our hearts.&#8221;<p>- Practical takeaways:<p>&#8226; Hope clings to who God is, not to immediate outcomes.<p>&#8226; True faith trusts God&#8217;s heart when His hand wounds (cf. <a href="/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will still defend my ways to His face</b><p>- Job&#8217;s statement is not rebellion but honest covenant dialogue. Like the psalmists who pour out complaints before God (<a href="/psalms/142-2.htm">Psalm 142:2</a>), Job knows he can speak openly.<p>- He maintains his integrity, recalling God&#8217;s own testimony that he was &#8220;blameless and upright&#8221; (<a href="/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a>). In <a href="/job/23-4.htm">Job 23:4&#8211;5</a> he longs to &#8220;present my case before Him and fill my mouth with arguments.&#8221;<p>- This desire flows from relationship: a child can run to a father for explanation. <a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a> contrasts the righteous, who are bold as a lion, with the wicked who flee; Job stands in that righteous boldness.<p>- New-covenant believers share similar confidence: &#8220;If our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-21.htm">1 John 3:21</a>).<p>- Practical implications:<p>&#8226; God invites truthful dialogue; faith is not silent resignation.<p>&#8226; Maintaining integrity before God matters more than appeasing human critics.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a> presents a threefold testimony: God&#8217;s sovereignty may include severe suffering; steadfast hope must rest in God Himself; and authentic faith speaks honestly to God while maintaining integrity. Holding all three together, Job models a resilient, courageous trust that neither denies pain nor abandons reverence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him.</span>--This rendering is almost proverbial; but, to say the least, its accuracy is very doubtful, for the better reading does not warrant it, but runs thus: <span class= "ital">Behold He will slay me. I have no hope; yet will I maintain my ways before Him. </span>It is true we thus lose a very beautiful and familiar resolve; but the expression of living trust is not less vivid. For though there is, as there can be, no gleam of hope for victory in this conflict, yet, notwithstanding, Job will not forego his conviction of integrity; for the voice of conscience is the voice of God, and if he knows himself to be innocent, he would belie and dishonour God as well as himself in renouncing his innocence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">yet will</span> I <span class="accented">wait for him.</span> The passage is one of the few in this book where there are two readings - <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5dc;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5dc;</span>.

If this be not allowed the reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> will have to be preferred, on the double authority of the versions and of the context.
