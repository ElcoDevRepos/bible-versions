The imagery of carrying something on one's shoulder suggests a burden that is accepted and borne with strength. In ancient Near Eastern culture, carrying loads on the shoulder was a common practice, symbolizing responsibility and acceptance of one's duty. This reflects Job's confidence in his integrity and his readiness to face any charges brought against him. Biblically, the shoulder is often associated with strength and authority, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, where the government is said to be upon the Messiah's shoulder, indicating His power and responsibility.<p><b>and wear it like a crown.</b><br>Here, Job elevates the concept of bearing accusations to a position of honor, as a crown is a symbol of royalty, authority, and dignity. By stating he would wear it like a crown, Job implies that he would not only accept the accusations but also transform them into a testament of his righteousness. This reflects a deep trust in his own integrity and in God's justice. The crown is a recurring biblical symbol of victory and honor, as seen in <a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>, where Paul speaks of the "crown of righteousness" awarded to those who have kept the faith. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate vindication of the righteous, a theme that resonates with the Christian understanding of eternal reward and the believer's identity in Christ, who is often depicted as the King of Kings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

After laying out his long defense of personal integrity (<a href="/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1&#8211;34</a>), he exclaims, &#8220;Surely&#8221; to underscore that he is not wavering in the slightest. The tone echoes earlier declarations such as <a href="/job/27-5.htm">Job 27:5&#8211;6</a>, where he refuses to deny his integrity, and recalls David&#8217;s plea in <a href="/psalms/26-1.htm">Psalm 26:1</a>, &#8220;Vindicate me, O LORD, for I have walked with integrity.&#8221; Job is certain that if God will only grant him a hearing, the verdict will prove his righteousness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I would carry it on my shoulder</b><p>&#8220;It&#8221; refers to the written charge Job longs to see: &#8220;Oh, that I had someone to hear me! Let the Almighty answer me; my accuser put his indictment in writing&#8221; (<a href="/job/31-35.htm">Job 31:35</a>). Should God present that document, Job says he would &#8220;carry it on my shoulder.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In Scripture the shoulder often pictures both responsibility and honor. The high priest bore the names of Israel on his shoulders in onyx stones as a memorial before the LORD (<a href="/exodus/28-12.htm">Exodus 28:12</a>).<p>&#8226; By offering to shoulder the indictment, Job declares he has nothing to hide. He would bear whatever God handed him, confident the contents would vindicate him.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a> speaks of governmental authority resting on Messiah&#8217;s shoulders; Job likewise is ready to shoulder the full weight of divine scrutiny, convinced of his innocence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and wear it like a crown</b><p>Job presses the image further: he would not merely carry the indictment; he would &#8220;wear it like a crown.&#8221;<p>&#8226; A crown is public and celebratory. Job believes that once examined, the very document meant to accuse him would instead stand as a badge of honor, much as <a href="/proverbs/4-9.htm">Proverbs 4:9</a> promises wisdom will &#8220;present you with a crown of splendor.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Paul anticipates a &#8220;crown of righteousness&#8221; in <a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>, confident that the righteous Judge will acknowledge his faithfulness. Job expresses the same anticipation centuries earlier.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/3-11.htm">Revelation 3:11</a> urges believers to &#8220;hold fast, so that no one will take your crown.&#8221; Job&#8217;s steadfast integrity lets him envision God&#8217;s verdict turning into a visible testimony of honor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/31-36.htm">Job 31:36</a> captures the bold climax of Job&#8217;s appeal. Certain of his integrity, he yearns for God&#8217;s written indictment. Far from dreading it, he would hoist it on his shoulder like a sacred burden and display it as a royal crown, convinced it would proclaim his righteousness rather than condemn him. In one vivid sentence Job models unwavering confidence that God&#8217;s righteous judgment will ultimately vindicate those who walk blamelessly before Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely I would take it upon my shoulder</span> - the place of honour (see <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>;
