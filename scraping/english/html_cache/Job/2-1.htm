It emphasizes the ongoing nature of the spiritual conflict and the testing of Job's faith. The concept of "days" in the biblical context often signifies specific times appointed by God for particular purposes.<p><b>the sons of God</b><br>This term is traditionally understood to refer to angelic beings. In the Old Testament, "sons of God" can denote divine beings or angels, as seen in <a href="/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2</a> and <a href="/psalms/29.htm">Psalm 29:1</a>. These beings are depicted as having access to the divine council, participating in the governance of the world under God's authority.<p><b>came to present themselves before the LORD</b><br>This phrase suggests a formal assembly or court setting where these heavenly beings report to God. The idea of presenting oneself before the LORD implies accountability and submission to God's sovereign rule. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern concept of a divine council where deities or divine beings would gather.<p><b>and Satan also came with them</b><br>Satan's presence among the sons of God highlights his role as the accuser or adversary. The Hebrew term "Satan" means "adversary" or "accuser," and his role here is to challenge the integrity of God's servants. This scene sets the stage for the testing of Job's righteousness, illustrating the cosmic struggle between good and evil.<p><b>to present himself before Him</b><br>Satan's act of presenting himself before God indicates that even he is subject to God's authority. This underscores the theme of divine sovereignty, where all beings, including those opposed to God, must ultimately answer to Him. It also foreshadows the eventual defeat of evil, as seen in <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>, where Satan's final judgment is depicted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_god.htm">The Sons of God</a></b><br>This term refers to angelic beings who serve and worship God.

It consists of three parts. Vers. 1-6 contain an account of Satan's second appearance in the courts of heaven, and of a second colloquy between him and the Almighty. Vers. 7-10 contain the sequel to this colloquy, viz. Satan's further affliction of Job, and his conduct under it. Vers. 11-13 contain an account of the arrival of Job's three special friends to mourn with him and to comfort him; and of their behavior during the first seven days after their arrival <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Again there was a day when the sons of God same to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them</span>. There is no "again" in the original. The words used are an exact repetition of those contained in ver. 6 of ch. 1. But they mark, no doubt, a <span class="accented">second</span> occasion on which the angelic host came to present themselves before the throne of God, and Satan came with them. <span class="cmt_word">To present himself before the Lord</span>. These words are additional to those used in the former passage. We may gather from them, that, whereas on the former occasion Satan came only to observe, and with no intention of drawing God's special attention to himself, he now had such intention, and looked forward to a colloquy. He anticipated, doubtless, that the circumstances of Job's probation would be referred to, and he had prepared himself to make answer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/2-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On another</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
