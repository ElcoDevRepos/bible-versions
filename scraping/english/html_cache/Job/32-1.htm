These friends represent traditional wisdom and the belief that suffering is a direct result of sin. Their silence indicates the end of their arguments, suggesting they have exhausted their reasoning without convincing Job. This moment marks a transition in the narrative, as it sets the stage for Elihu's speeches and ultimately God's response. The cessation of their dialogue highlights the limitations of human wisdom in understanding divine purposes.<p><b>because he was righteous in his own eyes</b><br>This phrase suggests that Job maintained his integrity and self-perception of righteousness despite his friends' accusations. In the cultural and historical context of the Ancient Near East, righteousness was often associated with adherence to social and religious norms. Job's insistence on his innocence challenges the retributive justice theology held by his friends. This self-perception is not necessarily prideful but reflects Job's honest assessment of his life and actions. Theologically, this sets up a tension between human understanding of righteousness and divine perspective, which is later addressed by God. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament theme of righteousness through faith, as seen in <a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>, where righteousness is apart from the law and through faith in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

The name appears to mean, <span class= "ital">He is my God. </span>The person from whom he was descended seems to have been the son of Nahor, Abraham's brother (<a href="/genesis/22-21.htm" title="Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,">Genesis 22:21</a>); and a city of the like name is mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/25-23.htm" title="Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost corners,">Jeremiah 25:23</a>. There is a Ram mentioned in <a href="/ruth/4-19.htm" title="And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,">Ruth 4:19</a>, who was the great grandson of Judah; but we can hardly suppose this was the Ram of whose kindred Elihu was. On the other hand, we have no clue to the identification; for even if, with some, we suppose him to have been the same as Aram, the son of Kemuel, and great nephew of Abraham, it is not easy to see how a descendant of Buz, his uncle, should have been described as of the kindred of Ram. One tradition identifies Ram with Abraham, but this is mere conjecture, and in this case highly improbable; the only inference we can draw is that this specification of Elihu serves to show that he was a real, and not an imaginary, personage. The Targum speaks of Elihu as a relative of Abraham. If we are right in putting the life of Elihu so far back, the whole position and surroundings of Job's history become the more probable, because what is told us of Abraham and the patriarchs corresponds with the description and character of Job; and then, also, the traditional Mosaic origin of the Book of Job becomes the more probable.<p><span class= "bld">Because he was righteous in his own eyes.</span>--This appears from <a href="/job/3-26.htm" title="I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.">Job 3:26</a>; <a href="/job/6-10.htm" title="Then should I yet have comfort; yes, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.">Job 6:10</a>; <a href="/job/6-29.htm" title="Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yes, return again, my righteousness is in it.">Job 6:29</a>; <a href="/job/10-7.htm" title="You know that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of your hand.">Job 10:7</a>; <a href="/job/13-15.htm" title="Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain my own ways before him.">Job 13:15</a>; <a href="/job/19-6.htm" title="Know now that God has overthrown me, and has compassed me with his net.">Job 19:6</a>, &c., <a href="/job/23-7.htm" title="There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.">Job 23:7</a>; <a href="/context/job/23-10.htm" title="But he knows the way that I take: when he has tried me, I shall come forth as gold.">Job 23:10-12</a>; <a href="/job/27-6.htm" title="My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.">Job 27:6</a>; <a href="/job/29-12.htm" title="Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.">Job 29:12</a>, &c. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-5.</span> - The discourse of Elihu is prefaced by a short introduction in plain prose, explaining who he was, and giving the reasons which actuated him in coming forward at this point of the dialogue. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So these three men ceased to answer</span> <span class="cmt_word">Job</span>.
