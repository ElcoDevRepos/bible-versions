This reflects the common belief in ancient times that suffering was directly linked to sin. The book of Job challenges this notion, showing that suffering can occur for reasons beyond human understanding. This phrase invites reflection on the nature of sin and its consequences, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/john/9-2.htm">John 9:2-3</a>, where Jesus explains that not all suffering is a result of personal sin.<p><b>what have I done to You</b><br>Job is expressing confusion and frustration, questioning what he could have possibly done to deserve such intense suffering. This reflects a deep sense of bewilderment and a desire for understanding. It echoes the human struggle to comprehend divine justice and the reasons behind personal trials, similar to the lamentations found in Psalms, such as <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>.<p><b>O watcher of mankind?</b><br>This phrase acknowledges God's omniscience and His role as the overseer of human actions. The term "watcher" suggests a God who is attentive and aware of human affairs. This concept is consistent with passages like <a href="/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3-4</a>, which describe God as a vigilant guardian. It also raises questions about the nature of divine observation&#8212;whether it is protective, judgmental, or both.<p><b>Why have You made me Your target</b><br>Job feels singled out by God for suffering, as if he is being specifically targeted. This imagery of being a target suggests a sense of persecution and highlights Job's feeling of being unjustly afflicted. It resonates with the experiences of other biblical figures who felt abandoned or targeted by God, such as David in <a href="/psalms/38-2.htm">Psalm 38:2</a>.<p><b>so that I am a burden to You?</b><br>Job perceives himself as a burden to God, which reflects his deep sense of worthlessness and despair. This phrase underscores the intensity of Job's suffering and his feeling of being a source of trouble to God. It invites reflection on the nature of human suffering and its place in the divine plan, as well as the assurance found in scriptures like <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>, where Jesus offers rest to the weary.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil. He is the central figure in the Book of Job, experiencing intense suffering and questioning God's justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Watcher of men)</a></b><br>Referred to as the "Watcher of men," highlighting His omniscience and omnipresence. Job addresses God directly, questioning His actions and intentions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_suffering.htm">Job's Suffering</a></b><br>The context of this verse is Job's lament over his suffering, which he perceives as unjust and overwhelming. He feels targeted by God despite his innocence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_omniscience.htm">Understanding God's Omniscience</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the "Watcher of men," fully aware of our actions, thoughts, and struggles.

However, maintaining faith and seeking understanding through prayer and scripture is crucial.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>Trust in God's sovereignty and justice, even when His ways are beyond our understanding.

Scripture teaches that<p>&#8226; &#8220;All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>).<p>&#8226; David likewise pleads, &#8220;Search me, O God&#8230;see if there is any offensive way in me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/139-23.htm">Psalm 139:23-24</a>).<p>Job&#8217;s words echo that same humble self-examination. He is not claiming perfection; he is acknowledging that, if sin is present, he needs to know it and confess it (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what have I done to You</b><p>Job then asks, &#8220;what have I done to You&#8221; (<a href="/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a>). He wonders how his supposed sin could have provoked such intense suffering. In <a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a> David says, &#8220;Against You, You only, have I sinned,&#8221; showing that every sin, no matter how private, is an offense primarily against God&#8217;s holiness. Yet <a href="/acts/17-25.htm">Acts 17:25</a> reminds us the Lord &#8220;is not served by human hands, as if He needed anything,&#8221; so Job&#8217;s wrongdoing has not diminished God&#8217;s power. The question springs from confusion, not irreverence: &#8220;Father, if I am guilty, where is the link between my act and this pain?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>O watcher of mankind</b><p>Calling God the &#8220;watcher of mankind&#8221; (<a href="/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a>) affirms His constant, personal oversight. <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a> says, &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are in every place, observing the evil and the good.&#8221; <a href="/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a> adds, &#8220;He who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.&#8221; Job knows that nothing in his life has escaped divine notice (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>). This title magnifies God&#8217;s vigilance while intensifying Job&#8217;s bewilderment: the very One who sees all seems, to Job, to be silent about the reason for his agony.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why have You made me Your target</b><p>&#8220;Why have You made me Your target?&#8221; (<a href="/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a>). Job feels as if the Almighty has fixed His bow on him&#8212;language he already used in <a href="/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>. <a href="/lamentations/3-12.htm">Lamentations 3:12&#8211;13</a> pictures similar anguish: &#8220;He bent His bow and set me as a target for His arrow.&#8221; Suffering can look like divine hostility, yet elsewhere God clarifies that trials refine rather than destroy (<a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>). Job&#8217;s lament captures the raw emotion of a believer who trusts God&#8217;s sovereignty but cannot trace His purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that I am a burden to You?</b><p>Finally, Job asks if he has become a &#8220;burden&#8221; to God (<a href="/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a>). <a href="/isaiah/43-24.htm">Isaiah 43:24</a> records the Lord saying, &#8220;You have burdened Me with your sins,&#8221; showing that persistent rebellion grieves Him. <a href="/malachi/2-17.htm">Malachi 2:17</a> adds, &#8220;You have wearied the LORD with your words.&#8221; Job fears he has crossed that line. Yet the fuller testimony of Scripture balances those verses with God&#8217;s invitation: &#8220;Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>). The same God who is offended by sin is also willing to carry it (<a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a> reveals a faithful sufferer wrestling honestly with God&#8217;s providence:<p>&#8226; He concedes the possibility of sin yet cannot identify a specific offense.<p>&#8226; He affirms God&#8217;s all-seeing nature but feels singled out and crushed.<p>&#8226; He dreads that his life has become an intolerable weight to the Lord, even while Scripture shows God is both holy toward sin and merciful toward sinners.<p>Taken together, the verse portrays the believer&#8217;s cry for clarity amid pain and underscores the larger message of Job: God&#8217;s purposes may be hidden, but His character&#8212;holy, watchful, and ultimately compassionate&#8212;remains unshaken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">I have sinned</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, "Putting the case that I have sinned, yet what then can I do unto Thee, O thou keeper of men?
