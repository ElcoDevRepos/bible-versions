The mention of his lineage and being a Buzite connects him to the family of Buz, a nephew of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22-21.htm">Genesis 22:21</a>), suggesting a heritage linked to the broader Abrahamic tradition. This introduction sets Elihu apart from Job's three friends, indicating a fresh perspective. His declaration marks a shift in the dialogue, as he enters the conversation with a sense of authority and purpose.<p><b>I am young in years, while you are old;</b><br>Elihu acknowledges the age difference between himself and Job's friends, which is significant in the cultural context where age was associated with wisdom and authority (<a href="/leviticus/19-32.htm">Leviticus 19:32</a>). This admission shows his respect for the traditional view of wisdom but also sets the stage for his argument that wisdom is not solely dependent on age. This theme is echoed in <a href="/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>, where Paul advises Timothy not to let anyone look down on him because of his youth.<p><b>that is why I was timid and afraid to tell you what I know.</b><br>Elihu's initial hesitation reflects the cultural norm of deference to elders. His fear and timidity suggest a respect for the established order, yet his decision to speak indicates a conviction that he has something valuable to contribute. This tension between respect for tradition and the courage to speak truth is a recurring biblical theme, seen in the prophets who often had to overcome fear to deliver God's message (<a href="/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6-8</a>). Elihu's boldness can be seen as a type of Christ, who also spoke with authority beyond His years (<a href="/luke/2-46.htm">Luke 2:46-47</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who enters the dialogue in the Book of Job.

In the present chapter, after a short apologetic exordium, excusing his youth (vers. 6-9), he addresses himself exclusively to Job's friends. He has listened attentively to them, and weighed their words (vers. 11, 12). but has found nothing in them that confuted Job. They had not "found wisdom" - they had not "vanquished Job" - at the last they had been "amazed, and had not had a word more to say" (vers. 13-16). Elihu, therefore, will supply their deficiency; he has kept silence with difficulty, and is full of thoughts, to which he would fain give utterance (vers. 17-20). In all that he says he will show no favouritism - he will "accept no man's-person," "give no flattering titles," but express sincerely what he believes (vers. 21, 22). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old</span>. We can only guess at the exact ages of Job and his friends. From the fact that God at the last "gave Job twice as much as he had before" (<a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>), and the further fact that he lived, after he had recovered his prosperity, a hundred and forty years (<a href="/job/42-16.htm">Job 42:16</a>), it has been conjectured that he was seventy years of age at the time of his conference with his friends, and that he died at the age of two hundred and ten. But this clearly is quite uncertain. He may not have been much more than fifty when his calamities fell upon him. If this were so, the age of his friends need not have exceeded from sixty to seventy. Perhaps Elihu was himself not more than thirty. <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore I was afraid, and durst not show you mine opinion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I held back and was afraid to utter what I knew in your pre</span>sence.
