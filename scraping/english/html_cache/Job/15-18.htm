The wisdom literature, including books like Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, often reflects the teachings and sayings of these wise individuals. In the context of Job, Eliphaz is appealing to the authority of traditional wisdom, suggesting that the truths he speaks are grounded in the collective understanding of the wise. This reflects a cultural emphasis on the value of wisdom passed down through generations, which was seen as divinely inspired and authoritative.<p><b>and was not concealed from their fathers</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the transmission of wisdom across generations. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, oral tradition was a primary means of preserving and conveying knowledge. The phrase suggests that the wisdom being referenced was openly shared and not hidden, indicating its importance and reliability. This also implies a continuity of understanding from one generation to the next, reinforcing the idea that the teachings have been tested and proven over time. The reference to "fathers" highlights the patriarchal structure of society, where elders and ancestors were revered as custodians of knowledge and tradition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.
