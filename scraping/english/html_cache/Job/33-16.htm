In the context of the Book of Job, this is significant as it highlights God's desire to reach out to humanity, even in their suffering. Biblically, the concept of God opening ears is often associated with revelation and understanding (<a href="/isaiah/50-5.htm">Isaiah 50:5</a>). It implies a spiritual awakening or enlightenment, where God enables a person to perceive His will or message. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God seeking a relationship with His creation, as seen in the calling of prophets and the giving of the Law.<p><b>and terrifies them with warnings</b><br>The use of "terrifies" indicates the seriousness and urgency of God's communication. In the ancient Near Eastern context, dreams and visions were common means through which deities communicated with people, often with messages that were both awe-inspiring and fear-inducing. The warnings mentioned here can be seen as acts of divine mercy, intended to prevent individuals from continuing on a destructive path. This reflects the biblical principle that "the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom" (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), where fear is understood as a reverent acknowledgment of God's power and authority. The warnings serve as a call to repentance and alignment with God's purposes, similar to the prophetic messages found throughout the Old Testament, such as those delivered by Isaiah and Jeremiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering a different perspective on Job's suffering.

"He openeth their ear," that is, He showeth them that He will decree, confirm, and seal up their chastisement, the sentence that is to be executed upon them, if they will not repent.

At such times, Elihu holds, God gives men spiritual wisdom, instructs them, makes them understand his dealings with them and his purposes with respect to them. If Job is perplexed concerning the Almighty's ways with himself, and desires explanations, let him have his ear open to the Divine teaching on such occasions, and seriously lay it to heart.
