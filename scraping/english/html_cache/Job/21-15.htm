In the context of Job, the term "Almighty" (Hebrew: Shaddai) emphasizes God's power and sovereignty. The question mirrors the skepticism of those who do not recognize God's authority, similar to Pharaoh's question in <a href="/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>, "Who is the LORD, that I should obey His voice?" It highlights a common biblical theme of human pride and ignorance in the face of divine majesty.<p><b>that we should serve Him</b><br>This phrase questions the value of serving God, reflecting a utilitarian view of religion. In the ancient Near Eastern context, service to deities was often transactional, expecting blessings in return for worship. Job's friends argue that suffering is a result of failing to serve God properly, but Job challenges this simplistic view. This echoes the broader biblical narrative that true service to God is based on love and reverence, not merely for personal gain, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12-13</a>.<p><b>and what would we gain if we pray to Him?</b><br>This phrase questions the efficacy of prayer, suggesting skepticism about its benefits. In the historical context, prayer was a central aspect of worship and communication with God. The rhetorical question implies doubt about God's responsiveness or willingness to bless those who seek Him. This reflects a broader biblical tension between faith and doubt, as seen in <a href="/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, where the psalmist struggles with the prosperity of the wicked. The ultimate biblical teaching is that prayer is an act of faith and trust in God's wisdom and timing, as exemplified by Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and integrity, who undergoes severe trials and questions the justice of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_almighty.htm">The Almighty (El Shaddai)</a></b><br>A title for God emphasizing His ultimate power and sovereignty.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_friends.htm">Job's Friends</a></b><br>Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, who argue that suffering is a result of sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/uz.htm">Uz</a></b><br>The land where Job lived, often associated with the region east of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_suffering.htm">Job's Suffering</a></b><br>The series of calamities that befall Job, including loss of wealth, family, and health.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_sovereignty.htm">Understanding God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God's ways are higher than ours, and His plans are beyond our understanding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_true_worship.htm">The Nature of True Worship</a></b><br>Worship should not be based on what we gain but on who God is.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_amidst_doubt.htm">Faith Amidst Doubt</a></b><br>It's natural to question during trials, but faith requires trusting God's character and promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_illusion_of_prosperity.htm">The Illusion of Prosperity</a></b><br>Earthly success does not equate to divine favor;
