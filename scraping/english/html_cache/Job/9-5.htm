In the ancient Near Eastern context, mountains were often seen as symbols of stability and permanence. The idea that God can move them without their knowledge underscores His supreme power. This reflects the biblical theme of God's control over nature, as seen in <a href="/psalms/97-5.htm">Psalm 97:5</a>, where mountains melt like wax before the Lord. The imagery also connects to Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>, where faith as small as a mustard seed can move mountains, illustrating the power of faith in God's omnipotence.<p><b>and overturns them in His anger</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's righteous judgment and the consequences of His wrath. The overturning of mountains can be seen as a metaphor for God's ability to disrupt the natural order as a response to sin or rebellion. This is consistent with the biblical narrative of God's judgment, such as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>) and the plagues of Egypt (Exodus 7-12). The concept of divine anger is also present in the New Testament, where God's wrath is revealed against all ungodliness (<a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>). This phrase serves as a reminder of the seriousness of God's holiness and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Earthquakes are common in all the countries adjoining Syria and Palestine, and must always have been among the most striking manifestations of God's power. There are several allusions to them in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/8-8.htm">Psalm 8:8</a>, 104:32). and historical mention of them in <a href="/numbers/16-32.htm">Numbers 16:32</a>; <a href="/1_kings/19-1.htm">1 Kings 19:1</a>; <a href="/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4, 5</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-7.htm">Matthew 24:7</a>. Josephus speaks of one which desolated Judaea in the reign of Herod the Great, and destroyed ten thousand people ('Ant. Jud.,' 15:5. &sect; 2). There was another in 1181, which was felt over the whole of the Hauran, and did great damage. A still more violent convulsion occurred in 1837, when the area affected extended five hundred miles from north to south, and from eighty to a hundred miles east and west. Tiberias and Safed were overthrown. The earth gaped in various places, and closed again. Fearful oscillations were felt. The hot springs of Tiberias mounted up to a temperature that ordinary thermometers could not mark, and the loss of life was considerable (see the account given by Dr. Cunningham Geikie, in 'The Holy Land and the Bible,' vol. 2. pp. 317, 318). The phrases used by Job are, of course, poetical. Earthquakes do not literally "remove" mountains, nor "overturn" them. They produce fissures, elevations, depressions, and the like; but they rarely much alter local features or the general configuration of a district. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/9-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He moves</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;ma&#8216;&#183;t&#238;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
