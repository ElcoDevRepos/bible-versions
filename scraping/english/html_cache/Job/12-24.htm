Throughout the Bible, God is shown to have the power to grant or withhold wisdom. In <a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>, God grants Solomon wisdom, while in <a href="/daniel/4-31.htm">Daniel 4:31-32</a>, Nebuchadnezzar is deprived of reason as a demonstration of God's authority. The idea that God can influence the minds of leaders is a recurring theme, emphasizing that human authority is ultimately subject to divine will. This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, which states that the king's heart is in the hand of the Lord.<p><b>and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland.</b><br>This imagery of wandering in a wasteland suggests confusion and aimlessness, often used in Scripture to describe the consequences of turning away from God. The Israelites' 40 years in the desert (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33</a>) serve as a historical example of wandering due to disobedience. The "trackless wasteland" symbolizes a lack of direction and purpose, which can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual desolation. This phrase also connects to the theme of divine judgment, where God allows leaders to face the consequences of their pride and folly, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/29-14.htm">Isaiah 29:14</a>, where the wisdom of the wise is thwarted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, Job is the central figure in the Book of Job.
