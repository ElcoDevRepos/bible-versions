In the ancient Near Eastern context, harvest time was crucial for survival, and losing a harvest meant potential famine. This imagery is used to illustrate the vulnerability of the wicked's possessions. Biblically, this can be connected to the principle of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>), where the wicked ultimately face the consequences of their actions. The idea of the hungry consuming the harvest can also be seen as a divine judgment, where God allows the natural order to bring justice.<p><b>taking it even from the thorns</b><br>The mention of "thorns" suggests that the harvest is protected or difficult to access, yet the hungry are so desperate that they overcome these obstacles. Thorns in the Bible often symbolize sin and the curse of the fall (<a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>). This phrase may imply that no matter how the wicked try to protect their wealth, it will be taken from them. The imagery of thorns can also be seen in the parable of the sower (<a href="/matthew/13-7.htm">Matthew 13:7, 22</a>), where thorns choke the word, representing the cares of the world and deceitfulness of riches.<p><b>and the thirsty pant after his wealth</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the insatiable desire for the wealth of the wicked. The term "thirsty" conveys a deep longing or need, suggesting that others are eagerly waiting to seize the wealth of those who are unrighteous. In a broader biblical context, thirst is often used metaphorically for spiritual longing (<a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42:1-2</a>). The idea of panting after wealth can be contrasted with the call to seek first the kingdom of God (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>), emphasizing the futility of placing trust in material riches. This phrase underscores the transient nature of wealth and the ultimate futility of relying on it for security.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.
