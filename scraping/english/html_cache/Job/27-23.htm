In ancient Near Eastern culture, clapping hands was often a sign of scorn or contempt. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where clapping is associated with judgment or disdain, such as in <a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a>, where people clap their hands at the downfall of Jerusalem. The context in Job is one of divine justice, where the wicked face the consequences of their actions. This can be seen as a reflection of God's ultimate authority and the moral order He upholds.<p><b>and hisses him out of his place.</b><br>Hissing in the ancient world was a sound of disapproval or scorn, similar to booing in modern times. This action signifies rejection and expulsion, emphasizing the disgrace and downfall of the wicked. The phrase "out of his place" indicates a loss of position or status, which is a common theme in the wisdom literature of the Bible, where the wicked are often depicted as losing their place due to their unrighteousness. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of divine retribution, where God ensures that justice is served, as seen in <a href="/psalms/37-10.htm">Psalm 37:10</a>, where the wicked are no more and their place is not found.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_friends.htm">Job's Friends</a></b><br>Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, who visit Job to offer counsel but often misinterpret his suffering as a result of sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate authority and sovereign being who allows Job's trials to test his faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>In this context, Job is speaking about the fate of the wicked, contrasting their temporary success with their ultimate downfall.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_place_of_the_wicked.htm">The Place of the Wicked</a></b><br>Symbolic of the temporary and unstable position that the wicked hold, which will eventually be lost.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_temporary_triumph_of_the_wicked.htm">The Temporary Triumph of the Wicked</a></b><br>The wicked may experience temporary success, but it is fleeting and ultimately leads to downfall.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sovereignty_of_god.htm">The Sovereignty of God</a></b><br>God is in control, and His justice will prevail.

The &#8220;clap&#8221; recalls the crack of thunder as God&#8217;s judgment seals the fate of the wicked. Scripture often uses hand-clapping to show scornful glee over a fallen enemy&#8212;see <a href="/nahum/3-19.htm">Nahum 3:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/25-6.htm">Ezekiel 25:6</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a>.

Divine judgment is never abstract; it lands on real people who have spurned righteousness. Other passages underline this personal reckoning: <a href="/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18&#8211;19</a> shows God setting the wicked &#8220;on slippery places,&#8221; and <a href="/job/20-5.htm">Job 20:5</a> reminds us that their triumph is &#8220;short.&#8221; The focus keeps us from thinking sin is merely a societal flaw&#8212;it is a personal offense that draws a personal response.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and hisses him</b><p>The same storm now &#8220;hisses,&#8221; a word used elsewhere for contemptuous whistling at ruin (<a href="/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>; 49:17; <a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a>). What thunder began, the eerie whistle of the wind finishes, mocking the one who once mocked God.
