Job, once a man of great wealth and influence, finds himself abandoned by those closest to him. This reflects the cultural importance of friendship and loyalty in ancient Near Eastern societies, where social bonds were crucial for survival and support. The Hebrew word for "despise" indicates a strong rejection, suggesting that Job's friends not only abandoned him but also looked down on him. This mirrors the experience of Jesus, who was also despised and rejected by those He came to save (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<p><b>and those I love have turned against me</b><br>This phrase underscores the betrayal Job feels from his loved ones, adding to his emotional and spiritual anguish. In the historical context, family and kinship ties were paramount, and such a turning away would have been devastating. This situation can be compared to the betrayal Jesus experienced from His disciples, particularly Judas Iscariot, who turned against Him (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>). The phrase also echoes the prophetic suffering servant motif, where the righteous sufferer is abandoned by those he loves, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ's passion and crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
