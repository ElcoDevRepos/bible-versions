This promise is rooted in the Abrahamic Covenant, where God promised Abraham and his descendants the land of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 15</a>:18-21). The land was a significant part of God's covenant with Israel, symbolizing His provision and faithfulness. The exclusivity of the land being given "alone" to the Israelites underscores the special relationship between God and His chosen people, setting them apart from other nations.<p><b>when no foreigner passed among them</b><br>This part of the verse highlights a time when the Israelites were distinct and separate from other nations, emphasizing their unique identity and calling. Historically, this can be seen during the period of the conquest and settlement of Canaan under Joshua, when the land was primarily occupied by the Israelites without significant foreign influence (<a href="/joshua/23-9.htm">Joshua 23:9</a>). The absence of foreigners passing among them suggests a time of purity and undiluted worship of Yahweh, before the influence of surrounding pagan cultures led to idolatry and syncretism. This phrase can also be seen as a call to holiness and separation from worldly influences, a theme echoed throughout Scripture (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

He claims to speak from the heritage of &#8220;wise men,&#8221; whose teaching, he says, was pure and undiluted. This purity is summed up in <a href="/job/15-19.htm">Job 15:19</a>: &#8220;to whom alone the land was given when no foreigner passed among them.&#8221; By recalling that era, Eliphaz tries to bolster his argument that suffering comes only upon the wicked (<a href="/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7&#8211;9</a>; <a href="/job/15-20.htm">Job 15:20&#8211;24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To whom alone</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;To whom&#8221; points back to the fathers Eliphaz just mentioned (<a href="/job/15-18.htm">Job 15:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Eliphaz views these ancestors as uniquely entrusted with truth, much as Moses later reminded Israel that the LORD &#8220;has not done this for any nation&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/147-19.htm">Psalm 147:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The exclusivity echoes <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>, where God singled out Abram, promising to bless him and make him a channel of blessing. Eliphaz assumes a similar divine choice for the &#8220;wise men&#8221; of his lineage.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/51-2.htm">Isaiah 51:2</a> reminds Israel, &#8220;Look to Abraham your father,&#8221; underscoring how early patriarchal revelation carried special authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The land was given</b><p>&#8226; Land-gift language recalls God&#8217;s covenant grants&#8212;<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>, &#8220;To your descendants I have given this land.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a> also speaks of God &#8220;apportioning the nations,&#8221; showing that possession of land signified divine favor and responsibility.<p>&#8226; Eliphaz implies that because God gave the land to his forefathers, their understanding of righteousness was likewise God-given and reliable.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/37-29.htm">Psalm 37:29</a> affirms, &#8220;The righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever,&#8221; linking moral integrity with territorial blessing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When no foreigner passed among them</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;No foreigner&#8221; paints a picture of isolation from outside influence, suggesting an era of untainted tradition, similar to how Israel was warned, &#8220;Do not learn the way of the nations&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/10-2.htm">Jeremiah 10:2</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/4-20.htm">Proverbs 4:20-27</a> stresses guarding one&#8217;s heart from corrupting voices; Eliphaz applies that principle backward, claiming his fathers lived it perfectly.<p>&#8226; This phrase also echoes <a href="/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12-16</a>, where Israel is told to keep foreigners from leading them into idolatry, reinforcing the theme of doctrinal purity.<p>&#8226; By invoking a time &#8220;when no foreigner passed,&#8221; Eliphaz is saying, &#8220;Our doctrine has no outside contamination; trust it.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The point Eliphaz is making</b><p>&#8226; He sets up an argument from tradition:<p>&#8211; Our ancestors suffered no doctrinal intrusion.<p>&#8211; God Himself entrusted them with land and truth.<p>&#8211; Therefore, their teaching&#8212;that suffering is the just reward of sin&#8212;must stand (<a href="/job/15-20.htm">Job 15:20-35</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the larger narrative of Job challenges his conclusion, as Job&#8217;s righteousness is affirmed by God (<a href="/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a>; 2:3) despite his suffering.<p>&#8226; Scripture elsewhere warns that tradition, even good tradition, can be misapplied (<a href="/mark/7-8.htm">Mark 7:8-9</a>). Eliphaz illustrates that danger.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Application today</b><p>&#8226; Value heritage: Paul commends Timothy&#8217;s sincere faith handed down from his mother and grandmother (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Test every tradition against the whole counsel of God (<a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Recognize that divine gifts&#8212;land, family, heritage&#8212;are meant to lead us to humility, not presumption (<a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Avoid the error of Eliphaz: equating outward blessing or lack of foreign influence with automatic doctrinal correctness. Jesus warned the disciples, &#8220;Take heed&#8230; no one deceives you&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/24-4.htm">Matthew 24:4-5</a>), showing that deception can arise even within trusted circles.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/15-19.htm">Job 15:19</a> records Eliphaz&#8217;s claim that his forefathers uniquely possessed both land and truth in an age untouched by outsiders. He uses this to assert the unquestionable accuracy of his theological stance on suffering. While Scripture affirms that God often grants land and revelation to selected people, the broader biblical witness also shows that such gifts can be misunderstood. The verse reminds us to respect godly heritage yet continually measure every tradition by God&#8217;s full, revealed Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto whom alone the earth was given</span>. The reference is clearly to a very remote time, when men were comparatively few, and lived in quiet possession of their own lands, undisturbed by invasions, wars, or struggles for territory. Professor Lee thinks that the times immediately after, and even those before, the Flood are glanced at; while Schultens regards Eliphaz as alluding to the first settlements of the Joktanidae in Arabia. In either case, the passage tells in favour or, and not against, the antiquity of the Book of Job, since it marks the composer as "living at a time when the memory of an age of patriarchal simplicity was yet fresh in men's minds" (Canon Cook). <span class="cmt_word">And no stranger passed among them</span>.
