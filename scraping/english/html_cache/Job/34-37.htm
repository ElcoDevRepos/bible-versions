In biblical context, rebellion is often seen as a serious offense against God, akin to witchcraft (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>). Theologically, this suggests a willful defiance against divine authority. The idea of adding rebellion indicates a deepening of Job's spiritual crisis, moving from mere error to a conscious challenge against God's justice and sovereignty. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the human heart's tendency to harden against God, as seen in Pharaoh's story in Exodus.<p><b>he claps his hands among us</b><br>Clapping hands in ancient Near Eastern culture could signify several things, including mockery, derision, or a gesture of finality. In this context, it likely indicates Job's scorn or disdain for the arguments presented by his friends, as well as his frustration with his situation. This gesture can be seen as an outward expression of inner turmoil and rebellion. The cultural practice of clapping as a form of derision is also seen in <a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a>, where it is used to mock Jerusalem. This act underscores the tension between Job and his friends, as well as his perceived audacity in the face of divine judgment.<p><b>and multiplies his words against God.&#8221;</b><br>The multiplication of words against God suggests a persistent and perhaps escalating verbal challenge to divine authority. In the wisdom literature context, words hold significant power and are often seen as a reflection of one's heart (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>). Job's extensive speeches throughout the book reveal his struggle to reconcile his understanding of God's justice with his suffering. This phrase implies that Job's discourse has crossed into the territory of accusation or blasphemy, echoing the warnings found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2</a> about being cautious with words before God. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, where Jesus, though innocent, was accused of blasphemy and faced unjust suffering, yet He remained sinless in His words and actions (<a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22-23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering a perspective that combines respect for God's justice with a critique of Job's responses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and questions God's justice, yet remains a central figure in the discourse on suffering and righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_friends.htm">Job's Friends</a></b><br>Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, who attempt to explain Job's suffering through traditional wisdom, often attributing it to sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and sovereign being, whose justice and righteousness are central themes in the Book of Job.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_setting.htm">The Setting</a></b><br>The land of Uz, where Job's trials and the subsequent dialogues take place, serving as a backdrop for exploring themes of suffering, justice, and divine sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_rebellion.htm">Understanding Rebellion</a></b><br>Recognize that rebellion against God can manifest in attitudes and words, not just actions.

Job&#8217;s earlier lament over inexplicable suffering has swollen into stubborn obstinacy.<p>&#8226; Sin left unchecked hardens the heart. As <a href="/proverbs/28-14.htm">Proverbs 28:14</a> notes, &#8220;Blessed is the man who always fears the LORD, but he who hardens his heart falls into trouble.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture warns that rebellion compounds guilt: &#8220;For rebellion is like the sin of divination&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>). By nursing resentment instead of surrendering it, Job (in Elihu&#8217;s eyes) moves from bewildered sufferer to willful rebel.<p>&#8226; The picture is a caution for anyone tempted to justify lingering sin. <a href="/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a> offers the remedy: honest confession brings swift forgiveness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he claps his hands among us</b><p>The gesture shows open defiance&#8212;a public display that says, &#8220;I&#8217;m right, you&#8217;re wrong.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/27-23.htm">Job 27:23</a> uses the same image of scoffing applause: &#8220;It claps its hands at him and hisses him out of his place.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In biblical culture, clapping at someone often signals scorn (<a href="/nahum/3-19.htm">Nahum 3:19</a>). Elihu accuses Job of ridiculing both friends and divine justice.<p>&#8226; What begins in the heart spills out in body language. <a href="/luke/6-45.htm">Luke 6:45</a> reminds us, &#8220;Out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks,&#8221; and, by extension, the hands act.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and multiplies his words against God</b><p>Rather than quieting his soul, Job lengthens his protest.<p>&#8226; Elihu has already said, &#8220;So Job opens his mouth in vain and multiplies words without knowledge&#8221; (<a href="/job/35-16.htm">Job 35:16</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/10-19.htm">Proverbs 10:19</a> cautions, &#8220;When words are many, transgression is unavoidable,&#8221; and <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2</a> urges restraining speech before heaven.<p>&#8226; Endless argument keeps pain raw. Instead, <a href="/psalms/62-5.htm">Psalm 62:5</a> models stillness: &#8220;Rest in God alone, O my soul, for my hope comes from Him.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Elihu&#8217;s charge in <a href="/job/34-37.htm">Job 34:37</a> unfolds in three escalating steps: unrepented sin becomes rebellion, rebellion erupts into outward contempt, and contempt overflows in a torrent of self-justifying words against God. The verse stands as a sober warning: the longer sin is defended, the deeper it roots. Humble confession, not defiant debate, is the God-given path back to peace and restored fellowship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/34.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">He clappeth his hands among us.</span>--As though he were confident of victory in argument.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he addeth rebellion unto his sin</span>.
