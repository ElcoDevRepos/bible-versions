In the context of the Book of Job, Bildad is advising Job to look to the traditions and teachings of the ancestors for understanding. This reflects a common practice in ancient cultures, where oral traditions and historical accounts were passed down through generations. The Bible often highlights the value of learning from history, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-7.htm">Deuteronomy 32:7</a>, which encourages remembering the days of old and considering the years of many generations. This approach underscores the belief that wisdom is cumulative and that the experiences of past generations can provide guidance for present challenges.<p><b>and consider the discoveries of their fathers.</b><br>The term "discoveries" here can be understood as the insights, knowledge, and experiences gained by previous generations. In the ancient Near Eastern context, this would include not only practical knowledge but also spiritual and moral lessons. The "fathers" refers to the patriarchs and ancestors who have laid the foundation of faith and understanding. This phrase suggests a respect for tradition and the accumulated wisdom of the community. It aligns with <a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>, which advises listening to the instruction of one's father and not forsaking the teaching of one's mother. The emphasis on learning from the past is a recurring theme in Scripture, pointing to the idea that God's truths are timeless and that the lessons learned by previous generations remain relevant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bildad_the_shuhite.htm">Bildad the Shuhite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

Put the matter to the test of experience - not the short-lived experience of living men, but the treasure of experience which has been handed down from generation to generation since the remotest times, and which is embodied in proverbs - the expression of the concentrated wisdom of antiquity.

Go back, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to the past age, but do not stop there - pursue thy researches further and further to their remote ancestors. Bildad implies that the records of these remote times have been, in some way or other, preserved, either in writings or by oral tradition. Writing was certainly known in Egypt and Babylonia from a time anterior to Abraham, and to the Hittites at a date not very much later. Books of advice and instruction embodied in proverbs, or moral precepts, were among the earliest, in Egypt certainly. See the "Instructions of Amen-em-hat." in the 'Records of the Past,' vol. if. pp. 11-16, and the 'Proverbs of Aphobis,' published by the Revelation Dunbar Heath. Bildad's speech is thought to indicate "special familiarity with Egypt." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/8-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Please</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1453;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4994.htm">Strong's 4994: </a> </span><span class="str2">I pray', 'now', 'then'</span><br /><br /><span class="word">inquire</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;&#8217;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7592.htm">Strong's 7592: </a> </span><span class="str2">To inquire, to request, to demand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of past</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#238;&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7223.htm">Strong's 7223: </a> </span><span class="str2">First, in place, time, rank</span><br /><br /><span class="word">generations</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1465;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
