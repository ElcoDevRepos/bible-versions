In ancient times, this task was often left to those who had no land of their own, reflecting their marginalized status. The Mosaic Law provided for the poor by allowing them to glean from the fields (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>), but here, the implication is that they are forced to do so out of necessity rather than as a provision. This reflects the broader theme in Job of the righteous suffering while the wicked prosper.<p><b>and glean the vineyards of the wicked.</b><br>Gleaning was a practice commanded by God to ensure that the poor and the foreigner could gather leftover crops after the harvest (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-21.htm">Deuteronomy 24:21</a>). However, in this context, the vineyards belong to the wicked, suggesting an inversion of justice where the wicked have control over resources that should be available to the needy. This phrase underscores the social injustice and moral disorder that Job laments throughout the book. The wicked, who should be punished, instead have abundance, while the righteous suffer. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who, though righteous, suffered and was oppressed, highlighting the ultimate reversal of justice that will be fulfilled in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and patience who endures immense suffering and questions the justice of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Those who oppress and exploit others, often referenced in Job as those who prosper despite their unrighteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/fields_and_vineyards.htm">Fields and Vineyards</a></b><br>Symbolic of agricultural life in ancient times, representing sustenance and livelihood.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gleaning.htm">Gleaning</a></b><br>The act of collecting leftover crops from farmers' fields after they have been commercially harvested, often associated with the poor and needy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oppressed.htm">The Oppressed</a></b><br>Implicit in this verse are the poor and marginalized who are forced to gather what they can from the fields of the wicked.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_injustice.htm">Understanding Injustice</a></b><br>Recognize that injustice and exploitation are prevalent in the world, as seen in Job's time and today.

Here he shows how the poor must scrape together grass and stalks just to survive.<p>&#8226; Scripture elsewhere assumes landowners will leave some growth for the needy (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>), yet these victims receive no such mercy.<p>&#8226; The picture echoes <a href="/proverbs/13-23.htm">Proverbs 13:23</a>, &#8220;Abundant food is in the fallow ground of the poor, but injustice sweeps it away,&#8221; underscoring how greed robs them of what God intended as provision.<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s literal description reminds us that material deprivation is real, and God&#8217;s people are called to notice and act (<a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and glean the vineyards of the wicked</b><p>The same destitute people must &#8220;glean the vineyards of the wicked.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Gleaning&#8212;picking up leftover grapes&#8212;was meant as a dignified safety net (<a href="/ruth/2-2.htm">Ruth 2:2-3</a>). In Job&#8217;s lament, however, the harvest belongs to &#8220;the wicked,&#8221; a term signaling landowners who oppress rather than bless (<a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8</a>; <a href="/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Their fields flourish, yet they force others to work without fair share. <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:1</a> observes similar tears of the oppressed with &#8220;no comforter,&#8221; matching Job&#8217;s complaint.<p>&#8226; The verse hints that the wicked profit even from the poor&#8217;s gleaning; desperate workers must labor on property that enriches their oppressors&#8212;contrasting God&#8217;s ideal where fruitfulness benefits all (<a href="/psalms/72-12.htm">Psalm 72:12-14</a>).<p>&#8226; By pairing fodder-gathering with vineyard-gleaning, Job shows oppression spans the agricultural spectrum&#8212;from lowly animal feed to luxury produce&#8212;revealing systemic injustice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/24-6.htm">Job 24:6</a> paints a vivid, literal scene: the poor scour open fields for mere fodder and scavenge vineyards owned by heartless landlords. The verse serves as evidence in Job&#8217;s case that unrighteous people thrive while the helpless suffer, apparently without immediate divine intervention. Yet the rest of Scripture affirms God&#8217;s concern for justice and promises ultimate reckoning. Until then, the passage challenges believers to reflect God&#8217;s heart by defending and providing for those forced to live off society&#8217;s leftovers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">They reap every one his corn.</span>--Or, probably, <span class= "ital">the corn, </span>that is, <span class= "ital">of the wicked tyrant. </span>While they reap his corn and cut his provender, they have to go without themselves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They reap every one his corn in the field</span>.
