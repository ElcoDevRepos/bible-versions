In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, holding one's head high was a sign of dignity and confidence. Job feels that even if he tries to maintain his dignity, he is still subject to God's overwhelming power. This sentiment echoes the broader biblical theme of human humility before God, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, which warns against pride leading to a fall.<p><b>You would hunt me like a lion</b><br>The imagery of a lion hunting its prey is a powerful metaphor for God's pursuit of Job. Lions were well-known in the ancient world, symbolizing strength and ferocity. This metaphor suggests an intense and relentless pursuit, highlighting Job's feeling of being targeted by God. Similar imagery is found in <a href="/hosea/5-14.htm">Hosea 5:14</a>, where God is described as a lion to Ephraim and Judah, emphasizing His power and judgment.<p><b>and again display Your power against me</b><br>Job acknowledges God's sovereignty and omnipotence, recognizing that God's power is beyond human comprehension. This phrase underscores the recurring theme of divine power throughout the Book of Job. It also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's might, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10</a>, which speaks of God's powerful arm ruling for Him.

Even if he were to lift his face in confidence&#8212;signifying innocence and dignity&#8212;it would change nothing.<p>&#8226; Earlier he said, &#8220;Though I am blameless, I have no concern for myself&#8221; (<a href="/job/9-21.htm">Job 9:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The psalmist likewise knew the agony of a downcast spirit yet leaned on God: &#8220;Why, O my soul, are you downcast?&#8230; Put your hope in God&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/42-11.htm">Psalm 42:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Job, however, believes any attempt at hope will be met by fresh calamity, echoing his earlier lament, &#8220;If I hold my head high, You stalk me like a lion&#8221; (<a href="/job/9-27.htm">Job 9:27-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You would hunt me like a lion</b><p>Here Job pictures God as a relentless predator. The imagery captures how overpowering the attacks have felt.<p>&#8226; &#8220;He tears me in His wrath and hates me&#8221; (<a href="/job/16-9.htm">Job 16:9</a>) parallels this sense of being hunted.<p>&#8226; Other Scriptures use the lion to describe deadly pursuit (<a href="/psalms/7-2.htm">Psalm 7:2</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-10.htm">Lamentations 3:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Job is not denying God&#8217;s righteousness; he is confessing that, from his human vantage point, the blows seem fierce and personal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And again display Your power against me</b><p>Job anticipates yet another wave of suffering, convinced that God&#8217;s might will be turned on him once more.<p>&#8226; He has already endured repeated losses (<a href="/job/1-13.htm">Job 1:13-19</a>; 2:7-10).<p>&#8226; &#8220;He pierces me with His arrows&#8230; again and again&#8221; (<a href="/job/16-12.htm">Job 16:12-14</a>) shows the same expectation of ongoing assault.<p>&#8226; Still, Scripture affirms that God&#8217;s power is always purposeful (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>; <a href="/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>).

If he dares lift his head, he expects God to strike like a lion and unleash fresh power against him. The verse records raw, honest anguish&#8212;not unbelief. By preserving Job&#8217;s words, Scripture assures sufferers that God hears every cry, even when He seems like the adversary. The rest of the book shows that the same sovereign power Job dreads is the power that will ultimately vindicate and bless him, proving that God&#8217;s purposes, though mysterious, are trustworthy and good.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">For it increaseth.</span>--This verse is very obscure.

Or the subject is the <span class= "ital">head </span>of the former verse, "And if it exalt itself, Thou huntest me," &c.
