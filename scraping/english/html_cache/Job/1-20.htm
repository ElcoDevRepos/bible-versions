In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, standing up often signified readiness to act or speak. Job's standing up marks the beginning of his response to the devastating news he has just received.<p><b>tore his robe</b><br>Tearing one's robe was a common expression of grief and mourning in the ancient world, particularly in Hebrew culture. This act symbolized the rending of one's heart and soul in response to profound loss or distress. Similar expressions of grief are seen in <a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a> when Jacob mourns for Joseph, and in <a href="/2_samuel/1-11.htm">2 Samuel 1:11</a> when David mourns for Saul and Jonathan.<p><b>and shaved his head</b><br>Shaving the head was another traditional sign of mourning and humility. It represented the stripping away of personal glory and pride, acknowledging human frailty before God. This act is seen in other biblical contexts, such as <a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/7-29.htm">Jeremiah 7:29</a>, where it signifies deep sorrow and repentance.<p><b>He fell to the ground</b><br>Falling to the ground is an act of submission and humility, often associated with worship and prayer. It reflects Job's recognition of God's sovereignty even in the midst of his suffering. This posture is seen throughout scripture, such as in <a href="/genesis/17-3.htm">Genesis 17:3</a> when Abram falls facedown before God, and in <a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a> when Jesus falls to the ground in the Garden of Gethsemane.<p><b>and worshiped</b><br>Despite his immense loss, Job's response is one of worship, demonstrating his unwavering faith and reverence for God. This act of worship in the face of suffering is a profound testament to Job's character and faith. It echoes the call to worship God in all circumstances, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>, and prefigures the ultimate example of suffering and submission in Jesus Christ, who remained obedient to the Father even unto death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

This signals immediate, deliberate engagement with what has happened rather than collapse into paralysis.<p>&#8226; The movement mirrors David&#8217;s response when his child died&#8212;&#8220;Then David got up from the ground&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-20.htm">2 Samuel 12:20</a>). Like David, Job chooses to face his sorrow before God.<p>&#8226; Standing also prepares him for the next actions; sorrow does not immobilize faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;tore his robe</b><p>&#8226; Tearing a garment publicly expressed unbearable grief (<a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>; <a href="/joshua/7-6.htm">Joshua 7:6</a>).<p>&#8226; It is an outward sign that something inside is broken. Scripture never rebukes Job for this act; raw anguish is not the same as rebellion.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/matthew/26-65.htm">Matthew 26:65</a> the high priest tears his robes in outrage; Job tears his in mourning. Both show intensity, but Job&#8217;s is rooted in loss, not anger.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;and shaved his head</b><p>&#8226; Shaving the head was another ancient mark of mourning (<a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>; <a href="/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Before the Mosaic Law later regulated such practices (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>), this gesture carried no hint of pagan ritual for Job; it was a sincere demonstration that everything&#8212;even personal dignity&#8212;was surrendered.<p>&#8226; The act visually proclaims emptiness: without children, wealth, or servants, even his hair is removed, underscoring the truth of verse 21, &#8220;Naked I came from my mother&#8217;s womb, and naked I will depart&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He fell to the ground</b><p>&#8226; Rising to his feet earlier showed resolve; falling now shows humility. Both postures coexist in genuine faith.<p>&#8226; Similar scenes: Moses and Aaron &#8220;fell facedown&#8221; under crisis (<a href="/numbers/16-22.htm">Numbers 16:22</a>); Joshua did likewise before the Commander of the LORD&#8217;s army (<a href="/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s collapse isn&#8217;t defeat but surrender to God&#8217;s sovereignty. The ground becomes holy space where grief meets reverence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and worshiped</b><p>&#8226; Worship is the climax.

Job models that truth centuries earlier.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Job&#8217;s five rapid actions&#8212;standing, tearing his robe, shaving his head, falling, and worshiping&#8212;trace a path from shock to surrender. He fully feels his sorrow yet refuses to sever trust in God. Physical signs of mourning pour out honest grief, while humble worship proclaims unwavering faith. <a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a> teaches that the believer may weep freely, but must worship faithfully, affirming God&#8217;s unchanging worth even when every earthly blessing is gone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">And worshipped.</span>--Compare the conduct of David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-20.htm" title="Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.">2Samuel 12:20</a>) and of Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/19-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.">2Kings 19:1</a>).

After giving vent to his natural grief, Job made an act of adoration.
