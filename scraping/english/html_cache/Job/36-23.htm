In the context of the Book of Job, Elihu is speaking to Job and his friends, asserting that God's ways are beyond human understanding and control. This reflects the biblical theme that God is the ultimate authority, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13-14</a>, where it is stated that no one can instruct the Lord or be His counselor. The rhetorical question underscores that God&#8217;s plans and purposes are self-determined and not subject to human influence or direction.<p><b>or told Him, &#8216;You have done wrong&#8217;?</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the perfection and righteousness of God. It suggests that no one has the authority or the moral standing to accuse God of wrongdoing. This is consistent with the biblical portrayal of God as just and holy, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, which describes God as a "God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and upright is He." The idea that God is beyond reproach is also echoed in <a href="/romans/9-20.htm">Romans 9:20</a>, where Paul questions the right of the created to question the Creator. This phrase serves to remind believers of the importance of humility and trust in God's perfect will, even when His actions are beyond human comprehension.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

While God is thus the universal and all-perfect Teacher, there are some who would fain instruct him, dictate the course which he ought to pursue, improve and amend his universe.
