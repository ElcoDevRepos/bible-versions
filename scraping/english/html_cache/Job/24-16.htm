In ancient times, homes were often constructed with mud bricks or stone, making it feasible for thieves to dig through walls to gain entry. The darkness symbolizes evil and secrecy, a common biblical motif (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>). The act of digging through houses indicates premeditated and deliberate sin, contrasting with the light, which represents truth and righteousness (1 <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5-7</a>).<p><b>by day they shut themselves in,</b><br>This suggests that those who commit evil deeds prefer isolation during the day to avoid detection and accountability. It reflects a lifestyle of hiding and deceit, reminiscent of Adam and Eve hiding from God after their sin (<a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>). The behavior of shutting themselves in during the day indicates a rejection of community and transparency, which are valued in biblical teachings (<a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>).<p><b>never to experience the light.</b><br>This phrase underscores the spiritual blindness and moral darkness of those who choose evil. Biblically, light is often associated with God's presence and truth (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>; <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). The refusal to experience the light signifies a willful rejection of God's ways and a life devoid of His guidance. It echoes the fate of those who love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>). This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the Light of the World, offering salvation and truth to those who believe (<a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure of the Book of Job, a man of great faith and patience who endures immense suffering and questions the justice of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>In this context, those who commit crimes under the cover of darkness, representing moral and spiritual darkness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/darkness_and_light.htm">Darkness and Light</a></b><br>Symbolic elements representing evil and good, ignorance and knowledge, or sin and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_sin.htm">The Nature of Sin</a></b><br>Sin often seeks the cover of darkness to avoid exposure and accountability.

In ancient times, burglary commonly took this form. Windows were few, and high up in the walls; doors were strongly fastened with bolts and bars. But the walls, being of clay, or rubble, or sun-dried brick, were weak and easily penetrable. This was especially the case with party walls; and if burglars entered an unoccupied house, nothing was easier than to break through the slight partition which separated it from the house next door. The Greek word for "burglar" is <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>" he who digs through a wall." <span class="cmt_word">Which they had marked for themselves in the daytime</span>; rather, they <span class="accented">shut themselves up in the daytime</span>; literally, <span class="accented">they seal themselves up</span>; the meaning being that they carefully keep themselves close.
