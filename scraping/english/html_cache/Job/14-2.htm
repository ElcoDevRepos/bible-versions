In biblical times, flowers were often used as symbols of beauty and the fleeting nature of life (<a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>). The imagery of a flower suggests both the beauty and the brevity of human existence. In the context of Job, this reflects Job's lament over the shortness and suffering of life. The comparison to a flower can also be seen in <a href="/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15-16</a>, where human life is likened to grass and flowers that quickly fade.<p><b>then withers away</b><br>The withering of a flower signifies the inevitable decline and mortality of human life. This reflects the biblical theme of the fall and the consequences of sin, which brought death into the world (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>). The withering process is a natural part of life, emphasizing the inevitability of death. This imagery is consistent with the wisdom literature's focus on the brevity and challenges of life, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1-2</a>, which speaks of a time to be born and a time to die.<p><b>like a fleeting shadow</b><br>The comparison to a shadow underscores the insubstantial and temporary nature of human life. Shadows are intangible and constantly changing, much like the human condition. This metaphor is used elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/144-4.htm">Psalm 144:4</a>, which states, "Man is like a breath; his days are like a passing shadow." The fleeting nature of a shadow emphasizes the brevity and uncertainty of life, a common theme in the wisdom literature of the Bible.<p><b>he does not endure</b><br>This phrase concludes the thought by affirming the impermanence of human life. The inability to endure highlights the contrast between the eternal nature of God and the temporal nature of humanity. This is a central theme in the book of Job, where Job grapples with the realities of human suffering and mortality. The idea that man does not endure is echoed in <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which describes life as a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. This serves as a reminder of the need for reliance on God, who alone is eternal and unchanging.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and patience who undergoes severe trials and suffering. His reflections in this chapter are part of his lament about the brevity and suffering of human life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/u/uz.htm">Uz</a></b><br>The land where Job lived, often associated with the region east of Israel.

It reminds us that human life, at its beginning, is beautiful, delicate, and seemingly full of possibility.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15&#8211;16</a> echoes the same picture: &#8220;As for man, his days are like grass; he blooms like a flower of the field; the wind passes over it and it is gone.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus used flowers to illustrate God&#8217;s gracious provision in <a href="/matthew/6-28.htm">Matthew 6:28&#8211;30</a>, underscoring that while the flower is splendid, its glory is brief.<p>&#8226; The point: from a biblical standpoint, every birth is a visible testimony to God&#8217;s creative power and care (<a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13&#8211;14</a>), yet that visible burst of life is never meant to be permanent in this fallen world.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He comes forth</b><p>&#8226; The phrase stresses that our appearance in this world is real, tangible, and ordained by God (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Like a bud pushing through soil, we arrive at a set time, in a set place, by God&#8217;s design (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; This coming forth is purposeful&#8212;God &#8220;values each life&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>), even though Job is lamenting how short that life seems.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then withers away</b><p>&#8226; Just as quickly as the bloom opens, it droops. Job is painfully aware of mortality after losing his children and health (<a href="/bsb/job/1.htm">Job 1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6&#8211;8</a> reinforces the idea: &#8220;All flesh is grass&#8230; the grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God stands forever.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/1-10.htm">James 1:10&#8211;11</a> applies the same lesson, reminding believers that wealth and status cannot stop the inevitable decline.<p>&#8226; The lesson is not merely pessimistic; it reminds us to cling to the One whose Word endures, finding stability in God rather than in earthly strength.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like a fleeting shadow</b><p>&#8226; The imagery now shifts from a flower to a shadow&#8212;something insubstantial that moves with the sun and never stays put.<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/8-9.htm">Job 8:9</a> and <a href="/psalms/144-4.htm">Psalm 144:4</a> agree: &#8220;Man is like a breath; his days are like a passing shadow.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Shadows look real but have no substance. Likewise, years can appear long while we live them, yet in hindsight they seem to have slipped by unnoticed (<a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>).<p>&#8226; This drives home our dependence on the eternal God who alone is &#8220;the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He does not endure</b><p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s final clause acknowledges the hard reality: in his own strength, man cannot establish permanence.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a> reminds us, &#8220;It is appointed for man to die once, and after that to face judgment.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Yet Scripture balances this sober truth with hope: &#8220;The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/2-17.htm">1 John 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The endurance we lack in ourselves is supplied through union with Christ, who conquered death (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25&#8211;26</a>). Permanent life is found in Him alone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2</a> paints a vivid portrait of humanity: beautiful at birth, purposeful in appearing, inevitably declining, insubstantial as a shadow, and powerless to endure on its own. Cross-scripture echoes confirm the lesson&#8212;life is brief, fragile, and dependent on God. The text calls us to humbly acknowledge our mortality and to place our trust in the eternal Word and work of the Lord, who alone grants true and lasting life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down</span>. Few similes are more frequently used in Scripture (comp. <a href="/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1, 4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6, 7</a>; <a href="/james/1-10.htm">James 1:10, 11</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-24.htm">1 Peter 1:24</a>), and certainly none could have more poetic beauty. Eastern flowers do not often last much more than a day. <span class="cmt_word">He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not</span> (comp. <a href="/job/7-2.htm">Job 7:2</a>; <a href="/job/8-9.htm">Job 8:9</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-15.htm">1 Chronicles 29:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/102-11.htm">Psalm 102:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/109-23.htm">Psalm 109:23</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>, etc.). Shadows are always changing; but the shadows which flee away the fastest, and which Job has probably in his mind, are those of clouds, or other moving objects, which seem to chase each other over the earth, and never to continue for a single minute in one stay. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/14-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Like a flower,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7779;&#238;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6731.htm">Strong's 6731: </a> </span><span class="str2">Glistening, a burnished plate, a flower, a wing</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he comes forth,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1453;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3318.htm">Strong's 3318: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, bring, out, direct and proxim</span><br /><br /><span class="word">then withers away;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yim&#183;m&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5243.htm">Strong's 5243: </a> </span><span class="str2">Branch to be cut down off, circumcise </span><br /><br /><span class="word">like a fleeting shadow,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1437;&#1510;&#1468;&#1461;&#1431;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6738.htm">Strong's 6738: </a> </span><span class="str2">A shadow</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he does not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">endure.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5975.htm">Strong's 5975: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stand, in various relations</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/14-2.htm">OT Poetry: Job 14:2 He comes forth like a flower (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/14-1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 14:1"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 14:1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/14-3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 14:3"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 14:3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
