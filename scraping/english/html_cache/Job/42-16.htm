It signifies a new chapter in Job's life, following his dialogue with God and the resolution of his trials. The phrase "after this" suggests a divine intervention and a turning point, emphasizing God's sovereignty and the restoration of Job's fortunes. It also highlights the theme of endurance and faithfulness through suffering, which is a central message in the Book of Job.<p><b>Job lived 140 years</b><br>The longevity of Job's life is significant, reflecting the blessings and favor of God upon him after his trials. In the context of the ancient Near East, long life was often seen as a sign of divine blessing and approval. The number 140 is notable, as it suggests a doubling of Job's life span, paralleling the restoration of his fortunes. This mirrors the doubling of his possessions earlier in the chapter, symbolizing complete restoration and divine recompense. The extended lifespan also allows Job to witness the fulfillment of God's promises and the continuation of his lineage.<p><b>and saw his children and their children</b><br>This phrase underscores the restoration of Job's family, which was a central aspect of his earlier suffering. The ability to see one's descendants was considered a great blessing in biblical times, as it ensured the continuation of one's legacy and name. This restoration of family is a tangible sign of God's favor and a reversal of Job's earlier losses. It also reflects the biblical theme of generational blessings and the importance of family in God's covenantal promises.<p><b>to the fourth generation</b><br>Seeing descendants to the fourth generation is a significant blessing, indicating not only longevity but also the prosperity and stability of Job's family line. In biblical terms, the fourth generation represents a complete and full lineage, suggesting that Job's family was firmly established and secure. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of generational blessings and the faithfulness of God to His promises across generations. It also serves as a testament to Job's righteousness and the enduring impact of his faithfulness, as his legacy extends far beyond his own lifetime.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

It has been concluded from this statement, combined with that at the close of ver. 10, that Job was exactly seventy years of age when his calamities fell upon him ('Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 1087, note); but this is really only a conjecture, since the statement that "God added to all that had been Job's to the double," does not naturally apply to anything but his property. We may, however, fairly allow that (as Professor Lee says) he "could scarcely have been less than seventy" when his afflictions came, having then a family of ten children, who were all grown up (<a href="/job/1-4.htm">Job 1:4</a>). In this case, the whole duration of his life would have been 210 years, or a little more, which cannot be regarded as incredible by those who accept the ages of the patriarchs, from Peleg to Jacob, as respectively 239, 230, 148, 205, 175, 180, and 147 years. <span class="cmt_word">And saw his sons, and his sons' sons</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his descendants - grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.
