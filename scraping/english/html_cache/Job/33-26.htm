In the context of Job, Elihu is emphasizing that a person who turns to God in prayer can find favor, suggesting a restored relationship. The concept of finding favor with God is seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/genesis/6-8.htm">Genesis 6:8</a> where Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord. This favor is often associated with grace and mercy, indicating that God is willing to forgive and restore those who earnestly seek Him.<p><b>he sees God&#8217;s face and shouts for joy,</b><br>Seeing God's face is a metaphor for experiencing His presence and favor. In the ancient Near Eastern context, seeing the face of a king was a sign of acceptance and favor. Similarly, in biblical terms, it signifies a close and personal relationship with God. The joy that follows is a natural response to the assurance of God's presence and approval. This echoes the joy expressed in <a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>, where being in God's presence is associated with fullness of joy.<p><b>and God restores His righteousness to that man.</b><br>Restoration of righteousness implies a return to a state of right standing with God. In the context of Job, this suggests that God is willing to forgive and restore those who repent and seek Him. This restoration is not based on human merit but on God's grace. Theologically, this points to the concept of justification, where God declares a sinner righteous through faith, as seen in <a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22-24</a>. This also foreshadows the work of Jesus Christ, who restores righteousness to believers through His sacrificial death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering a perspective that emphasizes God's justice and righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith who undergoes severe trials and suffering, questioning God's justice but ultimately remaining faithful.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Almighty, who is sovereign and just, and who ultimately restores Job's fortunes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_suffering.htm">The Suffering</a></b><br>The context of Job's trials, which serve as a backdrop for Elihu's discourse on God's justice and mercy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/restoration.htm">Restoration</a></b><br>The event of God restoring Job's righteousness and fortunes, symbolizing divine favor and forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer.htm">The Power of Prayer</a></b><br>Prayer is a means of communication with God that can lead to divine favor and restoration.
