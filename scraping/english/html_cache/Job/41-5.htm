In the ancient Near Eastern context, birds were commonly kept as pets, symbolizing gentleness and control. The rhetorical question highlights the untamable nature of Leviathan, contrasting it with the ease of handling a bird. This imagery underscores God's power over creation, as only He can control such a formidable creature. The Leviathan is often seen as a symbol of chaos, and its mention here emphasizes God's sovereignty over all chaos and disorder.<p><b>or put him on a leash for your maidens?</b><br>The idea of putting Leviathan on a leash suggests domestication and subjugation, which was a common practice for animals in ancient times, especially for those used in labor or as pets. The mention of "maidens" implies a scenario where even the most vulnerable or least powerful members of society could control the creature, further emphasizing the absurdity of the notion. This serves to highlight the immense power and majesty of God, who alone can control Leviathan. In a broader biblical context, this reflects themes of divine authority and the futility of human attempts to rival God's power, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/27.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>, where Leviathan is also mentioned.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A righteous man tested by God through immense suffering, including loss of wealth, health, and family.

The picture is of a child stroking a tame parakeet&#8212;something gentle, harmless, easily mastered.<p>&#8211; Leviathan is anything but gentle. <a href="/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1-2</a> has already pictured this sea creature as untouchable; even the bravest turn back. <a href="/psalms/104-26.htm">Psalm 104:26</a> echoes the thought: &#8220;There the ships pass, and Leviathan, which You formed to frolic there.&#8221; The sea monster &#8220;frolics&#8221; where humans merely pass through, stressing our smallness.<p>&#8211; The question presses Job to admit a hard truth: if we cannot stroke Leviathan, how could we ever think to command the God who made him? <a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4-11</a> had shown the same contrast when God bounded the roaring sea, a feat no human could dream of repeating.<p>&#8211; The Lord&#8217;s rhetorical &#8220;Can you&#8230;?&#8221; amounts to &#8220;You can&#8217;t.&#8221; Its purpose is to humble, just as <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a> calls us to &#8220;Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will exalt you.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or put him on a leash for your maidens?</b><p>&#8211; The second image is even more striking: not only can Job not leash Leviathan, he certainly can&#8217;t hand the leash to his daughters for a leisurely walk. Picture a colossal dragon-like beast dragged along by giggling girls&#8212;absurd on its face.<p>&#8211; Earlier the LORD asked, &#8220;Can you pull in Leviathan with a hook, or tie down his tongue with a rope?&#8221; (<a href="/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1</a>). The answer was already no; now the impossibility is magnified. Humans can collar a dog, hitch an ox, even tame a falcon (<a href="/job/39-26.htm">Job 39:26</a>). Leviathan lies forever outside that range.<p>&#8211; Throughout Scripture the only One who &#8220;puts on a leash&#8221; such forces is God Himself. <a href="/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a> prophesies that the LORD &#8220;will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent.&#8221; <a href="/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a> pictures the dragon&#8212;Satan&#8212;seized and bound. Such ultimate mastery belongs to God alone.<p>&#8211; The maidens in the verse remind us that even the most vulnerable members of society would be safe if Leviathan could be leashed. Since that is impossible, safety and order must come from the LORD, not from human ingenuity (<a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/41-5.htm">Job 41:5</a> uses two vivid, almost humorous questions to expose human limits and exalt divine sovereignty. We cannot stroke Leviathan like a pet bird, nor hand him over to our daughters on a leash. If no one can domesticate this single creature, how much less can we control the Almighty who formed him. The verse calls us to humility, awe, and trust&#8212;acknowledging that the God who commands the untamable also cares for His people and deserves our complete surrender.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wilt thou play with him as with a bird?</span> The Egyptians were especially fond of pet animals, and Job's countrymen, it may be assumed, were the same. Besides dogs, we find the Egyptians keeping tame antelopes, leopards, and monkeys. A tame crocodile would certainly seem to be an extraordinary pet, but Herodotus says that the Egyptians tamed them (2:39), and Sir Gardner Wilkinson informed me that he had known some tame ones at Cairo. The Mesopotamian Arabs domesticate falcons to assist them in the chase of the bustard and the gazelle (Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' pp. 481-483).
