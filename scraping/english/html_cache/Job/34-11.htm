This concept is rooted in the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, such as <a href="/proverbs/24-12.htm">Proverbs 24:12</a>, which states that God will repay each person according to their deeds. The idea of retributive justice is also seen in the Mosaic Law, where blessings and curses are contingent upon obedience or disobedience (Deuteronomy 28). This reflects the broader biblical theme that God is just and fair in His dealings with humanity.<p><b>according to a man&#8217;s ways He brings consequences.</b><br>The term "ways" refers to the overall conduct and lifestyle of an individual. This phrase underscores the biblical teaching that one's life choices have inherent consequences, aligning with the principle of sowing and reaping found in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>. The concept of divine recompense is not only a theme in the Old Testament but is also affirmed in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches about the final judgment and the separation of the righteous and the wicked (<a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>). This reflects the consistent biblical message that God holds individuals accountable for their actions, and it serves as a call to live righteously.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering a perspective on God's justice and righteousness.

Jesus said, &#8220;Every good tree bears good fruit&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-17.htm">Matthew 7:17</a>). In other words, our outward actions testify to our inward condition.<p>&#8226; Deeds reveal whether faith is genuine (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>). They do not earn salvation, yet they demonstrate the reality of it (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He repays him</b><p>&#8226; God is perfectly just; He &#8220;shows no partiality and accepts no bribe&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>).

God "rewardeth every man according to his work" (Psalm 62:13), renders to each one good or evil, according as his own deeds have been the one or the other. But this must be understood of the man's <span class="accented">whole</span> conduct, and God's <span class="accented">entire</span> treatment of him. Such an absolute rectitude of God's moral government, considered as a whole, is implied and involved in his absolute and perfect justice. <span class="cmt_word">And cause every man to find according to his ways</span>. We "find according to our ways" when, having "ploughed iniquity, and sown wickedness, we reap the same" (<a href="/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>), or when, on the other hand, having "sown in righteousness, we reap in mercy" (<a href="/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>). Exact retribution is the law of God's rule; but the exactness cannot be seen, or tested, or demonstrated in this life.
