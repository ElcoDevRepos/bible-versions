In ancient times, bronze was a symbol of strength and resilience. The use of "tubes of bronze" suggests a structure that is both strong and hollow, indicating a combination of power and flexibility. This imagery aligns with descriptions of other mighty creatures in the Bible, such as Leviathan in <a href="/job/41.htm">Job 41</a>. The reference to bronze also connects to the construction of the Tabernacle and Temple, where bronze was used for items requiring durability, such as the altar (<a href="/exodus/27.htm">Exodus 27:1-2</a>). This metaphor emphasizes the creature's formidable nature, reflecting God's power in creation.<p><b>his limbs are rods of iron.</b><br>Iron, in biblical times, was known for its strength and was used for tools and weapons, symbolizing power and invincibility. The comparison of the creature's limbs to "rods of iron" underscores its immense strength and stability. This imagery is reminiscent of the strength of nations and rulers, as seen in <a href="/daniel/2-40.htm">Daniel 2:40</a>, where the fourth kingdom is described as strong as iron. The use of iron also points to the enduring nature of God's creation, as iron was a material that could withstand significant force and pressure. This phrase highlights the creature's robustness and serves as a reminder of the Creator's unmatched power and sovereignty over all creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, Job is the central figure in the Book of Job.

Bronze in Scripture often symbolizes durability and strength (<a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15&#8211;16</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/1-7.htm">Ezekiel 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The comparison to bronze highlights unyielding skeletal power. We picture bones that do not splinter easily but stand firm under great weight&#8212;reinforcing God&#8217;s point in <a href="/job/40-15.htm">Job 40:15</a> &#8211; 17 that behemoth is &#8220;chief of the works of God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The thought carries us to <a href="/psalms/18-34.htm">Psalm 18:34</a>, where David says, &#8220;He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.&#8221; Just as a bronze bow is nearly impossible to bend without exceptional strength, so the behemoth&#8217;s very frame is nearly unbreakable.<p>&#8226; Setting behemoth&#8217;s design alongside human frailty helps Job see the gap between creature and Creator. Only the One who forged bones like bronze can claim ultimate power (<a href="/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28&#8211;31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his limbs are rods of iron</b><p>&#8226; The verse continues, &#8220;his limbs are rods of iron.&#8221; Iron is another biblical emblem of strength and impenetrability (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>). While bronze focuses on skeletal density, iron emphasizes muscular and joint strength&#8212;every limb functions like an iron bar.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a> speaks of Christ who &#8220;will rule them with an iron scepter.&#8221; Iron imagery conveys unbreakable authority and control, mirroring the behemoth&#8217;s massive limbs that no human can restrain (<a href="/job/40-24.htm">Job 40:24</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a> echoes, &#8220;You will break them with an iron scepter; You will shatter them like pottery.&#8221; When these iron metaphors resurface, they draw us back to divine sovereignty. If men cannot subdue an animal with iron-like limbs, how much less can they challenge the God who made it?<p>&#8226; The verse underscores a lesson Job needs: human limitations contrast sharply with God&#8217;s limitless might (<a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4&#8211;11</a>). Job cannot master behemoth, but the Lord who outfitted that creature with ironlike limbs holds total mastery over all creation (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/40-18.htm">Job 40:18</a> paints a vivid portrait of behemoth&#8217;s invincible frame&#8212;bones like bronze, limbs like iron&#8212;to showcase God&#8217;s unequaled power in creation. Each metal simile reminds us that what overwhelms human strength is effortlessly fashioned by the Lord. Confronted with this reality, Job&#8212;and we&#8212;are invited to rest in the sheer greatness of the God whose work proves both His authority and His care over all He has made.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/40.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(</span>18<span class= "ital">)</span> <span class= "bld">Strong pieces.</span>--Or, perhaps, <span class= "ital">tubes. </span>His limbs are like bars of iron.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His bones are as strong pieces of brass</span>; rather, as <span class="accented">tubes of bronze.</span> The great thigh-bones - <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of the Greeks - are probably intended.
