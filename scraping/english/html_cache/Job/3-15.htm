In the ancient Near Eastern context, princes were often associated with wealth and power, symbolized by gold. Gold was a highly valued commodity, often used in trade and as a measure of wealth. The mention of princes suggests a status of honor and authority, which Job contrasts with his own state of misery. Biblically, gold is frequently associated with kingship and divine glory, as seen in the construction of the Tabernacle and Solomon's Temple (<a href="/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>; <a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20-22</a>). This connection underscores the idea of a life of ease and prosperity, which Job longs for in his suffering.<p><b>who filled their houses with silver</b><br>Silver, like gold, was a symbol of wealth and prosperity in the ancient world. It was used as currency and in trade, and having houses filled with silver indicates immense wealth and success. In biblical times, silver was often used in the making of sacred objects and in the payment of tribute (<a href="/genesis/23-16.htm">Genesis 23:16</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21</a>). The imagery of houses filled with silver suggests a life of abundance and security, contrasting sharply with Job's current state of loss and despair. This phrase also highlights the transient nature of wealth, as Job's previous prosperity has been stripped away, echoing the biblical theme that material wealth is fleeting (<a href="/proverbs/23-5.htm">Proverbs 23:5</a>). The longing for such a state reflects Job's deep desire for relief from his suffering and a return to a life of peace and stability.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Job&#8217;s wish to have died and rested alongside wealthy princes is less about envy and more about relief: in the grave, the burdens that afflict him now would cease, and the worldly advantages that separate people in life would no longer matter. The verse therefore invites us to hold earthly success loosely and find ultimate hope in God, not in the fleeting security of wealth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver</span>. This may either mean simply," princes who were rich in silver and gold during their lifetime," or "princes who have gold and silver buried with them in their tombs." It was the custom in Egypt, in Phoenicia, and elsewhere throughout the East, to bury large quantities of treasure, especially gold and silver vessels, and jewellery, in the sepulchres of kings and other great men. A tomb of a Scythian king in the Crimea, opened about fifty years ago, contained a golden shield, a golden diadem, two silver vases, a vase in electrum, and a number of ornaments, partly in electrum and partly in gold (see the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 3. p. 59, 3rd edit.). Another Scythian tomb near the Caspian, opened by the Russian authorities, contained ornaments set with rubies and emeralds, together with four sheets of gold, weighing forty pounds. A third, near Asterabad, contained a golden goblet, weighing seventy ounces; a pot, eleven ounces, and two small trumpets. The tombs of the kings and queens in Egypt were so richly supplied with treasure that, in the time of the twentieth dynasty, a thieves' society was formed for plundering them, especially of their golden ornaments (Brugsch, 'History of Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 247, 1st edit.). The tomb of Cyrus the Great contained, we are told (Arrian, 'Exp. Alex.,' 6:29), a golden couch, a golden table set out with drinking-cups, a golden bowl, and much elegant clothing adorned with gems. Phoenician tombs, in Cyprus especially, have recently yielded enormous treasures (Di Cesnola, 'Cyprus,' pp. 310-316). If the "gold" and "silver" of the present passage refer to treasures buried with princes and kings, we must understand by the "houses" of the second clause their tombs. The Egyptians called their tombs their "eternal abodes" (Diod. Sic., 1:51). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/3-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">or</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_176.htm">Strong's 176: </a> </span><span class="str2">Desire, if</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;i&#183;m&#183;&#347;&#257;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5973.htm">Strong's 5973: </a> </span><span class="str2">With, equally with</span><br /><br /><span class="word">princes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1453;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8269.htm">Strong's 8269: </a> </span><span class="str2">Chieftain, chief, ruler, official, captain, prince</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who had gold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1443;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#257;&#183;h&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2091.htm">Strong's 2091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gold, something gold-colored, as oil, a clear sky</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who filled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1469;&#1502;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mal&#183;&#8217;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Verb - Piel - Participle - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4390.htm">Strong's 4390: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fill, be full of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their houses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;t&#183;t&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with silver.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1505;&#1462;&#1507;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;&#183;sep&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3701.htm">Strong's 3701: </a> </span><span class="str2">Silver, money</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/3-15.htm">Job 3:15 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/3-15.htm">Job 3:15 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/3-15.htm">Job 3:15 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/3-15.htm">Job 3:15 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/3-15.htm">Job 3:15 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/3-15.htm">Job 3:15  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/3-15.htm">Job 3:15 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/3-15.htm">Job 3:15 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/3-15.htm">Job 3:15 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/3-15.htm">Job 3:15 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/3-15.htm">OT Poetry: Job 3:15 Or with princes who had gold who (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/3-14.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 3:14"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 3:14" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/3-16.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 3:16"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 3:16" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
