Once a respected figure, he is now the subject of ridicule. This reflects the theme of reversal of fortunes, a common motif in wisdom literature. Job's lamentation here echoes the broader biblical theme of the righteous suffering unjustly, as seen in the lives of figures like Joseph and David.<p><b>men younger than I am</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, age was associated with wisdom and respect. Younger men mocking an elder would have been seen as a significant social disgrace. This highlights Job's fall from a position of honor to one of derision, emphasizing the depth of his suffering and the loss of his former status.<p><b>whose fathers I would have refused to put with my sheep dogs</b><br>Job is emphasizing the low status of those mocking him by comparing them to individuals he would not have trusted even with the lowest of tasks. In the ancient world, shepherding was a humble occupation, and sheep dogs were considered lowly animals. This phrase underscores the irony and injustice of Job's situation, where those of lesser status now feel emboldened to mock him. This can be seen as a reflection of the broader biblical theme of the proud being humbled and the humble being exalted, as seen in the teachings of Jesus in the Gospels.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and integrity, who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

Having drawn the portrait of himself as he was, rich, honoured, blessed with children, flourishing, in favour with both God and man, Job now presents himself to us as he is, despised of men (vers. 1-10), afflicted of God (ver. 11), a prey to vague terrors (ver. 15), tortured with bodily pains (vers. 17, 18), cast off by God (vers. 19, 20), with nothing but death to look for (vers. 23-31).

As Job had been speaking last of the honour in which he was once held, he beans his contrast by chewing how at present he is disgraced and derided.

There seem to have been in his vicinity weak and debased tribes, generally contemned and looked down upon, regarded as thieves (ver. 5) by their neighbours, and considered to be of base and vile origin (ver. 8), who saw in Job's calamities a rare opportunity for insulting and triumphing over a member of the superior race which had crushed them, and thus tasting, to a certain extent, the sweetness of revenge. <span class="cmt_word">Whose fathers I would have disdained</span> (rather, I <span class="accented">disdained</span>) <span class="cmt_word">to have set with the dogs of my flock</span>.
