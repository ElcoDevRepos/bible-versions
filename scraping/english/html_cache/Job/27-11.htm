This reflects the wisdom tradition in ancient Israel, where elders and those with experience would impart knowledge to others. The "power of God" here can be seen as a reference to God's sovereignty and might, which is a central theme throughout the Book of Job. Job's friends have failed to accurately represent God's power, often attributing suffering directly to personal sin. Job seeks to correct this by highlighting God's inscrutable and sovereign nature. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative where God's power is demonstrated in creation (Genesis 1), in the deliverance of Israel (Exodus 14), and ultimately in the resurrection of Jesus Christ (<a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>).<p><b>I will not conceal the ways of the Almighty.</b><br>Job's commitment to not concealing the ways of God suggests transparency and truthfulness in his testimony about God's character and actions. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, revealing divine truths was often the role of prophets and wise men. Job positions himself as one who speaks truthfully about God, contrasting with his friends who have misrepresented God's justice and mercy. The "ways of the Almighty" encompass God's actions and purposes, which are often beyond human understanding (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of God's ways through Jesus Christ, who fully reveals the Father (<a href="/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>) and whose life and teachings illuminate the path to understanding God's will and character.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and patience who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

But the hypotheses which would make Job irresponsible for the present utterance and fix on him, as his steadfast conviction, the opposite theory, are unsatisfactory and have no solid basis. To suppose that Zophar is the real speaker is to imagine the absolute loss and suppression of two entire verses - one between vers. 10 and 11, assigning the speech to him, and another at the beginning of ch. 28, reintroducing Job and making him once more the interlocutor. That this should have happened by accident is inconceivable. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> To ascribe it to intentional corruption by a Hebrew redactor, bent on maintaining the old orthodox view, and on falsely and wickedly giving the authority of Job to it (Froude 'Short Studies on Great Subjects,' vol. 1. p. 316), is to take away all authority from the existing text of the Hebrew Scriptures, and to open a door to any amount of wild suggestion and conjectural emendation. The other hypothesis - that of Eichhorn - that Job is here simply anticipating what his adversaries will say, though a less dangerous view, is untenable, since Job never does this without following up his statement of the adversaries' ease with a reply, and here is no reply whatever, but a simple turning away, after ver. 23, to another subject. The explanation of the contradiction by supposing that Job's former statement was tentative and controversial, or else hasty and ill-considered, and that now, to prevent misconception, he determines to set himself right, is, on the other hand, thoroughly defensible, and receives a strong support from the remarkable introduction in ver. 11, which "prepares us, if not for a recantation, yet (at any rate) for a modification of statements wrung from the speaker when his words flowed over from a spirit drunk with the poison of God's arrows" (see the remarks of Canon Cook, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 90, which are in substantial agreement with those of Ewald said Dillmann). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will teach you by</span> (or, concerning) <span class="cmt_word">the hand of God</span>. Job is now at last about to deliver his real sentiments respecting God's dealings with men in the world, and prefaces his. remarks with this solemn introduction, to draw special attention to them. He is aware that his previous statements on the subject, especially in <a href="/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2-24</a>, have been overstrained and exaggerated, and wishes, now that he is uttering his last words (<a href="/job/31-40.htm">Job 31:40</a>), to correct his previous hasty utterances, and put on record his true views. <span class="cmt_word">That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal</span>.
