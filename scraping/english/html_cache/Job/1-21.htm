It sets the tone for the entire book, highlighting Job's faith and submission to God's sovereignty. Job's statement is a declaration of his understanding of human existence and divine providence.<p><b>Naked I came from my mother&#8217;s womb,</b><br>Job acknowledges the reality of human life, beginning with nothing. This reflects the biblical theme of human humility and dependence on God. It echoes <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:15</a>, which speaks of leaving the world as we came, emphasizing the transient nature of earthly possessions.<p><b>and naked I will return.</b><br>This phrase underscores the inevitability of death and the futility of material wealth. It aligns with <a href="/1_timothy/6-7.htm">1 Timothy 6:7</a>, which states that we bring nothing into the world and can take nothing out. It also reflects the cultural understanding of life and death in the ancient Near East, where burial customs often involved returning to the earth.<p><b>The LORD gave,</b><br>Job recognizes God as the ultimate source of all blessings. This reflects the biblical principle that every good and perfect gift comes from above (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). It also highlights the sovereignty of God in distributing wealth and blessings according to His will.<p><b>and the LORD has taken away.</b><br>Job attributes his losses to God's sovereign will, demonstrating his acceptance of God's authority over all aspects of life. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's control over both prosperity and adversity, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>, where God declares His power to give life and take it away.<p><b>Blessed be the name of the LORD.</b><br>Despite his suffering, Job chooses to praise God, exemplifying unwavering faith and trust. This reflects the biblical call to worship God in all circumstances, as seen in <a href="/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34:1</a>, which encourages continual praise. Job's response foreshadows the ultimate example of submission and trust in God's plan, as seen in Jesus Christ's acceptance of His suffering and crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

There is some difficulty in the word "thither," since no man returns to his mother's womb (<a href="/john/3-4.htm">John 3:4</a>), at death or otherwise. The expression must not be pressed. It arises out of the analogy, constantly felt and acknowledged, between "mother" earth and a man's actual mother (setup. Psalm 129:15). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away</span>. Job is here represented as knowing God by his name "Jehovah," though elsewhere the "great Name" appears once only in the words of Job (<a href="/job/12-9.htm">Job 12:9</a>), and never in the words of his friends. The natural <span class="accented">conclusion is</span> that the name was known in the land of Uz at the time, but was very rarely used - scarcely, except in moments of excitement. <span class="cmt_word">Blessed be the Name of the Lord</span>; literally, <span class="accented">may the Name of Jehovah be blessed!</span> The ermphatic word is kept for the last. According to Satan, Job was to have" cursed God to his face" (ver. 11). The event is that he openly and resolutely blesses God. That the same word is used in its two opposite senses rather accentuates the antithesis. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/1-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">saying:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
