In the context of Job, it reflects Job's understanding of God's supreme authority and the awe-inspiring nature of His presence. The term "majesty" is often associated with kingship and divine authority, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/93.htm">Psalm 93:1</a>, where God's majesty is linked to His reign over the earth. The idea of being terrified by God's majesty is consistent with the biblical theme of the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). This fear is not merely about being scared but involves a deep reverence and respect for God's holiness and power. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, kings were often seen as divine or semi-divine figures, and their majesty would indeed inspire fear and respect among their subjects. This reflects the broader biblical narrative where God's majesty is unparalleled and demands a response of humility and reverence.<p><b>Would the dread of Him not fall upon you?</b><br>The "dread" of God refers to a profound sense of awe and fear in the presence of His holiness and justice. This concept is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>, where Isaiah is overwhelmed by the vision of God's holiness. The dread of God is not just about fear of punishment but also an acknowledgment of His moral perfection and the human inability to stand before Him without His grace. In the historical context of Job, this dread would be understood as a natural response to the divine, especially in a culture where the gods were often seen as capricious and powerful. However, the God of Israel is depicted as just and righteous, and His dread is tied to His moral authority. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, who embodies both the majesty and the approachable nature of God. While Christ's first coming was marked by humility, His second coming will reveal His full majesty and power, as described in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>, where the nations will indeed experience the dread of His righteous judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

At Sinai, &#8220;all the people trembled&#8221; when God descended in fire (<a href="/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah, upon seeing the Lord &#8220;high and exalted,&#8221; cried, &#8220;Woe to me! I am ruined!&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Even John, the beloved disciple, &#8220;fell at His feet as though dead&#8221; when he saw the risen Christ (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>).<p>Every one of these encounters underscores what Job affirms: God&#8217;s majesty is not merely impressive; it is overwhelming. When we grasp how infinitely above us He is, fear is not a flaw but a right response. The verse assumes this reaction is natural, not optional, and implies that Job&#8217;s friends have forgotten it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Would the dread of Him not fall upon you?</b><p>Job deepens the thought by switching from majesty to dread, emphasizing the personal impact of God&#8217;s holiness.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/76-7.htm">Psalm 76:7</a> asks, &#8220;You alone are to be feared. Who can stand before You when You are angry?&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28-29</a>, addressing believers, urges reverence &#8220;for our God is a consuming fire.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The same balance appears in <a href="/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3-4</a>: &#8220;If You, O LORD, kept a record of sins, who could stand? But with You there is forgiveness, that You may be feared.&#8221;<p>Job&#8217;s point: authentic knowledge of God doesn&#8217;t lead to casual talk about Him. It produces a holy dread that &#8220;falls upon&#8221; us&#8212;an experience that humbles, silences, and corrects. In effect, Job challenges his friends: if you truly stood before God, would you still deliver pat answers and tidy theology? The dread of the Lord strips away presumption and fosters honesty, the very thing Job longs for in their conversation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/13-11.htm">Job 13:11</a> calls us to remember that God&#8217;s revealed majesty naturally terrifies and His holy dread rightly falls upon all who encounter Him. Scripture affirms this reflex from Sinai to the throne room of Revelation. Recognizing it guards us from shallow speech about the Almighty and drives us toward humble, reverent honesty before Him and with one another.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall not his excellency make you afraid! and his dread fall upon you?</span> Will not the very excellency and perfection of God cause you all the more to fear, since they will be arrayed against you?
