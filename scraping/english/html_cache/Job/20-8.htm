In biblical context, dreams often symbolize things that are temporary or insubstantial (<a href="/psalms/73-20.htm">Psalm 73:20</a>). The imagery of flying away emphasizes the suddenness and complete disappearance of the wicked's influence and wealth. This reflects the broader biblical theme that earthly riches and power are transient (<a href="/proverbs/23-5.htm">Proverbs 23:5</a>). The use of "dream" also connects to the idea that what seems real and substantial in the moment can quickly vanish upon waking, much like the temporary success of the unrighteous.<p><b>never to be found</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the finality of the wicked's downfall. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, being forgotten or having no lasting legacy was considered a severe misfortune. The Bible often contrasts the fate of the wicked with the righteous, who are remembered and honored (<a href="/proverbs/10-7.htm">Proverbs 10:7</a>). The phrase implies a complete erasure from memory and history, aligning with the biblical principle that only what is done for God endures (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-12.htm">1 Corinthians 3:12-15</a>).<p><b>he will be chased away like a vision in the night</b><br>The imagery of being "chased away" suggests divine judgment and the active removal of the wicked from their place of prominence. Visions in the night, like dreams, are transient and often carry messages of warning or revelation (<a href="/daniel/2-19.htm">Daniel 2:19</a>). This phrase may imply that the wicked's removal is both inevitable and divinely orchestrated. The night symbolizes darkness and uncertainty, reinforcing the idea that the wicked's apparent success is illusory and destined to vanish. This aligns with the biblical theme of light overcoming darkness (<a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>), where the righteous ultimately prevail through God's justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zophar_the_naamathite.htm">Zophar the Naamathite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.
