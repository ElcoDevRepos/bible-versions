This reflects the biblical theme of God's transcendence and the imperfection of all creation in comparison to Him. In <a href="/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18</a>, a similar sentiment is expressed, emphasizing that God charges His angels with error. This underscores the idea that all created beings, regardless of their status, fall short of God's glory (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>).<p><b>if even the heavens are not pure in His eyes</b><br>The heavens, often seen as the epitome of purity and perfection, are here described as impure in the sight of God. This reflects the biblical understanding of God's absolute holiness and the pervasive impact of sin on creation. The heavens, though majestic and awe-inspiring, are still part of the created order and thus subject to the corruption introduced by sin (<a href="/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20-22</a>). This phrase also points to the need for a new creation, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a> and fulfilled in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>, where a new heaven and a new earth are established, free from the taint of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

Even they live under the divine gaze that discerns any hint of imperfection.<p>&#8226; Scripture records the fall of some angels (<a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>; Jude 6). Their rebellion proved that creaturely holiness is derivative, never equal to God&#8217;s.<p>&#8226; The point is not that God doubts or second-guesses Himself. Rather, the verse highlights that His righteousness is so absolute that He relies on no created being to validate His own integrity.<p>&#8226; By affirming this truth, Eliphaz (though misapplying it to Job) underscores a foundational doctrine: only God is essentially, inherently, and independently holy (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If even the heavens are not pure in His eyes</b><p>&#8220;Eliphaz adds, &#8216;even the heavens are not pure in His eyes&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/job/15-15.htm">Job 15:15</a>b), widening the lens from angelic beings to the entire created order.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;heavens&#8221; include the cosmic realm&#8212;sun, moon, stars&#8212;everything above the earth (<a href="/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; Though the heavens declare God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>), they are still created and therefore finite. They bear the marks of a universe subjected to futility since the fall (<a href="/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/24-5.htm">Isaiah 24:5</a> notes that &#8220;the earth is defiled under its inhabitants,&#8221; and <a href="/hebrews/1-10.htm">Hebrews 1:10&#8211;12</a> teaches that the heavens &#8220;will wear out like a garment.&#8221;<p>&#8226; If the vast, majestic expanse of space cannot meet God&#8217;s perfect standard of purity, sinful humanity certainly cannot on its own (<a href="/job/25-5.htm">Job 25:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; By invoking the heavens, Eliphaz tries to magnify the distance between God&#8217;s perfection and human frailty. While his application to Job is flawed, the principle itself is sound: creation, however awe-inspiring, is tainted when measured against the Creator&#8217;s spotless glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/15-15.htm">Job 15:15</a> underscores the infinite holiness of God by showing that He places no ultimate trust in even the most exalted creatures and that the very heavens fall short of His flawless purity. Angels may be called &#8220;holy,&#8221; and the skies may proclaim His handiwork, yet only God Himself embodies holiness in its absolute sense. The verse pushes us to marvel at the Creator&#8217;s unrivaled righteousness and to remember that, apart from His grace, no created thing can stand unblemished before Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Behold.</span>--Comp. <a href="/job/4-18.htm" title="Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:">Job 4:18</a>; <a href="/job/5-5.htm" title="Whose harvest the hungry eats up, and takes it even out of the thorns, and the robber swallows up their substance.">Job 5:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in his holy ones</span> (see the Revised Version).

Eliphaz here, as in <a href="/job/5-1.htm">Job 5:1</a>, speaks not of holy men, but of the holy angels. Without taxing them with sin, he is strongly convinced of their imperfection - their defective wisdom (<a href="/job/5-18.htm">Job 5:18</a>), weakness, and untrustworthiness. His views are decidedly peculiar, and not borne out by the rest of Scripture. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.</span> The material heavens are probably intended. That limpid liquid blue in which the human eye sees no stain or speck, to the Divine eye is tinged with uncleanness The idea is that neither animate nor inanimate nature contains any form of being that is absolutely without spot or blemish.
