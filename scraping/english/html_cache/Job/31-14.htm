The concept of God as the ultimate judge is rooted in passages like <a href="/psalms/9-7.htm">Psalm 9:7-8</a>, where God is depicted as sitting on His throne to judge the world in righteousness. Job's rhetorical question underscores his understanding of God's sovereignty and justice. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, divine judgment was a common belief, but Job's monotheistic view sets the God of Israel apart as the sole arbiter of justice. This anticipates the New Testament teaching of Christ as the judge of the living and the dead (<a href="/acts/10-42.htm">Acts 10:42</a>).<p><b>How will I answer when called to account?</b><br>Job's concern about how he will respond when held accountable by God highlights the biblical principle of personal responsibility before the Creator. This echoes the teaching found in <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>, where each person is said to give an account of themselves to God. The phrase suggests a courtroom setting, a common metaphor in Scripture for divine judgment, as seen in passages like <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>, where the dead are judged according to their deeds. Job's introspection and desire for integrity foreshadow the New Testament emphasis on living a life worthy of the calling received in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/4.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
