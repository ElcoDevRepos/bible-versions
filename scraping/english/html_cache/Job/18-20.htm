The term "appalled" suggests a deep sense of shock and dismay at the fate of the wicked, as described in the preceding verses. This reaction underscores the universal recognition of divine justice, as even those far removed geographically are moved by the severity of God's judgment. The cultural context of the time placed significant emphasis on reputation and legacy, and the downfall of a once-prosperous individual would have been a cautionary tale. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of the fear of the Lord being the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), as the consequences of wickedness serve as a warning to all.<p><b>while those in the east tremble in horror</b><br>The "east" likely refers to regions such as Mesopotamia or Arabia, areas known for their wisdom and wealth in the ancient world. The phrase "tremble in horror" indicates a visceral, fear-driven response to the fate of the wicked. This reaction is not just emotional but also spiritual, as it reflects an understanding of the power and righteousness of God. The trembling can be seen as a form of reverence, acknowledging that no one is beyond the reach of divine justice. This mirrors the biblical narrative where fear of God's judgment leads to repentance and humility, as seen in the story of Nineveh's repentance in <a href="/jonah/3.htm">Jonah 3</a>. The east's reaction also serves as a reminder of the pervasive nature of God's sovereignty, transcending cultural and geographical boundaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bildad_the_shuhite.htm">Bildad the Shuhite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him but ends up arguing that Job's suffering is due to his own sin.
