Elihu is addressing Job's complaints and questions about the justice of God. In the context of the Book of Job, Job has been questioning the reasons for his suffering and the apparent lack of divine justice. Elihu's role is to offer a different perspective, suggesting that Job's questioning of God's justice is misguided. This reflects a common theme in wisdom literature, where questioning and seeking understanding are central, yet the ultimate wisdom is seen as trusting in God's sovereignty.<p><b>&#8216;What does it profit me,</b><br>This part of the verse reflects a common human concern about the value of righteousness and obedience to God. In the ancient Near Eastern context, prosperity and well-being were often seen as signs of divine favor. Job's suffering challenges this notion, as he is a righteous man who experiences great loss. The question of profit or benefit from righteousness is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, where the psalmist struggles with the prosperity of the wicked. The underlying issue is the tension between temporal and eternal perspectives on reward and justice.<p><b>and what benefit do I gain</b><br>Here, the focus is on the tangible benefits of living a righteous life. In the cultural context of the time, blessings were often understood in material terms&#8212;wealth, health, and family. Job's experience challenges this understanding, as he loses all these despite his righteousness. This phrase invites readers to consider the deeper, spiritual benefits of righteousness that may not be immediately visible. The New Testament further develops this idea, emphasizing spiritual rewards and eternal life as the ultimate benefits of faithfulness to God (e.g., <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p><b>apart from sin?&#8217;</b><br>This phrase highlights the contrast between living a life of righteousness and one of sin. Elihu suggests that Job's questioning implies that there is no benefit to righteousness if it does not lead to immediate, tangible rewards. Theologically, this touches on the concept of sin as separation from God and the ultimate source of human suffering. The question challenges readers to consider the intrinsic value of righteousness and the inherent consequences of sin. In the broader biblical narrative, this points to the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who offers reconciliation with God and eternal life, transcending the temporal benefits or sufferings of this world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering a different perspective on Job's suffering.

Scripture consistently teaches that living apart from sin brings lasting advantage&#8212;earthly peace of conscience, divine favor, and eternal reward&#8212;while sin yields death and loss. The verse invites believers to trust God&#8217;s justice, knowing He sees, records, and ultimately rewards every act of faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thou saidst What advantage will it be unto thee?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> What advantage will thy righteousness be unto thee?
