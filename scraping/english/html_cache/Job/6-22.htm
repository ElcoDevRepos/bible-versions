This rhetorical question highlights Job's integrity and self-sufficiency. In the broader context of the Book of Job, Job is responding to Eliphaz's earlier speech, where Eliphaz suggests that Job's suffering might be due to some hidden sin. Job's question implies that he has not been a burden to others, nor has he exploited his relationships for personal gain.<p><b>&#8216;Give me something;</b><br>Job emphasizes that he has not asked for material support or assistance from his friends. This reflects the cultural value of self-reliance and honor in ancient Near Eastern societies, where asking for help could be seen as a sign of weakness or dependency. Job's assertion underscores his previous status as a respected and wealthy man who was able to provide for himself and others, as seen in <a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>, where he is described as the greatest man among all the people of the East.<p><b>offer me a bribe from your wealth;</b><br>Here, Job denies ever having solicited a bribe, which would imply corruption or manipulation. In biblical times, bribery was condemned as unjust and contrary to God's law, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>. Job's statement serves to reinforce his righteousness and the unjust nature of his suffering. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate integrity of Jesus Christ, who, despite being tempted, never succumbed to corruption or sin (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>). Job's integrity in the face of false accusations can be seen as a type of Christ, who was also falsely accused and yet remained blameless.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

He reminds his friends that, in all their years of knowing him, he has never begged for favors. Much like Samuel&#8217;s public declaration of integrity (<a href="/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>) or Paul&#8217;s refusal to covet anyone&#8217;s silver or gold (<a href="/acts/20-33.htm">Acts 20:33-35</a>), Job can point to a spotless record. His words echo later in the chapter when he pleads, &#8220;Look at me and be appalled; put your hand over your mouth&#8221; (<a href="/job/21-5.htm">Job 21:5</a>). In essence:<p>&#8226; He is calling for honest testimony about his life.<p>&#8226; He invites scrutiny, confident it will vindicate him (<a href="/job/6-28.htm">Job 6:28-30</a>).<p>&#8226; He sets the stage to contrast his own character with the accusations he is hearing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Give me something</b><p>Job has never asked his friends for a handout. Even at his lowest, he isn&#8217;t appealing for material relief. <a href="/proverbs/30-7.htm">Proverbs 30:7-9</a> warns about the dangers of craving riches, and Job embodies the balanced heart Solomon sought: content in plenty, steadfast in want. Like Elisha refusing Naaman&#8217;s gifts (<a href="/2_kings/5-15.htm">2 Kings 5:15-16</a>) and Paul learning to be content in every circumstance (<a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-13</a>), Job models trust in God rather than dependence on man. His statement underscores:<p>&#8226; His integrity&#8212;he won&#8217;t manipulate relationships for gain.<p>&#8226; His confidence that God, not people, is his provider (<a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; A gentle rebuke: &#8220;I asked for comfort, not cash&#8212;why treat me as a beggar?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Offer me a bribe</b><p>The word &#8220;bribe&#8221; exposes the ugliness of what Job&#8217;s friends are implying. Job insists he has never sought to influence anyone&#8217;s judgment through under-the-table payments. Scripture consistently condemns bribes (<a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>; <a href="/proverbs/17-23.htm">Proverbs 17:23</a>). In New Testament language, leaders must shepherd &#8220;not for shameful gain&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2</a>). By denying any pursuit of a bribe, Job declares:<p>&#8226; He hasn&#8217;t tried to buy sympathy or silence.<p>&#8226; His plea is for justice, not preferential treatment (<a href="/job/13-18.htm">Job 13:18</a>).<p>&#8226; He values righteousness above reputation or restoration of wealth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From your wealth</b><p>Job&#8217;s friends are still prosperous; he is penniless. Yet he points out he never leveraged their resources. <a href="/psalms/62-10.htm">Psalm 62:10</a> warns, &#8220;If wealth increases, do not set your heart on it,&#8221; a truth Job practiced when he was rich (<a href="/job/29-12.htm">Job 29:12-16</a>) and when destitute (<a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>). His words subtly challenge his friends:<p>&#8226; Your possessions can&#8217;t solve my pain; only true comfort can.<p>&#8226; Wealth is God-given stewardship, not bargaining chips (<a href="/james/2-5.htm">James 2:5-6</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-6.htm">1 Timothy 6:6-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Real friendship offers presence and compassion, not payouts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/6-22.htm">Job 6:22</a> highlights Job&#8217;s transparent integrity. He has never begged, schemed, or bribed; he simply longs for understanding. By protesting, &#8220;Have I ever said, &#8216;Give me something; offer me a bribe from your wealth&#8217;?&#8221; he reminds his friends&#8212;and us&#8212;that genuine righteousness neither exploits others nor depends on worldly riches. True comfort flows from compassion grounded in truth, pointing every sufferer back to the faithful provision of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Did I say, Bring unto me?</span>--"It is not as though I had abused your former kindness.
