In the context of Job, this refers to the behemoth, a creature symbolizing God's power and creativity. The term "foremost" indicates a position of prominence, possibly suggesting that the behemoth is a prime example of God's handiwork. This can be seen as a reflection of God's sovereignty and the order of creation, where each creature has its place and purpose. Theologically, it underscores the idea that all creation is under God's dominion, and even the mightiest of creatures are subject to His will.<p><b>only his Maker can draw the sword against him.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the behemoth's invincibility to human efforts, suggesting that only God, the Creator, has the power to confront or control it. The imagery of "drawing the sword" implies a battle or confrontation, which in this context, signifies divine authority over creation. This can be seen as a reminder of human limitations and the futility of challenging God's established order. It also reflects the broader theme in Job of God's unmatched power and wisdom, which is beyond human understanding. Theologically, it points to the idea that ultimate power and judgment belong to God alone, reinforcing the notion of divine sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A righteous man tested by God through immense suffering, whose account is the central focus of the Book of Job.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator, who speaks to Job out of the whirlwind, highlighting His sovereignty and the limitations of human understanding.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/behemoth.htm">Behemoth</a></b><br>A creature described in the Book of Job, symbolizing God's power in creation.

The last clause is very obscure. Some render, "He only that made him can bring his sword near unto him;" or, "He that made him hath furnished him with his sword." Others, "He that would dress him (as meat) let him come near him with his sword !" indicating the inequality of the contest. Perhaps a combination of the first and last is best--"Let his Maker (but no one else venture to) approach him with His sword."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He is the chief of the ways of God</span>. This is the main argument in favour of the elephant, rather than the hippopotamus, being intended (see Schultens, <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). It has, indeed, been argued that some specimens of the hippopotamus exceed the elephant in height and bulk (Canon Cook, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 19); but no modern naturalist certainly would place the former animal above the latter in any <span class="accented">catalogue raisonee</span> of animals arranged according to their size and importance. The elephant, however, may not have been known to the author of Job, or, at any rate, the Asiatic species, which seems not to have been imported into Assyria before the middle of the <span class="date">ninth century B.C.</span> In this case, the hippopotamus might well seem to him the grandest of the works of God. <span class="cmt_word">He that made him can make his sword to approach unto him</span>. This is explained to mean, "Only God can attack behemoth with success and slay him; man is powerless to do so" (Canon Cook, Stanley Leathes, Revised Version). But the Egyptians, from very early times, used to attack the hippopotamus and slay him (Wilkinson, in the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2, p. 100). It is better, therefore, to translate the passage, with Schultens, "He that made him hath furnished him with his sword," and to understand by "his sword" those sharp teeth with which the hippopotamus is said to "cut the grass as <span class="accented">neatly as if it were mown</span> and to sever, as <span class="accented">if</span> <span class="accented">with shears</span> a tolerably stout and thick stem" (Wood, ' Natural History,' vol. 1. p. 762).
