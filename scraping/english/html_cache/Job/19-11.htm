This reflects Job's deep anguish and confusion, as he feels unjustly targeted by divine anger. In the broader biblical context, God's anger is often associated with judgment against sin (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/9-8.htm">Deuteronomy 9:8</a>, <a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11</a>). However, Job is described as a blameless and upright man (<a href="/job/1.htm">Job 1:1</a>), which adds complexity to his suffering. This tension highlights the theme of the righteous suffering and the mystery of God's ways, which is a central theme in the Book of Job. Theologically, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ, who also experienced the wrath of God on behalf of humanity, despite being sinless (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p><b>and He counts me among His enemies</b><br>Job feels alienated from God, as if he has been placed in the category of those who oppose Him. This sentiment is echoed in other parts of Scripture where individuals feel abandoned or opposed by God (e.g., <a href="/psalms/13.htm">Psalm 13:1</a>, <a href="/lamentations/3.htm">Lamentations 3:1-18</a>). Historically, being considered an enemy of God would imply being subject to His judgment and wrath, as seen in the fate of nations and individuals who opposed Israel (e.g., <a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6-7</a>, <a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2</a>). Culturally, this reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of divine retribution. In a typological sense, Job's experience can be seen as a precursor to Christ's own experience on the cross, where He was treated as an enemy of God for the sake of humanity's redemption (<a href="/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>, <a href="/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
