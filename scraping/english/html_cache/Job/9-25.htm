The imagery of a runner suggests speed and urgency, emphasizing how quickly time passes. In the ancient Near Eastern context, runners were often used as messengers, known for their speed and endurance. This metaphor highlights the rapid passage of time, a theme echoed in other biblical texts such as <a href="/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5</a>, which speaks of the shortness of life. The swiftness of a runner also reflects the urgency and relentless pace of Job's suffering, as he feels his life slipping away without relief.<p><b>they flee without seeing good.</b><br>Job laments that his days pass without experiencing goodness or joy. This reflects his deep sense of despair and the overwhelming nature of his trials. In the cultural context of the time, prosperity and well-being were often seen as signs of divine favor, while suffering was viewed as a result of sin or divine displeasure. Job's statement challenges this notion, as he maintains his innocence despite his suffering. This phrase can be connected to <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>, which questions the value of life when it is filled with hardship. Theologically, this points to the human condition and the longing for redemption and restoration, ultimately fulfilled in the hope of Christ, who offers eternal life and the promise of seeing good in the presence of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man described as blameless and upright, who fears God and shuns evil.

Life slips away so fast that before it is well begun, it is ended.
