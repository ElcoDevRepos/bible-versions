In the context of the Book of Job, Eliphaz is speaking, implying that the wicked will face consequences prematurely. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern belief in immediate retribution, where one's actions directly influence their fate. The idea of "before his time" indicates a premature end, which contrasts with the biblical promise of a long life as a blessing (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). This can be seen as a warning that God's judgment is inevitable and will occur at the appointed time, even if it seems early from a human perspective. Theologically, this aligns with the principle that God is sovereign over time and life (<a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>).<p><b>and his branch will not flourish</b><br>The imagery of a "branch" is often used in the Bible to symbolize offspring or prosperity (<a href="/psalms/128-3.htm">Psalm 128:3</a>). In this context, it suggests that the wicked man's lineage or endeavors will not succeed. This can be connected to the biblical theme of the righteous flourishing like a tree (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>), while the wicked are compared to chaff that the wind drives away (<a href="/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a>). The failure to flourish implies a lack of divine blessing and favor, which is a recurring theme in wisdom literature. This also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's justice, where the unrighteous will not prosper eternally. The imagery of a branch can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is referred to as the "Branch" in prophetic literature (<a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>), contrasting the flourishing of the righteous with the downfall of the wicked.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

The principle itself, however, stands firm: divine justice is precise and often swifter than human expectation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his branch will not flourish</b><p>The image shifts from the individual to his future&#8212;his &#8220;branch,&#8221; or posterity. In biblical thought, a flourishing branch represents ongoing vitality, descendants, and legacy. When God withholds that flourishing, the wicked lose both influence and remembrance.<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/18-16.htm">Job 18:16</a> portrays the same fate: &#8220;His roots dry up beneath, and his branches wither above.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a> observes that evildoers &#8220;wither like grass,&#8221; emphasizing the temporary nature of unrighteous success.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/14-20.htm">Isaiah 14:20</a> describes the cut-off line of a tyrant, showing how sin can sever future generations from blessing.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/15-6.htm">John 15:6</a>, though spoken of spiritual fruitfulness, pictures branches gathered and burned, a vivid parallel to the denial of growth.<p>The lesson is plain: sin not only harms the sinner&#8217;s present life but also chokes the fruitfulness that would have extended beyond him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32</a> teaches that God&#8217;s justice is neither delayed nor partial. The wicked person&#8217;s due is &#8220;paid in full&#8221; ahead of schedule, and his seeming prosperity ends with a barren branch. The verse assures believers that righteousness is never forgotten and unrighteousness never escapes notice, inviting us to trust God&#8217;s perfect timing and to pursue lives that bear lasting, godly fruit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">It shall be accomplished.</span>--That is, paid in full before its time.<p>The remainder of this chapter calls for little explanation. In it the speaker only repeats the orthodox and familiar saw that the wicked are punished in life, and therefore, by implication, the good rewarded: a maxim which fails utterly in the face of afflictions like those of Job, unless, as his friends insinuated, he was one of the wicked. After stating the doom of the ungodly, Eliphaz, in the last verse, sums up the character of those he has been denouncing. Not only are they evil in themselves, but they hatch evil; but it is evil that recoils on themselves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It shall be accomplished before his time</span>.
