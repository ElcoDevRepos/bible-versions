In the context of Job, it reflects the belief that the wicked will ultimately face divine retribution. The "house" symbolizes one's life and legacy, often associated with stability and prosperity in ancient Near Eastern culture. This aligns with the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>, where the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous. The removal of possessions can also be seen as a fulfillment of divine justice, as seen in the story of Achan in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>, where disobedience led to the loss of all he had.<p><b>flowing away</b><br>The imagery of possessions "flowing away" evokes a sense of inevitability and helplessness, much like water that cannot be contained. This can be connected to the transient nature of earthly wealth, as emphasized in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:10-15</a>, where material riches are described as fleeting. The metaphor of water is often used in Scripture to describe judgment or cleansing, as seen in the flood narrative in <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6-9</a>. This suggests that the loss is not only material but also a purging of unrighteousness.<p><b>on the day of God&#8217;s wrath</b><br>This phrase points to a specific time of divine judgment. The "day of God's wrath" is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, such as in <a href="/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14-18</a>, where it describes a time of great distress and punishment for the wicked. It underscores the certainty of God's justice and the ultimate accountability of all individuals. In the New Testament, this concept is echoed in <a href="/revelation/6-17.htm">Revelation 6:17</a>, where the great day of wrath is depicted as a time when no one can stand. This serves as a reminder of the eschatological hope for believers and the final defeat of evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zophar_the_naamathite.htm">Zophar the Naamathite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.
