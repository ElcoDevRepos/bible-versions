In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, names often carried significant meaning and were sometimes prophetic or indicative of the parents' hopes for the child. The dove is a symbol of peace and the Holy Spirit in the Bible, as seen in the account of Noah's Ark (<a href="/genesis/8-8.htm">Genesis 8:8-12</a>) and the baptism of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>). Jemimah's name may reflect the restoration and peace that Job experienced after his trials, aligning with the theme of divine restoration and blessing.<p><b>his second Keziah</b><br>Keziah is a name that means "cassia," a type of spice similar to cinnamon, known for its fragrance and value. In biblical times, spices were highly prized and often used in anointing oils and perfumes, as seen in <a href="/exodus/30-24.htm">Exodus 30:24</a>. The mention of Keziah highlights the renewed prosperity and blessing in Job's life, as spices were associated with wealth and abundance. The use of such a name may also suggest the sweet and pleasing nature of Job's restored family life, echoing the transformation from suffering to blessing.<p><b>and his third Keren-happuch</b><br>Keren-happuch translates to "horn of eye-paint" or "horn of antimony," referring to a cosmetic used in the ancient world to enhance the eyes. This name suggests beauty and adornment, indicating that Job's daughters were not only blessed with material wealth but also with physical beauty. The use of cosmetics was common in ancient cultures, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/9-30.htm">2 Kings 9:30</a>, where Jezebel paints her eyes. The name Keren-happuch may symbolize the outward manifestation of God's favor and the inner beauty of a life restored by divine grace. The mention of Job's daughters by name, and their inheritance alongside their brothers (<a href="/job/42-15.htm">Job 42:15</a>), underscores the theme of equality and the breaking of cultural norms, reflecting the comprehensive nature of God's restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who endured immense suffering and was ultimately restored by God.

Job, restored after his long ordeal, signals that God has brought him into a season of calm. This mirrors how a dove marked the end of judgment for Noah (<a href="/genesis/8-11.htm">Genesis 8:11</a>) and how the Spirit descended &#8220;like a dove&#8221; at Jesus&#8217; baptism, announcing favor (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>). By naming his firstborn daughter Jemimah, Job publicly affirms that the God who &#8220;makes wars cease&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/46-9.htm">Psalm 46:9</a>) has also stilled the storms in his own life.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s restoration is tangible: the first child born after Job&#8217;s trials embodies peace.<p>&#8226; Scripture emphasizes God&#8217;s ability to end turmoil (<a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Jemimah&#8217;s introduction sets the tone for a family marked by blessing, foreshadowing the statement that &#8220;no women in all the land were found so beautiful&#8221; as Job&#8217;s daughters (<a href="/job/42-15.htm">Job 42:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his second Keziah</b><p>&#8220;Keziah&#8221; refers to the spice cassia, known for its rich fragrance. In the tabernacle worship, cassia was part of the anointing oil (<a href="/exodus/30-24.htm">Exodus 30:24&#8211;25</a>), symbolizing consecration and delight in God&#8217;s presence. By selecting this name, Job acknowledges that the Lord has not merely ended suffering but has infused his household with fresh spiritual aroma (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Cassia&#8217;s scent points to joy and worship, aligning with Job&#8217;s renewed relationship with God after his repentance (<a href="/job/42-6.htm">Job 42:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The fragrance theme recalls <a href="/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a>, where the Messiah&#8217;s garments &#8220;are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia,&#8221; hinting that restored fellowship with God is a foretaste of messianic blessing.<p>&#8226; Keziah&#8217;s name reminds readers that God&#8217;s restorations are pleasant, not grudging; He &#8220;gives richly to enjoy&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his third Keren-happuch</b><p>&#8220;Keren-happuch&#8221; means &#8220;horn of eye paint,&#8221; an ancient cosmetic container suggesting beauty accentuated and displayed. The name highlights visible, unmistakable favor. After the ash heap, Job&#8217;s life now shines, proving that &#8220;He will make your righteousness shine like the dawn&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/37-6.htm">Psalm 37:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;horn&#8221; often represents strength (<a href="/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1</a>), so the name blends beauty with renewed vigor.<p>&#8226; Eye paint made the eyes sparkle; likewise, God&#8217;s deliverance gives spiritual radiance (<a href="/psalms/34-5.htm">Psalm 34:5</a>, &#8220;their faces are radiant&#8221;).<p>&#8226; By giving his third daughter this name, Job signals that God not only restores but embellishes; He &#8220;is able to do immeasurably more&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/42-14.htm">Job 42:14</a> is more than a birth announcement. Each daughter&#8217;s name&#8212;Jemimah (peace), Keziah (fragrant joy), and Keren-happuch (radiant strength)&#8212;proclaims a different facet of God&#8217;s restoration.
