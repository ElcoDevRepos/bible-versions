The oppression of the poor is a recurring theme in the Bible, condemned in various passages such as <a href="/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a> and <a href="/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14-15</a>. In ancient Near Eastern societies, the poor were often vulnerable to exploitation due to their lack of resources and social standing. The Law of Moses explicitly commanded care for the poor and marginalized (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>), emphasizing God's concern for justice and righteousness. The forsaking of the poor indicates a deliberate neglect and abandonment, contrary to the biblical call to love one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>).<p><b>he has seized houses he did not build.</b><br>This phrase suggests an act of injustice and theft, where the wicked take possession of property without rightful ownership. In the historical context, land and houses were significant assets, often passed down through generations. The seizure of houses not built by oneself implies a violation of property rights, which were protected under Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15, 17</a>). This act can be seen as a form of covetousness and greed, condemned throughout Scripture. The imagery of seizing houses also echoes the warnings given to Israel about the consequences of disobedience, where they would build houses but not live in them (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>). This phrase can be seen as a type of the ultimate justice of God, who will restore and vindicate the oppressed, as seen in the eschatological hope of the New Testament (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zophar_the_naamathite.htm">Zophar the Naamathite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

God hears the cry of the vulnerable (<a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22-24</a>), warns that &#8220;whoever oppresses a poor man insults his Maker&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a>), and promises that &#8220;the wages you failed to pay&#8221; will &#8220;cry out against you&#8221; (<a href="/james/5-4.htm">James 5:4</a>). Zophar is describing the wicked person who uses power to crush those already weak. The verse reminds us that such injustice is not a new social trend&#8212;it is a timeless evil that God has always condemned.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and forsaken the poor</b><p>The word &#8220;forsaken&#8221; adds a chilling layer: the wicked not only abuse the poor, they abandon them afterward. Isaiah denounced this same cold indifference: &#8220;Is it not to share your bread with the hungry &#8230; and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a>). Jesus echoes it in <a href="/matthew/25-45.htm">Matthew 25:45</a> when He links eternal accountability to ignoring &#8220;the least of these.&#8221; Oppression harms; forsaking compounds the harm by stripping away any hope of relief or advocacy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he has seized houses</b><p>The verse now pictures outright theft: &#8220;he has seized houses.&#8221; It recalls Ahab grabbing Naboth&#8217;s vineyard (<a href="/bsb/1_kings/21.htm">1 Kings 21</a>) or the land-grabs Micah condemned: &#8220;They covet fields and seize them&#8221; (<a href="/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a>). The wicked take what God gave another, acting as though divine ownership and neighborly boundaries do not exist. Habakkuk warns, &#8220;Woe to him who builds his house by unjust gain&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he did not build</b><p>Adding &#8220;he did not build&#8221; underlines the injustice. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10-12</a> foresees Israel living in cities they did not build as a gift from God; here, the wicked claim the same benefit not by grace but by greed. Amos rebukes such entitlement: &#8220;Though you have built stone mansions, you will not live in them&#8221; (<a href="/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11</a>). God sees the shortcut, the freeloading, the refusal to do honest work. The judgment Zophar predicts later in the chapter fits the crime precisely: what was stolen will not be enjoyed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/20-19.htm">Job 20:19</a> stacks four charges like courtroom evidence: oppressing, abandoning, stealing, and freeloading. Each offense violates God&#8217;s revealed standards of justice, compassion, and honest labor. The verse serves as both diagnosis and warning: wherever people misuse power, dismiss the needy, grab what isn&#8217;t theirs, and bypass the sweat of building, they position themselves under God&#8217;s sure judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Because he hath oppressed and forsaken . . .</span>--For these insinuations there was not a vestige of ground, but Job formally rebuts them in Job 31<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor</span>.
