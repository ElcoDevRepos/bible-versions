In the ancient Near Eastern context, oral tradition was a primary means of transmitting knowledge about God. Job, like many others, would have learned about God through stories and teachings passed down through generations. This hearing represents an intellectual or theoretical knowledge of God, which is common in religious practices where teachings are often received through community and family.<p><b>but now my eyes have seen You</b><br>Here, Job expresses a transformative experience of encountering God directly. This shift from hearing to seeing signifies a deeper, more personal revelation of God's nature and presence. In biblical terms, seeing often implies a direct and profound understanding or experience. This mirrors other biblical figures who had direct encounters with God, such as Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3) or Isaiah's vision in the temple (Isaiah 6). Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, where the invisible God is made visible and known through Jesus (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). Job's experience foreshadows the New Testament promise of believers seeing God through Christ (<a href="/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>). This personal encounter leads to a deeper faith and understanding, moving beyond mere knowledge to a relational experience with the divine.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Yet hearing alone can remain second-hand; it can leave God at arm&#8217;s length.<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s long speeches show how incomplete information can breed confusion: he could quote facts about God but still feel abandoned. The discrepancy exposed a gap between knowing about God and knowing God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But now</b><p>This brief hinge signals a seismic shift.<p>&#8226; After fifty-plus chapters of silence, debate, and lament, &#8220;the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind&#8221; (<a href="/job/38-1.htm">Job 38:1</a>). Divine speech turned theory into encounter.<p>&#8226; That &#8220;now&#8221; draws a line between yesterday&#8217;s partial knowledge and today&#8217;s unveiled reality.

Argument gave way to awe. The moment you truly meet God, self-defense collapses and humble surrender begins (compare <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The shift is also temporal and personal: God is not merely Someone Job once heard about; He is the Living One intervening in the present.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My eyes have seen You</b><p>Though no mortal can behold the fulness of God&#8217;s face and live (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>), Job experienced a real, literal manifestation of God&#8217;s glory that satisfied his longing heart.<p>&#8226; &#8220;My eyes&#8221; highlights personal ownership; the revelation is firsthand.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Have seen You&#8221; moves from information to intimacy. Isaiah had a similar breakthrough: &#8220;My eyes have seen the King, the LORD of Hosts&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Seeing God always transforms: Isaiah cried &#8220;Woe is me,&#8221; Peter fell at Jesus&#8217; knees (<a href="/luke/5-8.htm">Luke 5:8</a>), and Job will immediately &#8220;repent in dust and ashes&#8221; (<a href="/job/42-6.htm">Job 42:6</a>).

Ultimately, &#8220;we will see Him as He is&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>), and even now &#8220;we&#8230; reflect the glory of the Lord, being transformed&#8230; from glory to glory&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/42-5.htm">Job 42:5</a> traces a journey from second-hand knowledge (&#8220;My ears had heard of You&#8221;), through a decisive moment of divine confrontation (&#8220;but now&#8221;), to personal, transformational encounter (&#8220;my eyes have seen You&#8221;).
