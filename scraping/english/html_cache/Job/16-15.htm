In the context of Job, this act signifies his profound grief and humiliation. The sewing of sackcloth over the skin suggests a permanent state of mourning, indicating that Job's suffering is not temporary but deeply ingrained. This imagery is consistent with other biblical references to sackcloth, such as in <a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>, where Jacob mourns for Joseph, and in <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-6</a>, where the people of Nineveh wear sackcloth in repentance. The act of wearing sackcloth is a physical manifestation of inner turmoil and is often associated with humility before God.<p><b>I have buried my horn in the dust.</b><br>The "horn" in biblical literature often symbolizes strength, power, and dignity. In this phrase, Job's statement of burying his horn in the dust reflects a complete loss of strength and honor. Dust is frequently associated with mortality and humility, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>, where God tells Adam, "for dust you are and to dust you will return." By burying his horn in the dust, Job is expressing his utter defeat and submission to his circumstances. This imagery can also be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's humility and suffering, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a>, where Jesus "made himself nothing" and took on the nature of a servant. Job's experience, therefore, can be viewed as a type of Christ's own suffering and humility.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Job&#8217;s sewing adds permanence, underscoring sincerity.<p>&#8226; The image also portrays submission under God&#8217;s sovereign hand. <a href="/jeremiah/4-8.htm">Jeremiah 4:8</a> urges Judah, &#8220;Clothe yourselves with sackcloth and lament,&#8221; acknowledging divine judgment. Job accepts that same reality, even while confused by his circumstances.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have buried my horn in the dust</b><p>&#8226; In Scripture the &#8220;horn&#8221; often symbolizes personal strength, dignity, and honor. Hannah rejoices, &#8220;My horn is exalted in the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1</a>). Job says the opposite&#8212;his honor is buried.<p>&#8226; Dust represents humiliation and mortality: &#8220;He has brought me into the dust of death&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/22-15.htm">Psalm 22:15</a>). Job deliberately presses his own &#8220;horn&#8221; into that dust, declaring complete abasement before God.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/75-10.htm">Psalm 75:10</a> promises God will &#8220;cut off all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the righteous will be exalted.&#8221; Job feels as though his righteous horn has been cut off; still, he relinquishes any claim to vindication on his own terms.<p>&#8226; <a href="/lamentations/2-3.htm">Lamentations 2:3</a> laments that the Lord &#8220;has cut off every horn of Israel in His fierce anger,&#8221; mirroring Job&#8217;s sense of being divinely opposed. Yet Job&#8217;s act is voluntary surrender, not rebellion&#8212;handing over his reputation and strength to God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/16-15.htm">Job 16:15</a> paints a vivid, literal picture of grief and humility. By sewing sackcloth to his skin, Job embraces prolonged mourning and repentance; by burying his horn in the dust, he lays down every shred of strength and honor. The verse teaches that genuine faith may require enduring sorrow and relinquishing personal glory, trusting that the God who seems silent now will, in His time, lift the humble and restore the horn of the righteous.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin.</span>--Referring, probably, to the state of his skin, which had become hard and rugged as sackcloth. As the second half of the verse must be figurative, there seems to be no reason to understand the first half otherwise.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin</span>. Another transition. Job turns to the consideration of how he has acted under his severe afflictions. In the first place, he has put on sackcloth, not for a time merely, as ordinary mourners do, but for a permanency, so that he may be said to have sewn it to his skin. There is, perhaps, also an allusion to the adhesion of the garment to his many sores. <span class="cmt_word">And have defiled my horn in the dust</span>. "My horn" is equivalent to "my pride," "my dignity." Job, when he left his state, and put on sackcloth, and "sat down among the ashes" (<a href="/job/2-8.htm">Job 2:8</a>), denuded himself of his honour and dignity, and as it were trailed them in the dust <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/16-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I have sewn</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1453;&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#257;&#183;p&#772;ar&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8609.htm">Strong's 8609: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sew together</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sackcloth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1463;&#1443;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;aq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8242.htm">Strong's 8242: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mesh, coarse loose cloth, sacking, a bag</span><br /><br /><span class="word">over</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my skin;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7713;il&#183;d&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
