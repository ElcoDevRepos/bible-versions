In the context of the Book of Job, it underscores the theme of human suffering and the inevitability of death. The imagery of being "smashed to pieces" suggests a violent and sudden destruction, which can be seen as a metaphor for the trials and tribulations that people face. The reference to "dawn to dusk" indicates the brevity of life, echoing other biblical passages such as <a href="/psalms/90-6.htm">Psalm 90:6</a>, which compares human life to grass that flourishes in the morning and withers by evening. This phrase also aligns with the wisdom literature's emphasis on the fleeting nature of human existence, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1-2</a>.<p><b>unnoticed, they perish forever.</b><br>The idea of perishing "unnoticed" highlights the insignificance of individual lives in the grand scheme of the world, a recurring theme in Job. This can be connected to the broader biblical narrative that emphasizes the sovereignty of God over life and death, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>, which contrasts the temporary nature of human life with the eternal word of God. The phrase "perish forever" underscores the finality of death, a concept that is explored throughout the Bible. In the New Testament, this is contrasted with the hope of eternal life through Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>. The notion of being "unnoticed" also speaks to the human desire for significance and the biblical assurance that God sees and knows each individual, as affirmed in <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.
