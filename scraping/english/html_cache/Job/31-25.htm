In the ancient Near Eastern context, wealth was often seen as a sign of divine favor. However, Job is careful to ensure that he has not placed his trust or joy in material possessions. This aligns with biblical teachings that warn against the love of money (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>) and emphasize storing up treasures in heaven rather than on earth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). Job's statement is a reflection of his integrity and his understanding that true joy and security come from God, not from earthly riches.<p><b>because my hand had gained so much</b><br>Here, Job acknowledges his role in acquiring wealth, yet he distances himself from pride or self-sufficiency. The phrase suggests a recognition of human effort in wealth accumulation, but Job is careful not to attribute his success solely to his own abilities. This humility is consistent with the biblical principle that all blessings, including wealth, ultimately come from God (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-18.htm">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>). Job's attitude contrasts with the prideful self-reliance seen in other biblical figures who attributed their success to their own strength, such as Nebuchadnezzar in <a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>. This phrase also serves as a reminder of the biblical teaching that while human effort is involved, it is God who grants the increase (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-7.htm">1 Corinthians 3:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
