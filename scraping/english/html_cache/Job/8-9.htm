In the context of the Book of Job, Bildad is speaking to Job, suggesting that human wisdom is insignificant compared to God's eternal knowledge. The expression "born yesterday" is a metaphor for inexperience and lack of understanding, highlighting the transient nature of human existence. This idea is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/90-4.htm">Psalm 90:4</a>, which compares a thousand years in God's sight to a day that has just gone by. The phrase underscores the humility humans should have in acknowledging their limited perspective.<p><b>and know nothing;</b><br>This part of the verse points to the limitations of human knowledge. In the ancient Near Eastern context, wisdom was highly valued, yet Bildad argues that human wisdom is negligible compared to divine wisdom. This sentiment is reflected in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which advises trusting in the Lord rather than relying on one's own understanding. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the fallibility of human reasoning, a theme that runs throughout the wisdom literature of the Bible, including Ecclesiastes, which often reflects on the futility of human endeavors without divine insight.<p><b>our days on earth are but a shadow.</b><br>The imagery of life as a shadow conveys the fleeting and insubstantial nature of human existence. Shadows are temporary and lack substance, symbolizing how quickly life passes. This metaphor is consistent with other biblical passages, such as <a href="/psalms/144-4.htm">Psalm 144:4</a>, which states, "Man is like a breath; his days are like a passing shadow." The use of "shadow" also suggests the idea of life being insubstantial and transient, pointing to the need for reliance on God, who is eternal and unchanging. This concept is further developed in the New Testament, where life is described as a "vapor" in <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, emphasizing the urgency of living with an eternal perspective.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bildad_the_shuhite.htm">Bildad the Shuhite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.
