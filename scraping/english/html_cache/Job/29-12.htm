In the ancient Near Eastern context, the poor were often marginalized and lacked social support. Job's actions align with the biblical mandate to care for the needy, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>, which commands generosity towards the poor. His rescue of the poor can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's ministry, who also came to aid the marginalized and oppressed (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>).<p><b>and the fatherless who had no helper</b><br>The fatherless, or orphans, were particularly vulnerable in ancient societies, lacking inheritance rights and protection. Job's care for them reflects the biblical emphasis on justice and mercy, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>, which describes God as a "father to the fatherless." This care for orphans is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting God's concern for the defenseless. Job's actions prefigure the compassionate nature of Jesus, who often reached out to those without support or advocates (<a href="/john/14-18.htm">John 14:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
