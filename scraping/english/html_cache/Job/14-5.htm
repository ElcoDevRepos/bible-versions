The concept of predetermined days is echoed in <a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>, where it is stated that all the days ordained for a person were written in God's book before one of them came to be. This underscores the biblical theme of God's omniscience and control over the lifespan of individuals. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, life was often seen as fragile and fleeting, and this acknowledgment of divine determination provided a sense of order and purpose.<p><b>and the number of his months is with You</b><br>Here, the emphasis is on God's intimate knowledge and control over the specific duration of a person's life. The idea that the number of months is "with You" suggests that God holds this knowledge exclusively, reinforcing His role as the ultimate authority over life and death. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that God is the giver and taker of life, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>. It also reflects the cultural understanding of time as a divine gift, entrusted to humans for stewardship.<p><b>and since You have set limits that he cannot exceed</b><br>This phrase highlights the boundaries established by God for human existence. The concept of limits is a recurring theme in Scripture, illustrating God's order in creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a> with the separation of day and night, land and sea. Theologically, it speaks to human finitude and dependence on God. The limits set by God are not just physical but also moral and spiritual, as seen in the laws given to Israel. This understanding calls for humility and trust in God's wisdom and timing, as echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1-2</a>, which speaks of a time for every purpose under heaven.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

If oceans obey, so will the span of our years.<p>&#8226; These limits humble us, reminding us that real security lies not in extending life but in entrusting it to the One who sets the frame (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a> paints a three-stroke portrait of God&#8217;s sovereignty over time: our days are already scheduled, our months carefully held, and our lifespan strictly bounded.
