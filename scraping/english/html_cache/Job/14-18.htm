In biblical literature, mountains often represent stability and the eternal nature of God's creation (<a href="/psalms/125.htm">Psalm 125:1-2</a>). However, Job uses this imagery to illustrate the impermanence and fragility of human life. The erosion of a mountain can be seen as a metaphor for the trials and sufferings that wear down a person's spirit over time. This reflects Job's own experience of suffering and loss, as he feels his life and strength are being worn away by his afflictions. The process of erosion is slow and inevitable, much like the trials that test one's faith and endurance.<p><b>and a rock is dislodged from its place</b><br>Rocks, like mountains, are often seen as symbols of strength and reliability. In the Bible, God is frequently referred to as a rock, signifying His unchanging nature and dependability (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>). However, Job's use of this imagery suggests that even the most steadfast elements can be moved or altered. This can be interpreted as a reflection on the unpredictability of life and the fact that even the most secure aspects of existence can be disrupted. The dislodging of a rock from its place can also symbolize the upheaval in Job's life, as he has been removed from his position of prosperity and comfort. This imagery may also foreshadow the eventual restoration and redemption that comes through faith, as seen in the New Testament with Jesus Christ, the cornerstone who was rejected but became the foundation of salvation (<a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

His strength, status, and even his friends&#8217; confidence in him are steadily wearing away. <a href="/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a> notes that &#8220;the mountains quake before Him,&#8221; highlighting that what seems solid to us is pliable under God&#8217;s sovereign hand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and crumbles</b><p>Erosion leads somewhere&#8212;eventual collapse.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Crumbles&#8221; signals a point of no return: the peak gives way to dust. <a href="/isaiah/40-7.htm">Isaiah 40:7-8</a> contrasts fading grass with God&#8217;s enduring word; the created order is transient, but the promise of the Creator stands.<p>&#8226; Job feels his life has reached that breaking point. <a href="/hebrews/1-10.htm">Hebrews 1:10-12</a> recounts that the heavens &#8220;will perish, but You remain,&#8221; reinforcing the theme that all created things deteriorate while God abides.<p>&#8226; This crumbling also hints at judgment and renewal. Second Peter 3:10 describes the elements melting, not to leave a void but to usher in &#8220;a new heaven and a new earth&#8221; (v. 13). In Job&#8217;s suffering, the old securities are collapsing, yet God is clearing ground for something better, a truth fully unveiled in Christ&#8217;s resurrection.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and a rock is dislodged from its place</b><p>The picture tightens from a whole mountain to one stone ripped loose.<p>&#8226; What once fit perfectly now sits shattered at the valley floor. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a> calls the Lord &#8220;the Rock,&#8221; flawless and steadfast; by contrast, human life can be pried out of its seeming security in an instant.<p>&#8226; Job senses that everything he leaned on&#8212;health, family, reputation&#8212;has been dislodged. <a href="/psalms/62-2.htm">Psalm 62:2</a> reminds us, &#8220;He alone is my rock and my salvation; I will not be shaken.&#8221; When lesser rocks give way, the believer learns to stand on the Rock that never moves.<p>&#8226; Jesus echoes this in <a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>: building on sand ends in ruin, but building on the Rock endures every storm. Job&#8217;s lament carries an invitation: shift your weight from perishable supports to the everlasting God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/14-18.htm">Job 14:18</a> uses three cascading images&#8212;eroding mountain, crumbling mass, dislodged rock&#8212;to spotlight life&#8217;s relentless decay and the futility of trusting created things. The verse is not despair for despair&#8217;s sake; it presses us to recognize that only the Lord, the eternal Rock, remains unmoved. As every earthly foothold eventually slips, the believer anchors hope in God&#8217;s unchanging character and the resurrection promise that transforms erosion into everlasting restoration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought</span>.
