In the ancient Near Eastern context, night often symbolized distress, suffering, or judgment, while day symbolized clarity, understanding, and divine favor. Job's friends, by insisting on their own interpretation of his suffering, are metaphorically turning the natural order upside down. This inversion can be seen as a reflection of <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>, where woe is pronounced on those who call evil good and good evil. Theologically, this phrase underscores the theme of human misunderstanding of divine purposes, a recurring theme in the wisdom literature.<p><b>making light seem near</b><br>In the biblical context, light often symbolizes hope, truth, and God's presence. Job's friends, by offering simplistic explanations and false hope, are presenting a false light. This can be connected to <a href="/2_corinthians/11-14.htm">2 Corinthians 11:14</a>, where Satan masquerades as an angel of light, suggesting that not all that appears hopeful or truthful is genuinely so. The phrase also highlights the tension between human perception and divine reality, a central theme in the Book of Job.<p><b>in the face of darkness</b><br>Darkness in scripture frequently represents chaos, evil, or divine judgment. Job feels surrounded by darkness due to his immense suffering and the perceived absence of God's presence. This darkness is not just physical but spiritual and emotional, reflecting Job's inner turmoil. The phrase echoes the existential struggle found in <a href="/psalms/88.htm">Psalm 88</a>, a psalm of lament where the psalmist feels abandoned by God. In a typological sense, this darkness can be seen as a precursor to the darkness Christ experienced on the cross, as described in <a href="/matthew/27-45.htm">Matthew 27:45</a>, symbolizing the weight of sin and separation from God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

Job&#8217;s friends give pious-sounding speeches, yet their assurances are empty.<p>&#8226; By claiming Job&#8217;s suffering is easy to explain and quick to fix, they dismiss the depth of his pain. The night is real, and pretending otherwise only deepens the wound.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>making light seem near</b><p>&#8226; Zophar had promised, &#8220;Your life will be brighter than noonday&#8221; (<a href="/job/11-17.htm">Job 11:17</a>), if Job would only admit hidden sin. That promise now echoes in <a href="/job/17-12.htm">Job 17:12</a>.<p>&#8226; Such advice offers a counterfeit light&#8212;close enough to be enticing, yet unattainable through human effort. <a href="/proverbs/13-12.htm">Proverbs 13:12</a> reminds us, &#8220;Hope deferred makes the heart sick&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Real light is not manufactured optimism; it is the Lord Himself. <a href="/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a> declares, &#8220;The LORD is my light and my salvation&#8221;. Job&#8217;s friends substitute moral formulas for that living light.<p>&#8226; The gospel later reveals the true nearness of light: &#8220;The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>).

So little did his friends enter into his case that they wanted him to believe that his night of trial was the reverse of darkness, and that there was light at hand. This was to him only the more painful mockery, because of its contrast to his felt condition. He, on the contrary, says that his only hope is in the grave. "The light," say they, "is near unto the darkness; that it is near before the darkness cometh; they try to persuade me that prosperity is close at hand."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They change the night into day</span>. They, my detractors, who are also my so-called "comforters," pretend to change my night into day; assure me that the cloud which rests on me is only for a time, and will ere long give place to the brightness of day, to a glorious burst of sunshine (see <a href="/job/5-18.htm">Job 5:18-26</a>; <a href="/job/8-21.htm">Job 8:21, 22</a>; <a href="/job/11-15.htm">Job 11:15-19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The light</span> (they say) <span class="cmt_word">is short because of darkness</span>; or, rather, <span class="accented">is</span> <span class="accented">near because of the</span> darkness.
