The imagery of wind is often used in Scripture to represent God's power and the uncontrollable nature of life's challenges (e.g., <a href="/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>, <a href="/isaiah/40-24.htm">Isaiah 40:24</a>). In the ancient Near Eastern context, wind was seen as a powerful and sometimes destructive force, often associated with divine intervention or judgment. Job's use of this imagery underscores his perception of being at the mercy of God's sovereign will, much like the wind that cannot be tamed or predicted.<p><b>and drive me before it;</b><br>Here, Job expresses a sense of being propelled forward by circumstances he cannot resist, akin to being driven by a relentless force. This reflects the biblical theme of human vulnerability in the face of divine sovereignty, as seen in other parts of Scripture where God directs the course of events (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14-15</a>). The cultural context of the time would have understood this as a metaphor for being caught in a storm at sea, a common experience for those living in the ancient Near East, highlighting the helplessness and lack of control one feels in such situations.<p><b>You toss me about in the storm.</b><br>The storm imagery here is significant, as storms in the Bible often symbolize chaos, judgment, or divine testing (e.g., <a href="/jonah/1-4.htm">Jonah 1:4</a>, <a href="/mark/4-37.htm">Mark 4:37-41</a>). Job's description of being tossed about suggests a tumultuous and unstable existence, reflecting his inner turmoil and the external calamities he faces. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who also faced the storm of God's wrath on behalf of humanity (e.g., <a href="/matthew/8-23.htm">Matthew 8:23-27</a>, where Jesus calms the storm, demonstrating His authority over chaos). The historical context of Job's suffering, seen as a test of faith, parallels the trials faced by believers who endure hardships, trusting in God's ultimate purpose and sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

Job knows the same God who commands creation now handles him personally.<p>&#8226; This is not accidental weather; Job attributes the wind directly to God&#8217;s hand, echoing his earlier confession, &#8220;The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away&#8221; (<a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and drive me before it</b><p>The gust doesn&#8217;t simply lift Job; it propels him forward, out of control.<p>&#8226; He feels shoved toward an uncertain destination, much like Israel driven into the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/13-18.htm">Exodus 13:18</a>) or Jonah forced toward Nineveh by a storm (<a href="/jonah/1-4.htm">Jonah 1:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s lament highlights two truths held in tension:<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s sovereignty is active, not passive (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p>&#8211; The righteous can still experience bewildering hardship (<a href="/psalms/44-17.htm">Psalm 44:17-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Job senses no steering wheel in his hands. Any self-confidence has blown away, leaving only reliance on the One who directs the wind (<a href="/matthew/8-27.htm">Matthew 8:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You toss me about in the storm</b><p>The language intensifies: from wind to full-scale tempest.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Storm&#8221; evokes chaos and threat (<a href="/psalms/55-8.htm">Psalm 55:8</a>), yet in Scripture storms also become classrooms where God reveals Himself (<a href="/job/38-1.htm">Job 38:1</a>; <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>).<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s tossing mirrors a ship in rough seas&#8212;seemingly at the mercy of waves, yet ultimately under God&#8217;s command (<a href="/psalms/107-25.htm">Psalm 107:25-29</a>).<p>&#8226; His honesty teaches:<p>&#8211; Believers may voice raw anguish without denying God&#8217;s rule (<a href="/psalms/142-2.htm">Psalm 142:2</a>).<p>&#8211; Trials feel violent, but they are neither random nor unseen (<a href="/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/30-22.htm">Job 30:22</a> paints a vivid, three-stage picture of suffering: lifted, driven, and hurled by forces too strong to resist.
