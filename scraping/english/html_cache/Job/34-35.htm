Elihu asserts that Job lacks understanding in his complaints against God. This reflects a common theme in the Book of Job, where human wisdom is contrasted with divine wisdom. The phrase "without knowledge" suggests a lack of understanding of God's ways, which are often beyond human comprehension. This echoes the broader biblical theme found in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's thoughts and ways are higher than those of humans. The cultural context of the time placed a high value on wisdom and understanding, often associating them with righteousness and favor from God.<p><b>his words lack insight.</b><br>Elihu criticizes Job's speeches as lacking discernment or spiritual insight. Insight, in biblical terms, often refers to the ability to see things from God's perspective. This critique implies that Job's suffering has clouded his judgment, leading him to speak rashly about God's justice. The Book of Proverbs frequently emphasizes the importance of seeking wisdom and insight (<a href="/proverbs/2-3.htm">Proverbs 2:3-6</a>), suggesting that true understanding comes from God. This phrase also foreshadows God's response to Job later in the book, where God challenges Job's understanding of the universe and His divine governance. The lack of insight here can be seen as a reminder of humanity's limited perspective compared to God's omniscience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
