In the context of Job, this challenges the retribution theology held by Job's friends, who believed suffering was a direct result of personal sin. The idea that the wicked prosper is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3-12</a>, where the psalmist observes the prosperity of the wicked and struggles with understanding God's justice. Historically, this reflects the ancient Near Eastern belief systems where divine retribution was expected to be immediate. However, the Bible often presents a more complex view of divine justice, where ultimate judgment is reserved for God's timing.<p><b>delivered from the day of wrath</b><br>This part of the verse suggests that the wicked are not only spared from immediate calamity but also seem to escape divine wrath. In biblical terms, the "day of wrath" often refers to a future time of God's judgment, as seen in prophetic books like <a href="/zephaniah/1-15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15</a> and <a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>. This can be understood as a foreshadowing of the final judgment, where ultimate justice will be served. Theologically, this raises questions about God's patience and the purpose of allowing the wicked to prosper temporarily. It also points to the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, who offers deliverance from wrath through His sacrifice, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>. This highlights the tension between present experiences and future hope, encouraging believers to trust in God's ultimate justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, Job is the central figure in the Book of Job.

He is stating a hard-won observation, pushing back against his friends&#8217; tidy theology that bad things always happen to bad people (<a href="/job/21-27.htm">Job 21:27-28</a>). In <a href="/psalms/73-12.htm">Psalm 73:12</a> Asaph voices the same shock: &#8220;Behold, these are the wicked&#8212;always at ease, they increase their wealth.&#8221; Scripture affirms the reality Job sees; the wicked often flourish for a season even while God remains perfectly just (<a href="/psalms/37-7.htm">Psalm 37:7-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the evil man</b><p>The phrase paints a specific group: people who reject God&#8217;s ways (<a href="/proverbs/11-7.htm">Proverbs 11:7</a>).<p>&#8226; They defy God&#8217;s law (<a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>).<p>&#8226; They trust in their own strength and schemes (<a href="/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a>).<p>Yet their prosperity can look enviable. Job&#8217;s words echo the blunt acknowledgment of <a href="/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>, &#8220;Why does the way of the wicked prosper?&#8221; The Bible never denies that such people exist or that they sometimes appear successful.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is spared</b><p>&#8220;Spared&#8221; describes an unexpected reprieve. <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a> explains why it happens: &#8220;Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed quickly, the hearts of men are fully set to do evil.&#8221; God&#8217;s long-suffering gives room for repentance (<a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>), but the wicked misread mercy as approval. In the short term they avoid the disasters Job&#8217;s friends insist will surely strike them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the day of calamity</b><p>A &#8220;day of calamity&#8221; is any sudden, crushing disaster&#8212;war, famine, personal ruin (<a href="/proverbs/24-22.htm">Proverbs 24:22</a>). Job sees that the wicked sometimes sidestep such days while the righteous, like himself, are blindsided (<a href="/job/1-13.htm">Job 1:13-19</a>). Habakkuk voiced the same tension when he asked why violent men &#8220;swallow up those more righteous than they&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>). Scripture records these questions to validate our own cries and to show that God&#8217;s justice operates on a longer timeline than we often expect.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>delivered</b><p>The term sharpens the thought: not only do the wicked avoid calamity, they can look positively protected. <a href="/psalms/10-5.htm">Psalm 10:5</a> observes, &#8220;His ways prosper at all times.&#8221; Yet this &#8220;deliverance&#8221; is limited to earthly circumstances. Jesus&#8217; parable of the rich man and Lazarus (<a href="/luke/16-25.htm">Luke 16:25</a>) reveals the fuller picture: earthly comfort may end in eternal torment if repentance is refused.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the day of wrath</b><p>Here Job pushes the problem toward its ultimate conclusion. &#8220;Day of wrath&#8221; is a phrase later used for final judgment (<a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-17.htm">Revelation 6:17</a>). Job&#8217;s complaint is that some wicked die peacefully, seemingly shielded even from God&#8217;s climactic reckoning. Later revelation answers the tension: every unbeliever will face that day; none will be truly delivered (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>). What looks like escape is only a pause before certain judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/21-30.htm">Job 21:30</a> honestly records what believers still witness: wicked people may be &#8220;spared&#8221; in this life, gliding past disaster and dying in comfort. Scripture affirms the observation yet insists that divine justice is never thwarted. God&#8217;s patience delays judgment so people might repent, but the &#8220;day of wrath&#8221; remains fixed. Job&#8217;s lament widens our view: present circumstances cannot measure God&#8217;s faithfulness or final verdicts. The righteous walk by faith, trusting that the Judge of all the earth will do right&#8212;perfectly, thoroughly, and in His appointed time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30-33) <span class= "bld">That the wicked. . . .</span>--These verses contain the result of their experience.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - These conclusions are now set forth. <span class="cmt_word">They are, that the wicked is reserved for</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">spared in</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the day of destruction, and that they shall be brought forth to</span> (rather, <span class="accented">removed out of the way in</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the day of wrath</span>. This, according to Job, was the popular sentiment of his time; and, no doubt, there is in all ages a large mass of fleeting opinion to the same effect. Striking examples of wickedness in high places draw attention, and provoke indignation, and are much talked about; whence arises an idea that such cases are common, and ultimately, by an unscientific generalization in the vulgar mind, that they form the rule, and not the exception to the rule. It requires some power of intellect to take a broad and comprehensive view over the whole of human life, and fairly to strike the balance. Such a view seems to have been taken by Bishop Butler (among others); and the conclusion, reached by calm investigation and philosophic thought, is that, on the whole, ever in this life, the balance of advantage rests with the virtuous, who really prosper more than the wicked, have greater and higher satisfactions, escape numerous forms of suffering, and approach more nearly to happiness. An exact apportionment of happiness and misery to desert is a thing that certainly in this life does not take place; but the <span class="accented">tendency</span> of virtue to accumulate to itself other goods is clear; and Job's pessimistic view is certainly an untrue one, which we may suspect that he maintained, rather from a love of paradox, and from a desire to puzzle and confuse his friends, than from any conviction of its absolute truth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/21-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Indeed,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the evil</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7451.htm">Strong's 7451: </a> </span><span class="str2">Bad, evil</span><br /><br /><span class="word">man is spared</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1461;&#1495;&#1464;&#1443;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#234;&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#347;e&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2820.htm">Strong's 2820: </a> </span><span class="str2">To restrain, refrain, to refuse, spare, preserve, to observe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from the day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
