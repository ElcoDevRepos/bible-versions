In the context of the Book of Job, Eliphaz is speaking, suggesting that the wicked will face destruction. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's judgment against the wicked, as seen in Psalms 37:20, where the wicked perish like smoke. Historically, this reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of divine retribution, where gods were believed to protect the righteous and punish the wicked. Theologically, it underscores the hope for vindication and justice for those who remain faithful to God.<p><b>and fire has consumed their excess</b><br>Fire is often used in the Bible as a symbol of God's judgment and purification. In this context, it suggests the complete and consuming nature of divine retribution. The imagery of fire consuming excess can be connected to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>), where fire and brimstone rained down as a form of divine judgment. This also foreshadows the eschatological fire mentioned in <a href="/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7</a>, where the heavens and earth are reserved for fire on the day of judgment. Culturally, fire was a common element in sacrificial rituals, symbolizing purification and the removal of sin, which can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate sacrifice, purifying believers from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

Compare <a href="/psalms/19-9.htm">Psalm 19:9</a>, where &#8220;the judgments of the LORD are true; they are righteous altogether,&#8221; and <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>, which reminds us God does not lie or change His mind.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Our foes are destroyed</b><p>- Eliphaz asserts that the enemies of the righteous are already being wiped out.<p>- <a href="/psalms/37-20.htm">Psalm 37:20</a> echoes this: &#8220;But the wicked will perish; the enemies of the LORD, like the glory of the pastures, will vanish&#8212;like smoke they will vanish away.&#8221;<p>- His claim assumes a predictable moral order: obey God and prosper; rebel and be ruined (see <a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>, where God promises to rout Israel&#8217;s enemies).<p>- While Job&#8217;s situation contradicts Eliphaz&#8217;s neat formula, the statement still reflects an eternal truth: ultimate victory belongs to God&#8217;s people (<a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And fire has consumed</b><p>- Fire in Scripture often signifies divine judgment.

He speaks a truth about God&#8217;s unwavering justice, yet misapplies it to Job&#8217;s suffering. The verse affirms that God literally judges the wicked, consumes their ill-gotten gain, and vindicates His people, but it also reminds us to apply that truth with discernment and humility.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(</span>20<span class= "ital">)</span> <span class= "bld">Whereas our substance . . .</span>--These are probably the words of the righteous and the innocent: "Surely they that did rise up against us are cut off, and the remnant of them the fire hath consumed." The rendering in the Authorised Version is probably less correct, though in that also these words seem to be those of the innocent in <a href="/job/22-19.htm" title="The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.">Job 22:19</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whereas our substance is not cut down</span>. It is best to take these as the words of the righteous in their triumph over the wicked; but they can scarcely bear the interpretation given them in the Authorized Version. The clause is not really negative but affirmative, and the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. does not mean "substance," but "adversary." Translate, <span class="accented">Surely they that rose up against us</span> (or, <span class="accented">our adversaries</span>) <span class="accented">are cut off</span>; and compare the Revised Version. The "adversaries" of the righteous are the "wicked men" who have been "snatched away before their time," and have had their "foundation overflown with a flood" (ver. 16). <span class="cmt_word">But the remnant of them the fire consumeth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and the remnant of them hath the fire consumed</span> (see the Revised Version). The "fire" here, like the "flood" in ver. 16, is a metaphor, and therefore not to be pressed. All that is essential is that the wicked are destroyed. Over this the "righteous" and the "innocent" rejoice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/22-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8216;Surely</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">our foes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1464;&#1425;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#238;&#183;m&#257;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7009.htm">Strong's 7009: </a> </span><span class="str2">An opponent, enemies</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are destroyed,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1443;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(ni&#7733;&#183;&#7717;a&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3582.htm">Strong's 3582: </a> </span><span class="str2">To secrete, by act, word, to destroy</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and fire</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1469;&#1513;&#1473;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_784.htm">Strong's 784: </a> </span><span class="str2">A fire</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has consumed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1443;&#1499;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_398.htm">Strong's 398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To eat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their excess.&#8217;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1437;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;yi&#7791;&#183;r&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3499.htm">Strong's 3499: </a> </span><span class="str2">An overhanging, an excess, superiority, remainder, a small rope</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/22-20.htm">Job 22:20 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/22-20.htm">Job 22:20 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/22-20.htm">Job 22:20 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/22-20.htm">Job 22:20 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/22-20.htm">Job 22:20 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/22-20.htm">Job 22:20  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/22-20.htm">Job 22:20 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/22-20.htm">Job 22:20 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/22-20.htm">Job 22:20 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/22-20.htm">Job 22:20 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/22-20.htm">OT Poetry: Job 22:20 Saying 'Surely those who rose up against (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/22-19.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 22:19"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 22:19" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/22-21.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 22:21"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 22:21" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
