In the ancient Near Eastern context, feasting was a common practice for marking special occasions. The completion of these days suggests a return to normalcy and a time for reflection and spiritual renewal. The cyclical nature of feasting and purification highlights the rhythm of life in Job's time, where spiritual concerns followed physical celebrations.<p><b>Job would send for his children to purify them</b><br>Job's role as the family patriarch included spiritual oversight. The act of purification suggests a ritual cleansing, possibly involving washing and abstaining from certain activities, to restore spiritual purity. This reflects the ancient belief in the need for atonement and reconciliation with God after potential moral lapses. Job's proactive approach underscores his deep concern for his children's spiritual well-being, emphasizing the importance of intercessory actions by family heads.<p><b>rising early in the morning to offer burnt offerings for all of them</b><br>Rising early signifies diligence and priority given to spiritual duties. Burnt offerings were a central aspect of Old Testament worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. The act of offering sacrifices for each child individually highlights Job's meticulous care and the personal nature of his intercession. This practice aligns with the sacrificial system later formalized in the Mosaic Law, where offerings were made to atone for sins and seek God's favor.<p><b>For Job thought, &#8220;Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.&#8221;</b><br>Job's concern reflects an understanding of sin that goes beyond outward actions to include inner thoughts and attitudes. The fear of cursing God in their hearts indicates an awareness of the seriousness of blasphemy and the importance of maintaining a pure heart before God. This introspective view of sin is consistent with biblical teachings that emphasize the heart's condition, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a> and <a href="/matthew/5-8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>.<p><b>This was Job&#8217;s regular practice</b><br>Job's consistent behavior demonstrates his steadfast faith and commitment to God. His regular practice of intercession and sacrifice underscores the importance of routine spiritual disciplines in maintaining a relationship with God. This habitual devotion serves as a model of faithfulness and piety, reflecting the biblical principle of perseverance in spiritual duties, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a> and <a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

When the cycle of celebration wrapped up, Job did not brush it off as mere harmless fun. He sensed the spiritual vulnerability that often follows festive gatherings. Scripture repeatedly links feasting with the potential for excess (<a href="/proverbs/23-20.htm">Proverbs 23:20-21</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:2</a>). Job teaches us vigilance: joy is good, yet watchfulness must follow (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Job would send for his children to purify them</b><p>Even though these adult children lived independently, their father remained spiritually engaged. &#8220;Purify&#8221; (or &#8220;sanctify&#8221;) points to deliberate separation from anything unclean (<a href="/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2</a>; <a href="/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10-14</a>). Job models parental intercession:<p>&#8226; He calls them in, not to scold, but to shepherd.<p>&#8226; He treats sin as a possibility, not a certainty&#8212;yet still worth addressing.<p>The scene mirrors Joshua&#8217;s call, &#8220;Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/3-5.htm">Joshua 3:5</a>). Family leadership involves urging loved ones toward holiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Rising early in the morning to offer burnt offerings for all of them</b><p>Job&#8217;s devotion is immediate and wholehearted. Rising early recalls Abraham preparing an altar (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>) and Moses meeting God at dawn (<a href="/exodus/34-4.htm">Exodus 34:4</a>). The burnt offering, consumed wholly by fire (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a>), symbolized total surrender to God. Long before the Mosaic Law, Job understands that forgiveness requires substitutionary sacrifice (<a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).

He does not wait for visible rebellion; he addresses hidden attitudes. &#8220;Cursed God&#8221; is the very accusation Satan will level later (<a href="/job/1-11.htm">Job 1:11</a>).

After every celebration, Job gathers his family, urges purification, rises early, and presents burnt offerings for each child. He recognizes the unseen dangers of the heart, treats sin seriously, and establishes a steady habit of worship.

(Comp. <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>our "cleave to" and "cleave.") The use of <span class= "ital">bless </span>in the sense of <span class= "ital">curse </span>may be a euphemism, or it may arise from giving to it the meaning of <span class= "ital">saluting </span>or <span class= "ital">bidding farewell to, </span>and so <span class= "ital">dismissing. </span>This use is not elsewhere found than in the passages cited above. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about</span>; rather, <span class="accented">when the days of the feasting had come round</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whenever one of the birthdays had arrived in due course, and the feasting had taken place. That Job sent and sanctified them. In the old world, outside the Mosaic Law, the father of the family was the priest, to whom alone it belonged to bless, purify, and offer sacrifice. Job, after each birthday-feast, sent, it would seem, for his sons, and purified them by the accustomed ablutions, or possibly by some other ceremonial process, regarding it as probable that, in the course of their feasting, they had contracted some defilement. It would seem by the next clause that the purification took place at the close of the day of festivity. <span class="cmt_word">And rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings</span>. Burnt offerings were instituted soon after the Fall, as we learn from <a href="/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a>, and were in common use long before the Mosaic Law was given (see <a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-8.htm">Genesis 22:8, 13</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>; <a href="/exodus/18-12.htm">Exodus 18:12</a>; 'Records of the Past,' vol. 2. pp. 20, 21; vol. 12. pp. 49, 71, etc.). The practice was common, so far as appears, to all the nations of antiquity, except the Persians (Herod., 1:132). According to the number of them all One, apparently, for each child, since each might have sinned in the way suggested. The offerings were clearly it. tended as expiatory. <span class="cmt_word">For Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts</span>. Two wholly different meanings are assigned by good Hebraists to the expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. According to some, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> has its usual sense, "to bless," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> signifies "false gods," or "idols;" according to the others, who form the great majority, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> has its usual sense of "God," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> has the unusual sense of "curse" (so Buxtorf, Rosenmuller, Schultens, (Cook, Stanley Leathes, among moderns, and among ancient authorities, the Septuagint and the Vulgate). How the same word comes to have the two wholly opposite senses of "to bless" and "to curse" has been differently explained. Some think that, as men blessed their friends both on receiving them and on bidding them adieu, the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> got the sense of "bidding adieu to," "dismissing," "renouncing." Others regard the use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> for "to curse" as a mere euphemism, and compare the use of <span class="accented">sacer</span> and <span class="accented">sacrari</span> in Latin, and such expressions as "<span class="accented">Bless</span> the stupid man!" "What a <span class="accented">blessed</span> nuisance!" in English. The maledictory sense seems to be established by <a href="/job/2-9.htm">Job 2:9</a> and <a href="/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10</a>. By "cursing God in their hearts" Job probably means "forgetting him," "putting him out of sight," "not giving him the honour which is his due." <span class="cmt_word">Thus did Job continually</span>; literally, as in the margin, <span class="accented">all the days</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whenever one of the festival-days occurred. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/1-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1441;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
