In the Hebrew context, wisdom is often associated with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), while folly is linked to moral and spiritual deficiency. Job's rebuke suggests that his wife's advice lacks spiritual insight and understanding. The term "foolish" in the biblical sense often implies a rejection of God's sovereignty and wisdom, as seen in <a href="/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>, where the fool says in his heart, "There is no God."<p><b>he told her.</b><br>This phrase indicates Job's direct communication with his wife, emphasizing the personal and relational aspect of the dialogue. In the patriarchal society of the time, a husband's guidance was considered authoritative within the family structure. Job's leadership in maintaining faithfulness to God, even in adversity, sets a precedent for spiritual leadership within the family unit.<p><b>Should we accept from God only good and not adversity?</b><br>Job's rhetorical question underscores a profound theological truth about the nature of God's sovereignty and the human experience. It reflects the biblical theme that God is the source of both blessing and trial, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>, where God declares, "I form the light and create darkness, I bring prosperity and create disaster." This statement challenges the prosperity theology that suggests God only gives good things to His followers. Job's acceptance of both good and adversity from God is a testament to his understanding of God's ultimate authority and purpose, reminiscent of Jesus' submission to the Father's will in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>).<p><b>In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.</b><br>This affirmation of Job's righteousness is crucial in the narrative, as it reinforces his integrity and faithfulness despite severe trials. The phrase echoes the earlier declaration in <a href="/job/1-22.htm">Job 1:22</a>, where Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing. It highlights the biblical principle that true faith is tested and proven in adversity, as seen in <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>, which encourages believers to consider trials as opportunities for growth and perseverance. Job's restraint in speech also prefigures Christ, who, when reviled, did not revile in return (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>), demonstrating perfect submission and trust in God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

He reminds her&#8212;and us&#8212;that the God who gives pleasant gifts also permits painful trials, all under His wise sovereignty. Because Job clings to this truth, his words remain free of sin, offering a timeless model of steadfast faith and faithful speech amid adversity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Shall we receive good . . .?</span>--The words were fuller than even Job thought; for merely to receive evil as from <span class= "ital">God's </span>hands is to transmute its character altogether, for then even calamities become blessings in disguise. What Job meant was that we are <span class= "ital">bound </span>to expect evil as well as good from God's hands by a sort of compensation and even-handed justice, but what his words <span class= "ital">may </span>mean is a far more blessed truth than this. There is a sublime contrast between the temptation of Job and the temptation of Christ (<a href="/context/matthew/26-39.htm" title="And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as you will.">Matthew 26:39-42</a>, &c.). (Comp. <a href="/hebrews/5-8.htm" title="Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;">Hebrews 5:8</a>.) <span class= "ital">This </span>was the lesson Job was learning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh</span>; rather, as <span class="accented">one of</span> <span class="accented">the vile</span> (or <span class="accented">impious</span>) <span class="accented">women speaketh. Nabal</span>, the term used, is expressive, not of mere natural folly, but of that perversion of the intellect which comes on men when their hearts and understandings are corrupted and degraded.. (see <a href="/2_samuel/13-13.htm">2 Samuel 13:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-6.htm">Isaiah 32:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">What? shall we receive good at the hand of God and shall we not receive evil?</span> Job remembers all the good which he has received of God during his past life, all the blessings and prosperity bestowed on him (<a href="/job/1-2.htm">Job 1:2, 3</a>), and asks - Would it be fair or right to take all the good things as a matter of course, and then to murmur if evil things are sent? He accepts both prosperity and affliction as coming from God, and expresses himself as willing to submit to his will. But he has, perhaps, scarcely attained to the conviction that whatever God sends to his faithful servants is always that which is best for them - that afflictions, in fact, are blessings in disguise, and ought to be received with gratitude, not with murmuring (comp. <a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-11</a><span class="cmt_word">). In all this did not Job sin with his lips</span>. Thus far, that is, Job "kept the door of his mouth" strictly, righteously, piously. Later on he was not always so entirely free from fault. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/2-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;You speak</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1438;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
