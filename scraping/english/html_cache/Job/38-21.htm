It emphasizes the theme of human limitation in comprehending divine mysteries. This rhetorical question underscores the irony, as Job, a mere human, cannot possibly know the intricacies of creation and the universe. This aligns with other biblical passages that stress God's omniscience, such as <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's thoughts and ways are higher than human understanding.<p><b>for you were already born!</b><br>Here, God sarcastically suggests that Job must have been present at the creation of the world to possess such knowledge. This highlights the absurdity of human presumption in questioning God's governance. The phrase serves to remind readers of the temporal nature of human existence compared to God's eternal nature. It echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>, which speaks of God's eternal existence before the mountains were born.<p><b>And the number of your days is great!</b><br>This statement further emphasizes the irony, as Job's lifespan is insignificant compared to God's eternal existence. It serves as a reminder of the brevity of human life, a theme also found in <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which compares life to a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. The phrase challenges readers to recognize their own limitations and the futility of questioning God's purposes without understanding His eternal perspective.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
