Job recognizes that God's power is unmatched and beyond human comprehension. This aligns with other biblical passages that emphasize God's strength, such as <a href="/psalms/147-5.htm">Psalm 147:5</a>, which states, "Great is our Lord and mighty in power." The cultural context of the ancient Near East often depicted gods as powerful beings, but the God of Israel is portrayed as the ultimate source of strength, surpassing all others. This acknowledgment of divine strength also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, who demonstrates God's power through miracles and His resurrection.<p><b>If it is a matter of justice, who can summon Him?</b><br>Here, Job grapples with the concept of divine justice, questioning who has the authority to call God to account. This reflects the ancient understanding of God as the ultimate judge, whose decisions are beyond human challenge. The rhetorical question underscores the futility of contending with God in matters of justice, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13-14</a>, which asks, "Who has understood the mind of the Lord, or instructed Him as His counselor?" This phrase also points to the New Testament, where Jesus is depicted as the righteous judge (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>), emphasizing that divine justice is ultimately fulfilled in Christ. The cultural context of Job's time would have understood justice as a divine prerogative, reinforcing the idea that God's ways are inscrutable and His judgments are final.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man described as blameless and upright, who fears God and shuns evil.

In the face of terrible loss and physical suffering, he reminds himself&#8212;and his friends&#8212;that God&#8217;s strength is unmatched.<p>&#8226; Scripture gives repeated testimony that &#8220;power belongs to God&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/62-11.htm">Psalm 62:11</a>).<p>&#8226; From creation itself (<a href="/bsb/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>) to the flood (<a href="/bsb/genesis/7.htm">Genesis 7-8</a>) to the Red Sea (<a href="/bsb/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>), His acts of strength are woven through history.<p>&#8226; Job has already confessed, &#8220;What He tears down cannot be rebuilt; the man He imprisons cannot be released&#8221; (<a href="/job/12-14.htm">Job 12:14-15</a>). He knows there is no rival to the Almighty&#8217;s might.<p>&#8226; This recognition doesn&#8217;t diminish Job&#8217;s pain; it places it in perspective. The God who is &#8220;indeed mighty&#8221; (<a href="/job/9-19.htm">Job 9:19</a>) holds every circumstance, including suffering, in His sovereign hand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If it is a matter of justice, who can summon Him?</b><p>Job shifts from power to the courtroom image of justice, asking who could possibly drag God before a tribunal.<p>&#8226; In the ancient Near-Eastern world, a summons implied authority over the one called. Job admits no one wields that authority over God (<a href="/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; God alone &#8220;judges the ends of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a>). He is never the defendant&#8212;always the righteous Judge (<a href="/psalms/75-7.htm">Psalm 75:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul echoes this truth centuries later: &#8220;But who are you, O man, to answer back to God?&#8221; (<a href="/romans/9-20.htm">Romans 9:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Even King Nebuchadnezzar learned, &#8220;No one can restrain His hand or say to Him, &#8216;What have You done?&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/4-35.htm">Daniel 4:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s lament, then, is not rebellion but honest confession: if ultimate justice resides in God, frail humans cannot compel Him to explain Himself. Our role is to trust His perfect character, whether or not we understand His ways.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/9-19.htm">Job 9:19</a> sets two immovable pillars: God&#8217;s strength and God&#8217;s justice. He is powerful beyond challenge and righteous beyond accusation. Recognizing these truths anchors faith in every trial; we may bring our questions, but we rest in the assurance that the One who rules history is both almighty and perfectly just.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">If I speak of strength.</span>--All this is the most uncompromising acknowledgment of the absolute inability of man to stand in judgment before God. The whole of this is so very abrupt and enigmatical that it is extremely difficult to be sure of the argument, though naturally the general drift of it is obvious enough. "If it were a trial of strength--Who is Almighty?--and if it was a matter of judgment, is He not judge and court together? and what authority that He would acknowledge could give me the opportunity of pleading my cause before Him? Were I righteous, my own mouth would show me wicked; were I perfect, then would it or He prove me perverse. Were I perfect, I should not know myself, or know it myself. I despise my life under such conditions; therefore, said I, it is all one: He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked alike."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong</span>.
