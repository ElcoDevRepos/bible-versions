In the ancient Near East, iron was a symbol of strength and power. The use of "iron weapon" indicates a formidable threat, yet the subject attempts to escape it. This reflects the broader theme in Job of the futility of human efforts against divine will. Iron weapons were common in the time of Job, indicating advanced military technology and the seriousness of the threat. Biblically, iron is often associated with judgment and strength (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23</a>, <a href="/daniel/2-33.htm">Daniel 2:33-35</a>).<p><b>a bronze-tipped arrow will pierce him</b><br>Bronze, like iron, was a significant material in ancient warfare, often used for crafting weapons. The "bronze-tipped arrow" signifies a precise and unavoidable judgment. Arrows in scripture often symbolize sudden and unexpected divine retribution (<a href="/psalms/64-7.htm">Psalm 64:7</a>, <a href="/lamentations/3-12.htm">Lamentations 3:12-13</a>). The piercing action implies that despite attempts to escape, the consequences of one's actions, particularly wickedness, are inescapable. This reflects the broader biblical principle that God's justice is thorough and unavoidable (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). The imagery of piercing can also be seen as a type of Christ, who was pierced for humanity's transgressions (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>), highlighting the ultimate fulfillment of divine justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zophar_the_naamathite.htm">Zophar the Naamathite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

Yet the sinner thinks, &#8220;If I&#8217;m fast enough, I&#8217;ll be safe.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently shows such flight is futile:<p>&#8211; &#8220;The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>).<p>&#8211; Rebellious Judah boasted, &#8220;We will flee on horses&#8221;&#8212;and God replied, &#8220;therefore you will flee!&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/30-16.htm">Isaiah 30:16</a>).<p>&#8211; Amos painted an even starker scene: a man who escapes a lion only to meet a bear (<a href="/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>).<p>&#8226; No matter how clever the escape plan, &#8220;Where can I flee from Your presence?&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7</a>).

This is no indication of the late authorship of Job. Iron was in use in Egypt at a very early date. A thin plate of it was found by Colonel Howard Vyse embedded in the masonry of the great pyramid; and iron implements and ornaments, iron spear-heads, iron sickles, iron gimlets, iron keys, iron bracelets, iron wire, have been found in the early tombs not infrequently (see the author's 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 505). That they are not more common is accounted for by the rapid oxidization of iron by exposure to the air, and its rapid decay in the nitrous soil of Egypt. The inhabitants of South-Western Asia were at no time much behind the Egyptians in their knowledge of the useful arts: and iron appears as a well-known metal in the Jewish Scriptures from the time of the Exodus (see <a href="/numbers/35-16.htm">Numbers 35:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23</a>; <a href="/joshua/8-31.htm">Joshua 8:31</a>). It is true that the principal weapons of war continued to be made ordinarily of bronze, both in South-Western Asia and in Egypt, till a comparatively late period; but Zophar may mean to assign to the slayer of the wicked man weapons of a superior character. <span class="cmt_word">And the bow of steel shall strike him through</span>. It is uncertain whether steel was known in the ancient world. But, whether or no, "steel" is not meant here. The word used in the original is <span class="accented">nehushtah</span>, which undoubtedly means either "copper" or "bronze." As copper would be too soft a material for a bow, we may assume bronze to be intended. The bronze used in Egypt was extremely elastic, and there would have been little difficulty in fashioning bows of it (on the existence of such bows, see 2 Samuel 26:5; <a href="/psalms/18-34.htm">Psalm 18:34</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/20-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Though he flees</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1453;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#7687;&#183;ra&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1272.htm">Strong's 1272: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bolt, to flee suddenly</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from an iron</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1494;&#1462;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(bar&#183;zel)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1270.htm">Strong's 1270: </a> </span><span class="str2">Iron, an iron implement</span><br /><br /><span class="word">weapon,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(min&#183;n&#234;&#183;&#353;eq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5402.htm">Strong's 5402: </a> </span><span class="str2">Military equipment, arms, an arsenal</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a bronze-tipped</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#363;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5154.htm">Strong's 5154: </a> </span><span class="str2">Copper, bronze</span><br /><br /><span class="word">arrow</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1462;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(qe&#183;&#353;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7198.htm">Strong's 7198: </a> </span><span class="str2">A bow, for, shooting, the iris</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will pierce him.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1437;&#1495;&#1456;&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1461;&#1431;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#7717;&#183;l&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person feminine singular &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2498.htm">Strong's 2498: </a> </span><span class="str2">To slide by, to hasten away, pass on, spring up, pierce, change</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/20-24.htm">OT Poetry: Job 20:24 He shall flee from the iron weapon (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/20-23.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 20:23"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 20:23" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/20-25.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 20:25"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 20:25" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
