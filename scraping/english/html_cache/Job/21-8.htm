In ancient Near Eastern culture, having descendants was a sign of divine favor and blessing. The idea of descendants being "established" suggests a sense of permanence and security, which contrasts with the suffering of the righteous like Job. This theme is echoed in <a href="/psalms/37-35.htm">Psalm 37:35-36</a>, where the wicked are seen flourishing like a green tree. Theologically, this challenges the retribution principle, which posits that righteousness leads to blessing and wickedness to suffering.<p><b>and their offspring before their eyes</b><br>The presence of offspring "before their eyes" indicates not only the joy of seeing one's lineage continue but also the immediate, visible evidence of prosperity. In biblical times, witnessing the growth and success of one's children was a significant source of pride and fulfillment. This imagery contrasts with Job's own loss of his children (<a href="/job/1-18.htm">Job 1:18-19</a>), highlighting the depth of his lament. Theologically, this raises questions about divine justice and the apparent prosperity of the wicked, a theme also explored in <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:14</a>.

Job&#8217;s point is that earthly success can mask a heart far from God.<p>&#8226; The statement does not deny God&#8217;s ultimate justice; rather, it highlights the present-tense reality that earthly circumstances may appear favorable even for those who ignore Him (see <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and their offspring before their eyes</b><p>&#8226; Not only are the children settled, but the parents live long enough to watch them grow, echoing <a href="/proverbs/17-6.htm">Proverbs 17:6</a>: &#8220;Grandchildren are the crown of the aged.&#8221; The wicked enjoy scenes many righteous people long for&#8212;weddings, grandchildren, full tables&#8212;seemingly without divine interruption.<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s observation underlines the tension between temporal appearances and eternal outcomes. <a href="/psalms/37-35.htm">Psalm 37:35&#8211;36</a> records a similar sight: &#8220;I have seen a wicked, ruthless man flourishing like a leafy tree&#8230; yet he passed away.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By stressing &#8220;before their eyes,&#8221; Job emphasizes the personal satisfaction the ungodly experience in the present, even while ignoring the God who grants every breath (<a href="/acts/17-25.htm">Acts 17:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/21-8.htm">Job 21:8</a> records Job&#8217;s sober recognition that the wicked can enjoy the settled, visible prosperity of their children.
