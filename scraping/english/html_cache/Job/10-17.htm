This reflects Job's perception of his suffering as unjust and relentless. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, legal imagery was common, and witnesses were crucial in legal proceedings. Job's lament can be seen as a courtroom drama where he feels God is both the judge and the prosecutor. This imagery is consistent with other parts of Job, such as <a href="/job/9-33.htm">Job 9:33</a>, where he longs for an arbiter between him and God. Theologically, this reflects the human struggle to understand divine justice and suffering.<p><b>and multiply Your anger toward me</b><br>Job perceives that God's anger is increasing against him. This reflects the ancient belief that suffering was often a sign of divine displeasure. In the broader biblical context, God's anger is often associated with judgment and correction, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/29-27.htm">Deuteronomy 29:27-28</a>. However, Job's situation is unique because he is described as blameless and upright (<a href="/job/1.htm">Job 1:1</a>). This tension highlights the mystery of suffering and challenges the retributive justice theology prevalent in Job's time.<p><b>Hardships assault me in wave after wave</b><br>The imagery of waves suggests relentless and overwhelming suffering. This metaphor is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe overwhelming circumstances, such as in <a href="/psalms/42-7.htm">Psalm 42:7</a>, "Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls; all your waves and breakers have swept over me." The repetition of hardships reflects the intensity of Job's trials, which include loss of wealth, family, and health. This phrase captures the essence of Job's lament and his feeling of being besieged by suffering. It also foreshadows the ultimate resolution of Job's story, where God restores him, pointing to themes of redemption and hope amidst suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Later God will show that no hidden sin lies behind the suffering (<a href="/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Other saints have felt similarly outnumbered by accusations&#8212;see <a href="/psalms/44-17.htm">Psalm 44:17-19</a>, where Israel cries, &#8220;All this has come upon us, though we have not forgotten You.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and multiply Your anger toward me.</b><p>&#8226; From Job&#8217;s seat in the ash heap, every fresh blow looks like proof that divine wrath is intensifying: &#8220;His anger burns against me; He counts me among His enemies&#8221; (<a href="/job/19-11.htm">Job 19:11</a>).<p>&#8226; This is how pain distorts perception; yet the text affirms God&#8217;s sovereign right to act, even when the servant cannot trace the reason (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/88-16.htm">Psalm 88:16</a> echoes Job&#8217;s feeling: &#8220;Your wrath has swept over me; Your terrors have destroyed me.&#8221; The lament is real, but God&#8217;s character remains righteous, a truth Job will rediscover (<a href="/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hardships assault me in wave after wave.</b><p>&#8226; The Hebrew imagery is tidal: calamities rolling in one set after another. Job&#8217;s story began with four rapid disasters (<a href="/job/1-13.htm">Job 1:13-19</a>), and the emotional pounding continues.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/42-7.htm">Psalm 42:7</a> gives the same picture: &#8220;All Your breakers and waves sweep over me.&#8221; Believers may know seasons where relief is brief and troubles crowd the shore.<p>&#8226; Yet the sovereign hand behind the waves also sets their limit (<a href="/job/38-11.htm">Job 38:11</a>). In time, God will &#8220;restore the fortunes of Job&#8221; (<a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>), proving that the waves cannot wash away His purpose or love (<a href="/romans/8-35.htm">Romans 8:35-39</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/10-17.htm">Job 10:17</a> captures the raw honesty of a sufferer who trusts God&#8217;s sovereignty yet cannot understand His reasons. He feels like a defendant battered by endless testimony, a target of escalating wrath, and a sailor pounded by relentless waves. Scripture preserves these words so we can see that faith can voice pain without abandoning reverence. The God who permitted the waves also promises to still them, and in Christ we find the ultimate assurance that no accusation, anger, or hardship can separate us from His steadfast love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Thou renewest thy witnesses against me.</span>--Some understand this of the sores on Job's person, which his friends regarded as witnesses--proofs of his guilt; but it seems more probable that the figure is forensic: "Thou still bringest fresh witnesses against me, and multipliest thine anger against me, so that relays of them, even a host, are against me; for they come upon me host after host--these witnesses of Thine anger, the ministers of Thy vengeance." The sublimity of this indictment against God is only equalled by the sense of terrific awe with which one reads it.
