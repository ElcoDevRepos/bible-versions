In the context of Job, it reflects the idea that those who once witnessed the prosperity or presence of a person will eventually no longer see them. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of the brevity of life, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15-16</a>, which compares human life to grass that flourishes and then is gone.<p><b>will see him no more,</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the finality of death and the inevitable disappearance of individuals from the earthly realm. It resonates with the biblical understanding of death as a separation from the living world, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:5</a>, where the dead are described as knowing nothing and having no further part in anything done under the sun. This also reflects the cultural understanding of death in the ancient Near East, where life was seen as a temporary journey.<p><b>and his place</b><br>The term "his place" can refer to the physical location where a person lived or held influence. In the ancient world, one's place was often tied to their identity and social status. This phrase can be linked to the idea of legacy and the impact one leaves behind, as seen in <a href="/psalms/49-11.htm">Psalm 49:11</a>, which speaks of people naming lands after themselves in an attempt to achieve immortality.<p><b>will no longer behold him.</b><br>This final phrase underscores the idea that once a person is gone, their absence is felt by the places and people they leave behind. It highlights the void left by the departed and the inevitable change that occurs in their absence. This can be connected to the broader biblical narrative of the impermanence of earthly life and the hope of eternal life, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54-55</a>, where death is ultimately swallowed up in victory through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zophar_the_naamathite.htm">Zophar the Naamathite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

Everyone who once watched him rise&#8212;family, neighbors, business partners&#8212;had physical proof of his prosperity.<p>- Scripture often points to the public visibility of human achievement: &#8220;The eye of him who sees me will see me no more; Your eyes will be on me, but I will be gone&#8221; (<a href="/job/7-8.htm">Job 7:8</a>).<p>- <a href="/psalms/37-35.htm">Psalm 37:35&#8211;36</a> likewise notes, &#8220;I have seen a wicked, ruthless man flourishing like a native tree, yet he passed away, and behold, he was no more.&#8221; The point: observers can watch a life unfold, yet God determines its span.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will see him no more,</b><p>- Sudden reversal is at the heart of Zophar&#8217;s warning. The same eyes that once admired the wicked will look again and find only absence.<p>- <a href="/job/7-10.htm">Job 7:10</a> says of the departed, &#8220;He will never return to his house; his place will remember him no more.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/proverbs/10-25.htm">Proverbs 10:25</a> adds, &#8220;When the storm has passed, the wicked are gone, but the righteous stand firm forever.&#8221; God&#8217;s justice is swift enough that the onlookers get no second viewing; the wicked man is erased from the scene.<p>- This is not gradual fading but decisive removal, reflecting divine judgment rather than mere human misfortune.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his place will no longer behold him.</b><p>- Even inanimate surroundings&#8212;house, land, city gate&#8212;are personified as &#8220;beholding&#8221; him no longer.
