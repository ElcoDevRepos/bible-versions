The "breath" of God is often associated with His Spirit, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, where the Spirit of God hovers over the waters during creation. The clearing of the skies can be understood as God's ability to bring order out of chaos, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the sky was often seen as a realm of divine activity, and God's control over it signifies His supreme authority. This imagery also connects to the calming of storms, as seen in the New Testament when Jesus calms the sea (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>), demonstrating His divine authority over nature.<p><b>His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.</b><br>The "fleeing serpent" is a reference to chaos and evil, often symbolized by serpents or dragons in ancient Near Eastern mythology. This imagery is reminiscent of the Canaanite myth of Baal defeating the sea monster Lotan, which parallels the biblical narrative of God's victory over chaos. In a biblical context, the serpent is also a symbol of Satan, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a> and <a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>. The act of piercing the serpent signifies God's ultimate victory over evil. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's victory over Satan through His death and resurrection, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the seed of the woman will crush the serpent's head. This victory is further echoed in <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>, where Christ disarms the powers and authorities, triumphing over them by the cross.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man known for his patience and faithfulness amidst suffering.

In <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2&#8211;3</a> the Spirit of God hovers over the waters and creation springs forth at the spoken word. <a href="/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a> echoes, &#8220;By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, and all the stars by the breath of His mouth.&#8221;<p>- Job&#8217;s statement reminds us that every movement in the universe is sustained by the living God, not by impersonal forces. The same breath that animated Adam (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>) still animates the cosmos.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the skies were cleared</b><p>- &#8220;Cleared&#8221; points to order, beauty, and transparency. When God blows away storm clouds, the heavens become a display case for His majesty (<a href="/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>).<p>- In <a href="/job/26-7.htm">Job 26:7&#8211;10</a> Job has already listed God&#8217;s cosmic feats&#8212;stretching the north over empty space, hanging the earth on nothing, binding the waters in thick clouds&#8212;so this line continues the theme: God alone removes chaos and reveals clarity.<p>- For the believer, clear skies picture the peace God speaks into our storms (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His hand pierced</b><p>- God&#8217;s &#8220;hand&#8221; stresses direct, decisive action (<a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>). He does not merely restrain evil; He crushes it.<p>- &#8220;Pierced&#8221; conveys lethal force. <a href="/job/26-12.htm">Job 26:12</a> just noted, &#8220;By His wisdom He shattered Rahab,&#8221; a term for a primeval sea monster. The verse now zooms in on God&#8217;s final thrust.<p>- Bullet points of comfort:<p>&#8226; Evil may snarl, but it is vulnerable to God&#8217;s strike.<p>&#8226; Judgment is not accidental; it is executed by the very hand that formed the stars (<a href="/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the fleeing serpent</b><p>- The phrase points to a real adversary pictured as a serpent-dragon. <a href="/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a> speaks of &#8220;Leviathan, the fleeing serpent&#8230; the coiling serpent,&#8221; whom the LORD will slay. <a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a> identifies &#8220;the great dragon&#8230; that ancient serpent, called the devil.&#8221;<p>- In Job&#8217;s era it also recalled the chaotic sea-monster motif, but Scripture consistently uses that image to reveal an actual spiritual enemy.<p>- God&#8217;s victory over the fleeing serpent foreshadows the cross where Christ &#8220;disarmed the powers and authorities&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>) and anticipates the day when Satan is thrown into the lake of fire (<a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/26-13.htm">Job 26:13</a> paints a two-stroke portrait: the breath of God crafts and orders the heavens, and the hand of God crushes the serpent that would poison them. The verse assures us that the Creator who spoke peace into the sky also personally defeats every force of evil. Our place is to marvel, worship, and trust the Lord whose gentle breath sustains life and whose mighty hand secures final victory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">The crooked serpent.</span>--By this expression is doubtless meant the forked lightning-flash, though it is difficult to determine whether any, or what mythological ideas may underlie the expression, or whether it is anything more than a figure derived from the natural world, which suggested the similitude of the flying serpent. Others understand by it the constellation of the Northern Dragon, to whose influence storms were ascribed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens</span>; or, <span class="accented">by his spirit the heavens are brightness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at a breath from his mouth the heavens, lately all cloud and storm (vers. 8-11), recover their serenity, are calm and clear and bright. Our experience says, "After a storm comes a calm." Job notes that both alike are from God. <span class="cmt_word">His hand hath formed the crooked serpent</span>; rather, <span class="accented">his hand hath pierced the swift serpent</span> (see the Revised Version). The reference is probably to "the war in heaven," already suggested by the mention of" Rahab" (ver. 12). In that war, according to the tradition that had reached Job, a great serpent, like the Egyptian Apepi (Apophis), had borne a part. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/26-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">By His breath</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1453;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;r&#363;&#183;&#7717;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
