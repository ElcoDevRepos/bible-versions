In the context of <a href="/job/41.htm">Job 41</a>, God is describing the Leviathan, a creature symbolizing chaos and power. The imagery of looking down implies dominance and control over those who are arrogant or self-important. Biblically, haughtiness is often condemned (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>), and this phrase reinforces the idea that no human pride can stand before God's creation and power. The Leviathan, as a creature of immense strength, serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over all creation, including those who consider themselves mighty.<p><b>he is king over all the proud.</b><br>The term "king" denotes rulership and ultimate authority. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, kings were seen as the highest authority, often believed to be appointed by the divine. By stating that Leviathan is king over the proud, the text emphasizes the futility of human pride in the face of God's creation. This can be seen as a metaphor for God's ultimate authority over all human arrogance. Theologically, this reflects the biblical theme that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). The Leviathan, as a symbol of chaos, is under God's control, illustrating that even the most chaotic and powerful forces are subject to God's will. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, in His humility, conquered sin and death, demonstrating true power through submission to God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A righteous man tested by God through severe trials, including the loss of his wealth, health, and family.

Leviathan is pictured as surveying everything beneath him, unafraid, untouched.<p>&#8226; This mirrors the Creator&#8217;s intent to show Job that even the most intimidating forces in creation are still under God&#8217;s ultimate oversight (<a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4, 41</a>:10).<p>&#8226; Cross-reference: <a href="/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13-15</a> shows the Lord &#8220;looking down from heaven&#8221; on all mankind, reinforcing that only the One enthroned above truly sees all.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on all the haughty</b><p>The object of Leviathan&#8217;s gaze is &#8220;all the haughty.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Haughty&#8221; people exalt themselves (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). God highlights that even human arrogance holds no threat to this creature, let alone to God.<p>&#8226; In Scripture, haughtiness is consistently condemned&#8212;<a href="/proverbs/8-13.htm">Proverbs 8:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>. By pointing to Leviathan&#8217;s superiority over the arrogant, the Lord underscores His own far greater authority over pride.<p>&#8226; Practically, Job&#8212;and we&#8212;are reminded that self-exaltation is futile when faced with powers beyond us and, supremely, with God Himself (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he is king</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;he is king.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Leviathan is portrayed as ruling in his realm. Nothing in the natural world dethrones him.<p>&#8226; This royal language heightens the contrast: if a creature is sovereign in its sphere, how much more is the Creator sovereign over all spheres (<a href="/psalms/95-3.htm">Psalm 95:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; It also hints at the order God has built into creation. Even fearsome beasts operate within limits He sets (<a href="/jeremiah/5-22.htm">Jeremiah 5:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>over all the proud</b><p>Finally, &#8220;over all the proud.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Leviathan stands as a living rebuke to pride. No proud person can subdue or control him (<a href="/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1-8</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording recalls <a href="/psalms/18-27.htm">Psalm 18:27</a>, where God humbles the proud but saves the humble. If a mere creature dominates the proud, how certain is God&#8217;s judgment of pride (<a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>).<p>&#8226; For Job, who wrestled with questions of justice, the message is clear: God sees pride, God controls every force, and no one escapes His rulership (<a href="/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/41-34.htm">Job 41:34</a> caps God&#8217;s speech by presenting Leviathan as an untouchable monarch over human arrogance. If this creature effortlessly &#8220;looks down on all the haughty&#8221; and reigns &#8220;over all the proud,&#8221; how much more does the Lord reign supreme. The verse humbles every form of pride, reassures believers of God&#8217;s unmatched sovereignty, and calls us to rest in the One who governs all, from the greatest beast to the proudest heart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He beholdeth all high things</span> He looks without fear on everything that is high and great.
