The Bible frequently cautions believers to examine themselves and their motives (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>). Self-deception can lead to spiritual blindness, as seen in the Pharisees' inability to recognize Jesus as the Messiah (<a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39-41</a>). The heart is deceitful above all things (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>), and without the guidance of the Holy Spirit, individuals can easily fall into the trap of believing lies about themselves and their standing before God.<p><b>with trust in emptiness</b><br>Trusting in emptiness refers to placing confidence in things that are ultimately worthless or void of substance. This can include material wealth, human wisdom, or false idols, all of which are condemned throughout the Bible (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>). The futility of trusting in anything other than God is a recurring theme, as seen in the story of the rich young ruler who trusted in his wealth (<a href="/matthew/19-16.htm">Matthew 19:16-22</a>). The Hebrew word for "emptiness" can also imply vanity or falsehood, aligning with the biblical view that only God provides true security and fulfillment.<p><b>for emptiness will be his reward</b><br>This phrase highlights the principle of sowing and reaping, where the outcome is directly related to the nature of one's actions (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>). Trusting in emptiness leads to a life devoid of true meaning and eternal value. The Bible contrasts this with the rewards of righteousness, which include peace, joy, and eternal life (<a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6-7</a>). The concept of emptiness as a reward serves as a stark warning against idolatry and self-reliance, urging believers to seek their reward in God alone, who offers abundant life through Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him but ends up accusing him of wrongdoing.

Scripture is clear that the human heart is &#8220;more deceitful than all else&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Self-deception happens when a person ignores God&#8217;s revealed truth and convinces himself he is fine without repentance or dependence on the Lord. See also:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Do not be deceived: God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>)<p>&#8226; &#8220;If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, let him become a fool so that he may become wise.&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-18.htm">1 Corinthians 3:18</a>)<p>&#8226; James echoes the same caution: &#8220;Be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>)<p>&#8226; Practically, Eliphaz is pressing the listener to examine motives, align with Scripture, and refuse any mindset that contradicts God&#8217;s Word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with trust in emptiness</b><p>&#8226; The phrase pictures a person leaning on something that has no substance&#8212;idols, riches, self-righteousness, or worldly philosophies.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Those who cling to worthless idols forfeit the grace that could be theirs.&#8221; (<a href="/jonah/2-8.htm">Jonah 2:8</a>)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Let not the rich man boast in his riches.&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23</a>)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in the uncertainty of riches.&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>)<p>&#8226; Isaiah mocked idols that &#8220;cannot save&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/45-20.htm">Isaiah 45:20</a>), and Jeremiah called them &#8220;broken cisterns that hold no water&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Trust that is not rooted in the living God is, by definition, empty. Jesus warned that building on sand ends in ruin (<a href="/matthew/7-26.htm">Matthew 7:26-27</a>).<p>&#8226; Job himself had earlier rejected such hollow confidence: &#8220;If I have made gold my trust&#8230; that too would be an iniquity&#8221; (<a href="/job/31-24.htm">Job 31:24-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for emptiness will be his reward</b><p>&#8226; A hollow faith inevitably produces a hollow outcome. As Hosea described, &#8220;They sow the wind, and they reap the whirlwind&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/8-7.htm">Hosea 8:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Proverbs reinforces the principle: &#8220;The wicked man earns deceptive wages&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/11-18.htm">Proverbs 11:18</a>) and &#8220;Whoever trusts in his riches will fall&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul applies the same truth: &#8220;The one who sows to his flesh will reap destruction from the flesh&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-8.htm">Galatians 6:8</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s justice ensures that what a person pursues apart from Him ultimately collapses, leaving &#8220;emptiness&#8221; as the final portion.<p>&#8226; By contrast, when trust is anchored in the Lord, the reward is abundant life (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>) and imperishable treasure (<a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/15-31.htm">Job 15:31</a> warns against the lethal cycle of self-deception: ignoring God, leaning on worthless supports, and ending in bitter loss.
