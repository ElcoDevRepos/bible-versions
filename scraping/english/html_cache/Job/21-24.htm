In the context of the Book of Job, it contrasts with Job's own suffering and physical affliction. The imagery of a well-nourished body can be seen as a symbol of God's blessing and favor, often associated with the righteous in the Old Testament. In ancient Near Eastern culture, physical well-being was often linked to spiritual and moral standing. This phrase may also reflect the prosperity of the wicked, as Job is challenging the simplistic view that only the righteous prosper. The idea of nourishment can be connected to <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, where God provides abundantly for His people.<p><b>and his bones are rich with marrow</b><br>Bones rich with marrow indicate vitality and strength. In biblical times, marrow was considered the source of life and health, as it is essential for producing blood cells. This phrase emphasizes the inner health and robustness of the individual. In Job's discourse, it serves to highlight the apparent contradiction between the prosperity of the wicked and the suffering of the righteous. The imagery of strong bones can be linked to <a href="/proverbs/3-8.htm">Proverbs 3:8</a>, which speaks of fearing the Lord and turning away from evil as bringing health to the body and nourishment to the bones. This phrase also foreshadows the resurrection and eternal life, where believers will be restored to perfect health, as seen in the promise of new bodies in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-42.htm">1 Corinthians 15:42-44</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

The phrase pictures a stomach satisfied, muscles filled out, and overall visible health.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/73-4.htm">Psalm 73:4</a> echoes the scene: &#8220;They have no struggles; their bodies are healthy and strong&#8221;. The psalmist, like Job, observes that outward ease is not limited to the righteous.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-15.htm">Deuteronomy 11:15</a> speaks of God&#8217;s provision&#8212;&#8220;you will eat and be satisfied&#8221;&#8212;reminding us that food and physical wellness are gifts the Lord can allow even to those who do not acknowledge Him.<p>&#8226; Yet Job&#8217;s wider argument (<a href="/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7&#8211;13</a>) is that physical prosperity is no sure indicator of spiritual standing.

Job observes that such robust health can appear even in those who seem indifferent to God.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/58-11.htm">Isaiah 58:11</a> speaks of God making bones &#8220;strong,&#8221; underscoring that real vigor ultimately comes from Him.<p>&#8226; By highlighting well-marrowed bones, Job stresses that some people die at the peak of wellness; no wasting disease weakens them first. In contrast, others &#8220;die in the bitterness of soul&#8221; (<a href="/job/21-25.htm">Job 21:25-26</a>). Earthly outcomes vary, so we must not equate temporal ease with divine approval.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/21-24.htm">Job 21:24</a> paints a picture of complete physical flourishing&#8212;full stomach, strong flesh, rich marrow. Job&#8217;s point is not to celebrate health but to challenge the assumption that prosperity proves righteousness. Both the godly and the ungodly may experience robust bodies and comfortable lives, yet their eternal destinies differ.
