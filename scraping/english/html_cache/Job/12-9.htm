The rhetorical question implies that all of creation is aware of God's sovereignty. In the ancient Near Eastern context, nature was often seen as a testament to divine power and order. This aligns with passages like <a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>, which speaks of the heavens declaring the glory of God.<p><b>does not know</b><br>The use of "know" here suggests an inherent understanding or recognition. In biblical terms, knowledge often implies a deeper, experiential understanding rather than mere intellectual assent. This reflects the biblical theme that God's attributes and actions are evident in creation, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>, where Paul states that God's invisible qualities are clearly seen in the world He has made.<p><b>that the hand of the LORD</b><br>The "hand of the LORD" is a common biblical metaphor for God's power and action. It signifies His direct involvement in the world. This phrase is used throughout Scripture to denote God's intervention, whether in creation, judgment, or deliverance (e.g., <a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>, <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). The hand symbolizes strength, authority, and the ability to accomplish His will.<p><b>has done this?</b><br>The phrase "has done this" refers to the events and circumstances of life, including Job's own suffering. It acknowledges God's ultimate control over all things, a central theme in the Book of Job. This reflects the belief in God's providence, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>, where God declares His sovereignty over both prosperity and disaster. The acknowledgment of God's hand in all things is a call to trust in His wisdom and purpose, even when it is not immediately apparent.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
