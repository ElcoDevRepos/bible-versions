In the context of Job, it reflects Job's hope for a future resurrection or restoration, where God would call him back to life. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God calling His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/43.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>, where God calls His people by name. The idea of God calling is also seen in the New Testament, where Jesus calls His followers (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>).<p><b>and I will answer;</b><br>Job expresses confidence that he will respond to God's call. This reflects a relationship where the human response to divine initiative is expected and assured. The concept of answering God is seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/91-15.htm">Psalm 91:15</a>, where God promises to answer those who call on Him. It also foreshadows the resurrection hope found in the New Testament, where believers are called to eternal life (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>).<p><b>You will desire the work of Your hands.</b><br>This phrase indicates God's care and value for His creation, particularly humanity, which is described as the work of His hands. It reflects the biblical theme of God's intimate involvement in creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where God forms man from the dust. The idea that God desires His creation is echoed in passages like <a href="/psalms/138-8.htm">Psalm 138:8</a>, which speaks of God fulfilling His purpose for His people. This also points to the redemptive work of Christ, who restores and redeems the work of God's hands, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>, where believers are described as God's workmanship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, Job is the central figure in the Book of Job.
