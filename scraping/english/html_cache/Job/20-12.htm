In biblical context, sin often appears attractive and desirable, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a>, where Eve finds the forbidden fruit pleasing to the eye. The sweetness of evil can be likened to the temporary satisfaction that sin provides, which ultimately leads to destruction (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>). This reflects the human tendency to be enticed by immediate gratification without considering long-term consequences.<p><b>and he conceals it under his tongue</b><br>The act of concealing evil under the tongue implies deceit and premeditation. This imagery suggests a deliberate choice to harbor sin secretly, akin to hiding something precious or forbidden. In historical and cultural contexts, the tongue is often associated with speech and the power of words (<a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-6</a>). This concealment indicates a hidden sinfulness that is not immediately visible to others, echoing the biblical theme of hypocrisy and the danger of hidden sins (<a href="/psalms/19-12.htm">Psalm 19:12</a>). The concealment also points to the internal struggle and the deceitfulness of the heart (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>), emphasizing the need for repentance and transformation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

The verse exposes the foolish devotion the wicked give to evil, thinking they can enjoy it privately without consequence. Cross-Scripture echoes&#8212;from Proverbs to Luke&#8212;affirm that sinful pleasure is fleeting, concealment is self-deception, and God will bring every hidden thing to light. Wise believers heed the warning: refuse the initial taste, and bring anything already hidden into the cleansing light of God&#8217;s truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth.</span>--He draws a picture of the wicked man after the pattern of a gourmand or glutton, which, if it were intended to apply to Job, was a fresh instance of heartless cruelty, as well as of an entire want of discernment of character, and of unfitness for the office of judge he was so ready to assume. It is possible that the reproach here aimed at Job was that of inordinate love of riches, which Zophar extracts from the bare fact of his having been a wealthy man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> though the wicked man delight in his wickedness, and gloat over it, and keep the thought of it in his mind, as a gourmand keeps, so long as he can, a delicious taste in his mouth; though he, as it were, hide it under his tongue, in order not to let it escape him; <span class="cmt_word">though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth</span>, yet, notwithstanding all this, disgust and nausea arrive in course of time (see the next two verses). It is, perhaps, the most surprising among the phenomena of wickedness that men can gloat over it, voluntarily recur to it, make a boast of it, recount signal instances of it to their friends, and seem to find a satisfaction in the recollection. One would have expected that shame and self-disapproval and fear of retribution would have led them to dismiss their wicked acts from their thoughts as soon as possible.
