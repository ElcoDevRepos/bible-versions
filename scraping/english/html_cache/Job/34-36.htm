In the context of the Book of Job, this reflects the ongoing debate between Job and his friends about the nature of suffering and righteousness. Elihu, the speaker here, believes that Job's complaints and assertions warrant further scrutiny. The idea of being "tried to the utmost" can be connected to the biblical theme of testing faith, as seen in passages like <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>, where trials are said to produce perseverance and maturity in faith. Theologically, this reflects the belief that God allows trials to refine and purify believers, much like gold is refined by fire (<a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>).<p><b>for answering like a wicked man</b><br>Elihu accuses Job of speaking in a manner similar to the wicked, implying that Job's words are irreverent or blasphemous. This accusation is significant in the cultural and historical context of the Ancient Near East, where speech was considered a reflection of one's character and relationship with the divine. In the broader narrative of Job, this accusation is part of the tension between Job's insistence on his innocence and his friends' belief that suffering is always a result of sin. Theologically, this phrase challenges readers to consider the nature of righteous speech and the importance of maintaining faith and integrity even in the face of suffering. It also foreshadows the ultimate vindication of Job by God, who rebukes the friends for not speaking rightly about Him (<a href="/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Honest lament and bold questioning coexist.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>like a wicked man</b><p>- Elihu equates Job&#8217;s self-defense with the talk of rebels: &#8220;For he has said, &#8216;It profits a man nothing to delight in God&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/job/34-9.htm">Job 34:9</a>).<p>- Scripture warns against such cynicism (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-14.htm">Malachi 3:14-15</a>).<p>- Still, labeling Job &#8220;wicked&#8221; oversteps what God will later confirm (<a href="/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Elihu urges maximum testing because he hears Job speaking with the tone of the ungodly. He assumes further affliction will expose hidden sin and silence irreverent words. The verse shows Elihu&#8217;s zeal for God&#8217;s honor but also his limited view of suffering. Job&#8217;s trials are already proving the genuineness of a believer&#8217;s faith, not unveiling secret wickedness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/34.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">My desire is that Job may be tried.</span>--There seems to be reason to prefer the marginal rendering, and consider the words as addressed to God: "Oh my Father, let Job be tried, &c." "<span class= "ital">Pater mi probetur Job," V</span>ulg. Elihu's words cannot have fallen upon Job with more acceptance or with lighter weight than those of his other friends.
