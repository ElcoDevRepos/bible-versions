In the context of the Book of Job, Eliphaz is urging Job to listen to God's wisdom. The concept of receiving instruction directly from God is a recurring theme in the Bible, highlighting the value of divine wisdom over human understanding. In <a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>, it is stated that man does not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord, underscoring the necessity of spiritual nourishment. The phrase also reflects the cultural context of ancient Israel, where oral tradition and spoken word were primary means of communication and teaching.<p><b>and lay up His words in your heart</b><br>This part of the verse calls for internalizing God's words, suggesting a deep, personal commitment to His teachings. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's being, including mind, will, and emotions. This mirrors the exhortation found in <a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>, where the psalmist declares, "I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you." The idea is to treasure and meditate on God's words, allowing them to transform one's life. This internalization is a precursor to living out God's commandments, as seen in the Shema of <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where the Israelites are instructed to keep God's words on their hearts and teach them diligently to their children.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>- A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

One is naturally disposed to think that since Job seems to be the one Gentile book of the Old Testament, the one book in which the literature of Israel touches the world at large, it must, therefore, be prior to the Law, or else have been written in independence and ignorance of it. The former seems by far the more reasonable supposition, and certainly the life depicted appears to be that of the patriarchal times before the giving of the Law. And yet, on the other hand, it is hard to know what could be meant by "His words" prior to the Mosaic Revelation, unless, indeed, the expression is a witness to the consciousness of that inner revelation of the voice of God in the conscience which the holy in all ages have never wanted.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth</span>; or, <span class="accented">receive now instruction from his mouth.</span> The supposition of some commentators, that the "Law of Moses" is intended, is negatived by the entire absence from the Book of any allusion to the details of the Mosaic legislation, as well as by the primitive character of the life depicted in the book, and the certainty that no one of the interlocutors is an Israelite. The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;</span>, without the article prefixed, is properly "instruction," and is only to be assumed as meaning "the Law" when the context shows this meaning to be probable. The "instruction" to which Eliphaz here points, and which he regards as instruction from God's mouth, is probably the teaching of religious men, such as himself, which he considered to have come from God originally, though, perhaps, he could not have explained how. <span class="cmt_word">And lay up his words in thine heart</span>.
