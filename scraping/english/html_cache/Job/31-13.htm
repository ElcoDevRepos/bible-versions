In the ancient Near Eastern context, servants were often vulnerable to mistreatment. The Mosaic Law provided protections for servants (<a href="/exodus/21.htm">Exodus 21:1-11</a>), emphasizing fair treatment. Job's statement aligns with these laws, showing his adherence to God's standards. This concern for justice is echoed in the New Testament, where masters are instructed to treat their servants justly (<a href="/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>, <a href="/colossians/4.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>).<p><b>when they made a complaint against me</b><br>Job acknowledges the right of his servants to bring grievances, which was not commonly recognized in ancient cultures. This reflects a progressive view of servant-master relationships, emphasizing accountability and the importance of hearing and addressing complaints. The biblical narrative often highlights God's concern for the oppressed and marginalized (<a href="/proverbs/31-8.htm">Proverbs 31:8-9</a>, <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>). Job's willingness to listen to complaints prefigures Christ's teaching on humility and servanthood (<a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42-45</a>), where leaders are called to serve others and address their needs compassionately.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A wealthy and righteous man from the land of Uz, known for his patience and faithfulness amidst severe trials.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/manservant_and_maidservant.htm">Manservant and Maidservant</a></b><br>Servants in Job's household, representing those under his authority and care.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/complaint.htm">Complaint</a></b><br>A grievance or accusation brought by the servants against Job, highlighting issues of justice and fairness in relationships.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/justice_and_fairness.htm">Justice and Fairness</a></b><br>Job's statement reflects a commitment to justice and fairness, even towards those in subordinate positions.

Scripture consistently warns against closing our ears to those who cry for help&#8212;&#8220;Whoever shuts his ears to the cry of the poor will also cry out and not be answered&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/21-13.htm">Proverbs 21:13</a>). By framing the sentence as a conditional, Job is saying, &#8220;Search my record; I never did this.&#8221; He stakes his integrity on listening, echoing the righteous pattern of the Lord who &#8220;is gracious and righteous; our God is full of compassion&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/116-5.htm">Psalm 116:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the cause</b><p>&#8220;The cause&#8221; points to a legal claim or plea for justice. A servant&#8217;s complaint mattered in God&#8217;s economy just as much as a prince&#8217;s. <a href="/exodus/23-6.htm">Exodus 23:6</a> commands, &#8220;You shall not deny justice to your poor people in their lawsuits&#8221;. Job, therefore, insists that every dispute deserves a fair hearing.<p>&#8226; Justice is rooted in God&#8217;s own character (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s people are to &#8220;do right and justice&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/18-19.htm">Genesis 18:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Refusing a fair hearing invites God&#8217;s judgment (<a href="/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of my manservant or maidservant</b><p>Job singles out those most easily overlooked: household slaves. While the culture of his day often treated servants as property, Job recognizes their dignity. He will soon argue, &#8220;Did not He who made me in the womb also make them?&#8221; (<a href="/job/31-15.htm">Job 31:15</a>). Other passages reinforce equal value before God:<p>&#8226; &#8220;You are to remember that you were slaves in Egypt&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-18.htm">Deuteronomy 24:18</a>), a motivation to show compassion.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/4-1.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;There is neither slave nor free&#8230; for you are all one in Christ Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when they made a complaint against me</b><p>Job places himself under scrutiny, recognizing that even a godly employer can err. The willingness to be confronted is a mark of humility. <a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a> cautions, &#8220;He who answers before he hears, it is folly and shame to him.&#8221; Jesus models this openness by inviting, &#8220;Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>). Like the persistent widow before the judge (<a href="/luke/18-1.htm">Luke 18:1&#8211;5</a>), servants have a right to present their case; righteous leaders listen.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/31-13.htm">Job 31:13</a> showcases a heart tuned to God&#8217;s justice: never dismiss a servant&#8217;s plea, always give a fair hearing, and recognize the shared humanity of every person under your authority.

Eliphaz had taxed him generally with harshness and cruelty in his relations towards those weaker than himself (<a href="/job/22-5.htm">Job 22:5-9</a>), but had not specially pointed to this kind of oppressiveness. As, however, this was the commonest form of the vice, Job deems it right to disclaim it, before addressing himself to the several charges brought by Eliphaz. He has <span class="accented">not</span> ill used his slaves, either male or female. He has not "despised their cause," but given it full consideration and attention; he has heard them when they contended with him; he has allowed them to "contend;" he has been a just, and not a hard master. The slavery of which he speaks is evidently of a kind under which the slave had certain rights, as was the case also under the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2-11</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/31-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have rejected</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1431;&#1505;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;em&#183;&#8217;as)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3988.htm">Strong's 3988: </a> </span><span class="str2">To spurn, to disappear</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the cause</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;pa&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4941.htm">Strong's 4941: </a> </span><span class="str2">A verdict, a sentence, formal decree, divine law, penalty, justice, privilege, style</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of my manservant</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1453;&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7687;&#183;d&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
