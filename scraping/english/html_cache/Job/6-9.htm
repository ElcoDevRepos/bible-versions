The term "crush" indicates a complete and total destruction, reflecting Job's intense anguish. This sentiment is rooted in the ancient Near Eastern understanding of divine sovereignty, where God is seen as the ultimate arbiter of life and death. Job's plea can be compared to the laments found in the Psalms, where the psalmists often cry out for deliverance from their distress (e.g., <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>). Theologically, this reflects the human struggle with understanding suffering and divine will.<p><b>to unleash His hand</b><br>The imagery of God's hand is significant throughout Scripture, often symbolizing power and authority. In Exodus, God's hand is depicted as delivering Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3</a>). Here, however, Job sees God's hand as a potential source of his demise. This duality highlights the complexity of God's interactions with humanity&#8212;both as a protector and as one who allows suffering. The phrase suggests a release of divine restraint, indicating that Job feels overwhelmed by his circumstances and perceives them as being under God's control.<p><b>and cut me off!</b><br>The idea of being "cut off" in biblical terms often refers to death or being separated from the community (<a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a>). Job's request to be cut off underscores his desire for relief from his pain, even if it means death. This reflects the cultural context of the ancient world, where suffering was often seen as a fate worse than death. In a broader biblical context, this phrase can be contrasted with the New Testament promise of eternal life through Christ, who was "cut off" for the transgressions of humanity (<a href="/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>), offering hope beyond suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

The speaker may mean that, notwithstanding all that might befall him, his consolation would still be that he had never denied the words of the Holy One. The words "I would harden myself in sorrow" are the most doubtful, not occurring elsewhere in Scripture. Some render the two clauses, "I would exult, or rejoice, in pain that spareth not;" but "Let him not spare," or "Though he spare not," seems preferable.
