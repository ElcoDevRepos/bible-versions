In the ancient Near Eastern context, a person's prime was marked by prosperity, influence, and familial stability. Job's reference to his prime suggests a period when he was highly respected and his life was marked by success and blessing. This notion of a "prime" can be seen in other biblical figures, such as David, who experienced a peak in his kingship (<a href="/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4-5</a>). Theologically, it underscores the transient nature of human life and the blessings that come from God, which can be taken away, as seen in Job's later trials.<p><b>when the friendship of God rested on my tent</b><br>The "friendship of God" indicates a close, personal relationship with the Divine, characterized by favor and protection. In the Old Testament, God's presence was often symbolized by His "resting" on a place, as seen with the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>). The "tent" here symbolizes Job's household, suggesting that God's favor extended to his entire family and possessions. This imagery is reminiscent of the covenantal blessings promised to the patriarchs, such as Abraham, whose tent was also a place of divine encounter and blessing (<a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18:1-10</a>). Theologically, this phrase highlights the intimacy and blessing of a life lived in accordance with God's will, a theme echoed in the New Testament with the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers (<a href="/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate friendship with God through Jesus Christ, who calls His followers friends (<a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

He is not boasting but mourning the loss of a season God Himself had granted.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently acknowledges the gift of one&#8217;s prime:<p>&#8211; <a href="/psalms/71-17.htm">Psalm 71:17&#8211;18</a> speaks of God&#8217;s faithfulness &#8220;from my youth,&#8221; asking Him to remain present &#8220;even to old age and gray hairs.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:1</a> urges remembering the Creator &#8220;in the days of your youth&#8221; before hardships come.<p>&#8211; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-18.htm">Deuteronomy 8:18</a> reminds Israel that it is the Lord who gives power to gain wealth, underlining that strength and success are gifts, not entitlements.<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s reflection reveals a healthy perspective: past blessings are traced directly to God. Even in pain he does not rewrite history to make himself the source of former prosperity (compare <a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; For us, the passage invites gratitude during seasons of strength and humility when those seasons wane, echoing <a href="/psalms/90-12.htm">Psalm 90:12</a>&#8217;s plea, &#8220;Teach us to number our days.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when the friendship of God rested on my tent</b><p>&#8220;when the friendship of God rested on my tent&#8221; (<a href="/job/29-4.htm">Job 29:4</a>b)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Friendship&#8221; here conveys intimate fellowship. Job sensed God&#8217;s nearness not merely as Creator but as Companion.<p>&#8226; Abraham enjoyed a similar privilege; &#8220;Abraham believed God&#8230; and he was called a friend of God&#8221; (<a href="/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>; see <a href="/genesis/18-17.htm">Genesis 18:17&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; Moses experienced it as well: &#8220;The LORD spoke with Moses face to face, as a man speaks with his friend&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a> affirms, &#8220;The LORD confides in those who fear Him,&#8221; showing that reverent relationship invites divine counsel.<p>&#8226; Job adds that this friendship &#8220;rested on my tent,&#8221; picturing God&#8217;s presence hovering over his household&#8212;much like the cloud over Israel&#8217;s camp (<a href="/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15&#8211;23</a>). The blessing was tangible, touching family, servants, and all holdings (<a href="/job/1-2.htm">Job 1:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; That sense of covering is echoed in <a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>, &#8220;He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s anguish now is as much spiritual as physical; he feels the friendship withdrawn (<a href="/job/19-6.htm">Job 19:6&#8211;10</a>), though in reality God remains sovereignly involved (<a href="/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/29-4.htm">Job 29:4</a> captures nostalgic longing for two intertwined blessings: personal vitality and intimate fellowship with God. Job remembers a time when his life was strong and God&#8217;s favor clearly rested on his home. The verse teaches that (1) seasons of strength are gifts from God, worthy of gratitude, and (2) the highest blessing is God&#8217;s nearness, not material prosperity. Even when circumstances change, the faithful can trust that God&#8217;s friendship ultimately endures, as Job himself discovers in the closing chapter of the book.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">In the days of my youth.</span>--Literally, my <span class= "ital">autumn: i.e., </span>in the ripeness, maturity of my days.
