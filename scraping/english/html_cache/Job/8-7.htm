It echoes the biblical theme of God lifting the humble, as seen in the lives of figures like David, who started as a shepherd before becoming king (1 Samuel 16). The modest beginnings also remind us of Jesus Christ, born in a manger, yet destined to be the Savior of the world (<a href="/luke/2-7.htm">Luke 2:7</a>). The cultural context of the ancient Near East valued humility and recognized that one's status could change dramatically, often seen as a result of divine intervention.<p><b>your latter days will flourish</b><br>This promise of future prosperity is a common biblical motif, emphasizing hope and restoration. It aligns with the broader narrative of Job, where God ultimately restores Job's fortunes (<a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10-17</a>). The flourishing of latter days can be seen as a type of eschatological hope, pointing to the ultimate restoration and blessing in the life to come, as promised in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>. This phrase also connects to the Abrahamic covenant, where God promises to bless and multiply Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>), illustrating the principle of divine blessing following faithfulness and endurance through trials.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and integrity, who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

Bildad does not refer to the past, but to the present. Though, if God were now to set to work to prosper Job, his beginning would be slender indeed, yet what the outcome might be none could know. God might prosper him greatly. <span class="cmt_word">Yet thy latter end should greatly increase</span>. Here, once mere, Bildad does but follow in the steps of Eliphaz (see <a href="/job/5-18.htm">Job 5:18-26</a>), prophesying smooth things, as be had done. It is difficult to believe that either comforter put any faith in the prospect which he held out, or imagined that Job would really be restored to prosperity. Rather there is a covert sarcasm in their words. If thou weft indeed so free from guilt as thou claimest to be, then thou wouldst be confident of a happy issue out of thy afflictions. If thou art not confident of such an issue, it is because thou art conscious of guilt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/8-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Though your beginnings</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1461;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1443;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#234;&#183;&#353;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7225.htm">Strong's 7225: </a> </span><span class="str2">The first, in place, time, order, rank</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">modest,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1425;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7779;&#183;&#8216;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4705.htm">Strong's 4705: </a> </span><span class="str2">Petty, a short</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your latter days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1437;&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1431;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_319.htm">Strong's 319: </a> </span><span class="str2">The last, end, the future, posterity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will be full of prosperity.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;geh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7685.htm">Strong's 7685: </a> </span><span class="str2">To grow, increase</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/8-7.htm">Job 8:7 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/8-7.htm">Job 8:7 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/8-7.htm">Job 8:7 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/8-7.htm">Job 8:7 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/8-7.htm">Job 8:7 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/8-7.htm">Job 8:7  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/8-7.htm">Job 8:7 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/8-7.htm">Job 8:7 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/8-7.htm">Job 8:7 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/8-7.htm">Job 8:7 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/8-7.htm">OT Poetry: Job 8:7 Though your beginning was small yet your (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/8-6.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 8:6"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 8:6" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/8-8.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 8:8"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 8:8" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
