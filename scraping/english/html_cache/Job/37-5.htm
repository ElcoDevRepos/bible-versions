In the context of Job, this imagery reflects God's sovereignty and authority over creation. The thunderous voice of God is reminiscent of the theophany at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a>), where God's presence was accompanied by thunder and lightning, signifying His holiness and power. The use of "thunders" also connects to <a href="/psalms/29.htm">Psalm 29</a>, where the voice of the Lord is described as powerful and full of majesty, breaking cedars and shaking the wilderness. This imagery serves to remind believers of God's ultimate control over nature and His ability to communicate His will through creation.<p><b>He does great things we cannot comprehend.</b><br>This phrase highlights the mystery and incomprehensibility of God's actions and purposes. Throughout the Book of Job, the theme of human limitation in understanding God's ways is prevalent. Job's friends attempt to explain his suffering through human reasoning, but God's response underscores that His ways are higher than human ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). The "great things" God does are often beyond human understanding, as seen in the creation narrative (Genesis 1) and the miracles throughout the Bible, such as the parting of the Red Sea (Exodus 14) and the resurrection of Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/28-5.htm">Matthew 28:5-6</a>). This phrase encourages believers to trust in God's wisdom and sovereignty, even when His actions are beyond human comprehension, pointing to the ultimate mystery of God's redemptive plan through Christ, which was hidden for ages but revealed in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who endured immense suffering and sought understanding of God's ways.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering a perspective on God's majesty and justice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Almighty Creator, whose power and wisdom are beyond human understanding.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_realm.htm">Heavenly Realm</a></b><br>The domain from which God speaks and acts, demonstrating His sovereignty over creation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nature.htm">Nature</a></b><br>The natural world, which serves as a testament to God's power and majesty.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_majesty_of_god's_voice.htm">The Majesty of God's Voice</a></b><br>God's voice is not only powerful but also wondrous, reflecting His divine majesty and authority over all creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_incomprehensibility_of_god's_works.htm">The Incomprehensibility of God's Works</a></b><br>We are reminded that God's actions and plans are beyond human understanding, calling us to trust in His wisdom and sovereignty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_before_god.htm">Humility Before God</a></b><br>Recognizing our limited understanding should lead us to a posture of humility and reverence before God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Even when we cannot comprehend His ways, we can trust that God is doing great things for His purposes and glory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/n/nature_as_a_testament_to_god's_power.htm">Nature as a Testament to God's Power</a></b><br>Observing the natural world can deepen our appreciation for God's creative power and His ongoing involvement in the world.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Job_37_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Job 37:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Job_37_5_God_s_power_in_creation.htm">How does Job 37:5 reveal God's power and majesty in creation?

</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Job 37:5 Mean</div><b>God thunders</b><p>&#8226; Scripture regularly links thunder with the Lord&#8217;s tangible power. At Sinai &#8220;there were thunders and lightning&#8221; when He descended (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>), and David declared, &#8220;The LORD thundered from heaven&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/18-13.htm">Psalm 18:13</a>). Job&#8217;s friend Elihu reminds his hearers that this is no mere metaphor; the audible roll of thunder is an actual display of God&#8217;s dominion over creation.<p>&#8226; Thunder turns heads and stills conversations. Likewise, God&#8217;s interventions in history&#8212;from the flood of <a href="/bsb/genesis/7.htm">Genesis 7</a> to the plagues of <a href="/bsb/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7&#8211;12</a>&#8212;demand humanity&#8217;s attention.<p>&#8226; The verse assures the sufferer that the same God who commands the storm also oversees every detail of human life (<a href="/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29&#8211;31</a>). If He can shake the skies, He can certainly handle the questions Job is asking.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Wondrously with His voice</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Wondrously&#8221; speaks of more than volume; it points to awe&#8208;inspiring purpose. <a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3-4</a> echoes the theme: &#8220;The voice of the LORD resounds over the waters; the God of glory thunders&#8230; The voice of the LORD is powerful.&#8221;<p>&#8226; When Jesus cried, &#8220;Father, glorify Your name,&#8221; some in the crowd said it had thundered (<a href="/john/12-28.htm">John 12:28&#8211;29</a>). Even then, God&#8217;s voice produced both wonder and confusion, underscoring that He communicates on His own terms.<p>&#8226; His voice called worlds into existence (<a href="/bsb/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>). It sustains them still (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>). Every promise, rebuke, and comfort in Scripture carries that same creative authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He does great things</b><p>&#8226; Elihu shifts from sound to action: &#8220;He does great things.&#8221; Think of creation itself (<a href="/bsb/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1-2</a>), the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>), the sun standing still for Joshua (<a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12-14</a>), or Christ&#8217;s resurrection (<a href="/matthew/28-5.htm">Matthew 28:5-7</a>).<p>&#8226; These works are not distant history. God &#8220;alone does great wonders&#8221; in every generation (<a href="/psalms/136-4.htm">Psalm 136:4</a>) and &#8220;is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<p>&#8226; For Job, the &#8220;great thing&#8221; might soon be vindication and deeper understanding; for us, it may be salvation, provision, or sanctification&#8212;but always sourced in the same mighty hand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We cannot comprehend</b><p>&#8226; Elihu concludes with humility: the scale of God&#8217;s greatness is beyond human calculus. &#8220;Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; His greatness is unsearchable&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/145-3.htm">Psalm 145:3</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a> reminds us His thoughts and ways tower above ours; <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a> exclaims, &#8220;How unsearchable are His judgments!&#8221;<p>&#8226; Accepting our limits is not resignation but worship. We bow, trusting that even unanswered questions rest in the care of a wise, sovereign Father (<a href="/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/37-5.htm">Job 37:5</a> presses us to listen for God&#8217;s thunder, marvel at His wondrous voice, remember His unrivaled deeds, and admit our finite understanding.
