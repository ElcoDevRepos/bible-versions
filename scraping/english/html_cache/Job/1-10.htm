In ancient Near Eastern culture, a "hedge" symbolized security and safeguarding from harm. The imagery of a hedge indicates God's comprehensive protection over Job, akin to a shepherd protecting his flock. This concept is echoed in <a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>, where God is described as a refuge and fortress. Theologically, it underscores the belief in God's sovereignty and His ability to shield His faithful from evil.<p><b>and his household</b><br>The mention of Job's household highlights the importance of family and community in ancient times. In the patriarchal society of the Old Testament, a man's household included not only his immediate family but also servants and extended kin. This reflects the biblical principle that God's blessings often extend beyond the individual to their family and community, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a> with God's promise to Abraham.<p><b>and all that he owns?</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the material blessings and prosperity that Job enjoys. In the historical context, wealth was often measured by livestock, land, and servants, which were signs of God's favor. The comprehensive nature of God's protection and blessing over Job's possessions is a testament to his righteousness and God's covenant faithfulness, similar to the blessings promised in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a> for obedience to God's commands.<p><b>You have blessed the work of his hands</b><br>This indicates that Job's success is attributed to divine blessing rather than mere human effort. The "work of his hands" refers to his labor and endeavors, which God has prospered. This aligns with the biblical principle found in <a href="/psalms/90-17.htm">Psalm 90:17</a>, where God's favor is sought to establish the work of one's hands. It also reflects the cultural understanding that prosperity is a sign of divine approval.<p><b>and his possessions have increased in the land.</b><br>The increase of Job's possessions signifies not only material wealth but also God's abundant provision. In the agrarian society of the time, such increase would include livestock, crops, and servants, indicating stability and growth. This mirrors the promises of prosperity found in the covenant blessings of <a href="/leviticus/26-3.htm">Leviticus 26:3-5</a>. The phrase also foreshadows the restoration and even greater blessings Job receives at the end of the book, symbolizing hope and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Scripture repeatedly affirms God&#8217;s ability to guard His people:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>, &#8220;The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him, and He delivers them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a> reminds us, &#8220;As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds His people, both now and forevermore.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_peter/1-5.htm">1 Peter 1:5</a> speaks of believers &#8220;who through faith are shielded by God&#8217;s power.&#8221;<p>These passages echo the principle that God actively sets limits on what the enemy may do (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>). Job&#8217;s story illustrates that God&#8217;s hedge is real and only God can grant Satan permission to breach it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>around him and his household</b><p>Protection extends beyond Job to those under his roof. Throughout Scripture, God often blesses entire families for the sake of a righteous leader:<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/7-1.htm">Genesis 7:1</a>&#8212;Noah&#8217;s household is spared because of Noah&#8217;s righteousness.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31</a>&#8212;&#8220;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved&#8212;you and your household.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/psalms/128.htm">Psalm 128</a> celebrates the blessings that flow to the family of one who fears the LORD.<p>Job&#8217;s daily sacrifices for his children (<a href="/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a>) show a father&#8217;s intercessory role, mirroring later instructions like <a href="/ephesians/6-4.htm">Ephesians 6:4</a> for fathers to nurture their households in the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all that he owns?</b><p>Nothing Job possesses lies outside God&#8217;s oversight. The Bible treats material things as gifts entrusted to stewards:<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-17.htm">Deuteronomy 8:17-18</a> warns against claiming, &#8220;My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth,&#8221; adding, &#8220;Remember the LORD your God, for it is He who gives you the power to gain wealth.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a> calls every good and perfect gift &#8220;from above.&#8221;<p>Satan&#8217;s complaint underscores that Job&#8217;s livestock, servants, and land prosper only because God allows it, highlighting divine sovereignty over our resources (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-12.htm">1 Chronicles 29:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have blessed the work of his hands,</b><p>Here Satan concedes that Job&#8217;s labor prospers because God actively blesses it. Scripture reinforces this truth:<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-12.htm">Deuteronomy 28:12</a>&#8212;God promises to &#8220;bless all the work of your hands.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/90-17.htm">Psalm 90:17</a> prays, &#8220;Establish the work of our hands for us&#8212;yes, establish the work of our hands.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/10-22.htm">Proverbs 10:22</a> teaches, &#8220;The blessing of the LORD enriches, and He adds no sorrow to it.&#8221;<p>Job illustrates that diligent work under God&#8217;s favor yields fruit, yet the source of success remains divine, not merely human effort (<a href="/proverbs/16-3.htm">Proverbs 16:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his possessions have increased in the land.</b><p>The phrase points to visible, measurable abundance&#8212;fields full of livestock, servants, and produce. Similar instances appear throughout Scripture:<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/26-12.htm">Genesis 26:12-14</a>&#8212;Isaac &#8220;reaped a hundredfold,&#8221; becoming &#8220;very wealthy.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/105-44.htm">Psalm 105:44</a> recounts God giving Israel &#8220;the lands of the nations&#8221; so they might enjoy the fruits of others&#8217; labor.<p>&#8226; <a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a> speaks of blessings poured out &#8220;without measure&#8221; on faithful givers.<p>Job&#8217;s prosperity demonstrates that God can multiply resources within a specific geography (&#8220;in the land&#8221;) and timeframe, showing that His blessings are practical, not merely theoretical.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/1-10.htm">Job 1:10</a> reveals a multifaceted portrait of God&#8217;s favor: He surrounds His people with protective hedges, extends that safety to their families, oversees and enriches their possessions, blesses their diligent labor, and multiplies their resources within the land He assigns. Satan&#8217;s accusation unwittingly testifies to God&#8217;s comprehensive care, reminding believers that every aspect of life&#8212;security, family, work, and wealth&#8212;remains under the gracious hand of the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hast not thou made an hedge about him?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "hedged him around, protected him, made a sort of invisible fence about him, through which no evil could creep." This was undoubtedly true. God had so protected him. But the question was not as to this fact, but as to Job's motive. Was it mere prudence? - the desire to secure a continuance of this protection? <span class="cmt_word">And about his house</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "his family" - his sons and daughters - the members of his household. <span class="cmt_word">And about all that he hath on every side</span>. His possessions - land, houses, cattle, live stock of all kinds, furniture, goods and chattels. Thou hast blessed the work of his hands (comp. <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, where it is said of the righteous man. that "whatsoever he doeth, it shall prosper"). So it was with Job. God's blessing was upon him, and success crowned all his enterprises. "The work of his hands" will include everything that he attempted. <span class="cmt_word">And his substance is increased in the land</span>. In the former clause we have the cause, God's blessing; in the latter the effect, a great increase in Job's "substance," or "cattle" (marginal reading). (On the final number of his cattle, see ver. 3.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/1-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Have You not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">placed a hedge</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1463;&#1443;&#1499;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;a&#7733;&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7753.htm">Strong's 7753: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hedge or fence up or about</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on every side</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1505;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(mis&#183;s&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
