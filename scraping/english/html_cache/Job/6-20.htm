This reflects the emotional state of Job's friends, who had expected to find Job in a different condition. The concept of hope in the Bible often relates to trust in God's promises, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/5-5.htm">Romans 5:5</a>, where hope does not disappoint. Here, however, their hope is misplaced, leading to their confounding. This can be compared to the Israelites' hope in false gods or alliances, which often led to disappointment and confusion (<a href="/isaiah/30-3.htm">Isaiah 30:3</a>).<p><b>their arrival brings disappointment.</b><br>The arrival of Job's friends, who had initially come to comfort him, instead results in disappointment. This disappointment can be seen as a failure to meet expectations, similar to the unfulfilled hopes of the Israelites when they relied on human strength rather than divine intervention (<a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5-6</a>). The cultural context of ancient Near Eastern hospitality would have expected visitors to bring comfort and support, yet their presence only adds to Job's suffering. This can be contrasted with the arrival of Jesus Christ, who fulfills the hope of salvation and does not disappoint those who trust in Him (<a href="/romans/10-11.htm">Romans 10:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_friends.htm">Job's Friends</a></b><br>Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, who come to comfort Job but end up offering misguided counsel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_uz.htm">The Land of Uz</a></b><br>The setting of the Book of Job, a region whose exact location is uncertain but is traditionally considered to be in the area of Edom or northern Arabia.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate sovereign being who allows Job's trials to test his faith and integrity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_job's_suffering.htm">The Event of Job's Suffering</a></b><br>Job's loss of wealth, health, and family, which sets the stage for the dialogues and discourses in the book.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_misplaced_hope.htm">Understanding Misplaced Hope</a></b><br><a href="/job/6-20.htm">Job 6:20</a> highlights the danger of placing hope in human wisdom or circumstances rather than in God.
