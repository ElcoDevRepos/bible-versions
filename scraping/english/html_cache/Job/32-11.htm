His patience in waiting to speak reflects a cultural respect for elders, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-31.htm">Proverbs 16:31</a>, which values the wisdom of age. This patience also highlights a biblical principle of listening before speaking, as advised in <a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>. Elihu's approach contrasts with the impulsive nature of Job's friends, who quickly jumped to conclusions about Job's suffering.<p><b>I listened to your reasoning;</b><br>Elihu's attentive listening indicates a desire to understand fully before responding. This mirrors the wisdom literature's emphasis on discernment and understanding, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>. The term "reasoning" suggests a logical discourse, which was a common method of debate in ancient Near Eastern cultures. Elihu's methodical approach sets the stage for his forthcoming arguments, which he believes are divinely inspired, as he later claims in <a href="/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a>.<p><b>as you searched for words,</b><br>The phrase "searched for words" implies a struggle to articulate thoughts, reflecting the complexity of the theological and existential issues being discussed. This struggle is evident throughout the dialogues in the Book of Job, where human wisdom falls short in explaining divine mysteries. The search for words can also be seen as a metaphor for humanity's quest for understanding God's ways, a theme echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>, which speaks of God's inscrutable plans. Elihu's observation here sets the stage for his own contribution, which he believes will provide clarity and insight.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks after Job's three friends have finished their discourse.

In <a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a> the Holy Spirit later teaches, &#8220;Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak,&#8221; a timeless echo of Elihu&#8217;s approach.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I listened to your reasoning</b><p>&#8226; Elihu did more than endure a pause; he listened carefully. Listening is active, attending to the heart behind words (<a href="/proverbs/20-5.htm">Proverbs 20:5</a>).<p>&#8226; By absorbing their arguments, he could evaluate them against revealed truth. <a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a> praises the Bereans for testing teachings by Scripture; Elihu is practicing something similar.<p>&#8226; His attentive ear exposed the friends&#8217; faulty logic: they assumed suffering always equals divine punishment (<a href="/job/22-5.htm">Job 22:5</a>), overlooking examples like Joseph (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>) and the man born blind (<a href="/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a> calls believers to &#8220;test all things; hold fast what is good.&#8221; Elihu listens first so that his forthcoming correction (<a href="/job/33-1.htm">Job 33:1&#8211;33</a>) rests on discernment rather than impulse.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as you searched for words</b><p>&#8226; The friends groped for explanations, recycling the same charge without real comfort (<a href="/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2</a>; <a href="/job/26-2.htm">Job 26:2&#8211;4</a>). Their verbal exhaustion exposes the poverty of human wisdom divorced from divine revelation (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Elihu notes their struggle because it underlines God&#8217;s role as the true source of understanding (<a href="/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a>, &#8220;But it is the spirit in a man&#8230;the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Their &#8220;search for words&#8221; mirrors <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a>, mankind&#8217;s endless quest for meaning apart from God.

He exemplifies godly listening&#8212;granting respect, gathering facts, and acknowledging the limits of human wisdom&#8212;before speaking words shaped by the Spirit. The verse invites believers to practice patience, discernment, and humble reliance on God&#8217;s revelation whenever we seek to counsel others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I waited for your words</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "I was full of expectation; I waited impatiently to hear what you would say."
