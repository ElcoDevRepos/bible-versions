In the ancient Near Eastern context, clothing was a basic necessity, and its absence could lead to severe suffering or death, especially in harsh climates. Job's statement reflects the biblical principle of caring for the poor and needy, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>, which commands generosity towards the poor. The imagery of perishing for lack of clothing also echoes the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/25-36.htm">Matthew 25:36</a>, where providing clothing to the needy is equated with serving Christ Himself. Job's integrity is demonstrated by his proactive concern for those in dire need, aligning with the broader biblical narrative that emphasizes God's heart for the marginalized.<p><b>or a needy man without a cloak</b><br>The cloak in ancient times was not just a garment but also served as a blanket for warmth, especially for the poor who might not have had other means of protection against the cold. <a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26-27</a> underscores the importance of returning a cloak taken as a pledge before sunset, highlighting its essential role in a person's well-being. Job's mention of a "needy man without a cloak" underscores his awareness and empathy towards those who are vulnerable. This concern is a reflection of the character of God, who is described in <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a> as a "father to the fatherless" and a "defender of widows." Job's life serves as a type of Christ, who in His ministry, consistently reached out to the marginalized and provided for their needs, as seen in His miracles and teachings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

He is not speaking of rumors but of situations he has personally witnessed. Scripture consistently links moral duty to what our eyes take in: &#8220;If you see your brother&#8217;s donkey or ox fallen on the road, do not ignore it; help him lift it up&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-4.htm">Deuteronomy 22:4</a>). Likewise, the priest and Levite in <a href="/luke/10-31.htm">Luke 10:31-32</a> &#8220;saw him&#8221; yet passed by, while the Samaritan acted. Job is declaring: I did not turn a blind eye when God placed need before me.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>one perish for lack of clothing,</b><p>Here Job denies allowing anyone to die from exposure. In <a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a> the Lord defines true fasting as &#8220;to share your bread with the hungry and to bring the poor and homeless into your house; when you see the naked, to cover him.&#8221; James echoes the thought: &#8220;If a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food and one of you says&#8230; &#8216;Go in peace,&#8217; but you do nothing&#8230; what good is that?&#8221; (<a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15-16</a>). By claiming innocence, Job affirms that genuine faith is proven by concrete compassion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or a needy man without a cloak,</b><p>The cloak in Scripture was both garment and blanket, often pledged as collateral (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-12.htm">Deuteronomy 24:12-13</a>). God commanded it be returned by sunset so the owner could sleep warmly, underscoring His concern for dignity. Job states he never let a person shiver through the night. His life reflected <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>: &#8220;He who is kind to the poor lends to the LORD.&#8221; Jesus later highlighted the same ethic: &#8220;I was naked and you clothed Me&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/25-36.htm">Matthew 25:36</a>). Job&#8217;s care for the needy was practical, immediate, and personal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/31-19.htm">Job 31:19</a> shows Job asserting that he never ignored someone suffering from lack of basic clothing. He insists he responded whenever he personally saw need, refused to let anyone perish from exposure, and ensured the poor possessed a cloak for warmth and dignity. The verse reinforces the biblical theme that righteousness includes active mercy toward those in material distress, aligning Job&#8217;s conduct with God&#8217;s enduring call to love our neighbors in tangible ways.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">If I have seen any perish for want of.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">any wanderer without.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If I have seen any perish for want of clothing</span> (scrap. <a href="/job/22-6.htm">Job 22:6</a>, where Eliphaz taxes Job with so acting; and, on the duty of clothing the naked, see <a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7, 16</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-36.htm">Matthew 25:36</a><span class="cmt_word">).
