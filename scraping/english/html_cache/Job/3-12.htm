The imagery of "knees to receive me" reflects the ancient Near Eastern custom of a child being received onto the knees of a parent or midwife, symbolizing acceptance and legitimacy. This act was a sign of familial acknowledgment and care. In the broader biblical context, this can be compared to <a href="/genesis/50-23.htm">Genesis 50:23</a>, where Joseph's grandchildren are placed on his knees, signifying blessing and acceptance. Job's questioning here highlights his deep despair and the reversal of expected joy at birth, contrasting with the cultural norms of celebrating new life.<p><b>and breasts that I should be nursed?</b><br>The mention of "breasts that I should be nursed" emphasizes the nurturing and sustenance provided by a mother. In the ancient world, breastfeeding was a critical aspect of infant survival and maternal bonding. Job's lament here underscores his wish that he had never been nurtured into life, reflecting his profound suffering and desire for non-existence. This can be connected to other biblical passages that speak of maternal care, such as <a href="/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a>, where God's care is compared to that of a nursing mother. Theologically, this phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, in His humanity, experienced the full range of human life from birth to death, yet without despair, offering hope and redemption through His suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Job&#8217;s cry asks why that moment of joyful reception ever happened when his present misery seems to render his life pointless.<p>&#8226; Job is not denying God&#8217;s sovereignty; he is grappling with the contrast between the warmth of his arrival and the cold affliction he now bears (compare <a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; His words echo <a href="/jeremiah/20-14.htm">Jeremiah 20:14&#8211;18</a>, where Jeremiah also curses the day of his birth.<p>&#8226; By recalling those welcoming knees, Job highlights the stark difference between the hope that greeted his birth and the despair that now engulfs him (<a href="/psalms/22-9.htm">Psalm 22:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and breasts that I should be nursed?</b><p>&#8220;And breasts that I should be nursed?&#8221; (<a href="/job/3-12.htm">Job 3:12</a>b) shifts to the nurturing that follows birth.

The nurturing that once promised life now seems, to Job, to have ushered him into agony.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/3-12.htm">Job 3:12</a> voices the anguished contradiction between the tender welcome of birth&#8212;knees receiving, breasts nursing&#8212;and the torment he now faces. By recalling the very first acts of acceptance and care, Job highlights how deeply his suffering has shaken him. His questions do not nullify God&#8217;s goodness; they expose the raw struggle of a righteous man who cannot reconcile early blessings with present pain. The verse invites readers to acknowledge grief honestly while trusting that the God who ordained birth remains present, even when His purposes are hidden (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>; <a href="/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Prevent</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, "Why was I nursed with care instead of being allowed to fall to the ground and be killed?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why did the knees prevent me?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Why did my mother take me on her knees and nurse me, instead of casting me on the ground, where I should have perished?"
