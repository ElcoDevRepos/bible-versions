In biblical times, burial was a significant cultural and religious practice, emphasizing respect for the dead. The act of carrying the body signifies the community's involvement and the honor given to the deceased. This can be contrasted with the fate of the wicked in other parts of Scripture, where they are often described as having no proper burial (<a href="/jeremiah/22-19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a>). The carrying to the grave also foreshadows the burial of Jesus Christ, who was carried and laid in a tomb (<a href="/john/19-38.htm">John 19:38-42</a>).<p><b>and watch is kept over his tomb</b><br>This phrase suggests a form of protection or honor for the deceased, indicating that the grave is guarded or maintained. In ancient cultures, especially among the wealthy or influential, tombs were often guarded to prevent grave robbery or desecration. This practice highlights the respect and value placed on the individual even after death. In the New Testament, a guard was placed at Jesus' tomb to prevent His disciples from stealing His body (<a href="/matthew/27-62.htm">Matthew 27:62-66</a>), which underscores the importance of the tomb in both cultural and theological contexts. The watch over the tomb can also symbolize the belief in an afterlife or the hope of resurrection, a theme that is central to Christian doctrine.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and patience who endures immense suffering and questions the justice of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_grave.htm">The Grave</a></b><br>Represents the final resting place of the deceased, a common theme in Job's discourse on the fate of the wicked and the righteous.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/honor_guard.htm">Honor Guard</a></b><br>Symbolizes the respect and dignity afforded to the deceased, often highlighting the disparity between earthly honor and divine justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_illusion_of_earthly_honor.htm">The Illusion of Earthly Honor</a></b><br>Earthly honor, such as an honor guard at a tomb, does not equate to divine approval or eternal security.

Instead, their bodies are respectfully laid to rest, echoing <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:10</a>, &#8220;the wicked&#8230; received praise in the city.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Even in death their influence seems unshaken; like the rich man in <a href="/luke/16-22.htm">Luke 16:22</a>, they enjoy a ceremonious burial that can give the false impression of God&#8217;s favor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>watch is kept over his tomb</b><p>&#8226; A &#8220;watch&#8221; suggests continual honor and protection&#8212;guards, mourners, or caretakers ensuring the grave remains undisturbed (compare <a href="/isaiah/14-18.htm">Isaiah 14:18</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-65.htm">Matthew 27:65-66</a>).<p>&#8226; The wicked man&#8217;s legacy appears secure, with monuments or markers preserved so others remember him (<a href="/psalms/49-11.htm">Psalm 49:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Job highlights the tension: outward respect does not equal inner righteousness. Though their tombs are tended, <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a> reminds that &#8220;people are appointed to die once, and after that to face judgment.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/21-32.htm">Job 21:32</a> shows that, in this fallen world, the wicked can experience apparent success even in death&#8212;honored processions, guarded tombs, lasting memorials. Yet these external trappings do not cancel the certainty of God&#8217;s final justice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">And shall remain in the tomb.</span>--The word rendered tomb is rendered <span class= "ital">shock of corn </span>in <a href="/job/5-26.htm" title="You shall come to your grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn comes in in his season.">Job 5:26</a>, and is not found in the sense of tomb elsewhere. It is doubtful, therefore, whether this is its meaning here. The verse may mean: "He shall be borne to the grave, and men shall watch over his sheaves," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>his possessions; or "He shall be borne to the grave with as much deference as when he used to watch over his sheaves" (to protect them from robbery).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet shall he be brought to the grave</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he moreover is borne</span> (in pomp) <span class="accented">to the grave</span>. Even in death the advantage is still with the wicked man. He is borne in procession to the grave - a mausoleum or a family vault - by a long train of mourners, who weep and lament for him, and pay him funeral honours. The poor virtuous man, on the other hand, is hastily thrust under the soil. <span class="cmt_word">And shall remain in in the tomb</span>; <span class="accented">or shall keep watch over his tomb.</span> The allusion is probably to the custom, common certainly in Egypt and Phoenicia, of carving a figure of the deceased on the lid of his sarcophagus, to keep as it were watch over the remains deposited within. The figure was sometimes accompanied by an inscription, denouncing curses on those who should dare to violate the tomb or disturb the remains (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 9. pp. 112-114; and compare the author's 'History of Phoenicia,' pp. 393-395). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/21-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1453;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is carried</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hofal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2986.htm">Strong's 2986: </a> </span><span class="str2">To conduct, bear along</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the grave,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(liq&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;r&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6913.htm">Strong's 6913: </a> </span><span class="str2">A grave, sepulcher</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and watch is kept</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1511;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#353;&#183;q&#333;&#183;w&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8245.htm">Strong's 8245: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be alert, sleepless, to be on the lookout</span><br /><br /><span class="word">over</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1469;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his tomb.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(g&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1430.htm">Strong's 1430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A stack of sheaves, a tomb</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/21-32.htm">Job 21:32 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/21-32.htm">Job 21:32 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/21-32.htm">Job 21:32 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/21-32.htm">Job 21:32 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/21-32.htm">Job 21:32 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/21-32.htm">Job 21:32  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/21-32.htm">Job 21:32 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/21-32.htm">Job 21:32 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/21-32.htm">Job 21:32 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/21-32.htm">Job 21:32 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/21-32.htm">OT Poetry: Job 21:32 Yet he will be borne to (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/21-31.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 21:31"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 21:31" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/21-33.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 21:33"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 21:33" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
