In the biblical context, this reflects the understanding that God is the ultimate authority over creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, where God is the Creator of the heavens and the earth. The rhetorical question implies that God's authority is inherent and self-existent, aligning with passages like <a href="/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13-14</a>, which highlight God's wisdom and independence. Historically, this challenges the ancient Near Eastern views of multiple deities with divided powers, asserting monotheism and God's unique sovereignty.<p><b>Who appointed Him over the whole world?</b><br>This phrase reinforces the idea of God's supreme rule and governance over all creation. It suggests that God's dominion is not derived from any external source but is intrinsic to His nature. This is consistent with the biblical theme of God's kingship, as seen in <a href="/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>, which declares that the earth and everything in it belong to the Lord. Theologically, it points to God's omnipotence and omnipresence, qualities that are foundational to understanding His role as the sustainer of the universe. This also prefigures the New Testament revelation of Christ's authority, as seen in <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, where Jesus declares that all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Him, indicating a continuity of divine rule through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering a perspective on God's justice and sovereignty.
