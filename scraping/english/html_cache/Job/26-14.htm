In the context of Job, it highlights the limited understanding humans have of God's workings. The "fringes" suggest that what is observable or known about God is only a small part of His total being and activity. This aligns with other biblical passages such as <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's thoughts and ways are described as higher than human thoughts and ways. The imagery of "fringes" can also be connected to the idea of the hem of a garment, suggesting that what we perceive is just the outermost part of God's majesty.<p><b>how faint is the whisper we hear of Him!</b><br>This phrase suggests that human perception of God is limited and often indirect. The "whisper" implies a quiet, subtle revelation of God, contrasting with the full "thunder" of His power. This can be related to <a href="/1_kings/19-12.htm">1 Kings 19:12</a>, where God speaks to Elijah not in the wind, earthquake, or fire, but in a gentle whisper. It underscores the idea that God's communication with humanity is often not through grand displays but through subtle, personal interactions. The whisper also suggests the need for attentiveness and humility in seeking to understand God.<p><b>Who then can understand the thunder of His power?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the theme of God's incomprehensible power and majesty. The "thunder" symbolizes God's might and authority, often associated with divine judgment and revelation, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a> during the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai. The question implies that if even the whisper of God is hard to grasp, the full extent of His power is beyond human comprehension. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's transcendence and the limitations of human understanding, as seen in <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33-34</a>, where Paul marvels at the depth of God's wisdom and knowledge. The thunder can also be seen as a type of Christ, who embodies the power and authority of God, yet is often misunderstood or unrecognized by the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man known for his righteousness and suffering.
