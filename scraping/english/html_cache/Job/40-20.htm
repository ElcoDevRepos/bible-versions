In the context of <a href="/job/40.htm">Job 40</a>, God is describing the behemoth, a creature of great strength and size, to Job. The imagery of hills yielding produce indicates a land rich in resources, possibly reflecting the fertile regions of the ancient Near East. This abundance can be seen as a testament to God's provision and the natural order He established. Theologically, it underscores God's sovereignty over creation, as He provides for all creatures. This provision is reminiscent of the blessings described in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>, where obedience to God results in the land yielding its bounty.<p><b>while all the beasts of the field play nearby</b><br>This phrase paints a picture of harmony in creation, where even the mighty behemoth coexists peacefully with other animals. The "beasts of the field" playing nearby suggests a lack of fear or threat, highlighting a world where God's creatures live in balance. This imagery can be connected to the prophetic vision of peace in <a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>, where the wolf dwells with the lamb, symbolizing the restoration of creation. It also reflects the original harmony in Eden before the fall, as described in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1-2</a>. The peaceful coexistence of creatures points to the ultimate reconciliation and peace found in Christ, who is the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who undergoes severe trials and questions God's justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator, who speaks to Job out of the whirlwind, challenging Job's understanding of divine wisdom and power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/behemoth.htm">Behemoth</a></b><br>A creature described by God, symbolizing His power and the majesty of His creation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hills.htm">Hills</a></b><br>Representing the natural world and its abundance, providing sustenance to the creatures.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/beasts_of_the_field.htm">Beasts of the Field</a></b><br>Symbolizing the diversity and vitality of God's creation, living in harmony with the environment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Creation</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the ultimate provider and sustainer of all life.

This line underscores:<p>&#8211; Abundant provision: Just as <a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14</a> says, &#8220;He makes the grass grow for the cattle,&#8221; the Creator faithfully furnishes enough vegetation for even the mightiest land creature.<p>&#8211; Divine ownership: <a href="/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10</a> reminds us, &#8220;Every beast of the forest is Mine,&#8221; so these hills are ultimately the Lord&#8217;s storehouse, not man&#8217;s.<p>&#8211; Human limitation: Job is confronted with a reality he cannot manage (compare <a href="/job/38-41.htm">Job 38:41</a>); only God sustains this giant.<p>&#8226; Picture the scene: rolling hills, lush with fresh growth, continually renewed by the Lord (<a href="/psalms/65-9.htm">Psalm 65:9&#8211;13</a>). The emphasis is not on scarcity but on God&#8217;s overflowing generosity.<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: If God can feed Behemoth, He can meet the daily needs of His people (<a href="/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>while all the beasts of the field play nearby</b><p><a href="/job/40-20.htm">Job 40:20</a>b &#8212; &#8220;while all the beasts of the field play nearby&#8221;<p>&#8226; The other animals frolic unafraid, highlighting Behemoth&#8217;s serene dominance. Like <a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a> notes, &#8220;The righteous are as bold as a lion,&#8221; Behemoth stands calm because nothing threatens him.<p>&#8226; Harmony in creation: <a href="/psalms/104-20.htm">Psalm 104:20&#8211;22</a> portrays nocturnal beasts that &#8220;roam about,&#8221; yet within God&#8217;s ordering there is room for play and peace. Similarly, <a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6</a> envisions a future where predators and prey coexist; Job&#8217;s snapshot gives an earthly preview.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s point to Job: If lesser creatures can relax beside this colossus, how much more should Job rest in the LORD&#8217;s sovereignty (compare <a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: Trust frees us from fear. Knowing the Almighty rules, believers can &#8220;lie down and sleep in peace&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/3-5.htm">Psalm 3:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/40-20.htm">Job 40:20</a> paints a vivid picture of God&#8217;s lavish provision and perfect order. Hills teem with vegetation to satisfy Behemoth, and smaller animals play close by, untroubled. Together, these images remind us that the Creator sustains every creature, governs every relationship in nature, and invites His people to live in confident, fearless dependence on Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely the mountains bring him forth food</span>.
