The heart being "enticed" suggests an internal struggle with temptation, emphasizing the importance of inner purity. This aligns with the teachings found in <a href="/proverbs/6-25.htm">Proverbs 6:25</a>, which warns against lusting after a neighbor's wife. The concept of the heart in biblical terms often refers to the center of one's will and emotions, indicating that sin begins internally before manifesting in actions. This phrase also echoes the commandment in <a href="/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>, "You shall not covet your neighbor's wife," highlighting the continuity of moral law throughout Scripture.<p><b>or I have lurked at his door</b><br>The imagery of "lurking" suggests premeditated intent and deceitful behavior, contrasting with the uprightness Job claims throughout his defense. In ancient times, the act of lurking at someone's door would imply a breach of trust and respect within the community. This behavior is condemned in <a href="/proverbs/7-6.htm">Proverbs 7:6-27</a>, where the adulterous woman is described as waiting at her door to entice a young man. The cultural context underscores the importance of maintaining one's integrity and the severe social consequences of violating another's marriage. This phrase also serves as a type of Christ, who, unlike Job, was without sin and perfectly upheld the law, resisting all forms of temptation as seen in <a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
