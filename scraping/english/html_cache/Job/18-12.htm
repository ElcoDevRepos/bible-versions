In the context of the Book of Job, Bildad is describing the fate of the wicked, suggesting that their strength will inevitably fail. This can be seen as a reflection of the broader biblical theme that human strength is ultimately insufficient without reliance on God (<a href="/isaiah/40-30.htm">Isaiah 40:30-31</a>). The depletion of strength can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual weakness or moral failure, which is a recurring theme in the wisdom literature of the Bible.<p><b>and calamity is ready at his side</b><br>Calamity here refers to impending disaster or misfortune, which is portrayed as being ever-present and ready to strike. This aligns with the biblical understanding that those who live in opposition to God's ways are often on the brink of ruin (<a href="/proverbs/24-16.htm">Proverbs 24:16</a>). The imagery of calamity being "at his side" suggests an unavoidable and intimate threat, emphasizing the immediacy and certainty of divine justice. This can be connected to the broader biblical narrative of God's judgment against sin, as seen in the prophetic books where calamity is often depicted as a consequence of turning away from God (<a href="/jeremiah/18-11.htm">Jeremiah 18:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bildad_the_shuhite.htm">Bildad the Shuhite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.
