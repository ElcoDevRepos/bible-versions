It highlights the ongoing dialogue and debate between Job and his friends, who believe that suffering is a direct result of personal sin. This reflects the broader theme of the book, which challenges the simplistic retribution theology of the time.<p><b>&#8216;Where now is the nobleman&#8217;s house</b><br>The term "nobleman" refers to a person of high status or wealth. In the context of Job, this could be seen as a reference to those who are perceived as righteous or blessed by God due to their prosperity. Job's question challenges the assumption that wealth and status are indicators of divine favor. This echoes the biblical theme that God's ways are not always aligned with human understanding of justice and prosperity, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, where the prosperity of the wicked is questioned.<p><b>and where are the tents in which the wicked dwell?&#8217;</b><br>The "tents" symbolize temporary dwellings, contrasting with the more permanent "house" of the nobleman. This imagery suggests the transient nature of life and the fleeting success of the wicked. Job's question implies that the wicked often seem to prosper without immediate consequence, challenging the belief that they are always punished in this life. This theme is further explored in <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:14</a>, where the apparent prosperity of the wicked and the suffering of the righteous are discussed. The question also foreshadows the ultimate justice of God, which may not be evident in the present but is assured in the eschatological future, aligning with the prophetic hope found in books like Isaiah and Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and patience who undergoes severe trials and questions the justice of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_friends.htm">Job's Friends</a></b><br>Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, who visit Job to offer counsel but often misinterpret his suffering as a result of sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>A general reference to those who live in opposition to God's ways, often prospering in the world despite their unrighteousness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nobleman's_house.htm">Nobleman's House</a></b><br>Symbolizes wealth, status, and the apparent success of the wicked, which Job's friends question.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tents.htm">Tents</a></b><br>Represents the temporary dwelling and lifestyle of the wicked, suggesting impermanence despite apparent prosperity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_apparent_injustice.htm">Understanding Apparent Injustice</a></b><br>Recognize that the prosperity of the wicked is a temporary condition and does not reflect God's ultimate justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Even when circumstances seem unfair, trust that God is in control and His justice will prevail in His timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_misjudgment.htm">Avoiding Misjudgment</a></b><br>Be cautious not to assume that material success is a sign of God's favor or that suffering is a result of personal sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/endurance_in_trials.htm">Endurance in Trials</a></b><br>Like Job, maintain faith and integrity even when facing difficult questions about God's justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Focus on eternal rewards rather than temporary earthly success, understanding that God's judgment is final and just.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Job_21_28_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Job 21:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Job_21_28_Why_do_the_wicked_prosper.htm">How does Job 21:28 challenge our understanding of the prosperity of the wicked?

You plant them, and they take root.&#8221;<p>- By confronting this tension, Job presses us to trust God&#8217;s eventual, not necessarily immediate, justice (<a href="/psalms/37-35.htm">Psalm 37:35-36</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-15.htm">Malachi 3:15-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/21-28.htm">Job 21:28</a> exposes the simplistic theology of Job&#8217;s friends: they assume every collapse of a wealthy household proves God&#8217;s instant judgment on wickedness. Job answers that real-world evidence often contradicts that neat equation. While Scripture promises that divine justice will prevail, it also records seasons when the wicked appear secure. Believers are therefore called to trust God&#8217;s ultimate timetable, resisting the urge to read every circumstance as a direct, immediate verdict on a person&#8217;s righteousness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Of the prince</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., of the generous, virtuous, princely man?</span>--the antithesis to the wicked man. "Behold I know your thoughts, for ye say, How can we tell who is virtuous and who is wicked? and consequently we know not to which catalogue you belong." They had all along been insinuating that, though he seemed to be righteous, he was really wicked.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For ye say, Where is the house of the prince?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "What has become of the house of the powerful man (Job himself)?

Again Job is intended, although the insult is veiled by the plural form being used. Job supposes that his opponents will meet his statement, that the righteous are afflicted and the wicked prosper, by pointing to his own case as one in which wickedness has been punished. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/21-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you say,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;Where</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ay&#183;y&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_346.htm">Strong's 346: </a> </span><span class="str2">Where?</span><br /><br /><span class="word">now is the nobleman&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1491;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#238;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5081.htm">Strong's 5081: </a> </span><span class="str2">Voluntary, generous, magnanimous, a grandee</span><br /><br /><span class="word">house,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#234;&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and where</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1437;&#1488;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;ay&#183;y&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
