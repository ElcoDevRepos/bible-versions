This reflects the biblical theme of the fear of the Lord, which is often associated with wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). In the context of Job, this fear is not just reverence but a profound terror due to the overwhelming power and holiness of God. Job's experience is reminiscent of other biblical figures who encountered God's presence, such as Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>) and Isaiah's vision of the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>). The Hebrew word for "terrified" here conveys a sense of trembling and dread, highlighting the intensity of Job's emotions.<p><b>when I consider this,</b><br>Job is reflecting deeply on his situation and the nature of God. The act of considering implies a thoughtful and deliberate meditation on God's character and actions. This introspection is a common theme in wisdom literature, where understanding and contemplation are valued (<a href="/psalms/77-12.htm">Psalm 77:12</a>). Job's consideration leads him to a greater awareness of God's majesty and his own human limitations. This phrase underscores the importance of reflection in the believer's life, encouraging a thoughtful engagement with one's faith and circumstances.<p><b>I fear Him.</b><br>The fear of God is a central theme in the book of Job and throughout Scripture. It denotes a profound respect and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and justice. This fear is not merely an emotional response but a recognition of God's ultimate authority and power. In Job's context, it is a fear born out of his suffering and the realization of God's inscrutable ways. This fear is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to work out their salvation with fear and trembling (<a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a>). It also points to the reverence Jesus showed towards the Father, exemplifying perfect submission and obedience (<a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
