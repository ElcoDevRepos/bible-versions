The imagery of "thick clouds" is often used in Scripture to describe God's majesty and the mystery surrounding His presence (<a href="/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>, <a href="/psalms/97-2.htm">Psalm 97:2</a>). This phrase reflects the belief that God's ways and thoughts are higher than human understanding (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). The clouds symbolize both the glory and the hiddenness of God, emphasizing His transcendence.<p><b>so He does not see us</b><br>Eliphaz implies that God is so far removed from human concerns that He does not notice individual actions. This reflects a misunderstanding of God's omniscience, as other parts of Scripture affirm that God sees and knows everything (<a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>, <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>). Theologically, this challenges the idea of God's immanence, which is the belief that God is present and active within His creation. The assertion contrasts with the biblical teaching that God is intimately aware of and involved in the lives of His people.<p><b>as He traverses the vault of heaven.</b><br>The "vault of heaven" refers to the ancient Near Eastern cosmology, where the sky was seen as a solid dome over the earth. This phrase suggests God's majestic movement across the heavens, highlighting His sovereignty and authority over creation (<a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>, <a href="/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>). The imagery of God traversing the heavens can also be seen as a type of Christ, who ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of God (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>, <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>). This reflects the belief in God's active rule and presence throughout the universe, despite Eliphaz's claim of divine detachment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

Yet Scripture records that clouds often accompany God&#8217;s self-revelation, not His absence.<p>&#8211; <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16&#8211;18, 24</a>:15-18: the cloud on Sinai highlights holiness and majesty, not limitation.<p>&#8211; <a href="/2_chronicles/6-1.htm">2 Chronicles 6:1</a>: &#8220;The LORD has said that He would dwell in thick cloud.&#8221; His presence fills the temple even as the cloud conceals His glory from sinful eyes.<p>&#8211; <a href="/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>: &#8220;He made darkness His hiding place, and storm clouds a canopy around Him.&#8221; Darkness protects us from being consumed by unveiled glory; it never blinds God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So He does not see us</b><p>&#8226; Eliphaz moves from imagery to accusation: if God is veiled, then human deeds escape His notice. Scripture flatly contradicts that notion.<p>&#8211; <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>: &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are in every place, observing the wicked and the good.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1&#8211;12</a>: David marvels that even &#8220;the darkness is not dark to You; &#8230; the night shines like the day.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>: &#8220;No creature is hidden from His sight.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Eliphaz implies Job sins with impunity, but God&#8217;s omniscience remains absolute. Job himself affirms this later (<a href="/job/28-24.htm">Job 28:24</a>; 31:4).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As He traverses the vault of heaven</b><p>&#8226; The charge continues: God roams the sky, remote and uninvolved. Yet the same Bible that declares God sovereign over the heavens also proclaims His nearness.<p>&#8211; <a href="/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>: He &#8220;sits enthroned above the circle of the earth,&#8221; ruling, not wandering aimlessly.<p>&#8211; <a href="/jeremiah/23-23.htm">Jeremiah 23:23-24</a>: &#8220;Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?&#8221;&#8212;both transcendent and immanent.<p>&#8211; <a href="/acts/17-27.htm">Acts 17:27</a>: He is &#8220;not far from each one of us.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Eliphaz&#8217;s theology is upside-down. God&#8217;s &#8220;vault of heaven&#8221; is His throne room (<a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>), from which He actively governs and sees all.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Eliphaz claims that clouds hide God, that God cannot see human conduct, and that He drifts far above earthly affairs. Scripture records the statement accurately but exposes it as false. Clouds signify glory, not blindness; the Almighty sees every deed; His throne in the heavens guarantees, rather than prevents, His involvement with His creation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not</span> (see the comment on the preceding verse);
