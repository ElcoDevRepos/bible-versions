The "sword" symbolizes divine judgment or retribution. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the sword was often associated with warfare and divine punishment. This warning echoes the biblical principle of reaping what one sows, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, where it states that God is not mocked and a man reaps what he sows. Job is cautioning his friends that their unjust accusations could bring divine retribution upon themselves.<p><b>because wrath brings punishment by the sword</b><br>Here, "wrath" refers to divine anger or judgment. The Bible frequently associates God's wrath with punishment, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>, where God's wrath is revealed against all ungodliness. The "punishment by the sword" suggests a direct and severe form of divine justice. This reflects the biblical theme that God's wrath is a response to sin and injustice, emphasizing the seriousness of divine judgment.<p><b>so that you may know there is a judgment</b><br>This phrase underscores the certainty of divine judgment. It serves as a reminder that God is just and will hold individuals accountable for their actions. The concept of judgment is a central theme throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>, which states that God will bring every deed into judgment. This assurance of judgment is meant to instill a sense of accountability and reverence for God's justice. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment at the end of times, as described in <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>, where all are judged according to their deeds.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

If they insist on accusing him, they must remember the same divine justice they invoke will evaluate them.<p>- <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a> reminds us, &#8220;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge.&#8221; Job wants his friends to embrace that reverent fear, not a self-righteous confidence.<p>- Jesus echoes this principle in <a href="/matthew/7-2.htm">Matthew 7:2</a>, &#8220;For with the judgment you pronounce, you will be judged.&#8221; The warning keeps everyone humble.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Wrath Brings Punishment by the Sword</b><p>&#8220;Because wrath brings punishment by the sword&#8221; (<a href="/job/19-29.htm">Job 19:29</a>b)<p>- &#8220;Wrath&#8221; here points to the burning anger they have unleashed against Job in their speeches. Such hostility invites God&#8217;s corrective action.<p>- <a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a> notes that the governing sword is &#8220;an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.&#8221; Whether by civil authority or direct providence, unrepentant anger reaps violence.<p>- <a href="/job/4-9.htm">Job 4:9</a> had earlier declared, &#8220;By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of His anger they are consumed.&#8221; Job subtly turns Eliphaz&#8217;s own words back on the counselors.<p>- The image of the sword recalls <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>, where accountable humanity is warned that bloodshed invites bloodshed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So That You May Know There Is a Judgment</b><p>&#8220;So that you may know there is a judgment.&#8221; (<a href="/job/19-29.htm">Job 19:29</a>c)<p>- Job affirms a final, personal, divine reckoning.

The sword threatens the wicked, but the vindication of the faithful is certain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p>Job warns his friends that the very justice they wield against him will return upon them. Their wrathful words can summon the sword of divine discipline. He points forward to an unavoidable judgment where God will sort every motive and action. Therefore, rather than presuming guilt in others, believers live in humble, reverent fear, trusting the Lord&#8217;s perfect justice and awaiting the day when He will set all things right.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Be ye afraid . . .</span>--Job threatens his friends with that condign punishment of which they regarded him as a conspicuous example.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be ye afraid of the sword</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the sword of God's justice, which will assuredly smite you if you persecute an innocent <span class="accented">man."</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>For wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for wrath is among the transgressions of the sward</span>; <span class="accented">i e.</span> among the transgressions for which the sword is the fit punishment.
