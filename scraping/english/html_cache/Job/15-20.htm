In the context of the Book of Job, Eliphaz is speaking, suggesting that suffering is a direct result of sin. This aligns with the retributive justice view common in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where one's actions directly influence their fate. The idea of continuous pain for the wicked is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/32-10.htm">Psalm 32:10</a>, which states, "Many are the woes of the wicked." This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and separation from God that the wicked will face, as seen in New Testament teachings like <a href="/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>.<p><b>only a few years are reserved for the ruthless.</b><br>This part of the verse suggests that the ruthless, those who act with cruelty and without regard for others, have a limited time to prosper. The brevity of their success is a common theme in wisdom literature, emphasizing the temporary nature of earthly power and wealth. This is similar to <a href="/psalms/37-10.htm">Psalm 37:10</a>, which says, "A little while, and the wicked will be no more." The phrase implies divine justice, where God limits the time of the wicked's influence. It also serves as a warning that earthly life is fleeting, and eternal consequences await. This can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over evil, where the temporary reign of the wicked is contrasted with the eternal reign of righteousness through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure of the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him but ends up accusing him of wrongdoing.

A sound of terror is for ever in his ears lest the spoiler should come upon him in his prosperity--he always seems to dread his war-swoop. And this condition of darkness within, which contrasts so painfully with his outward prosperity, he sees no escape from; he is over in fear of a sword hanging over him, like Damocles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-35.</span> - Schultens calls this "a magnificently elaborate oration, crowded with illustrations and metaphors, in which it is shown that the wicked cannot possibly escape being miserable, but that the punishment which they have so richly deserved assuredly awaits them, and is to be inflicted on them, as an example and terror to others, by a holy and just God, because, just as he loves virtue, so he pursues vice with a fierce and deadly hatred" ('Liber Jobi,' p. 104, edit. R. Grey). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days</span>. Certainly an over-statement of the truth. With a much nearer approach to the facts of the case, the Psalmist remarked, "I was grieved at the wicked: I do also see the ungodly in such prosperity. For they are in no peril of death, but are lusty and strong. They come in no misfortune like other folk; neither are they plagued like other men" (<a href="/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3-5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the number of years is hidden to the oppressor</span>; rather, <span class="accented">even the number of years that is laid up for the oppressor.</span> So Merx and the Revised Version. Another possible meaning is, "And a [small] number of years is laid up," etc. If we take the former view, we must regard the clause as exegetical of "all his days." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/15-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A wicked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1453;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7563.htm">Strong's 7563: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wrong, an, bad person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">man writhes in pain</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1461;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7791;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;w&#183;l&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2342.htm">Strong's 2342: </a> </span><span class="str2">To twist, whirl, to dance, to writhe in pain, fear, to wait, to pervert</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">days;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">only a few</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;mis&#183;par)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
