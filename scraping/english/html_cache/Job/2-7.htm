The presence of the LORD signifies the divine court, a setting where God&#8217;s sovereignty is emphasized. The departure of Satan underscores his role as a subordinate being who must operate within the boundaries set by God. This scene echoes the earlier encounter in <a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>, reinforcing the theme of divine permission and control over evil.<p><b>and infected Job with terrible boils</b><br>The affliction of boils is a physical manifestation of suffering, often associated with divine judgment or severe testing in the ancient Near East. Boils are mentioned in other biblical contexts, such as the plagues of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/9-9.htm">Exodus 9:9-11</a>), highlighting their severity and the intense suffering they cause. This physical ailment serves as a tangible expression of Job's trial, testing his integrity and faith. The Hebrew term used here suggests a painful and debilitating condition, emphasizing the extremity of Job's suffering.<p><b>from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head</b><br>This phrase indicates the totality of Job's affliction, affecting his entire body. It symbolizes the comprehensive nature of his suffering, leaving no part of him untouched. This imagery is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe complete devastation or judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-35.htm">Deuteronomy 28:35</a>, <a href="/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>). The extent of Job's suffering foreshadows the complete and redemptive suffering of Christ, who bore the sins of humanity in totality.
