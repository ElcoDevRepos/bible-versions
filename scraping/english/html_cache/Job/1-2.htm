The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible, as seen in the seven days of creation (Genesis 1) and the seven churches in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>). This could imply that Job's family was seen as complete and blessed.<br><br>The number three, associated with the daughters, also holds symbolic meaning, often representing divine wholeness or the Trinity in Christian theology. This could suggest a sense of divine favor or completeness in Job's family structure.<br><br>In the cultural and historical context of the ancient Near East, having a large family, particularly many sons, was considered a sign of wealth and blessing. Sons were often seen as a source of strength and security, as they could work the land and protect the family. Daughters, while not holding the same societal status as sons, were also considered a blessing, contributing to the family's social and economic alliances through marriage.<br><br>The structure of Job's family can also be seen as a type or foreshadowing of restoration and blessing. At the end of the Book of Job, after his trials, Job is blessed with the same number of children, indicating a restoration of his fortunes and a reaffirmation of God's favor (<a href="/job/42-13.htm">Job 42:13</a>).<br><br>This verse sets the stage for understanding the magnitude of Job's initial blessings and the depth of his subsequent losses, which are central themes in the narrative. It also highlights the cultural importance of family and progeny in the biblical world, providing a backdrop for the trials and restoration that follow.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

The numbers three and seven, and their product, ten, are certainly sacred numbers, regarded as expressive of ideal perfection. But this does not prevent their being also historical. As Canon Cook observes, "Striking coincidences between outward facts and ideal numbers are not uncommon in the purely historical portions of Scripture" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 20). There are <span class="accented">twelve</span> apostles, <span class="accented">seventy</span> (7 &times; 10) disciples sent out by our Lord, <span class="accented">seven</span> deacons, three synoptic Gospels, <span class="accented">twelve</span> minor prophets, seven princes of Persia and Media, ten sons of Haman, three of Noah, Gomer, Terah, Levi, and Zeruiah, <span class="accented">seven</span> of Japhet, Mizraim, Seir the Horite, Gad, and Jesse (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-13.htm">1 Chronicles 2:13-15</a>), <span class="accented">twelve</span> of Ishmael, <span class="accented">twelve</span> of Jacob, etc. Our Lord is <span class="accented">thirty</span> (3 x 10) years old when he begins to teach, and his ministry lasts <span class="accented">three</span> years; he heals <span class="accented">seven</span> lepers, casts out of Mary Magdalene <span class="accented">seven</span> devils, speaks upon the cross <span class="accented">seven</span> "words," bids Peter forgive his brother "<span class="accented">seventy</span> times seven," etc. It is thus not only in vision or in prophecy, or in symbolical language, that these "ideal numbers" come to the front far more frequently than ethers, but also in the most matter-of-fact histories. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/1-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He had seven</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;i&#7687;&#183;&#8216;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7651.htm">Strong's 7651: </a> </span><span class="str2">Seven, seven times, a week, an indefinite number</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#257;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and three</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;l&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7969.htm">Strong's 7969: </a> </span><span class="str2">Three, third, thrice</span><br /><br /><span class="word">daughters,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1323.htm">Strong's 1323: </a> </span><span class="str2">A daughter</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/1-2.htm">Job 1:2 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/1-2.htm">Job 1:2 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/1-2.htm">Job 1:2 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/1-2.htm">Job 1:2 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/1-2.htm">Job 1:2 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/1-2.htm">Job 1:2  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/1-2.htm">Job 1:2 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/1-2.htm">Job 1:2 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/1-2.htm">Job 1:2 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/1-2.htm">Job 1:2 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/1-2.htm">OT Poetry: Job 1:2 There were born to him seven sons (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/1-1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 1:1"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 1:1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/1-3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 1:3"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 1:3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
