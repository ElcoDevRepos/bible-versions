The LORD, Yahweh, is depicted as sovereign, initiating the conversation. This setting underscores the belief in God's ultimate authority over all creation, including Satan. The presence of Satan, the adversary, reflects the ongoing spiritual conflict and the testing of human faith.<p><b>Have you considered My servant Job?</b><br>God's question to Satan draws attention to Job's exemplary character. The term "My servant" signifies a special relationship and divine approval, reminiscent of other biblical figures like Moses and David. This phrase suggests that God is aware of Job's faithfulness and uses it to challenge Satan's skepticism about human righteousness. It also sets the stage for the testing of Job's integrity.<p><b>For there is no one on earth like him</b><br>This statement emphasizes Job's unparalleled righteousness and integrity. It suggests that Job's character is exceptional, setting him apart from all other people. This echoes the biblical theme of God recognizing and rewarding faithfulness, as seen in figures like Noah and Daniel. It also foreshadows the trials Job will face, testing whether his righteousness is genuine.<p><b>a man who is blameless and upright</b><br>The description of Job as "blameless and upright" highlights his moral and ethical integrity. "Blameless" suggests completeness and sincerity in his devotion to God, while "upright" indicates his just and honest dealings with others. This dual description aligns with the biblical ideal of righteousness, as seen in Psalms and Proverbs, where a righteous person is one who lives in accordance with God's laws.<p><b>who fears God and shuns evil</b><br>This phrase encapsulates the essence of true piety in the biblical sense. "Fears God" implies reverence, awe, and obedience to God's will, a central theme in wisdom literature like Proverbs. "Shuns evil" indicates an active rejection of sin and wrongdoing, reflecting a commitment to holiness. Together, these qualities define Job's character and set the foundation for the narrative's exploration of suffering and faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God who initiates the conversation with Satan, highlighting His omniscience and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/satan.htm">Satan</a></b><br>The adversary who roams the earth, seeking to challenge the integrity of God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who fears God and shuns evil, living in the land of Uz.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_court.htm">Heavenly Court</a></b><br>The setting where the sons of God present themselves before the LORD, indicating a divine council.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/uz.htm">Uz</a></b><br>The land where Job resides, often associated with the region east of Israel, though its exact location is uncertain.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_knowledge.htm">God's Sovereignty and Knowledge</a></b><br>God knows the hearts and lives of His servants intimately.

God Himself begins the dialogue, underscoring His total sovereignty; Satan can only act by divine permission (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/18-18.htm">2 Chronicles 18:18-21</a>; <a href="/luke/22-31.htm">Luke 22:31-32</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently portrays Satan as &#8220;the accuser of our brothers&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>), yet it is the LORD who controls the conversation and sets the terms.<p>&#8226; <a href="/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1-2</a> offers a parallel picture: Satan stands ready to accuse, but the LORD rebukes him. <a href="/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a> opens with that same authoritative tone&#8212;God is in command.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Have you considered My servant Job?</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Considered&#8221; points to Satan&#8217;s roaming scrutiny (<a href="/job/1-7.htm">Job 1:7</a>); God draws attention to Job&#8217;s life as evidence that genuine faith exists on earth.<p>&#8226; By calling Job &#8220;My servant,&#8221; the LORD places Job in the honored line of Moses (<a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>) and David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-5.htm">2 Samuel 7:5</a>). The term highlights ownership, intimacy, and commendation.<p>&#8226; God is not informing Satan; He is challenging the adversary with undeniable proof of faithful obedience (cf. <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For there is no one on earth like him</b><p>&#8226; This is a divine assessment, not mere opinion. It echoes <a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>, where Noah is called &#8220;a righteous man, blameless in his generation.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The statement establishes Job as the benchmark of human righteousness for his day, magnifying the stakes of the coming test.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s witness about Job silences any accusation that true righteousness is impossible (cf. <a href="/psalms/11-7.htm">Psalm 11:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A man who is blameless and upright</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Blameless&#8221; describes integrity of character&#8212;wholehearted devotion without hidden compromise (cf. <a href="/psalms/18-23.htm">Psalm 18:23</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Upright&#8221; speaks of straightness in conduct&#8212;consistent, honest dealings with God and people (<a href="/proverbs/14-2.htm">Proverbs 14:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Together these terms present Job as morally complete: what he is inside shapes what he does outside.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who fears God and shuns evil</b><p>&#8226; The fear of God is reverent awe that leads to obedience (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>). Job&#8217;s life flows from worship, not mere rule-keeping.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Shuns evil&#8221; (literally turns away) shows active resistance, similar to <a href="/psalms/34-14.htm">Psalm 34:14</a>: &#8220;Turn away from evil and do good.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The pair forms the heart of wisdom literature: fearing God produces separation from sin (<a href="/proverbs/3-7.htm">Proverbs 3:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a> records God&#8217;s own testimony that Job is the foremost example of faithful, wholehearted, obedient living on earth. In a heavenly arena, the LORD showcases Job&#8217;s integrity&#8212;blameless within, upright without, marked by reverent fear and decisive rejection of evil. The verse assures readers that true righteousness is possible and recognized by God, setting the stage for the book&#8217;s exploration of suffering not as punishment for sin but as a proving ground for genuine faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered?</span> literally. <span class="accented">Hast thou set thine heart on?</span> equivalent to "Hast thou given thine attention to?"
