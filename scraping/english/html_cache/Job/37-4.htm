In the context of Job, this roaring sound can be likened to the natural phenomena that demonstrate God's sovereignty and power over creation. The imagery of roaring is consistent with other biblical passages, such as <a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3-9</a>, where the voice of the Lord is described as powerful and full of majesty, breaking cedars and shaking the wilderness. This sound signifies God's presence and His active involvement in the world.<p><b>He thunders with His majestic voice.</b><br>The thunderous voice of God is a recurring theme in the Bible, symbolizing His authority and the fear it instills in humanity. In <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a>, God's voice is associated with thunder and lightning on Mount Sinai, emphasizing His holiness and the seriousness of His covenant with Israel. The majesty of God's voice reflects His divine nature, commanding respect and reverence. This thunderous voice is also a reminder of God's ultimate control over the universe, as seen in the natural order and the weather patterns He governs.<p><b>He does not restrain the lightning when His voice resounds.</b><br>This phrase highlights God's unrestrained power and the immediacy of His actions. The lightning, often seen as a symbol of divine judgment or revelation, is not held back when God speaks. This can be connected to the plagues in Egypt, where lightning and thunder were part of God's judgment against Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23-24</a>). The unrestrained nature of the lightning signifies that God's will is accomplished without hindrance. In a broader theological sense, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate revelation of God, coming into the world with power and authority, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith who undergoes severe trials and suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>The speaker in this passage, a younger friend of Job who offers his perspective on Job's suffering and God's majesty.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Almighty, whose power and majesty are being described through the natural phenomena of thunder and lightning.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/thunder_and_lightning.htm">Thunder and Lightning</a></b><br>Natural events used metaphorically to describe the power and majesty of God's voice and actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_majesty_of_god's_voice.htm">The Majesty of God's Voice</a></b><br>God's voice is powerful and majestic, commanding respect and awe.

When the Philistines threatened Israel, &#8220;the LORD thundered loudly&#8230; and threw them into panic&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/7-10.htm">1 Samuel 7:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Elihu&#8217;s point: God&#8217;s rule is not theoretical. Every clap of thunder is a real-time proclamation that the King of the universe is speaking, commanding, and defending His glory.<p>&#8226; For Job, battered by loss and confusion, the message is clear&#8212;God&#8217;s sovereignty remains intact, and His voice still reaches human ears.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He does not restrain the lightning when His voice resounds</b><p>&#8226; As the thunder peaks, flashes split the sky. &#8220;He fills His hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark&#8221; (<a href="/job/36-32.htm">Job 36:32</a>).<p>&#8226; God &#8220;does not restrain&#8221; the bolts; nothing limits the reach of His power. <a href="/psalms/77-18.htm">Psalm 77:18</a> notes the same pairing: &#8220;Your thunder resounded&#8230; the lightning lit up the world.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The unleashed lightning signals decisive action. <a href="/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a> links storms to God&#8217;s justice; what He purposes, He performs.<p>&#8226; Job has wondered whether God sees or cares. The unrestrained lightning answers: the Lord is actively engaged, perfectly accurate, and never hesitant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/37-4.htm">Job 37:4</a> uses the escalating drama of a storm to spotlight God&#8217;s nearness, authority, and unstoppable power. The initial roar signals His approach, the majestic thunder proclaims His kingship, and the unrestrained lightning demonstrates that His will is carried out without delay. For every sufferer who, like Job, wrestles with unanswered questions, the verse invites renewed awe: the God who speaks through the storm is fully alive, fully in control, and fully committed to making His presence known.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/37.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">After it a voice roareth</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the thunderclap which follows the lightning-flash.<span class= "bld"><p>And he stayeth them not </span>(or will not stay them) <span class= "bld">when his voice is</span> <span class= "bld">heard.</span>--What does this mean?
