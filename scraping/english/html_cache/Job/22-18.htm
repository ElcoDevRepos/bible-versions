In the context of the Book of Job, Eliphaz is speaking, suggesting that the prosperity of the wicked is ultimately allowed by God. This reflects the biblical theme that God is the source of all blessings, as seen in passages like <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>, which states that every good and perfect gift is from above. The historical context of Job, set in the patriarchal period, emphasizes the belief that material wealth and prosperity were signs of divine favor. However, the narrative of Job challenges this notion by showing that suffering can occur even to the righteous. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative where God provides for His people, as seen in the provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16).<p><b>so I stay far from the counsel of the wicked.</b><br>Eliphaz claims a moral high ground by distancing himself from the wicked, reflecting the biblical principle of avoiding evil influences, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>, which blesses the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked. This phrase underscores the importance of discernment and righteousness, themes prevalent throughout Scripture. The cultural context of the ancient Near East often associated wisdom with moral living, and Eliphaz's statement aligns with this worldview. However, the irony in the Book of Job is that Eliphaz's counsel, though seemingly wise, is ultimately flawed, as God later rebukes him and the other friends for not speaking rightly about Him (<a href="/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7</a>). This highlights the complexity of understanding God's ways and the need for humility in interpreting divine actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
