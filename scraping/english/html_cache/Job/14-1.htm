It highlights the natural and humble beginnings of humanity, connecting to <a href="/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>, where childbirth is mentioned as part of the consequences of the Fall. The phrase underscores the frailty and mortality of human life, contrasting with the divine nature of God. In biblical context, being "born of woman" also points to the humanity of Jesus Christ, who, though divine, was born of the Virgin Mary, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>.<p><b>is short of days</b><br>This reflects the brevity of human life, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. <a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a> echoes this sentiment, stating that human life is typically seventy to eighty years, emphasizing its fleeting nature. The phrase serves as a reminder of the temporal nature of earthly existence, urging individuals to live wisely and righteously. Historically, life expectancy in ancient times was indeed shorter due to various factors, including disease and conflict, making this observation particularly poignant for Job's audience.<p><b>and full of trouble</b><br>This part of the verse acknowledges the inherent difficulties and sufferings of life. It resonates with the broader narrative of the Book of Job, where Job experiences profound personal loss and suffering. The phrase aligns with Jesus' words in <a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>, where He acknowledges the tribulations of the world but offers peace through Him. The troubles of life are seen as a result of the fallen world, yet they also serve as opportunities for spiritual growth and reliance on God. This understanding is central to the Christian perspective on suffering, where trials are seen as refining and faith-strengthening.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

It would seem that the patriarch, having vented his feelings, experiences a certain relief, an interval of calm, in which, his own woes pressing less heavily upon him, he is content to moralize on the general condition of humanity. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Man that is born of a woman</span>. In this fact Job sees the origin of man's inherent weakness. He is "born of a woman," who is "the weaker vessel" (<a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>). He is conceived by her in uncleanness (<a href="/psalms/51-5.htm">Psalm 51:5</a>; comp. below, ver. 4), brought forth in sorrow and pain (<a href="/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>) suckled at her breasts, placed for years under her guidance.

Methuselah, perhaps, thought the same. We all, as we come towards old age, and death draws manifestly near, feel as if we had only just begun to live, as if, at any rate, we had not done half our work, and were about to be cut off before our time. But would the case be seriously different if our tale of years were doubled?
