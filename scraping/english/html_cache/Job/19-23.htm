In the ancient Near Eastern context, oral tradition was prevalent, but written records were considered more enduring and authoritative. Job's longing for his words to be recorded suggests a hope for vindication and a lasting testimony of his integrity and suffering. This desire for permanence can be seen as a foreshadowing of the written Scriptures, which serve as a lasting record of God's revelation and human experience.<p><b>and inscribed in a book,</b><br>The mention of a "book" indicates the importance of written documentation in ancient times, where inscribing on materials like clay tablets or papyrus was a way to preserve important information. This reflects the cultural practice of recording significant events and legal matters in written form. Theologically, this can be connected to the concept of the "Book of Life" mentioned in Revelation, where the names of the righteous are recorded. Job's wish for his words to be inscribed suggests a yearning for his story to be remembered and understood by future generations, much like the enduring nature of the biblical text itself.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

The former view is probably owing to the Christian acceptation given to them, and the consequently great importance attaching to them. Since, however, the three verses, <a href="/context/job/19-25.htm" title="For I know that my redeemer lives, and that he shall stand at the latter day on the earth:">Job 19:25-27</a>, are manifestly more emphatic than any he has yet spoken, though they do not stand quite alone, there is no reason why it should not be especially these very words which he desires more than any others to have recorded.

As there is nothing that is very remarkable in the preceding words, whereas the latter are among the most striking in the book, the general opinion has been that he refers to these last. It is now universally allowed, even by those whose date for Job is the most remote, that books were common long before his time, and so that he might naturally have been familiar with them. Writing is, of course, even anterior to books, and was certainly in use before <span class="date">B.C. 2000</span>. The earliest writing was probably on stone or brick, and was perhaps in every case hieroglyphical.
