In biblical terms, stretching out one's hand can symbolize aggression or an attempt to exert power. This imagery is reminiscent of other biblical figures who opposed God, such as Pharaoh in Exodus, who hardened his heart against the Lord. The act of stretching out one's hand against God is a metaphor for prideful rebellion, which is a recurring theme in the Bible. It reflects the human tendency to challenge divine authority, as seen in the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>) and in the actions of King Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>).<p><b>and has vaunted himself against the Almighty</b><br>To vaunt oneself means to boast or exalt oneself. This phrase indicates arrogance and self-exaltation in opposition to God. The term "Almighty" emphasizes God's supreme power and authority, highlighting the futility and audacity of human pride. This echoes the sin of Lucifer, who sought to elevate himself above God (<a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-15</a>). The cultural context of the ancient Near East often involved rulers and individuals who claimed divine status or challenged the gods, reflecting a broader human inclination toward self-deification. This behavior is contrasted with the humility exemplified by Jesus Christ, who, though being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage (<a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

He runneth upon Him with haughty neck, with the thick bosses of his bucklers; "fully protected as he supposes against the vengeance of the Most High.
