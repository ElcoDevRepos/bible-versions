The "laws of the heavens" refer to the natural order and cosmic principles governing celestial bodies. In ancient times, the heavens were seen as a realm of divine control, beyond human comprehension. This aligns with passages like <a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>, which speaks of the heavens declaring God's glory. The rhetorical question emphasizes human limitations compared to God's infinite wisdom, a theme prevalent throughout the Book of Job.<p><b>Can you set their dominion over the earth?</b><br>This question underscores God's authority in establishing the heavens' influence over the earth. The "dominion" suggests a governing power, reflecting the belief that celestial bodies impact earthly events, a concept seen in <a href="/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14-18</a>, where the sun, moon, and stars are given roles in marking time and seasons. This phrase also points to God's providence and control over creation, contrasting human inability to exert such influence. It echoes the biblical theme of God's sovereignty, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>, where God is depicted as the one who calls the stars by name.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Job might scan the night sky, but only God can establish its rhythms&#8212;seasons, tides, planetary paths&#8212;each one perfectly timed, as <a href="/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a> notes when it credits God with &#8220;turning darkness into dawn and darkening day into night.&#8221;<p>- In everyday terms, the verse nudges us to humility: every orbit, eclipse, and constellation is already governed by the Lord who &#8220;determines the number of the stars and calls them each by name&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/147-4.htm">Psalm 147:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Can you set their dominion over the earth?</b><p>- The heavens not only possess laws; they wield real influence on earth. <a href="/genesis/8-22.htm">Genesis 8:22</a> links seedtime and harvest to the steady movements of heavenly bodies. Without their God-ordained dominion&#8212;light, warmth, gravity&#8212;life could not thrive.<p>- God asks Job if he can exert that same governing power. Obviously, he cannot. This contrasts sharply with what the Creator does in <a href="/psalms/104-19.htm">Psalm 104:19&#8211;20</a>, where the moon marks seasons and the sun knows when to set&#8212;functions a human could never command.<p>- <a href="/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a> invites us to &#8220;lift up your eyes on high and see who has created these,&#8221; again stressing that dominion belongs exclusively to the One who &#8220;brings out their host by number.&#8221;<p>- By drawing Job&#8217;s attention upward, God reinforces His sovereign rule downward. The heavens influence weather (<a href="/job/37-9.htm">Job 37:9&#8211;13</a>), tides (<a href="/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>), and even world events foretold through signs in the sky (<a href="/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>). All these realms remain under divine, not human, control.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/38-33.htm">Job 38:33</a> confronts human limitation and exalts divine sovereignty. We cannot chart every cosmic statute or harness the heavens to do our bidding, yet God has already established both their laws and their earthly sway. Recognizing this keeps us humble, worshipful, and confident that the same Lord who orders the stars faithfully governs our lives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/38.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">The ordinances of heaven.</span>--Comp. <a href="/job/28-26.htm" title="When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:">Job 28:26</a>.

The general prevalence of law in the material world is quite as strongly asserted by the sacred writers as by modern science. The difference is that modern science regards the laws as physical necessities, self-subsisting, while Scripture looks upon them as the ordinances of the Divine will. This latter view involves, of course, the further result that the Divine will can at any time suspend or reverse any of its enactments. <span class="cmt_word">Canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?</span> If Job does not even know the laws whereby the world is governed, much less can he establish such laws himself, and make them work. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/38-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Do you know</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1453;&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the laws</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1467;&#1511;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;uq&#183;q&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2708.htm">Strong's 2708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something prescribed, an enactment, statute</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the heavens?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;m&#257;&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8064.htm">Strong's 8064: </a> </span><span class="str2">Heaven, sky</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Can you set</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#257;&#183;&#347;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7760.htm">Strong's 7760: </a> </span><span class="str2">Put -- to put, place, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their dominion</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1496;&#1464;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;&#7789;&#257;&#183;r&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
