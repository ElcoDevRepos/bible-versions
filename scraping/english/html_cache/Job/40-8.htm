In the context of the Book of Job, God is responding to Job's earlier complaints about his suffering and the perceived injustice of his situation. The rhetorical question emphasizes the impossibility of nullifying divine justice, which is perfect and beyond human understanding. Biblically, God's justice is a recurring theme, seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, which describes God as a "God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and upright is He." The question also reflects the broader biblical narrative that God's ways are higher than human ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p><b>Would you condemn Me to justify yourself?</b><br>Here, God addresses the human tendency to justify oneself by questioning or blaming God. This reflects a deeper issue of pride and self-righteousness, which is a common human failing. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, where Job is set, divine justice was often seen as inscrutable, and humans were expected to submit to it. Theologically, this phrase points to the need for humility before God, as seen in <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>, "Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will exalt you." It also foreshadows the ultimate justification found in Christ, who, though innocent, was condemned so that believers might be justified before God (<a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

God is about to show Job his inability to govern the world and administer judgment among men, so as to rule them morally, from his acknowledged inability to govern the more formidable animals of the brute creation. If he cannot restrain them, how is it likely that he will be able to tread down the wicked in their place? And if he cannot hold the wicked in check and compel them to submission, how, any more, can he protect himself from their violence? how can he save himself from the outbursts of their fury? or, if not save himself from them, how much less can he deliver himself from the hand of God? If he cannot hide them in the dust together, and bind them (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>restrain the threatenings of their rage in the hidden world) in the secret prison-house, how much less can he save himself, and be independent of the help of a saviour?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wilt thou also</span> (rather, <span class="accented">even</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>dis<span class="accented">-</span>annul my judgment?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> maintain that my judgment towards thee has not been just and equitable, and therefore, so far as it lies in thy power, disannul it? <span class="cmt_word">Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?</span> Dost thou think it necessary to accuse me of injustice, and condemn me. in order to establish thine own innocence?
