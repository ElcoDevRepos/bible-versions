In the context of the Book of Job, Job is asserting his integrity and righteousness, emphasizing that he has lived in a way that avoids divine punishment. The fear of calamity from God is a common theme in the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, where the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). This fear is not merely terror but a profound respect for God's authority and justice. Historically, the ancient Near Eastern cultures, including the Israelites, viewed natural disasters and personal misfortunes as potential signs of divine displeasure. Job's fear underscores his awareness of God's sovereignty and the potential consequences of sin.<p><b>and His splendor I cannot overpower</b><br>Here, Job acknowledges the overwhelming majesty and glory of God, which is beyond human control or influence. The term "splendor" conveys the idea of God's majestic presence and holiness, which is a recurring theme throughout the Bible. In <a href="/exodus/33-18.htm">Exodus 33:18-23</a>, Moses requests to see God's glory, but God only allows him to see His back, indicating the overwhelming nature of His presence. Job's statement reflects the biblical understanding that God's ways and His essence are beyond human comprehension and manipulation. This acknowledgment of God's splendor is a recognition of His ultimate authority and the futility of human efforts to challenge or change His will. The phrase also points to the transcendence of God, a concept that is central to the biblical narrative and is fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ, who embodies the fullness of God's glory (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
