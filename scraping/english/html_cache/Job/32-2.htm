His lineage is significant; being a Buzite connects him to the family of Buz, a nephew of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22-21.htm">Genesis 22:21</a>), suggesting a heritage of wisdom and understanding. The mention of the family of Ram may indicate a noble or respected lineage, possibly linked to the Arameans, known for their wisdom traditions. Elihu's anger is described as "kindled," indicating a righteous indignation, a theme often seen in biblical narratives where God's representatives express divine displeasure (e.g., Moses in <a href="/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19</a>).<p><b>He burned with anger against Job for justifying himself rather than God,</b><br>Elihu's anger is directed at Job's self-justification, which he perceives as Job prioritizing his own righteousness over God's. This reflects a central theme in the Book of Job: the struggle to understand divine justice and human suffering. Elihu's perspective introduces a new dimension to the dialogue, emphasizing the importance of God's sovereignty and righteousness over human understanding. This aligns with other scriptural teachings, such as <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, which highlight the transcendence of God's ways over human reasoning. Elihu's role can be seen as a type of Christ, acting as a mediator who seeks to correct misunderstandings about God's nature, similar to how Christ reveals the Father (<a href="/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who enters the dialogue in the Book of Job.

However, it is important to balance zeal with wisdom and humility.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/listening_before_speaking.htm">Listening Before Speaking</a></b><br>Elihu waited to speak until the older men had finished.

The debates between Job and his three friends have stalled (<a href="/job/32-1.htm">Job 32:1</a>), and the atmosphere is thick with unspoken tension. Elihu&#8217;s response is framed as righteous indignation, not petulant irritation. Scripture shows that anger can be appropriate when God&#8217;s honor is at stake&#8212;think of Moses breaking the tablets (<a href="/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19</a>) or Jesus clearing the temple (<a href="/john/2-15.htm">John 2:15-17</a>). Yet <a href="/james/1-20.htm">James 1:20</a> cautions that &#8220;man&#8217;s anger does not bring about the righteousness of God,&#8221; reminding us to test whether our own anger is fueled by zeal for truth or by wounded pride.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Identifying the speaker: &#8220;Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite &#8230;&#8221;</b><p>The verse grounds Elihu in real history and geography, underscoring the Bible&#8217;s reliability. &#8220;Buz&#8221; links him to Nahor&#8217;s descendants (<a href="/genesis/22-21.htm">Genesis 22:21</a>), placing him in the same broad patriarchal orbit as Job. While Job&#8217;s three older friends represent established wisdom traditions (<a href="/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>), Elihu appears younger (<a href="/job/32-4.htm">Job 32:4</a>) yet divinely prompted, hinting that God can raise up fresh voices when conventional counsel fails. First Timothy 4:12 echoes this dynamic: youth is no barrier when character and truth align.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His lineage: &#8220;of the family of Ram&#8221;</b><p>By adding &#8220;of the family of Ram,&#8221; the text highlights covenant roots. &#8220;Ram&#8221; is listed in the Messianic line (<a href="/ruth/4-19.htm">Ruth 4:19</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/2-9.htm">1 Chronicles 2:9-10</a>), subtly linking Elihu&#8217;s words to redemptive history. This ancestry signals that the rebuttal about to unfold is not random rhetoric but providentially situated, echoing God&#8217;s pattern of choosing unlikely messengers&#8212;David the shepherd (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11-13</a>) and Amos the herdsman (<a href="/amos/7-14.htm">Amos 7:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Intensity of emotion: &#8220;He burned with anger against Job &#8230;&#8221;</b><p>The phrase magnifies Elihu&#8217;s emotional temperature. <a href="/proverbs/14-29.htm">Proverbs 14:29</a> commends slow anger, yet <a href="/ephesians/4-26.htm">Ephesians 4:26</a> allows &#8220;Be angry and do not sin.&#8221; Elihu&#8217;s ardor serves as a caution: passion must stay tethered to truth. His burning impatience mirrors Jeremiah&#8217;s &#8220;fire shut up in my bones&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>), suggesting that silence would betray the conviction that God&#8217;s character must be defended.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The cause: &#8220;for justifying himself rather than God&#8221;</b><p>Here lies the crux. Job&#8217;s earlier speeches tip from lament to self-vindication (<a href="/job/27-2.htm">Job 27:2-6</a>), and Elihu hears a dangerous drift: defending personal innocence at the expense of divine justice. <a href="/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a> nails the principle&#8212;&#8220;Let God be true and every man a liar.&#8221; Even Job, a &#8220;blameless and upright man&#8221; (<a href="/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a>), must maintain God&#8217;s righteousness above his own. Elihu&#8217;s anger, then, is theological: any attempt to uphold self-righteousness imperils the glory reserved for God alone (<a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>). His forthcoming speeches will redirect the spotlight from human merit back to God&#8217;s sovereign wisdom (<a href="/job/33-12.htm">Job 33:12-13</a>; 34:10-12).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2</a> introduces Elihu as a fiery yet providential voice who cannot remain silent while God&#8217;s justice is eclipsed by human self-defense.

The name "Elihu" was not uncommon among the Israelites. It is found among the ancestors of Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>), among the Korhite Levites of the time of David (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-7.htm">1 Chronicles 26:7</a>), and as a variant for Eliab, one of David's brothers (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-8.htm">1 Chronicles 27:8</a>) The meaning of the word was, "He is my God" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">The son of Barachal</span>. Barachel is also a significant name. It means, "Bless, O God," or "God blesses" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>). Both names imply that the new interlocutor belonged to a family of monotheists. <span class="cmt_word">The Buzite</span>. "Huz" and "Buz" were brothers, the sons of Nahor, Abraham's brother, by Maleah, the daughter of Haran (<a href="/genesis/11-29.htm">Genesis 11:29</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-20.htm">Genesis 22:20, 21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the kindred of Ram.</span> By "Ram" we are probably to understand "Aram," who was the son of Kemuel, a brother of Huz and Buz.

Elihu was well-intentional; and it is perhaps not surprising that he had been shocked by some of Job's expressions.

But it is to be remembered that finally God justifies Job's sayings, while condemning those of his "comforters."
