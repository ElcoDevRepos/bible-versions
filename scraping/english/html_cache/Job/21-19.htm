This idea is seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, where God warns that He visits "the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation." This reflects a cultural understanding of communal and generational responsibility. However, Job challenges this notion, questioning the justice of punishing children for their parents' sins. This tension is also addressed in <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>, where it is stated that "the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father."<p><b>Let God repay the man himself,</b><br>Job argues for direct accountability, suggesting that justice should be immediate and personal. This reflects a desire for a more direct and observable form of divine justice, where the wicked receive their due punishment in their own lifetime. This idea contrasts with the delayed justice that might affect future generations. The call for personal retribution aligns with the principle found in <a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>, which states that individuals should be punished for their own sins.<p><b>so he will know it.</b><br>The emphasis here is on awareness and understanding of divine justice. Job desires that the wicked recognize the consequences of their actions, which would serve as a clear demonstration of God's justice. This awareness is crucial for repentance and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty. The concept of knowing or experiencing God's judgment is echoed in <a href="/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a>, where it is said, "The LORD is known by the judgment He executes." This phrase underscores the importance of personal experience in understanding divine justice and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

The rest of Scripture shows both generational repercussions and individual accountability, but ultimately confirms Job&#8217;s conviction that God will personally repay every person for his own deeds, perfectly and unmistakably.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">God layeth up his iniquity </span>(i.e., the punishment of it) <span class= "bld">for his children, </span>may be the hypothetical reply of the antagonists in the mouth of Job, and the second clause his own retort: "Let him repay it to himself that he may know it."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God layeth up his iniquity for his children</span>.
