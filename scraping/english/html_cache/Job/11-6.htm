In the context of the Book of Job, wisdom is often portrayed as something that belongs to God alone (<a href="/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>). The "secrets of wisdom" imply that there are deeper truths and insights that God can reveal, which are beyond human comprehension. This aligns with the biblical theme that God's thoughts and ways are higher than ours (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p><b>for true wisdom has two sides</b><br>The idea that wisdom has "two sides" can be interpreted as the complexity and depth of divine wisdom. It suggests that wisdom is multifaceted and not easily understood from a single perspective. This duality can be seen in the balance between justice and mercy, or between God's sovereignty and human responsibility. The Book of Proverbs often contrasts wisdom with folly, indicating that understanding requires discernment (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p><b>Know then that God exacts from you less than your iniquity deserves</b><br>This statement reflects the biblical principle of God's mercy. While human sin deserves punishment, God often shows restraint and compassion. This is consistent with the broader biblical narrative of grace, where God does not treat us as our sins deserve (<a href="/psalms/103-10.htm">Psalm 103:10</a>). In the context of Job, it challenges the assumption that suffering is always a direct result of personal sin, suggesting instead that God's dealings with humanity are more merciful than we might expect. This foreshadows the ultimate expression of mercy through Jesus Christ, who bore the punishment for sin on behalf of humanity (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Into that setting comes verse 6.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Zophar&#8217;s claim: hidden wisdom</b><p>&#8220;and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom&#8221;<p>&#8226; Zophar asserts that only God can unveil what we cannot see (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>).<p>&#8226; He assumes Job lacks this heavenly perspective, therefore misunderstands his suffering (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Two-sided wisdom</b><p>&#8220;for true wisdom has two sides&#8221;<p>&#8226; One side: God&#8217;s justice&#8212;He must judge sin (<a href="/psalms/11-7.htm">Psalm 11:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Other side: God&#8217;s mercy&#8212;He restrains full punishment (<a href="/psalms/103-10.htm">Psalm 103:10</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>).<p>Zophar is partly right: divine wisdom is multifaceted. Yet he wrongly thinks the &#8220;other side&#8221; cannot include innocent suffering (<a href="/john/9-1.htm">John 9:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Undeserved mercy</b><p>&#8220;Know then that God exacts from you less than your iniquity deserves.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture affirms that all have sinned (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>); even the righteous need grace (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; God often spares us the full weight of our sin&#8217;s consequences (<a href="/ezra/9-13.htm">Ezra 9:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/145-8.htm">Psalm 145:8</a>).<p>Zophar&#8217;s core principle is sound, but he misapplies it by concluding Job&#8217;s losses must be punishment (<a href="/luke/13-1.htm">Luke 13:1-5</a> shows this error).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lessons for believers</b><p>&#8226; Embrace both justice and mercy in God&#8217;s character; they meet perfectly at the cross (<a href="/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24-26</a>).<p>&#8226; Avoid presuming to read providence in another&#8217;s pain (<a href="/james/4-11.htm">James 4:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; When suffering, remember that even discipline is tempered with compassion (<a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-6, 11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/11-6.htm">Job 11:6</a> teaches that God&#8217;s wisdom is richer than human logic and that His mercy often withholds the full penalty our sins merit. Zophar rightly praises God&#8217;s two-sided wisdom but errs by assuming Job&#8217;s suffering equals divine retribution. The verse calls us to trust God&#8217;s just yet merciful nature, resist hasty judgments, and humbly receive grace that none of us deserves.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">They are double to that which is</span>!--This translation conveys no sense, and is not a translation; see the last Note.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom!</span> In God are "all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hid away" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <a href="/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>). Zophar wishes that he would reveal to Job this wisdom, or a portion of it, as, in that case, all his pride and self-confidence would be confounded and fall away. That they are double to that which is! This phrase is very obscure. Some translate, "For he (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God) is twice as wise as thou;" others, "That it (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> wisdom) is manifold in effectual working;" others, again, "That they (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the treasures of wisdom) are double (or manifold) in substance." Perhaps this last rendering is to be preferred. The treasures of wisdom that are hid away in God have many depths, secret and unexplored; they "lie, as it were, fold over fold, in unexpected complexities, defying the shallow and unscrutinizing gaze" (Professor Stanley Leathes). If they were revealed to Job, they would astonish, confound, silence, him. Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth. "Be sure," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "that God, so far from inflicting on thee a more severe punishment than thou deservest, in reality excuses much of thy guilt, and punishes thee less than is thy due." This is Zophar's conclusion from his general knowledge of God's dealings with man (comp. <a href="/ezra/9-13.htm">Ezra 9:13</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/11-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and disclose</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;yag&#183;ge&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
