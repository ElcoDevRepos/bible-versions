In the context of the Book of Job, reverence refers to Job's fear and respect for God. The friends of Job, particularly Eliphaz in this chapter, suggest that Job's suffering might not be due to his reverence or righteousness. This reflects a common belief in the ancient Near East that suffering was a direct result of personal sin, a view that is challenged throughout the book. The concept of reverence is central to the wisdom literature, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, which states that "the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge."<p><b>that He rebukes you</b><br>Rebuke in the biblical context often implies correction or discipline. In the Old Testament, God&#8217;s rebuke is sometimes seen as a form of divine discipline intended to bring about repentance and restoration, as seen in <a href="/psalms/39-11.htm">Psalm 39:11</a>. The idea of God rebuking someone for their actions is consistent with the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God disciplines His people to guide them back to righteousness. However, in Job's case, the rebuke is questioned, as Job maintains his innocence.<p><b>and enters into judgment against you?</b><br>Judgment here refers to the divine assessment of Job's life and actions. In the ancient world, judgment was often seen as a public declaration of one's standing before God. The friends of Job assume that God&#8217;s judgment is a response to sin, reflecting the retributive justice theology prevalent in their culture. However, the narrative of Job challenges this assumption, suggesting that suffering is not always a direct result of personal sin. This theme is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus addresses the issue of suffering and sin in <a href="/john/9.htm">John 9:1-3</a>, indicating that not all suffering is due to personal wrongdoing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

The implication is sarcastic: &#8220;Surely God wouldn&#8217;t discipline someone just because he&#8217;s reverent&#8212;would He?&#8221; Scripture consistently shows that genuine reverence brings favor, not wrath.<p>&#8226; Job himself was earlier described as &#8220;blameless and upright, fearing God and shunning evil&#8221; (<a href="/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;The LORD&#8217;s delight is in those who fear Him&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/147-11.htm">Psalm 147:11</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>).<p>So Eliphaz&#8217;s premise is flawed from the start. True reverence pleases God; it never provokes Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that He rebukes you</b><p>Rebuke in Scripture is usually loving correction (<a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-6</a>). Eliphaz assumes Job&#8217;s suffering equals divine rebuke for hidden sin, but God later affirms Job&#8217;s integrity (<a href="/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7-8</a>).<p>Key truths:<p>&#8226; God does rebuke sin, yet not all suffering is punitive (<a href="/john/9-1.htm">John 9:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Rebuke aims to restore, not to destroy (<a href="/revelation/3-19.htm">Revelation 3:19</a>).<p>Eliphaz confuses the possibility of discipline with certainty of guilt.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and enters into judgment</b><p>To &#8220;enter into judgment&#8221; pictures God taking someone to court. Eliphaz imagines Job is on trial and losing. But Scripture shows:<p>&#8226; God &#8220;judges the peoples with equity&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/9-8.htm">Psalm 9:8</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, judgment begins with refining, not condemnation (<a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>).<p>Job&#8217;s experience is a mystery of righteous suffering, not a verdict of guilt.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against you?</b><p>Eliphaz paints God as adversary. Yet when God sets His love on a person, He is &#8220;for us&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>). Even under severe testing:<p>&#8226; &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;No weapon formed against you shall prosper&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>).<p>Job will eventually see that God&#8217;s purposes are compassionate (<a href="/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>), not hostile.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/22-4.htm">Job 22:4</a> records Eliphaz&#8217;s faulty accusation: God wouldn&#8217;t punish someone because he&#8217;s reverent&#8212;so Job must be irreverent. Scripture overturns his logic: reverence delights God; rebuke may come but is restorative; divine judgment for the faithful is never adversarial. Eliphaz&#8217;s words expose human misunderstanding, while the broader narrative affirms that God&#8217;s dealings with His servants are rooted in righteousness, wisdom, and steadfast love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Will he reprove thee.</span>--That is, <span class= "ital">Because He standeth in awe of thee.
