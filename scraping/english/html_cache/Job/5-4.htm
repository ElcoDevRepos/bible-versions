In the ancient Near Eastern context, family and lineage were of utmost importance, and the safety of one's children was a primary concern. The idea of being "far from safety" suggests a lack of divine protection, which was often seen as a consequence of the father's sins. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that the sins of the parents can affect their descendants, as seen in <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, where God speaks of visiting "the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation."<p><b>crushed in court</b><br>The imagery of being "crushed in court" indicates a legal setting where justice is not served. In ancient times, courts were places where disputes were settled, but they could also be arenas of corruption and oppression, especially for those without influence or resources. This reflects the biblical concern for justice and the protection of the vulnerable, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>, which calls for defending the oppressed and taking up the cause of the fatherless. The term "crushed" suggests a complete and devastating defeat, highlighting the powerlessness of those who lack divine favor or human advocacy.<p><b>without a defender</b><br>The absence of a defender underscores the plight of the defenseless in a legal or social context. In biblical times, having an advocate or a kinsman-redeemer was crucial for protection and justice. This concept is seen in the role of the "goel" or redeemer in the Book of Ruth, where Boaz acts as Ruth's protector and redeemer. The lack of a defender in this verse symbolizes abandonment and isolation, contrasting with the New Testament portrayal of Jesus Christ as the ultimate advocate and intercessor for believers, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1</a>, where He is described as our advocate with the Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

When a household rejects the fear of the LORD, the refuge He promises in <a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1&#8211;2</a> is forfeited.<p>&#8226;By contrast, &#8220;In the fear of the LORD there is strong confidence, and His children will have a place of refuge&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/14-26.htm">Proverbs 14:26</a>). Eliphaz underscores a sober truth that resonates throughout Scripture: choices made by one generation echo in the next.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>crushed in court</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;they are crushed in court&#8221; (<a href="/job/5-4.htm">Job 5:4</a>b).

The sins of the fathers arc visited upon the children. Eliphaz makes covert allusion to the death of Job's children (<a href="/job/1-19.htm">Job 1:19</a>). Feeling, however, that he is on delicate ground, he goes on into details which in no way fit their case. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (he says) <span class="cmt_word">they are crushed in the gate</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they are oppressed, crushed, by litigations. The house once smitten of God, human beasts of prey enter in; claims are made against the children; lawsuits commenced; all the arts of chicanery set in motion; every effort made to strip them of their last penny. (For the sense here assigned to "the gate," see <a href="/job/29-7.htm">Job 29:7</a> and Job 31:21.) <span class="cmt_word">Neither is there any to deliver them</span>. No one intercedes on their behalf, undertakes their detente in the courts, or makes any effort to avert their ruin.
