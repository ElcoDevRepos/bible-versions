In the context of Job, it underscores the theme of human frailty and the divine power that governs life and death. The idea of God overpowering man is consistent with the biblical narrative of God's ultimate authority, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>, where humanity is reminded of its mortality. Theologically, this speaks to the doctrine of God's providence, where He is in control of all creation. The imagery of overpowering can also be seen in the Psalms, such as <a href="/psalms/90-3.htm">Psalm 90:3</a>, which speaks of God returning man to dust.<p><b>and he passes on</b><br>This phrase indicates the transient nature of human life. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, life was often viewed as fleeting and temporary, a theme echoed throughout the wisdom literature of the Bible, such as <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:20</a>. The phrase "passes on" can be seen as a euphemism for death, highlighting the inevitability of mortality. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that life is a journey with an eventual end, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>, which states that it is appointed for man to die once.<p><b>You change his countenance</b><br>The change in countenance can be understood as the physical transformation that occurs at death. In biblical times, the face was often seen as a reflection of one's inner state, and a change in countenance could signify a change in condition or status. This transformation can also be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual change that occurs at death, where the soul departs from the body. Theologically, this can be connected to the resurrection, where believers are promised a new, glorified body, as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51-52</a>.<p><b>and send him away</b><br>This phrase suggests the finality of death and the separation from the earthly realm. In the historical context of Job, death was often viewed as a journey to Sheol, the abode of the dead, as seen in <a href="/job/7-9.htm">Job 7:9-10</a>. The sending away can also be interpreted as God's sovereign decision over the timing and manner of one's death. This aligns with the biblical understanding that life and death are in God's hands, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>. The concept of being sent away can also be seen as a type of Christ, who was sent away in death but ultimately triumphed over it through His resurrection, offering hope of eternal life to believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.
