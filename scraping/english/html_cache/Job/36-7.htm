In biblical context, the "righteous" are those who live in accordance with God's laws and commandments. This reflects the idea found in <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>, "The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and His ears are attentive to their cry." It underscores God's omnipresence and His intimate involvement in the lives of His people. Historically, this assurance would have been comforting to the Israelites, who often faced external threats and needed reassurance of God's protection.<p><b>but He enthrones them with kings</b><br>This suggests that God elevates the righteous to positions of honor and authority. In the ancient Near Eastern context, being enthroned with kings signifies a place of high status and influence. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the believer's future reign with Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>, "You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth." It also reflects the biblical theme of God exalting the humble, as seen in the lives of Joseph and David, who were raised from lowly positions to places of power.<p><b>and exalts them forever</b><br>The promise of eternal exaltation points to the everlasting reward for the righteous. This aligns with the New Testament teaching of eternal life and glory for believers, as seen in <a href="/2_timothy/2-12.htm">2 Timothy 2:12</a>, "if we endure, we will also reign with Him." The concept of eternal exaltation is rooted in the covenantal promises God made to His people, assuring them of a future hope beyond their present circumstances. This eternal perspective encourages believers to remain steadfast in their faith, knowing that their ultimate reward is secure in God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.
