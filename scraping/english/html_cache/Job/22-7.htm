Water, a vital resource in the arid regions of the Middle East, symbolizes life and sustenance. In biblical times, offering water to travelers or those in need was a common act of kindness and righteousness. The lack of such an act is seen as a moral failing. This accusation against Job by Eliphaz suggests a breach of social and religious duty, reflecting the broader biblical theme of caring for the needy, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/58-10.htm">Isaiah 58:10</a> and <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35</a>, where providing for the thirsty is equated with righteousness.<p><b>and withheld food from the famished</b><br>Withholding food from the hungry is another serious accusation, as feeding the hungry is a fundamental act of charity and justice in biblical teaching. In the context of the Book of Job, this charge is part of Eliphaz's argument that Job's suffering is due to his alleged sins. The cultural expectation was to share one's resources with those in need, as seen in the laws of gleaning in <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>, which allowed the poor to gather leftover crops. This phrase also echoes the broader biblical narrative of God's provision and the call for His people to emulate His generosity, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9</a> and <a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15-16</a>.

Abraham hurried to bring water to his guests (<a href="/genesis/18-4.htm">Genesis 18:4-5</a>). Rebekah&#8217;s willingness to draw water for a stranger and his camels marked her as God&#8217;s chosen bride for Isaac (<a href="/genesis/24-17.htm">Genesis 24:17-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus later elevates the same act: &#8220;And whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones&#8230; he will never lose his reward&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a>).<p>&#8226; Turning away a thirsty person violates the love of neighbor commanded in <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a> and illustrated in the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-33.htm">Luke 10:33-34</a>).<p>&#8226; Eliphaz&#8217;s charge implies a cold indifference that contradicts the character God desires: &#8220;If you extend your soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul, then your light will rise in darkness&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/58-10.htm">Isaiah 58:10</a>).

To give water to the thirsty was regarded in the East as one of the most elementary duties of man to man. The self-justification of the dead in the Egyptian Hades contained the following passage: "I gave my bread to the hungry, <span class="accented">and drink to him that was athirst</span>; I clothed the naked with garments; I sheltered the wanderer" ('Ritual of the Dead,' ch. CXXV. &sect; 38). The same claim appears continually on Egyptian tombs. "All men respected me," we read on one; "I <span class="accented">gave water to the thirsty</span>; I set the wanderer in his path; I took away the oppressor, and put a stop to violence" ('Non-Biblical Systems of Religion,' p. 46). In the proverbs assigned to Solomon, "which the men of Hezekiah copied out" (<a href="/proverbs/25-1.htm">Proverbs 25:1</a>), the duty was declared to be one owed even to enemies (see <a href="/proverbs/25-21.htm">Proverbs 25:21</a>, "If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, <span class="accented">give him water to drink"</span>). Isaiah notices it as praiseworthy in the Temanites (Eliphaz's people), that they "<span class="accented">brought water to him that was thirsty</span> and prevented with their bread him that fled" (<a href="/isaiah/21-14.htm">Isaiah 21:14</a>). Jael is praised for going further than this: He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish" (<a href="/judges/5-25.htm">Judges 5:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry</span>. Later on Job absolutely denies this, as well as many of the other charges. "If I have withheld," he says, "the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; or <span class="accented">have eaten my morsel myself alone</span>, <span class="accented">and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof</span>," then let mine arm fall from my shoulder-blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone" (<a href="/job/31-16.htm">Job 31:16-22</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/22-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You gave</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1511;&#1462;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#353;&#183;qeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8248.htm">Strong's 8248: </a> </span><span class="str2">To quaff, to irrigate, furnish a, potion to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">no</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">water</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1453;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4325.htm">Strong's 4325: </a> </span><span class="str2">Water, juice, urine, semen</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the weary</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1497;&#1461;&#1443;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;y&#234;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5889.htm">Strong's 5889: </a> </span><span class="str2">Faint, weary</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and withheld</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1469;&#1506;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(tim&#183;na&#8216;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4513.htm">Strong's 4513: </a> </span><span class="str2">To debar, from benefit, injury</span><br /><br /><span class="word">food</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1469;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7717;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3899.htm">Strong's 3899: </a> </span><span class="str2">Food, bread, grain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from the famished,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1437;&#1502;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1461;&#1431;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#234;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition &#124;
