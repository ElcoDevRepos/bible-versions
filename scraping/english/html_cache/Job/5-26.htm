In the context of the ancient Near East, longevity was often seen as a sign of divine favor and blessing. The idea of dying "in full vigor" implies maintaining strength and vitality until the end, which contrasts with the common fear of a frail and painful decline. This reflects the biblical theme of God&#8217;s provision and care for the righteous, as seen in <a href="/psalms/92-14.htm">Psalm 92:14</a>, which speaks of the righteous bearing fruit even in old age. Theologically, it underscores the belief in God's sovereignty over life and death.<p><b>like a sheaf of grain gathered in season</b><br>The imagery of a sheaf of grain being gathered "in season" evokes the agricultural cycle familiar to the original audience. Harvest time was a period of joy and fulfillment, representing the culmination of hard work and divine provision. This metaphor suggests that just as grain is harvested at the right time, so too will a person&#8217;s life be completed at the appropriate moment ordained by God. The sheaf of grain can also symbolize the idea of resurrection and new life, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>, where Christ is referred to as the "firstfruits" of those who have fallen asleep. This connection points to the hope of eternal life and the ultimate gathering of believers into God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who endured immense suffering and loss.

The emphasis, however, is on the closing words, "in his season." Eliphaz promises Job that he will reach a good ripe old age, and not die untimely.
