In the ancient Near Eastern context, harpoons were common tools for hunting large sea creatures, yet the text suggests that even these formidable weapons are ineffective against Leviathan. This highlights the creature's invulnerability and power, which can be seen as a metaphor for the uncontrollable forces of nature or evil that only God can subdue. The imagery of harpoons also connects to other biblical passages where God demonstrates His power over the sea and its creatures, such as in <a href="/psalms/104-26.htm">Psalm 104:26</a> and <a href="/isaiah/27.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>, where Leviathan is mentioned as a creature that God will ultimately defeat.<p><b>or his head with fishing spears?</b><br>The mention of fishing spears further emphasizes the futility of human attempts to conquer Leviathan. In the cultural and historical context, fishing spears were used for capturing smaller, manageable fish, not for mythical sea monsters. This contrast underscores the creature's immense size and strength, reinforcing the idea that Leviathan is beyond human control. Theologically, this can be seen as a reminder of God's sovereignty over creation, as only He can tame such a beast. This theme is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/job/38-8.htm">Job 38:8-11</a>, where God questions Job about his ability to control the sea, and in <a href="/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>, where the ultimate defeat of evil is depicted. The imagery of the head also suggests a focus on the creature's intelligence or cunning, further illustrating the challenge it poses to human power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

The skin of the crocodile is penetrable in very few places, and his capture by a single man with a harpoon, though now sometimes practised (Wilkinson, in the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 99), is still a work of danger and difficulty. Or his head with fish-spears? Fish-spears would have small effect on the head of a crocodile, which is bony and covered by a very tough skin. There is a vulnerable place, however, at the point where the head joins the spine, at which the ancient Egyptians, when they ventured to attack the crocodile, were wont to strike (see the author's 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 545). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/41-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Can you fill</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1469;&#1514;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#7791;&#183;mal&#183;l&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4390.htm">Strong's 4390: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fill, be full of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his hide</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#183;r&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5785.htm">Strong's 5785: </a> </span><span class="str2">Skin, hide, leather</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with harpoons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1467;&#1499;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#347;uk&#183;k&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7905.htm">Strong's 7905: </a> </span><span class="str2">A barb, spear</span><br /><br /><span class="word">or his head</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#333;&#183;&#353;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7218.htm">Strong's 7218: </a> </span><span class="str2">The head</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with fishing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1490;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;&#7713;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1709.htm">Strong's 1709: </a> </span><span class="str2">A fish</span><br /><br /><span class="word">spears?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1510;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1510;&#1463;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7779;il&#183;&#7779;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6767.htm">Strong's 6767: </a> </span><span class="str2">A clatter, whirring, a cricket, a harpoon, a cymbal</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/41-7.htm">Job 41:7 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/41-7.htm">Job 41:7 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/41-7.htm">Job 41:7 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/41-7.htm">Job 41:7 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/41-7.htm">Job 41:7 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/41-7.htm">Job 41:7  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/41-7.htm">Job 41:7 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/41-7.htm">Job 41:7 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/41-7.htm">Job 41:7 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/41-7.htm">Job 41:7 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/41-7.htm">OT Poetry: Job 41:7 Can you fill his skin with barbed (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/41-6.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 41:6"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 41:6" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/41-8.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 41:8"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 41:8" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
