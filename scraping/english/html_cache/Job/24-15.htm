The adulterer, in this case, is depicted as someone who deliberately chooses the time of day when visibility is low to engage in immoral acts. This reflects the broader biblical theme of darkness being associated with sin and evil (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>). The act of adultery is condemned throughout Scripture, as seen in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>) and in the teachings of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/5-27.htm">Matthew 5:27-28</a>). The imagery of "watching for twilight" suggests a premeditated intent to sin, highlighting the deceitful nature of the human heart (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>).<p><b>Thinking, &#8216;No eye will see me,&#8217;</b><br>This phrase captures the self-deception and false security of the sinner who believes that their actions are hidden from others and, by extension, from God. It reflects the folly of thinking that one can escape divine justice, a theme echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/psalms/94-7.htm">Psalm 94:7</a>, where the wicked say, "The LORD does not see." This belief in anonymity is a common human fallacy, as God is omniscient and sees all actions (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>). The idea that sin can be hidden is a recurring theme in the Bible, often leading to eventual exposure and judgment (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>).<p><b>he covers his face.</b><br>Covering the face is symbolic of attempting to hide one's identity and actions. In biblical times, covering the face could also signify shame or guilt (<a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7-8</a>). This act of covering is futile in the eyes of God, who sees beyond physical appearances and knows the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). The imagery here can also be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual blindness that sin causes, preventing individuals from seeing the truth and light of God (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>). The attempt to hide from God is reminiscent of Adam and Eve's actions in the Garden of Eden, where they tried to hide from God after sinning (<a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure of the Book of Job, a man known for his righteousness and suffering.

While the adulterer believes night hides him, Scripture insists God sees every motive and act. The verse calls readers to reject the false security of darkness, live transparently before the Lord, and embrace His light that frees from hidden sin (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me</span>. There is an analogy between moral and physical light, and between moral and physical darkness. The class of men here spoken of (vers. 14-16), who have rebelled against moral light (ver. 13), and refused its ways, and rejected its paths, are no great lovers of physical light. Their deeds of darkness are only suited to be done in the dark, and they wait for the evening twilight or the dusk of dawn to engage in them (comp. <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-21</a>, "And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God." See also <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>; <a href="/john/12-35.htm">John 12:35</a>; <a href="/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8-14</a>, etc.). And he disguiseth his face. As a further precaution against discovery, the adulterer disguiseth, or covereth up, his face. The same is often done by thieves and murderers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/24-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The eye</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
