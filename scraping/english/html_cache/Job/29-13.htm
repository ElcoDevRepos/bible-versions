The blessing from a dying man signifies the deep gratitude and appreciation for Job's kindness and assistance. In ancient Near Eastern culture, blessings were considered powerful and significant, often seen as a form of divine favor. Job's actions towards the dying reflect the biblical principle of caring for the vulnerable, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>, which states that kindness to the poor is like lending to the Lord. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>, where caring for the least of these is equated with serving Christ Himself.<p><b>and I made the widow&#8217;s heart sing for joy</b><br>Widows in the ancient world were often left without support or protection, making them one of the most vulnerable groups in society. Job's care for widows aligns with the biblical mandate to protect and provide for them, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a> and <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>. By bringing joy to a widow's heart, Job exemplifies the compassionate character that God desires from His people. This act of kindness can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described in <a href="/luke/7-11.htm">Luke 7:11-15</a> as having compassion on a widow by raising her son from the dead, thus restoring her joy and security. Job's actions reflect the heart of God, who is described in <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a> as a "father to the fatherless, a defender of widows."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and integrity, known for his patience and endurance through suffering.

These "perishing" ones Job often saved, and they "blessed" him. <span class="cmt_word">And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy</span>. How cold are the words of Ameni, "No widow have I oppressed," compared with these! Job was not content with mere abstinence from evil, mere negative virtue.
