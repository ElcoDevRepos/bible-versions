In the context of the Book of Job, Job is questioning why God does not set specific times for judgment, especially when the wicked seem to prosper. This reflects a common theme in wisdom literature, where the righteous suffer while the wicked thrive, as seen in Psalms and Ecclesiastes. Theologically, this question challenges the understanding of divine justice and sovereignty. The term "Almighty" emphasizes God's omnipotence, suggesting that He has the power to set such times but chooses not to reveal them. This can be connected to the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of the unknown timing of the final judgment (<a href="/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36</a>).<p><b>Why may those who know Him never see His days?</b><br>Here, "those who know Him" refers to the righteous or those in a covenant relationship with God. Job is lamenting that even those who are faithful do not witness God's intervention or judgment in their lifetimes. This reflects a deep yearning for divine justice and vindication. The phrase "His days" can be interpreted as the times when God acts decisively in history, often associated with judgment or deliverance. This echoes the prophetic literature, where "the day of the Lord" is a time of both judgment and salvation (<a href="/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a>, <a href="/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a>). Theologically, this points to the eschatological hope found in the New Testament, where believers await the return of Christ and the final establishment of God's kingdom (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and questions the justice of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_almighty.htm">The Almighty (God)</a></b><br>Referred to as the ultimate judge and sovereign ruler, whose timing and purposes are often beyond human understanding.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_know_him.htm">Those who know Him</a></b><br>This phrase refers to the righteous or those who have a relationship with God, who are perplexed by the apparent delay in divine justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_timing.htm">Understanding Divine Timing</a></b><br>God's timing for judgment and justice is perfect, even when it seems delayed from a human perspective.

Though hidden from human view, it is certain and perfectly timed. Trusting that truth keeps us from despair when judgment seems postponed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why may those who know Him never see His days?</b><p>&#8220;Why may those who know Him never see His days?&#8221; (<a href="/job/24-1.htm">Job 24:1</a>b)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Those who know Him&#8221; are believers who long for visible proof of God&#8217;s justice.

Our assurance rests on His character, not on immediate sight. The eventual unveiling of His justice is guaranteed, whether in our lifetime or beyond.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/24-1.htm">Job 24:1</a> captures the aching question of every believer who sees injustice linger: Why doesn&#8217;t God set a visible schedule for judgment, and why must the faithful often miss the day when He finally acts? Scripture answers both concerns by affirming that God has indeed fixed a time for judgment, even if He conceals it for now, and by inviting us to live in confident trust that His justice will arrive exactly when He has ordained. Waiting is not evidence of God&#8217;s absence but of His patience and sovereign timing, and those who know Him can rest assured that His promised day will surely come.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XXIV.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Why, seeing times are not hidden.</span>--Job, in this chapter, gives utterance to this perplexity, as it arises, not from his own case only, but from a survey of God's dealings with the world generally. "Why is it," he asks, "since times and events are not hidden from the Almighty, that they who know Him--that is, believe in and love Him--do not see His days?"--that is, His days of retribution and judgment. Even those who love and serve God are as perplexed about His principles of government as those who know Him not. It is to be observed that the position of the second negative in the Authorised Version of this verse renders it highly ambiguous to the majority of readers. This ambiguity would entirely disappear if we read <span class= "ital">see not </span>instead of "not see."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why, seeing times are not hidden from the almighty</span>. By "times" seem to be meant God's special periods of exhibiting himself in action as the moral Governor of the world, vindicating the righteous, and taking vengeance upon sinners. Such "times" are frequently spoken of in the prophetical Scriptures as "days of the Lord" (see <a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/3-18.htm">Isaiah 3:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/4-1.htm">Isaiah 4:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6, 9</a>; <a href="/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1, 11</a>; <a href="/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7, 14</a>, etc.). They are, of course, "not hidden" from him, seeing that it is he who determines on them beforehand, and, when their fixed date is come, makes them special "days," or "times," different from all others. <span class="cmt_word">Do they who know him not see his days?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> why are even they, who know and serve God, kept in the dark as to these "times," so that they do not foresee them or know when they are coming?
