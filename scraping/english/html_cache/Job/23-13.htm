The concept of God's unchangeability is rooted in passages like <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>, "For I the Lord do not change," and <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>, which speaks of God as having "no variation or shadow due to change." This attribute assures believers of God's consistent nature and faithfulness. In the context of Job, it underscores the idea that God's purposes and character remain constant despite human suffering and circumstances.<p><b>and who can oppose Him?</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights God's supreme authority and sovereignty. It echoes sentiments found in <a href="/isaiah/14-27.htm">Isaiah 14:27</a>, "For the Lord of hosts has purposed, and who will annul it?" and <a href="/romans/9-19.htm">Romans 9:19-21</a>, where Paul discusses God's sovereign will. The phrase suggests that no human or spiritual force can thwart God's plans. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, where gods were often seen as capricious, this statement affirms the biblical view of a God whose will is irresistible and whose plans are unassailable.<p><b>He does what He desires.</b><br>This phrase speaks to the divine will and purpose of God, aligning with scriptures like <a href="/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>, "Our God is in the heavens; He does all that He pleases." It reflects the belief that God's actions are not arbitrary but are in accordance with His perfect wisdom and purpose. Theologically, this ties into the doctrine of divine providence, where God is actively involved in the world, orchestrating events according to His will. This assurance is crucial for believers, as it provides confidence that God's plans are ultimately for good, even when they are beyond human understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

The happier tone of thought which extends from ver. 6 to ver. 12 grows out of a sanguine hope on Job's part that God will bring him before his tribunal, and judge his cause according to righteousness. Now he bethinks himself that hitherto God, notwithstanding his prayers, has refused to summon him to his judgment-seat, and begins to fear that there is no likelihood of his changing. "He is One," or "in one." With him is "no variableness, neither shadow of turning" (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). How is it likely that he will act in the future otherwise than he has acts! in the past? <span class="cmt_word">What his soul desireth, even that he doeth</span>. A somewhat harsh way of saying that God doeth that which seemeth him best - and which, therefore, is best.
