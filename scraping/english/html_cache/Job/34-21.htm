In the context of the Book of Job, this reflects the belief that God is aware of Job's suffering and the righteousness of his life. The idea of God's watchful eyes is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/5-21.htm">Proverbs 5:21</a>, which states, "For a man's ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and He ponders all his paths." This suggests a divine oversight that is both protective and judgmental. Theologically, it underscores the belief in a personal God who is intimately involved in the lives of individuals, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>and He sees his every step</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's detailed knowledge of human actions, suggesting that nothing is hidden from Him. It aligns with <a href="/psalms/139-3.htm">Psalm 139:3</a>, "You search out my path and my lying down and are acquainted with all my ways." This comprehensive awareness implies accountability, as God not only observes but also evaluates human behavior. Historically, this reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of deities as beings who are deeply involved in human affairs. In a broader biblical context, it points to the moral and ethical dimensions of life, where every action is subject to divine scrutiny. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who in the New Testament is described as the one who knows the hearts of men (<a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>), further affirming the continuity of God's intimate knowledge and concern for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering a perspective on God's justice and sovereignty.
