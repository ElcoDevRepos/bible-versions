In the biblical context, the moon is often seen as a lesser light compared to the sun (<a href="/genesis/1-16.htm">Genesis 1:16</a>). The idea that the moon does not shine on its own but reflects the sun's light can be seen as a metaphor for human righteousness, which is not inherent but derived from God. The moon's inability to shine on its own emphasizes the limitations of creation in comparison to the Creator's glory and perfection.<p><b>and the stars are not pure in His sight</b><br>Stars, often associated with guidance and navigation, were considered symbols of purity and order in the ancient world. In Job's time, stars were also seen as part of the divine order established by God (<a href="/genesis/1-16.htm">Genesis 1:16</a>, <a href="/psalms/8-3.htm">Psalm 8:3</a>). The assertion that stars are not pure in God's sight underscores the absolute holiness and perfection of God, against which even the most magnificent parts of creation fall short. This reflects the biblical theme of God's transcendence and the inherent imperfection of creation due to the fall (<a href="/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20-22</a>). The imagery of stars being impure can also be connected to the prophetic vision of a new creation where all things are made pure and new (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bildad_the_shuhite.htm">Bildad the Shuhite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.
