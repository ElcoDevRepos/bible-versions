The immediacy of the events suggests a supernatural orchestration, aligning with the narrative's portrayal of Satan's challenge to Job's faithfulness. This relentless sequence underscores the theme of suffering and tests of faith.<p><b>another messenger came and reported</b><br>The arrival of another messenger highlights the continuation of Job's trials. Messengers in ancient times were crucial for communication, often traveling long distances to deliver news. The repeated arrival of messengers in this chapter serves to heighten the tension and drama of the narrative, illustrating the totality of Job's losses.<p><b>The fire of God fell from heaven</b><br>This phrase refers to a destructive event, likely a lightning storm, perceived as divine judgment. In the ancient Near East, natural disasters were often attributed to the actions of deities. The term "fire of God" suggests a powerful, uncontrollable force, reminiscent of other biblical instances where fire signifies divine presence or judgment, such as in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>) or Elijah's confrontation with the prophets of Baal (<a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>).<p><b>It burned and consumed the sheep and the servants</b><br>The destruction of the sheep and servants represents a significant economic and personal loss for Job. Sheep were a primary source of wealth and sustenance, and the loss of servants further compounds the tragedy. This devastation reflects the comprehensive nature of Job's suffering, affecting both his livelihood and his household.<p><b>and I alone have escaped to tell you!</b><br>The survival of a single messenger serves a narrative purpose, ensuring that Job receives the full account of his losses. This pattern of one survivor is repeated in the subsequent calamities, emphasizing the completeness of the destruction while allowing Job to be informed of each disaster. The phrase also highlights the isolation Job experiences in his suffering, as he is left to grapple with the magnitude of his losses.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

This stacking of sorrow mirrors <a href="/job/1-17.htm">Job 1:17</a>, where yet another report follows &#8220;while he was still speaking.&#8221;<p>- The scene illustrates how trials can arrive back-to-back, leaving no breathing room&#8212;much like the rapid blows in <a href="/genesis/37-32.htm">Genesis 37:32-34</a> when Jacob hears of Joseph&#8217;s &#8220;death,&#8221; or the swift judgments in <a href="/2_samuel/13-30.htm">2 Samuel 13:30</a>.<p>- God&#8217;s Word shows that even in overlapping crises, He remains sovereign (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>), and His permitting hand&#8212;shown earlier in <a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>&#8212;sets the controlled boundaries of every test.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>another messenger came and reported</b><p>- Multiple servants deliver identical-sounding news: total loss. Each new voice confirms the scale of devastation, eliminating any thought that the first message was exaggerated.<p>- The repetition stresses God&#8217;s allowance of Satan&#8217;s assault (<a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6-12</a>) while highlighting Job&#8217;s complete lack of human control.<p>- Similar messengers of doom appear in <a href="/1_samuel/4-17.htm">1 Samuel 4:17</a> (loss in battle) and <a href="/jeremiah/51-31.htm">Jeremiah 51:31</a> (Babylon&#8217;s fall), reinforcing the biblical pattern that judgment reports often arrive via eyewitness carriers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;The fire of God fell from heaven.&#8221;</b><p>- The servant identifies the destructive force as divine fire, likely a massive lightning storm. wording mirrors Old Testament usage where extraordinary lightning is viewed as God&#8217;s fire (<a href="/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-48.htm">Psalm 78:48-49</a>).<p>- Biblically, literal heavenly fire consumes Elijah&#8217;s sacrifice (<a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>) and falls on hostile captains (<a href="/2_kings/1-10.htm">2 Kings 1:10</a>). <a href="/revelation/20-9.htm">Revelation 20:9</a> shows a future parallel.<p>- Though the servant attributes it directly to God, <a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a> clarifies that Satan wielded the event by permission. The wording still reminds us that all creation&#8217;s powers ultimately answer to the Creator (<a href="/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It burned and consumed the sheep and the servants</b><p>- The catastrophe is total: every animal and attendant is incinerated. For a man of Job&#8217;s era, sheep were both wealth and livelihood (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>; 30:43). Their loss means instant financial ruin.<p>- Human casualties deepen the tragedy. Scripture counts each life precious (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>), so the verse is not mere economic loss but a heartbreaking human toll.<p>- The enemy&#8217;s intent to &#8220;steal and kill and destroy&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>) is on full display, yet God&#8217;s restraining line still stands&#8212;Job himself remains untouched at this point (<a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>b).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I alone have escaped to tell you!</b><p>- One spared witness ensures Job receives accurate, firsthand testimony. God lets a remnant survive each calamity (<a href="/genesis/45-7.htm">Genesis 45:7</a>; <a href="/amos/4-11.htm">Amos 4:11</a>) to confirm His justice and set the stage for faith.<p>- The solitary survivor heightens Job&#8217;s isolation&#8212;no shared grief with fellow servants, only a stark report. Yet it also provides an opportunity for faithful response, anticipating <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>: &#8220;faith comes by hearing.&#8221;<p>- The messenger&#8217;s escape foreshadows Job&#8217;s own preservation. The same God who limits Satan&#8217;s reach here will ultimately vindicate and restore (<a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/1-16.htm">Job 1:16</a> records the second in a rapid-fire series of disasters allowed by God yet carried out by Satan. A lightning-like &#8220;fire of God&#8221; wipes out all of Job&#8217;s sheep and their caretakers, leaving a lone survivor to report the devastation. The verse teaches:<p>&#8226; Trials can arrive in relentless succession, yet remain under God&#8217;s sovereign oversight.<p>&#8226; Natural forces serve divine purposes; even when an enemy wields them, ultimate authority rests with the Lord.<p>&#8226; Earthly wealth and human life are fragile, pressing us to trust the One who controls storm and flame alike.<p>&#8226; God always preserves a witness and a remnant, paving the way for faith, endurance, and eventual restoration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">The fire of God.</span>--Whether or not we understand this phrase as in the margin, it can hardly mean anything else than lightning.

And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.">2Kings 1:10-14</a>.) It is characteristic of the Old Testament poetry to see in the convulsions of nature the immediate action of the Most High; but perhaps it is intended throughout Job that we should see more than this, as the book undoubtedly assumes to be the record of a Divine revelation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While he was yet speaking</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he</span> <span class="accented">yet speaking</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.

This Satan, under permission, might wield, as being "the prince of the power of the air" (<a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>): but there is, no doubt, something very extraordinary in a storm extending over the pastures occupied by nine thousand sheep, and destroying the whole of them (Cook) Still, it cannot be said that such a storm is impossible; and perhaps the damage done was not greater than that which followed on the seventh Egyptian plague (see <a href="/exodus/9-18.htm">Exodus 9:18-26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And hath burned up the sheep, and the servants</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the young men</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the shepherds who were in attendance upon the sheep. <span class="cmt_word">And consumed them</span>; literally, <span class="accented">devoured them.</span> Fire is often said to "devour" what it destroys. "The Egyptians," says Herodotus, "believe fire to be a live animal, which eats whatever it can seize, and then, glutted with the food, dies with the matter which it feeds upon" (Herod., 3:16). <span class="cmt_word">And I only am escaped alone to tell thee</span> (see the comment on ver. 15). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/1-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">While he</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2088.htm">Strong's 2088: </a> </span><span class="str2">This, that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was still</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;
