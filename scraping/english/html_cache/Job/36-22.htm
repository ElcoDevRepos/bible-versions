In the context of the Book of Job, this statement is part of Elihu's speech, where he seeks to highlight God's majesty and authority. The term "exalted" suggests a position of high status and reverence, aligning with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over creation (<a href="/psalms/97-9.htm">Psalm 97:9</a>). The power of God is evident throughout the Bible, from the creation narrative in Genesis to the miracles performed by Jesus in the New Testament. This power is not just physical but also moral and spiritual, demonstrating God's ability to govern the universe with justice and wisdom. The phrase invites readers to recognize and revere God's omnipotence, which is a central tenet of faith.<p><b>Who is a teacher like Him?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores God's unparalleled wisdom and ability to instruct. In the cultural and historical context of the ancient Near East, teachers were highly respected figures, often associated with wisdom and understanding. By comparing God to a teacher, the text elevates His role as the ultimate source of knowledge and guidance. This is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13-14</a>, which speak of God's wisdom as beyond human comprehension. The phrase also foreshadows the teaching ministry of Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as "Rabbi" or "Teacher" in the Gospels (<a href="/john/13-13.htm">John 13:13</a>). Jesus' teachings, parables, and actions reveal divine truths and provide a model for living according to God's will. This connection highlights the continuity of God's teaching role throughout the Bible, from the Old Testament to the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

He dilates on the power and majesty of God, and appears to be speaking in contemplation of some magnificent natural phenomenon--as the tempest, or hurricane, or whirlwind--out of which the Lord ultimately spake (<a href="/job/38-1.htm" title="Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,">Job 38:1</a>). It is probable that this storm was beginning to gather, and that it suggested the glorious imagery of Elihu's speech. The points are that (1) God is the source of greatness; (2) that there is no teacher like Him (<a href="/job/36-22.htm" title="Behold, God exalts by his power: who teaches like him?">Job 36:22</a>); (3) that He is absolute as well as almighty (<a href="/job/36-23.htm" title="Who has enjoined him his way? or who can say, You have worked iniquity?">Job 36:23</a>); (4) that He is unsearchable and eternal (<a href="/job/36-26.htm" title="Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.">Job 36:26</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, God exalteth by his power</span>; rather, <span class="accented">behold</span>, <span class="accented">God doeth loftily in his power</span> (see the Revised Version).
