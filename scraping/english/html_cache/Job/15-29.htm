In the context of the Book of Job, it is part of Eliphaz's speech, where he argues that the wicked will ultimately face ruin. This aligns with the biblical theme that true riches are spiritual rather than material (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). The idea that wealth is fleeting is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/23-5.htm">Proverbs 23:5</a>, which warns that riches can "fly away like an eagle."<p><b>his wealth will not endure.</b><br>The impermanence of wealth is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing that earthly treasures are not reliable. This is consistent with the teachings found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:10-15</a>, where the Preacher notes that wealth can be lost through misfortune or death. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the ultimate judgment and the futility of relying on material possessions for security, as seen in the parable of the rich fool in <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>.<p><b>His possessions will not overspread the land.</b><br>This suggests that the wicked man's influence and legacy will not last. In ancient times, land ownership was a sign of wealth and power, and the inability to expand one's territory was seen as a failure. This can be contrasted with God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14-17</a>, where his descendants are promised land as a sign of blessing. The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate inheritance of the righteous, as described in <a href="/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>, where the meek are promised the earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

Eliphaz is using that reality&#8212;though wrongly applying it to Job&#8212;to assert a broader principle: wealth never guarantees God&#8217;s favor or permanent security.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His wealth will not endure</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; his wealth will not endure &#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/job/15-29.htm">Job 15:29</a>b)<p>&#8226; Endurance speaks to longevity.

Loss of land meant loss of influence and legacy.<p>&#8226; God warned Israel that disobedience would result in &#8220;a people you do not know will eat the produce of your land&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-33.htm">Deuteronomy 28:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Solomon observed the same vulnerability: &#8220;I hated all the fruit of my labor&#8230; because I must leave it to the man who will come after me&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Eliphaz therefore underscores that, when God judges, even the outward symbols of success&#8212;vast estates, booming enterprises&#8212;can evaporate.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/15-29.htm">Job 15:29</a> affirms a timeless biblical reality: wealth apart from reverence for God is fragile.
