The process of crushing olives to extract oil was labor-intensive and typically done within the confines of a community or estate, often in a communal press. This phrase highlights the labor of the oppressed, who work hard to produce valuable goods. The imagery of crushing olives within walls suggests a sense of confinement and exploitation, as the workers are enclosed and controlled by those in power. This reflects the broader theme in Job of the righteous suffering while the wicked prosper, as seen in <a href="/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7-13</a>, where the wicked live in ease and abundance.<p><b>they tread the winepresses,</b><br>Treading the winepress was another laborious task, involving the crushing of grapes to produce wine, a significant product in biblical times for both daily consumption and religious ceremonies. The act of treading the winepress is often associated with joy and celebration, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/16-10.htm">Isaiah 16:10</a>, where the absence of treading signifies desolation. However, in this context, it underscores the irony and injustice faced by the laborers who perform this joyful task yet do not partake in its fruits. The winepress is also a symbol of judgment in scripture, as in <a href="/revelation/14-19.htm">Revelation 14:19-20</a>, where it represents God's wrath being poured out.<p><b>but go thirsty.</b><br>This phrase poignantly captures the injustice and irony of the situation. Despite their hard work in producing oil and wine, the laborers themselves are deprived of the basic necessities of life, such as water. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the righteous suffering unjustly, a central issue in the Book of Job. The thirst of the laborers can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual longing and deprivation, echoing the cries of the psalmist in <a href="/psalms/42-2.htm">Psalm 42:2</a>, "My soul thirsts for God, for the living God." This thirst contrasts with the abundance enjoyed by the wicked, highlighting the moral and spiritual inversion that Job laments throughout the book.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and patience who endures immense suffering and questions the justice of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oppressed_workers.htm">The Oppressed Workers</a></b><br>The individuals described in this verse who labor intensively but do not benefit from their work, symbolizing the broader theme of injustice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/olive_presses_and_winepresses.htm">Olive Presses and Winepresses</a></b><br>These are places of labor where olives and grapes are processed, representing the agricultural economy of the time and the hard work of the laborers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_landowners/employers.htm">The Landowners/Employers</a></b><br>Implied figures who benefit from the labor of the workers but do not provide for their needs, highlighting the social injustice present in the account.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_setting_of_job.htm">The Setting of Job</a></b><br>The land of Uz, a place of ancient wisdom and suffering, where Job's account unfolds, providing a backdrop for discussions on justice and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/injustice_in_labor.htm">Injustice in Labor</a></b><br>The verse highlights the reality of economic injustice, where workers do not receive the fruits of their labor.

Here Job pictures laborers forced to press olives inside the estate walls owned by the wealthy. The image highlights:<p>&#8226; Coercion and confinement: The phrase &#8220;within their walls&#8221; paints a scene of the poor working behind someone else&#8217;s fortifications. Like <a href="/exodus/1-13.htm">Exodus 1:13-14</a>, where Israel labored under harsh bondage, these workers are trapped by unjust power structures.<p>&#8226; Valuable product, unpaid hands: Olives become oil&#8212;essential for cooking, light, and worship (<a href="/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20</a>). Yet the very people producing the oil gain none of its benefit, echoing <a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14-15</a>, which forbids withholding wages from hired servants.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s witness: <a href="/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a> assures, &#8220;Because of the devastation of the needy and the groaning of the poor, I will now arise.&#8221; Job&#8217;s lament trusts that the Lord sees and will act, even when justice feels delayed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Treading the winepresses</b><p>&#8220;They tread the winepresses&#8221; (<a href="/job/24-11.htm">Job 24:11</a>b). The picture shifts from olives to grapes, but the storyline remains unchanged:<p>&#8226; Back-breaking effort: Treading grapes was heavy, repetitive work (<a href="/isaiah/63-2.htm">Isaiah 63:2-3</a>). Job stresses that the powerless exert themselves to create abundance for others.<p>&#8226; Celebration without the celebrants: Wine symbolizes joy and festivity (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>; <a href="/john/2-9.htm">John 2:9-10</a>), yet the laborers never taste it. <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:11</a> observes, &#8220;When good things increase, those who consume them increase.&#8221; Job mourns that the increase bypasses those who need it most.<p>&#8226; Wider indictment: <a href="/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11</a> warns the oppressor, &#8220;You trample on the poor and exact grain taxes from them; though you have built houses of dressed stone, you will not live in them.&#8221; Job&#8217;s example mirrors that prophetic charge: the rich profit; the poor remain empty-handed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But go thirsty</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;but go thirsty&#8221; (<a href="/job/24-11.htm">Job 24:11</a>c). The final clause delivers the sting:<p>&#8226; Stark irony: The individuals producing oil and wine&#8212;liquids that nourish and delight&#8212;lack even plain water. This drama of emptiness recalls <a href="/haggai/1-6.htm">Haggai 1:6</a>, &#8220;You eat but never have enough&#8230; you drink but never have your fill.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Systemic injustice: <a href="/proverbs/13-23.htm">Proverbs 13:23</a> notes, &#8220;Abundant food is in the fallow ground of the poor, but it is swept away by injustice.&#8221; Job&#8217;s cry underscores a recurring biblical theme: exploitation flips God&#8217;s intended order of provision.<p>&#8226; Divine reckoning: Though Job wrestles with the delay of judgment (<a href="/job/24-1.htm">Job 24:1</a>), Scripture assures eventual reversal. <a href="/james/5-4.htm">James 5:4</a> echoes the scene: &#8220;The wages you failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying out against you&#8230; The cries&#8230; have reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/24-11.htm">Job 24:11</a> exposes the bitter contradiction of oppressed laborers who create prosperity yet remain deprived. By spotlighting olive presses, winepresses, and thirst, Job testifies that God sees every hidden injustice.
