This does not imply sinlessness but rather a sincere devotion to God. The Hebrew word for "blameless" (tam) suggests completeness or wholeness in character. Job's uprightness is a model of ethical behavior, aligning with <a href="/proverbs/11-5.htm">Proverbs 11:5</a>.<p><b>fearing God and shunning evil.</b><br>"Fearing God" denotes a deep reverence and respect for the Almighty, a central theme in wisdom literature (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). Job's fear of God is demonstrated through his actions, as he actively avoids evil. This fear is not terror but a recognition of God's holiness and justice. Job's life exemplifies the principle found in <a href="/proverbs/8-13.htm">Proverbs 8:13</a>, where the fear of the Lord is to hate evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A central figure in the Book of Job, described as "blameless and upright," who fears God and shuns evil.

The historical books are generally united each to each by the <span class="accented">you</span> connective. In the land of Us. Uz, or Huz (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e5;</span>), seems to have been originally, like Judah, Moab, Ammon, Edom, etc., the name of a man. It was borne by a son of Nahor, the brother of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22-21.htm">Genesis 22:21</a>), and again by a son of Dishan, the son of Seir the Horite (<a href="/genesis/36-28.htm">Genesis 36:28</a>). Some regard it as also a personal name in <a href="/genesis/10-23.htm">Genesis 10:23</a>. But from this use it passed to the descendants of one or more of these patriarchs, and from them to the country or countries which they inhabited. The "land of Uz" is spoken of, not only in this passage, but also in <a href="/jeremiah/25-20.htm">Jeremiah 25:20</a> and <a href="/lamentations/4-21.htm">Lamentations 4:21</a>. These last-cited places seem to show that Jeremiah's "land of Uz" was in or near Edom, and therefore south of Palestine; but as Uzzites, like so many nations of these ports, were migratory, we need not be surprised if the name Uz was, at different times, attached to various localities. Arabian tradition regards the region of the Hauran, north-east of Palestine, as Job's country. The other geographical names in the Book of Job point to a more eastern location, one not far remote from the southern Euphrates, and the adjacent parts of Arabia Sheba, Dedan, Teman, Buz, Shuah, and Chesed (Casdim) all point to this locality. On the other hand, there is a passage in the inscriptions of Asshur-banipal (circ. <span class="date">B.C. 650-625</span>) which, associating together the names of Huz and Buz (Khazu and Bazu), appears to place them both in Central Arabia, not far from the Jebel Shnmmar ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 470). My own conclusion would be that, while the name "land of Uz" designated at various periods various localities, Job's "land of Uz" lay a little west of the Lower Euphrates, on the borders of Chaldea and Arabia. <span class="cmt_word">Whose name was Job</span>. In the Hebrew the name is "Iyyob," whence the "Eyoub" of the Arabs and the "Hiob" of the Germans. It is quite a distinct name from that of the third son of Issachar (<a href="/genesis/46-18.htm">Genesis 46:18</a>), which is properly expressed by "Job," being <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>. <span class="accented">Iyyob is</span> supposed to be derived from <span class="accented">aib</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;</span>), "to be hostile," and to mean "cruelly or hostilely treated," in which ease we must suppose it to have been first given to the patriarch in his later life, and to have superseded some other, as "Peter" superseded "Simon," and "Paul" superseded "Saul." According to a Jewish tradition, adopted by some of the Christian Fathers, Job's original name was "Jobab," and under this name he reigned as King of Edom (<a href="/genesis/36-33.htm">Genesis 36:33</a>). But this kingship is scarcely compatible with the view given of him in the Book of Job. The supposed connection of the name of Juba with that of Job is very doubtful. <span class="cmt_word">And that man was perfect</span><span class="accented">. Tam</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>), the word translated "perfect," seems to mean "complete, entire, not wanting in any respect," It corresponds to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and the Latin <span class="accented">integer</span> (comp. Horace, 'Od.,' 1:22. 1, "Integer vitro, scelerisque purus'). It does not mean" absolutely sinless," which Job was not (comp. <a href="/job/9-20.htm">Job 9:20</a>; <a href="/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4</a>). And upright. This is the exact meaning of <span class="accented">yashar</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>). "The Book of Jasher" was "the Book of the Upright" (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="/2_samuel/1-18.htm">2 Samuel 1:18</a>). One that feared God, and eschewed evil; literally, <span class="accented">fearing God and departing from evil</span>. The same testimony is given of Job by God himself in ver. 8, and again in <a href="/job/2-3.htm">Job 2:3</a> (comp. also <a href="/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14, 20</a>). We must suppose Job to have reached as near perfection as was possible tot man at the time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/1-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">There once was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1469;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;re&#7779;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
