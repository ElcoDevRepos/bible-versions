In biblical context, "darkness" often symbolizes chaos, evil, or divine judgment (e.g., <a href="/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-23</a>, where darkness is a plague upon Egypt). Theologically, it reflects the condition of those who live in opposition to God's will, as seen in <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>, where people loved darkness rather than light. The imagery of darkness also connects to the spiritual blindness and separation from God that sin causes.<p><b>the flame will wither his shoots,</b><br>The "flame" here symbolizes destruction and purification, often associated with God's judgment (<a href="/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15-16</a>). The "shoots" represent the offspring or the works of a person, indicating that the consequences of one's actions will be consumed by divine fire. This imagery is reminiscent of <a href="/john/15-6.htm">John 15:6</a>, where branches that do not remain in Christ are thrown away and burned. The agricultural metaphor underscores the futility of efforts that are not rooted in righteousness.<p><b>and the breath of God&#8217;s mouth will carry him away.</b><br>The "breath of God&#8217;s mouth" signifies the power and authority of God's word, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where God breathes life into man, and in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>, where the Lord will overthrow the lawless one with the breath of His mouth. This phrase emphasizes the irresistible force of God's will and judgment. It also connects to the concept of divine sovereignty, where God's spoken word is sufficient to enact His purposes, reflecting the creative and destructive power of His command.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him but ends up accusing him of wrongdoing.
