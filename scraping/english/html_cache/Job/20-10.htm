In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, wealth and social status were often inherited, and the sons of a wealthy man would typically continue in prosperity. However, this passage indicates that the sons of the wicked will be reduced to seeking favor from those they once looked down upon. This reflects the biblical principle that God humbles the proud and exalts the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). The idea of seeking favor implies a dependency and a need for mercy, which is a stark contrast to their previous position of power.<p><b>for his own hands must return his wealth</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the concept of divine justice. The wicked man's wealth, which was likely accumulated through unjust means, must be returned. This aligns with the biblical theme of restitution, as seen in the laws given to Israel (<a href="/exodus/22.htm">Exodus 22:1-4</a>). The phrase "his own hands" suggests personal responsibility and accountability, emphasizing that the consequences of one's actions are inescapable. This can be seen as a type of prophetic warning, illustrating the ultimate futility of relying on material wealth rather than on God. The idea of returning wealth also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's justice and the eventual restoration of righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zophar_the_naamathite.htm">Zophar the Naamathite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.
