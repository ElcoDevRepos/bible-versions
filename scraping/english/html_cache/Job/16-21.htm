In the context of the Book of Job, Job is in the midst of intense suffering and is seeking an advocate who can present his case before God. This longing for a mediator foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The cultural context of the time often involved legal disputes being settled by a mediator, which Job is yearning for in his spiritual struggle.<p><b>as he pleads with his neighbor!</b><br>Here, Job is expressing a wish for the same level of direct and personal communication with God as one might have with a fellow human. In ancient Near Eastern culture, disputes were often resolved through direct dialogue and negotiation, emphasizing the relational aspect of justice. This phrase highlights Job's feeling of isolation and his desire for a personal relationship with God, akin to the interpersonal relationships he understands. It also points to the accessibility of God through Christ, who invites believers into a personal relationship with Him (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Taken literally, it shows Job&#8217;s certainty that God is real, righteous, and reachable. His cry foreshadows the Gospel reality that in Jesus the perfect Mediator now stands ready, so every believer may approach the throne as freely as speaking to a trusted friend.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Oh that one might plead for a man with God!</span> The original here is obscure. It may mean, <span class="accented">Oh that he</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God himself) <span class="accented">would plead for a man with God! i.e.</span> would become a Mediator between himself and man, plead for him, undertake his defence, and obtain for him merciful consideration. Or, nearly as in the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">Oh that one might plead for man</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> mankind at large) <span class="accented">with God!</span> interest him on their behalf, and obtain a merciful judgment for them.

But if we prefer the other rendering, "as the Son of man," a Messianic interpretation will be necessary. (So Professor Lee and Dr. Stanley Leathes) But Messianic interpretations of passages that do not require them, and that have no such traditional interpretation, require extreme caution. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/16-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Oh, that a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1490;&#1462;&#1443;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7713;e&#183;&#7687;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1397.htm">Strong's 1397: </a> </span><span class="str2">A valiant man, warrior, a person simply</span><br /><br /><span class="word">might plead</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1499;&#1463;&#1443;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7733;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Conjunctive imperfect Jussive - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3198.htm">Strong's 3198: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be right, reciprocal, to argue, to decide, justify, convict</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5973.htm">Strong's 5973: </a> </span><span class="str2">With, equally with</span><br /><br /><span class="word">God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1492;&#1468;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;w&#183;ah)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_433.htm">Strong's 433: </a> </span><span class="str2">God -- a deity, the Deity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as [he] [pleads]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1469;&#1489;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;en-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with his neighbor!</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1461;&#1469;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;r&#234;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7453.htm">Strong's 7453: </a> </span><span class="str2">Friend, companion, fellow</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/16-21.htm">OT Poetry: Job 16:21 That he would maintain the right (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/16-20.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 16:20"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 16:20" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/16-22.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 16:22"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 16:22" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
