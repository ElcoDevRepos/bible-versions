The word "consigned" suggests a sense of inevitability and divine ordination, indicating that labor is an integral part of human existence. This labor is not just physical but also encompasses the struggles and burdens of life. Theologically, it underscores the consequences of sin and the curse upon the ground, which affects all humanity. The concept of labor also connects to the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of rest for the weary in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>, offering spiritual relief from the burdens of life.<p><b>Are not his days like those of a hired hand?</b><br>The comparison to a "hired hand" emphasizes the temporary and often difficult nature of human life. In ancient times, a hired hand was someone who worked for wages, often under harsh conditions and with little security. This reflects the transient and uncertain nature of life, as well as the sense of futility and lack of control over one's circumstances. The imagery suggests that life is filled with toil and is often unrewarding, echoing <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:22-23</a>, where Solomon speaks of the vanity of labor. This also points to the hope of eternal rest and reward, as promised in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>, where believers are assured of a rest from their labors in the presence of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

From Adam forward, labor is not optional but woven into daily existence (<a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;consigned&#8221; underlines that this condition is assigned by God&#8217;s sovereign decree. Suffering and effort do not slip past His notice; they are permitted for purposes He alone fully grasps (<a href="/job/5-7.htm">Job 5:7</a>; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s honesty models how to bring discouragement to the Lord instead of pretending it away (<a href="/psalms/62-8.htm">Psalm 62:8</a>). Even in frustration, he acknowledges God as overseer of his circumstances, an act of implicit trust (<a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The realism of the verse guards against naive expectations. Scripture never promises carefree ease on earth; rather, it prepares believers to find meaning in labor, looking beyond present toil to eternal rest (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-11</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Are not his days like those of a hired hand?</b><p>&#8220;Are not his days like those of a hired hand?&#8221; (<a href="/job/7-1.htm">Job 7:1</a>b)<p>&#8226; A hired hand&#8217;s work is temporary, measured, and often wearisome&#8212;he counts the hours until the day&#8217;s wage is earned (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-15.htm">Deuteronomy 24:15</a>). Job feels the same countdown, longing for relief (<a href="/job/14-6.htm">Job 14:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The comparison underscores human frailty. Our &#8220;contract&#8221; of earthly life has fixed limits set by God (<a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>; <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>). Every sunrise marks progress toward the completion of that term.<p>&#8226; Yet the image hints at hope: a hired laborer ultimately receives payment. Likewise, the Lord promises reward to those who remain faithful amid drudgery (<a href="/matthew/20-8.htm">Matthew 20:8</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>).<p>&#8226; Recognizing life&#8217;s brevity can foster diligence and dependence, prompting us to steward each allotted day for God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/ephesians/5-15.htm">Ephesians 5:15-16</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/7-1.htm">Job 7:1</a> paints a candid picture of human existence: hard-pressed labor on a sin-scarred earth and a lifespan as numbered as a hired worker&#8217;s shift. Instead of leading to despair, this realism directs the heart to God, who authors the assignment, limits its duration, and promises rest and reward beyond it. Accepting these truths fuels perseverance, humility, and hopeful expectation until the final payday of eternal fellowship with Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-21.</span> - In this chapter Job first bewails his miserable fate, of which he expects no alleviation (vers. 1-10); then claims an unlimited right of complaint (ver. 11); and finally enters into direct expostulation with God - an expostulation which continues from ver. 12 to the end of the chapter.
