In the ancient Near East, silver was a common medium of exchange and a symbol of wealth and prosperity. The imagery of dust emphasizes the futility and impermanence of material wealth, echoing themes found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:10</a>, where the pursuit of wealth is described as never satisfying. The Bible often warns against the dangers of placing trust in riches, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>, which states that those who trust in their riches will fall. This phrase also reflects the broader biblical narrative that true security and fulfillment come from God, not material possessions.<p><b>and piles up a wardrobe like clay</b><br>The reference to piling up a wardrobe like clay suggests the accumulation of clothing, another symbol of wealth and status in the ancient world. Clay, being a common and easily shaped material, implies that these garments, though numerous, are ultimately perishable and of little lasting value. In biblical times, clothing was a significant indicator of one's social status, as seen in the story of Joseph and his coat of many colors (<a href="/genesis/37-3.htm">Genesis 37:3</a>). The comparison to clay highlights the transient nature of such wealth, reminiscent of Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-20</a>, where He advises storing treasures in heaven rather than on earth. This phrase serves as a reminder of the temporary nature of earthly possessions and the importance of seeking eternal riches.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Silver, normally precious, is pictured as so plentiful it becomes common &#8220;like dust.&#8221;<p>- Scripture repeatedly reminds us that material abundance does not equal God&#8217;s favor:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/49-6.htm">Psalm 49:6-7</a> warns that those who &#8220;trust in their wealth&#8221; cannot ransom their own souls.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a> insists, &#8220;Riches do not profit in the day of wrath.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15-20</a> recounts the rich fool whose barns overflowed, yet God said, &#8220;This night your soul is required of you.&#8221;<p>- Wealth piled high offers an illusion of security, but it is temporary, easily scattered by the smallest wind of God&#8217;s judgment (cf. <a href="/proverbs/23-5.htm">Proverbs 23:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And piles up a wardrobe like clay</b><p>- The wardrobe&#8212;outer symbols of luxury and status&#8212;is amassed &#8220;like clay,&#8221; a fragile, earthy substance. The image hints that these garments will crumble just as clay breaks apart.<p>- <a href="/james/5-2.htm">James 5:2</a> echoes the thought: &#8220;Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/isaiah/51-8.htm">Isaiah 51:8</a> adds, &#8220;the moth will eat them like a garment,&#8221; underscoring the certainty of decay.<p>- Even clothing can become an idol of self-display. Yet <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-20</a> directs believers to store treasures in heaven &#8220;where moth and rust do not destroy.&#8221;<p>- Job implies that the wicked man&#8217;s outward splendor will not shield him; the very items he boasts in will testify to the futility of his hope (cf. <a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/27-16.htm">Job 27:16</a> paints a vivid picture: staggering heaps of silver and mountains of fine clothes cannot secure the wicked. Just as dust blows away and clay crumbles, earthly riches prove powerless before God&#8217;s judgment.
