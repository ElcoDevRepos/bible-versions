In biblical context, God is often portrayed as the ultimate judge who examines the hearts and minds of individuals (<a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>). The rhetorical question implies that human wisdom and reasoning are insufficient when compared to God's perfect knowledge and justice. This echoes the theme of divine omniscience found throughout Scripture, where God is aware of all actions and intentions (<a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>).<p><b>Could you deceive Him as you would deceive a man?</b><br>This phrase underscores the futility of attempting to deceive God, contrasting human limitations with divine omniscience. In historical and cultural context, deception was a common concern in human interactions, but the Bible consistently teaches that God cannot be deceived (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). The comparison to deceiving a man highlights human fallibility and the ease with which people can be misled. This also connects to the broader biblical narrative that emphasizes truthfulness and integrity before God (<a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>). The rhetorical nature of the question serves to remind Job's friends&#8212;and readers&#8212;of the importance of honesty and the impossibility of hiding anything from God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Scripture assures us that such examination is thorough and unmistakable: &#8220;O Lord, You have searched me and known me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1</a>). When God examines:<p>&#8226; Motives, not appearances, are weighed&#8212;echoing <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where &#8220;man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Hidden sins come to light, just as <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a> warns that &#8220;God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Only integrity can stand; hypocrisy collapses. <a href="/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9</a> reminds us, &#8220;He who walks in integrity walks securely, but he who perverts his ways will be found out.&#8221;<p>Job challenges his friends: if God inspected their counsel, would it pass? Their shallow answers to deep suffering would fare poorly under divine scrutiny, for &#8220;each one&#8217;s work will become evident; for the Day will disclose it&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Could you deceive Him as you would deceive a man?</b><p>Job&#8217;s second question drives the point home: God cannot be fooled. Unlike people, He sees through every fa&#231;ade.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a> declares, &#8220;Nothing in all creation is hidden from God&#8217;s sight. Everything is uncovered and exposed to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Examples abound: Ananias and Sapphira tried to mislead the apostles but fell under God&#8217;s immediate judgment (<a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Even crafty plans are plain before Him; &#8220;The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-20.htm">1 Corinthians 3:20</a>).<p>Job implies that his friends&#8217; pious-sounding arguments&#8212;meant to defend God by blaming Job&#8212;amount to flattery. Such flattery might sway people, but never God. <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a> records a similar rebuke: &#8220;These people draw near with their mouths &#8230; yet their hearts are far from Me.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/13-9.htm">Job 13:9</a> exposes the folly of pretending before God. First, any life, teaching, or counsel will be tested under His all-knowing examination, where only genuine integrity endures. Second, no one can trick or flatter the Almighty, for He sees past every mask. Wise believers therefore speak and live transparently, confident that honest faith pleases the God who &#8220;desires truth in the inmost being&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">As one man mocketh another.</span>--As one man, with mingled flattery and deception, seeks to impose upon another.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is it good that he should search you out?</span> "Are your motives in thus acting," Job asks his opponents, "so pure that they will stand the severity of God's judgment when he turns his scrutiny upon <span class="accented">you</span> and searches out the grounds of your proceedings?
