The term "upright" is significant, as it denotes moral integrity and righteousness, qualities that Job is described as possessing in the opening chapters of the book. This reflects the biblical principle that God is approachable by those who are righteous, as seen in <a href="/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23-33</a>, where Abraham reasons with God over the fate of Sodom. The idea of reasoning with God is also echoed in <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, where God invites His people to "come now, let us reason together." This suggests a relationship where God is willing to engage with humanity, especially those who live according to His statutes.<p><b>and I would be delivered forever from my Judge</b><br>Job expresses a hope for deliverance, which is a recurring theme throughout the Bible. The concept of God as Judge is prevalent in Scripture, emphasizing His role in justice and righteousness. Job's longing for deliverance "forever" indicates a desire for eternal vindication, which can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who is described as the righteous Judge in <a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>. The eternal aspect of deliverance also connects to the New Testament promise of eternal life for believers, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>. Job's confidence in being delivered reflects his faith in God's justice and mercy, despite his current suffering and the accusations of his friends.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Job&#8217;s hope anticipates the believer&#8217;s assurance that through God&#8217;s own provision, ultimate vindication and eternal security are found in Him alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">There the righteous might dispute.</span>--He has learnt this marvellous truth, which the Gospel has so effectually brought to light, that it is God the Saviour who is Himself the refuge from God the Judge (<a href="/john/12-47.htm" title="And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.">John 12:47</a>); and then, in the solemn conviction of His presence, he makes use of the most sublime language expressive of it, being assured, though He may hide Himself with the express purpose of not interfering in his cause, yet that all things work together for good to them that love Him (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm" title="And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.">Romans 8:28</a>), and that when his time of trial is over, he himself will come forth like gold. Job's case teaches us that if an innocent man is falsely accused, God's honour is vindicated and maintained by his holding fast his conviction of innocence rather than by his yielding to the pressure of adversity and owning to sins he has not committed, or relaxing his hold on innocence by yielding to irritability.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There the righteous might dispute with him</span>. There, before his high tribunal (ver. 3), the upright man (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e8;</span>) might argue or reason with him, appealing from his justice to his mercy - from God the Judge to God the Saviour (Loathes), vindicating his integrity, acknowledging his transgressions, and pleading that they were sins of infirmity-and at last obtaining from God the acquittal anticipated in the second clause of the verse. In the absence of any revelation of an Advocate who will plead our cause before God for us, Job would seem to have been justified in expecting such a liberty of pleading his own cause as he here sets forth<span class="cmt_word">. So should I be delivered for ever from my Judge</span>. The "Judge of all the earth" will certainly and necessarily "do right." Job's conscience testifies to his substantial integrity and uprightness (comp. <a href="/1_john/3-21.htm">1 John 3:21</a>). He is, therefore, confident that, if he can once bring his cause to God's cognizance, he will obtain acquittal and deliverance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/23-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8033.htm">Strong's 8033: </a> </span><span class="str2">There, then, thither</span><br /><br /><span class="word">an upright man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1453;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3477.htm">Strong's 3477: </a> </span><span class="str2">Straight, right</span><br /><br /><span class="word">could reason</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1499;&#1464;&#1443;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7733;&#257;&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3198.htm">Strong's 3198: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be right, reciprocal, to argue, to decide, justify, convict</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with Him,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;im&#183;m&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
