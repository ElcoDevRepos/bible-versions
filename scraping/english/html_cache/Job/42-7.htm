The divine speeches (Job 38-41) highlight God's power in creation and His wisdom, which surpasses human comprehension. This sets the stage for the resolution of the narrative, where God addresses Job's friends.<p><b>He said to Eliphaz the Temanite</b><br>Eliphaz is identified as the leader among Job's friends, possibly due to his age or status. Teman was a region in Edom, known for its wise men (<a href="/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7</a>). This geographical reference underscores the expectation of wisdom from Eliphaz, which contrasts with his failure to speak rightly about God.<p><b>My wrath is kindled against you and your two friends</b><br>God's anger is directed at Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar for their incorrect representation of His character and actions. This divine rebuke highlights the seriousness of misrepresenting God, a theme echoed in other scriptures such as <a href="/james/3.htm">James 3:1</a>, which warns of the responsibility of teachers to speak truthfully.<p><b>For you have not spoken about Me accurately</b><br>The friends' speeches are characterized by a rigid retribution theology, suggesting that suffering is always a direct result of personal sin. This view is challenged by the narrative of Job, who is described as blameless and upright (<a href="/job/1.htm">Job 1:1</a>). Their failure to speak accurately about God reflects a misunderstanding of His justice and mercy.<p><b>as My servant Job has</b><br>Despite Job's complaints and questions, God affirms that Job has spoken rightly about Him. This endorsement suggests that honest wrestling with God, even in confusion and pain, is preferable to false certainties. Job's role as a servant of God foreshadows the suffering servant motif found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which Christians see as a type of Christ, who also suffered unjustly yet remained faithful.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign God who speaks to Job and his friends, revealing His authority and justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A righteous man who suffered greatly but remained faithful to God, ultimately vindicated by God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who incorrectly judged Job's suffering as a result of sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bildad_the_shuhite_and_zophar_the_naamathite.htm">Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite</a></b><br>The other two friends of Job who, along with Eliphaz, misrepresented God's character and justice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dialogue.htm">The Dialogue</a></b><br>The series of conversations between Job and his friends, culminating in God's response and correction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_accurate_theology.htm">The Importance of Accurate Theology</a></b><br>Misrepresenting God's character can lead to His displeasure, as seen with Job's friends.

Job&#8217;s humble reply&#8212;&#8220;I repent in dust and ashes&#8221; (42:6)&#8212;shows that the dialogue achieved its purpose: Job now sees the LORD more clearly. Scripture routinely records decisive moments after God speaks (<a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>; <a href="/exodus/19-25.htm">Exodus 19:25</a>), underscoring that His words demand a response. Here, heaven pauses before turning to Job&#8217;s companions, reminding us that divine revelation always has communal implications.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He said to Eliphaz the Temanite</b><p>Eliphaz, the eldest and most vocal friend (<a href="/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>; 4:1), becomes God&#8217;s point of contact. The LORD singles him out first, just as He later makes him responsible for leading the group&#8217;s repentance (42:8). Leadership carries accountability (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>); the order of address highlights how influence over others intensifies divine scrutiny.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My wrath is kindled against you and your two friends.</b><p>The phrase declares holy anger, not a passing irritation. Throughout Scripture, the LORD&#8217;s wrath burns when His character is misrepresented (<a href="/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11</a>; <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>). The friends&#8217; pious-sounding speeches have provoked the very displeasure they thought they were defending God against. Their error shows that zeal without truth can become sin (<a href="/proverbs/19-2.htm">Proverbs 19:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For you have not spoken about Me accurately</b><p>The friends insisted that suffering is always proportional to sin (<a href="/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7&#8211;8</a>; 8:20; 11:13&#8211;15), reducing God to a predictable formula. By doing so they ignored:<p>&#8226; The mystery of divine sovereignty (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; The reality of the righteous sufferer (<a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The testimony God Himself had given about Job&#8217;s integrity (<a href="/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a>).<p>Misguided theology wounded a hurting man and dishonored the LORD. Scripture warns against such distortion (<a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-7.htm">1 Timothy 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as My servant Job has.</b><p>Despite deep anguish, Job consistently refused to lie about God. He admitted confusion (<a href="/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>), demanded answers (23:3&#8211;5), yet clung to God&#8217;s justice and awaited His vindication (19:25&#8211;27). The LORD now publicly affirms Job&#8217;s honesty. Calling him &#8220;My servant&#8221; restores his honor, echoing God&#8217;s earlier commendation (1:8) and foreshadowing the ultimate Suffering Servant who would also be vindicated (<a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8&#8211;11</a>). <a href="/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a> later celebrates Job&#8217;s perseverance, confirming God&#8217;s approval.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7</a> reveals that God cares not only about moral behavior but also about truthful speech concerning His nature. The LORD&#8217;s rebuke of the friends warns against simplifying the complexities of His providence, while His commendation of Job underscores that humble, honest wrestling is more faithful than polished error. Sound doctrine and compassionate application must walk together, lest we kindle divine wrath rather than reflect divine grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/42.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And it was so.</span>--The verdict that is spoken against the friends of Job is based rather on the tone and spirit of what they have said than on any of their actual words, for many of these are conspicuous for their wisdom, truth, and beauty. But throughout they had been on the wrong side, and seemed to think that the cause of God had need to be upheld at all risks, and that it might even be required to tell lies for God (<a href="/job/13-7.htm" title="Will you speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?">Job 13:7</a>); and it was this that provoked the Divine indignation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it was so, that after the Lord had spoken these words unto Job</span>. The "words" intended seem to be those of ch. 38-41, not any words in the earlier portion of this chapter. God heard Job's confession in silence, and, without further speech to him, addressed Eliphaz and his "friends." <span class="cmt_word">The Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends.</span> The superior position of Eliphaz is here very strongly recognized - he alone is mentioned by name, he alone addressed directly. The precedence thus given to him accords with that which he holds, both in the earlier historical narrative (<a href="/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>) and in the dialogue (<a href="/job/4-1.htm">Job 4:1</a>; <a href="/job/15-1.htm">Job 15:1</a>; <a href="/job/22-1.htm">Job 22:1</a>). For ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath. Job had, on the whole, spoken what was right and true of God, and is acknowledged by God as his true servant. The "comforters," consciously or unconsciously, had spoken what was false.
