Job, once a wealthy and respected man, would have had numerous servants. His calling for a servant highlights his previous status and the drastic change in his circumstances. This phrase also reflects Job's isolation and the breakdown of his social relationships, as even those who were once under his authority now ignore him. This can be seen as a metaphor for his feeling of abandonment by God, paralleling the servant's lack of response to Job's call.<p><b>but he does not answer</b><br>The lack of response from the servant signifies Job's complete alienation and the loss of respect and authority he once held. In the cultural context, a servant's failure to respond would be seen as a significant breach of duty and respect. This silence can be compared to Job's perception of God's silence in his suffering, emphasizing his sense of being unheard and forsaken. This theme of divine silence is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as in the Psalms, where the psalmists often cry out to God in times of distress and feel unheard.<p><b>though I implore him with my own mouth</b><br>Job's use of the word "implore" indicates a desperate plea, showing his vulnerability and the depth of his suffering. The phrase "with my own mouth" underscores the personal nature of his request, highlighting that Job himself, not through intermediaries, is making this plea. This personal appeal can be seen as a reflection of Job's direct and earnest prayers to God, seeking answers and relief from his afflictions. The intensity of Job's plea can be compared to the earnest prayers of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane, where He also implores God with deep anguish.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.

Earlier he was &#8220;the greatest of all the men of the east&#8221; (<a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>). In those days even leaders &#8220;kept silent and put their hands on their mouths&#8221; when Job walked by (<a href="/job/29-9.htm">Job 29:9-10</a>). Under normal conditions a master&#8217;s summons was instantly obeyed, as illustrated by the centurion who said, &#8220;I tell my servant, &#8216;Do this,&#8217; and he does it&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/8-9.htm">Matthew 8:9</a>). Job calls, but the servant who should have rushed to his side stays away. This highlights:<p>&#8226; The collapse of Job&#8217;s social standing.<p>&#8226; How suffering strips earthly status (compare <a href="/psalms/49-12.htm">Psalm 49:12</a>).<p>&#8226; A foretaste of the rejection Christ endured, &#8220;despised and forsaken of men&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but he does not answer</b><p>For a servant to ignore a master was unthinkable. Scripture expects servants to &#8220;obey your earthly masters with respect&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5</a>) and to &#8220;be submissive&#8230; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the harsh&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a>). Yet Job&#8217;s servant offers silence&#8212;an intentional slight, not mere oversight. This mirrors the wider abandonment Job catalogs: &#8220;My relatives have failed me&#8230; my close friends have forgotten me&#8221; (<a href="/job/19-14.htm">Job 19:14</a>). Similar isolation appears in <a href="/psalms/38-11.htm">Psalm 38:11</a>, &#8220;My friends and companions stand aloof because of my plague.&#8221; The verse underlines how human loyalty can evaporate when hardship strikes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>though I implore him</b><p>Job is not barking orders; he is pleading. The master stoops to beg the servant he feeds and shelters&#8212;an image of humiliation. Scripture records other role reversals that sting the heart: the prodigal son planning to say, &#8220;Make me like one of your hired servants&#8221; (<a href="/luke/15-19.htm">Luke 15:19</a>) and the lament, &#8220;I have become a stranger to my brothers&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/69-8.htm">Psalm 69:8</a>). Job&#8217;s plea shows:<p>&#8226; His willingness to humble himself.<p>&#8226; The depth of his need for even the smallest kindness.<p>&#8226; The pain of unanswered appeals, echoed in <a href="/lamentations/1-2.htm">Lamentations 1:2</a>, &#8220;She weeps bitterly in the night&#8230; there is no one to comfort her.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with my own mouth</b><p>Job emphasizes that he is speaking personally, directly, not through a steward or messenger. His &#8220;own mouth&#8221; pours out the request, proving the sincerity of his heart. David used similar language: &#8220;I pour out my complaint before Him; I declare my trouble before Him&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/142-2.htm">Psalm 142:2</a>). By highlighting his voice, Job underscores that:<p>&#8226; His plea is unmistakable&#8212;no servant could claim ignorance.<p>&#8226; He retains faith that honest words should matter (compare <a href="/proverbs/15-23.htm">Proverbs 15:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Even in physical misery, he still chooses transparent communication, a pattern later perfected by Christ, &#8220;Who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/19-16.htm">Job 19:16</a> paints a portrait of total social collapse: the once-honored master calls, but a servant snubs him, forcing Job to beg with his own mouth. The verse exposes how suffering can strip every earthly support, pressuring believers to lean solely on God. It spotlights human fickleness, heightens the contrast between worldly status and true worth, and foreshadows the greater rejection endured by the Man of Sorrows. In the silence of the servant, Job discovers that his final refuge is not in human response but in the LORD who ultimately answers (<a href="/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I called my servant, and he gave me no answer</span>.
