In the context of Job, it highlights the contrast between those who are suffering and those who are not. Biblically, this can be seen in the story of the rich man and Lazarus (<a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19-31</a>), where the rich man lived in ease while Lazarus suffered. Theologically, it suggests a warning against complacency and a lack of empathy for those in distress.<p><b>scorns misfortune</b><br>To scorn misfortune implies a dismissive or contemptuous attitude towards the suffering of others. This reflects a lack of compassion and understanding, which is contrary to the biblical call to love and support one another (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>). Historically, this attitude can be seen in societies where the wealthy and powerful often disregarded the plight of the poor and oppressed.<p><b>as the fate of those</b><br>This phrase suggests a deterministic view of suffering, where misfortune is seen as an inevitable outcome for certain individuals. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, suffering was often viewed as a result of divine judgment or personal failure. However, the book of Job challenges this notion by presenting a righteous man who suffers without cause.<p><b>whose feet are slipping</b><br>This imagery of slipping feet conveys instability and vulnerability. It is a metaphor for those who are on the brink of disaster or failure. In <a href="/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2</a>, the psalmist uses similar language to describe a crisis of faith. Theologically, it can represent the human condition of being prone to sin and the need for divine support, as seen in <a href="/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3</a>, where God is described as one who will not let your foot slip.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
