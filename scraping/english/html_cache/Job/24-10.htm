In the ancient Near Eastern context, clothing was a basic necessity, and being without it symbolized utter deprivation and vulnerability. The lack of clothing also signifies a loss of dignity and social standing. Biblically, nakedness often represents shame and exposure, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a> when Adam and Eve realized their nakedness after sinning. This imagery underscores the injustice and neglect experienced by the poor, who are left unprotected and humiliated. The plight of the naked is a recurring theme in Scripture, calling for compassion and justice, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a>, where God commands His people to clothe the naked.<p><b>They carry the sheaves, but still go hungry.</b><br>This part of the verse illustrates the exploitation and injustice faced by laborers. In an agrarian society, carrying sheaves was a common task during the harvest. However, the fact that these laborers go hungry despite their hard work indicates that they are not receiving fair compensation for their labor. This situation reflects the broader biblical theme of social justice and the responsibility of the wealthy to care for the poor, as emphasized in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14-15</a>, which instructs employers to pay workers promptly and fairly. The image of hungry laborers also echoes the prophetic calls for justice found in books like Amos, where God condemns those who oppress the poor and deny them their rightful wages. This verse serves as a reminder of the need for righteousness and equity in economic dealings, aligning with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized caring for the needy and condemned exploitation (<a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and patience who endures immense suffering and questions the justice of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oppressed.htm">The Oppressed</a></b><br>The verse refers to those who are suffering and oppressed, highlighting their lack of basic necessities like clothing and food.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oppressors.htm">The Oppressors</a></b><br>Implicit in the text are those who exploit the labor of the oppressed, allowing them to work but not providing for their basic needs.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sheaves.htm">The Sheaves</a></b><br>Symbolic of the harvest and the fruits of labor, representing the work done by the oppressed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, the broader context of Job often refers to desolate places, symbolizing the isolation and hardship faced by the oppressed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_for_the_oppressed.htm">Compassion for the Oppressed</a></b><br>As Christians, we are called to have compassion for those who are suffering and to take action to alleviate their burdens.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/justice_in_labor.htm">Justice in Labor</a></b><br>The verse challenges us to consider how we treat those who work for us or with us, ensuring that we are fair and just in our dealings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/awareness_of_injustice.htm">Awareness of Injustice</a></b><br><a href="/job/24-10.htm">Job 24:10</a> serves as a reminder to be aware of the injustices around us and to advocate for those who cannot speak for themselves.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_of_resources.htm">Stewardship of Resources</a></b><br>We are reminded of the importance of using our resources to help those in need, reflecting God's love and provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_justice.htm">Trust in God's Justice</a></b><br>Even when we see injustice, we are encouraged to trust in God's ultimate justice and timing, knowing that He sees and will act.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Job_24_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Job 24:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Job_24_10_plight_of_the_needy.htm">How does Job 24:10 highlight the plight of the impoverished and needy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Job_24_10_God_s_justice_in_a_fallen_world.htm">What does Job 24:10 reveal about God's justice in a fallen world?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_aid_the_naked_and_sheaf_carriers.htm">How can we support those who "go about naked" and "carry sheaves"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Which_scriptures_stress_aiding_the_needy.htm">What other scriptures emphasize caring for the poor and vulnerable like Job 24:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Job_24_10_s_relevance_to_poverty_today.htm">How can we apply Job 24:10 to address modern-day poverty and injustice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_God_let_innocents_suffer_3.htm">Why does God allow the innocent to suffer as described in Job 24:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Job_24_10_Fairness_of_God_questioned.htm">How does Job 24:10 challenge the belief in a just and fair God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_are_the_poor_suffering_in_Job_24_10.htm">What historical context explains the plight of the poor in Job 24:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_job_24.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Job 24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_about_bribery.htm">How should we treat foreigners among us?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/where_did_jesus_tell_them_to_stay.htm">Where did Jesus tell his disciples to stay after his resurrection?

First of all, the poor man, whose only wrap or cloak has been taken in pledge, is com-polled to go naked, or almost naked, both day and night, exposed alike to extremes of heat and cold. Secondly, he is compelled to reap and bind and carry home the sheaves of his oppressor, while he himself is half famished with hunger. The second clause of the verse is wrongly translated in the Authorized Version, where we read, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry; the real meaning being, "and they who are an hungered, carry the sheaves" (compare the Revised Version). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/24-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Without</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;l&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1097.htm">Strong's 1097: </a> </span><span class="str2">Failure, nothing, destruction, without, not yet, because not, as long as</span><br /><br /><span class="word">clothing,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1425;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3830.htm">Strong's 3830: </a> </span><span class="str2">A garment, clothing, raiment</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they wander about</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1453;&#1500;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(hil&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">naked.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;r&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6174.htm">Strong's 6174: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nude, either partially, totally</span><br /><br /><span class="word">They carry</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#347;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5375.htm">Strong's 5375: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lift, carry, take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the sheaves,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1465;&#1469;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6016.htm">Strong's 6016: </a> </span><span class="str2">A heap, a sheaf, an omer (dry measure)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but still go hungry.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1437;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1489;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;&#7687;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
