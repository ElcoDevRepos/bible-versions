The "breath of God" can be seen as a metaphor for His divine will and authority. In <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, God breathes life into Adam, highlighting His role as the giver of life. Conversely, here in Job, the breath signifies God's ability to take life away, underscoring His ultimate control over creation. This concept is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/40-7.htm">Isaiah 40:7</a>, where the breath of the Lord causes the grass to wither, symbolizing the transient nature of human life under divine judgment.<p><b>and by the blast of His anger they are consumed</b><br>The "blast of His anger" suggests a powerful, overwhelming force, akin to a storm or a consuming fire, which is a common biblical image for divine judgment. This imagery is consistent with other Old Testament passages, such as <a href="/psalms/18-15.htm">Psalm 18:15</a>, where God's rebuke is depicted as a force that lays bare the foundations of the earth. The idea of being "consumed" by God's anger reflects the seriousness of divine judgment and the consequences of sin, as seen in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate judgment at the end of times, as described in <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>, where God's righteous anger will be fully revealed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

If He withdraws it, &#8220;all flesh would perish together&#8221; (<a href="/job/34-14.htm">Job 34:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a> echoes the same truth: &#8220;When You take away their breath, they die and return to dust.&#8221; The verse in Job turns that principle into a sober warning&#8212;those who defy God cannot outlive His decision.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s breath is no mere figure of speech; it is the literal expression of His sovereign power. The One who gently breathed life into Adam can just as literally reclaim that breath, and human strength cannot resist Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and by the blast of His anger they are consumed</b><p>The imagery intensifies from the quiet withdrawal of breath to a forceful wind of judgment.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/15-7.htm">Exodus 15:7</a> celebrates God&#8217;s victory over Egypt: &#8220;You unleashed Your burning wrath; it consumed them like stubble.&#8221; The same divine anger Eliphaz mentions leveled a superpower.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/18-15.htm">Psalm 18:15</a> adds, &#8220;At the blast of Your breath&#8230; the foundations of the world were exposed,&#8221; highlighting how swiftly God&#8217;s wrath can overturn the created order.<p>&#8226; Historical events back this up: fire from the LORD consumed Nadab and Abihu (<a href="/leviticus/10-2.htm">Leviticus 10:2</a>) and the rebellious company of Korah (<a href="/numbers/16-35.htm">Numbers 16:35</a>).
