In the biblical context, the desert often symbolizes desolation and testing, as seen in the Israelites' wanderings (<a href="/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16:1</a>) and Jesus' temptation (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1</a>). The "mighty wind" can be seen as an instrument of divine judgment or testing, similar to the storm that God used to speak to Job later in the book (<a href="/job/38.htm">Job 38:1</a>). This event foreshadows the trials Job will face, testing his faith and integrity.<p><b>and struck the four corners of the house</b><br>The phrase "four corners" suggests total destruction, as it implies the house was hit from all sides. This imagery is reminiscent of the completeness of God's sovereignty over creation, as seen in the four corners of the earth (<a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>). The house, a place of safety and family, becomes a site of tragedy, highlighting the fragility of human security. This serves as a reminder of the transient nature of earthly possessions and the need to rely on God.<p><b>It collapsed on the young people and they are dead</b><br>The collapse of the house resulting in the death of Job's children is a profound personal tragedy. In the cultural context of the time, children were seen as a blessing and a sign of God's favor (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>). The loss of all his children at once would have been a devastating blow to Job, both emotionally and socially. This event sets the stage for Job's deep lament and questioning of God's justice, as he grapples with the loss of his legacy and future.<p><b>and I alone have escaped to tell you!&#8221;</b><br>The lone survivor serves as a witness to the calamity, emphasizing the totality of the disaster. This pattern of a single messenger reporting calamity is repeated throughout <a href="/job/1.htm">Job 1</a>, underscoring the overwhelming nature of Job's trials. Theologically, this can be seen as a test of Job's faith, as he receives news of his losses one after another. The role of the messenger also highlights the importance of testimony in the biblical narrative, as seen in the role of prophets and apostles who bear witness to God's actions and messages.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

The passage calls believers to trust God&#8217;s character in every storm, knowing He can transform even the deepest loss into a testimony of His faithful redemption.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">from across the wilderness</span> - a wind which began in the region lying on the other side of the wilderness, and sweeping across it, came with full force upon the inhabited tract where Job and his sons were dwelling. The desert winds are often very violent. Generally they are Laden with heavy clouds of fine sand, which cause intolerable discomfort and thirst; but when they sweep over a rocky and gravelly region, they are simply of extreme violence, without other distressing feature. They then resemble the hurricanes or tornadoes of the West Indies. We may reasonably connect this hurricane with the thunderstorm of ver. 16<span class="cmt_word">.
