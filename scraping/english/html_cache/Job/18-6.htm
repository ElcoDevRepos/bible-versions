In ancient times, a tent was a symbol of one's dwelling and household. The imagery of light growing dark suggests a decline in fortune and the absence of divine favor. In the broader context of Job, Bildad is speaking about the fate of the wicked, implying that Job's suffering is due to his own wrongdoing. This reflects the belief that light represents God's presence and blessing, as seen in <a href="/psalms/27.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>, where the Lord is described as "my light and my salvation." The darkening of light can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual blindness or separation from God.<p><b>and the lamp beside him goes out</b><br>The extinguishing of a lamp signifies the end of life or the removal of God's protection and guidance. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, lamps were essential for daily life, providing light and security. The lamp going out can be seen as a metaphor for death or the cessation of one's influence and legacy. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/13-9.htm">Proverbs 13:9</a>, which states, "The light of the righteous rejoices, but the lamp of the wicked will be put out." The lamp is also a symbol of God's word and truth, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path." The extinguishing of the lamp beside him suggests a complete loss of hope and divine guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bildad_the_shuhite.htm">Bildad the Shuhite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him. Bildad is known for his harsh and traditionalist views, often emphasizing the retributive justice of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure of the Book of Job, a man of great faith and patience who undergoes severe trials and suffering.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent.htm">The Tent</a></b><br>Symbolic of a person's dwelling or life.

Job himself remembered better days &#8220;when His lamp shone above my head&#8221; (<a href="/job/29-3.htm">Job 29:3</a>).<p>- When God withdraws favor, that domestic glow vanishes. <a href="/psalms/18-28.htm">Psalm 18:28</a> affirms, &#8220;For You light my lamp; the LORD my God illumines my darkness,&#8221; underscoring that any true brightness in the home ultimately comes from the Lord.<p>- <a href="/proverbs/13-9.htm">Proverbs 13:9</a> echoes the same principle: &#8220;The light of the righteous shines brightly, but the lamp of the wicked is extinguished.&#8221; Bildad&#8217;s words fit that pattern exactly&#8212;sin darkens what once seemed secure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>grows dark</b><p>- Darkness in Scripture speaks of confusion, calamity, and divine judgment. <a href="/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a> pictures cosmic darkness when God acts in wrath, while <a href="/amos/5-20.htm">Amos 5:20</a> warns that the Day of the LORD &#8220;will be darkness, not light.&#8221;<p>- For the wicked man in <a href="/bsb/job/18.htm">Job 18</a>, the gradual dimming signals a progressive unraveling of prosperity, reputation, and hope. None of it is random; it is God&#8217;s just response to an unrepentant life.<p>- <a href="/john/12-35.htm">John 12:35</a> reminds us that &#8220;he who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.&#8221; Bildad&#8217;s point: by choosing evil, the man forfeits spiritual sight and stumbles into ever-deepening gloom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the lamp beside him goes out</b><p>- A &#8220;lamp&#8221; often symbolizes influence and legacy. David was called &#8220;the lamp of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/21-17.htm">2 Samuel 21:17</a>), and God promised Jeroboam a &#8220;lamp in Jerusalem&#8221; for David&#8217;s sake (<a href="/1_kings/15-4.htm">1 Kings 15:4</a>).<p>- Here the picture is reversed: the wicked man&#8217;s lamp is snuffed. His name, posterity, and impact are cut short. <a href="/proverbs/20-20.htm">Proverbs 20:20</a> warns, &#8220;Whoever curses his father or mother, his lamp will go out in deepest darkness,&#8221; stressing that defiance toward God and others leads to the same end.<p>- <a href="/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5</a> shows the same principle applied to a church: &#8220;I will come and remove your lampstand from its place unless you repent.&#8221; Whether individual or corporate, unrepented sin leads to extinguished light.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/18-6.htm">Job 18:6</a> paints a sobering progression for the unrepentant: God-given brightness in the home fades, darkness settles in, and finally every remaining spark of influence is extinguished. The verse underscores that light&#8212;whether prosperity, guidance, or legacy&#8212;belongs to God alone. When one rejects Him, that light inevitably departs, leaving only darkness and loss.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The light shall be dark in his tabernacle</span>.
