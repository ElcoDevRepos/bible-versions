In the context of the Book of Job, Job is responding to his friends who insist that suffering is always a result of personal sin. Job observes that the wicked often prosper, which seems to contradict the idea of immediate divine justice. This sentiment is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3-12</a>, where the psalmist struggles with the prosperity of the wicked. Historically, this reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of divine justice, where the righteous were expected to prosper and the wicked to suffer. Theologically, it raises questions about God's sovereignty and the presence of evil, which are central themes in the Book of Job.<p><b>He blindfolds its judges.</b><br>This phrase suggests that justice is perverted or obscured. In ancient times, judges were expected to be impartial and wise, often seen as representatives of divine justice. The imagery of blindfolding implies a deliberate act of preventing justice from being served. This can be connected to <a href="/isaiah/5-23.htm">Isaiah 5:23</a>, where corrupt leaders are condemned for justifying the wicked for a bribe. Theologically, it raises the issue of human fallibility and the corruption of justice systems, which is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature. It also points to the need for a perfect judge, which Christians see fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who embodies perfect justice and righteousness.<p><b>If it is not He, then who is it?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the sovereignty of God over all events, including the allowance of evil and injustice. Job is acknowledging that, ultimately, God is in control, even if His ways are inscrutable. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>, where God declares His control over both light and darkness. The question challenges the reader to consider the mystery of God's providence and the limits of human understanding. It also foreshadows the resolution of the Book of Job, where God speaks out of the whirlwind, affirming His wisdom and authority over creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man described as blameless and upright, who fears God and shuns evil.

As a further proof of God's indifference to the sufferings of the innocent, Job adduces the fact that, in the high places of the earth, are mostly set wicked persons, who oppress and persecute the righteous. This has probably been true, in the East at any rate, at all times. <span class="cmt_word">He covereth the faces of the judges thereof</span>. God covers up the eyes of those who have to judge between the oppressors and the oppressed, so that they pervert judgment, and side with the oppressors. He does this, since he permits it to be done. Corrupt judges are among the perennial curses of the East. <span class="cmt_word">If not, where</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">who is he?</span> rather, <span class="accented">If it be not he</span> <span class="accented">who then is it?</span> (see the Revised Version).

There is no one else to whom it can be ascribed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/9-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The earth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1444;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;
