In the ancient Near Eastern context, rulers and princes often wielded significant power and influence, yet God does not show favoritism based on status or position. This aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>, which states that God shows no partiality nor takes a bribe. It underscores the biblical principle that all humans are equal before God, regardless of earthly rank.<p><b>and does not favor rich over poor?</b><br>The Bible frequently addresses the theme of wealth and poverty, emphasizing that material wealth does not equate to spiritual favor. <a href="/proverbs/22-2.htm">Proverbs 22:2</a> states, "Rich and poor have this in common: The LORD is the Maker of them all." This phrase in Job reinforces the idea that God's justice is not swayed by economic status. In the cultural context of the time, wealth was often seen as a sign of divine blessing, yet this passage challenges that notion, affirming God's equitable treatment of all individuals.<p><b>For they are all the work of His hands.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the doctrine of creation, affirming that all people, regardless of social or economic status, are created by God. This echoes <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>, where humanity is made in the image of God. It serves as a reminder of the inherent dignity and value of every person. Theologically, it points to God's sovereignty and creative power, suggesting that His justice is rooted in His role as Creator. This also foreshadows the New Testament teaching in <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>, where Paul speaks of God making every nation from one man, highlighting the unity and equality of all humanity before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering a perspective on God's justice and righteousness.

Right before verse 19 he says, &#8220;Far be it from God to do wrong, from the Almighty to commit injustice&#8221; (<a href="/job/34-10.htm">Job 34:10</a>). Verse 19 develops that theme, showing that God&#8217;s integrity is displayed through complete impartiality.
