In the context of Job, Elihu is asking for Job's attention, indicating that he believes he has important insights to share. This reflects the broader biblical theme of perseverance, as seen in <a href="/james/1-4.htm">James 1:4</a>, which encourages believers to let perseverance finish its work.<p><b>and I will show you</b><br>Elihu positions himself as a teacher or guide, suggesting he has wisdom to impart. This reflects the biblical tradition of prophets and wise men who reveal divine truths, similar to how Jesus taught his disciples, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5:1-2</a>. Elihu's confidence in his understanding mirrors the role of a prophet, though he is not explicitly called one.<p><b>that there is more to be said</b><br>This implies that the discussion about God's nature and actions is not yet complete. It highlights the inexhaustible depth of God's wisdom and the ongoing revelation of His character, as seen in <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>, which speaks of the depth of the riches of God's wisdom and knowledge.<p><b>on God&#8217;s behalf</b><br>Elihu claims to speak for God, a bold assertion that requires careful discernment. This reflects the biblical theme of divine representation, where individuals like Moses and the prophets spoke on God's behalf. It also foreshadows the ultimate revelation of God through Jesus Christ, who is described as the Word made flesh in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A young man who speaks to Job and his friends, offering a perspective on God's justice and sovereignty.

Patience creates space for truth to settle. &#8226; <a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a> reminds, &#8220;Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a> warns that answering before hearing &#8220;is folly and shame.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a> calls believers to &#8220;put on&#8230; patience,&#8221; a virtue Elihu models as he continues his counsel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I will show you</b><p>Elihu believes that what he is about to say will clarify God&#8217;s ways. Scripture often couples humble listening with faithful instruction: &#8226; <a href="/psalms/25-4.htm">Psalm 25:4, 5</a>&#8212;&#8220;Show me Your ways, O LORD&#8230; guide me in Your truth.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/acts/18-26.htm">Acts 18:26</a>&#8212;Aquila and Priscilla &#8220;explained to him the way of God more accurately.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>&#8212;The Spirit &#8220;will guide you into all the truth.&#8221; Elihu expects that careful explanation, not heated debate, will honor God and help Job.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that there is more to be said</b><p>Elihu senses that earlier speeches (Job&#8217;s and his friends&#8217;) have not exhausted the subject. God&#8217;s wisdom is always deeper than human discussion. &#8226; <a href="/job/32-17.htm">Job 32:17</a>&#8212;&#8220;I too will have my say; I too will tell what I know.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/proverbs/25-2.htm">Proverbs 25:2</a>&#8212;&#8220;It is the glory of God to conceal a matter; to search out a matter is the glory of kings.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/john/21-25.htm">John 21:25</a> notes that even all the books in the world could not contain everything about Jesus, hinting at the inexhaustible nature of divine truth. Elihu&#8217;s &#8220;more&#8221; signals that God&#8217;s purposes in suffering are richer than the simplistic formulas uttered so far.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on God&#8217;s behalf</b><p>Elihu claims to speak as God&#8217;s representative; his aim is God-centered, not self-centered. Scripture treats such representation with gravity: &#8226; <a href="/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>&#8212;&#8220;If anyone speaks, let him speak as the oracles of God.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>&#8212;&#8220;We are therefore ambassadors for Christ.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a>&#8212;The prophet is told, &#8220;You must go to everyone I send you to and say whatever I command you.&#8221; Elihu seeks to correct Job&#8217;s misconceptions about God&#8217;s justice and mercy, urging everyone present to see the Lord&#8217;s character clearly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/36-2.htm">Job 36:2</a> shows Elihu inviting patience, promising clearer insight, declaring that God&#8217;s counsel is not yet exhausted, and positioning himself as a faithful spokesman. The verse encourages believers to listen well, value thorough biblical explanation, recognize the limitless depth of God&#8217;s wisdom, and speak only in ways that accurately reflect Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/36-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Bear</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(kat&#183;tar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3803.htm">Strong's 3803: </a> </span><span class="str2">To enclose, to crown, to besiege, to wait</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
