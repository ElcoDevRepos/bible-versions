In the context of Job, it reflects Job's steadfastness despite his suffering and the accusations from his friends. The concept of righteousness in the Old Testament often involves living in accordance with God's laws and maintaining integrity. This perseverance is echoed in <a href="/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>, where the Lord watches over the way of the righteous. The idea of holding to one's way suggests a determined adherence to a path of integrity, reminiscent of <a href="/proverbs/4-25.htm">Proverbs 4:25-27</a>, which advises staying on the path of righteousness without turning aside.<p><b>and the one with clean hands grows stronger</b><br>"Clean hands" is a metaphor for innocence and purity, often used in the Psalms, such as <a href="/psalms/24-4.htm">Psalm 24:4</a>, which describes those who may stand in God's holy place as having clean hands and a pure heart. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, ritual purity was significant, and "clean hands" would symbolize moral and spiritual cleanliness. The promise of growing stronger suggests that maintaining purity and righteousness leads to spiritual fortitude. This is seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>, where those who hope in the Lord renew their strength. The phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, who exemplified perfect righteousness and purity, and through His strength, believers are empowered to grow in their faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
