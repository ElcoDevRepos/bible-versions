The act of "looking" signifies God's active engagement with wisdom, suggesting that wisdom is not merely an abstract concept but something tangible and valuable in the divine perspective. This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/8.htm">Proverbs 8</a>, where wisdom is personified and described as being present with God during creation. The appraisal indicates that God discerns the true worth of wisdom, emphasizing its supreme value above all earthly treasures. This reflects the biblical theme that true wisdom originates from God and is foundational to understanding life and creation.<p><b>He established it</b><br>Here, the text highlights God's role as the originator and sustainer of wisdom. To "establish" wisdom means that God has set it in place as a fundamental principle governing the universe. This echoes the creation narrative in Genesis, where God orders the cosmos with wisdom. It also connects to <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>, where Christ is described as the one through whom all things were created and are held together, suggesting that wisdom is integral to the divine order and purpose. The establishment of wisdom underscores its stability and reliability, contrasting with human understanding, which is often transient and flawed.<p><b>and searched it out.</b><br>This phrase suggests a thorough and exhaustive understanding of wisdom by God. The act of searching implies a deep and comprehensive exploration, indicating that God's knowledge of wisdom is complete and perfect. This can be linked to <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>, which speaks of the depth of the riches of God's wisdom and knowledge. It also reflects the idea that God's wisdom is beyond human comprehension, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's thoughts and ways are higher than ours. The searching out of wisdom by God assures believers that divine wisdom is both profound and accessible to those who seek it through a relationship with Him, as encouraged in <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure of the Book of Job, a man known for his righteousness and suffering.

Far from being distant, He beholds it as something that belongs to Him. Scripture often pictures the Lord surveying His creation&#8212;&#8220;The LORD looks down from heaven; He sees all the sons of men&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13</a>). When <a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a> reminds us that &#8220;the eyes of the LORD roam to and fro over all the earth,&#8221; it shows a God who is never ignorant of anything, least of all wisdom itself. By looking at wisdom, He:<p>&#8226; Affirms that real wisdom exists independently of human opinion.<p>&#8226; Establishes Himself as the One who defines what wisdom truly is (<a href="/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Demonstrates His intimate involvement in every detail of life, inviting us to seek our understanding from Him rather than from shifting cultural voices.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and appraised it</b><p>The verse then says He &#8220;appraised&#8221; wisdom&#8212;He set its worth. Earlier in the chapter Job lists gold, onyx, sapphire, and &#8220;crystal&#8221; yet concludes, &#8220;It cannot be bought with gold&#8221; (<a href="/job/28-15.htm">Job 28:15-19</a>). God alone measures wisdom&#8217;s value because He alone is qualified. <a href="/proverbs/8-11.htm">Proverbs 8:11</a> echoes, &#8220;For wisdom is more precious than rubies.&#8221; By appraising wisdom, God:<p>&#8226; Declares that nothing we chase&#8212;wealth, status, knowledge&#8212;compares with knowing Him.<p>&#8226; Reveals that wisdom&#8217;s price is beyond earthly currency; it is accessed through relationship with Him (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Calls us to adopt His value system. When <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a> tells us that His thoughts are higher than ours, it urges us to trust the One who has already weighed and declared wisdom priceless.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He established it</b><p>Next, God &#8220;established&#8221; wisdom. This speaks of laying a foundation. &#8220;The LORD founded the earth by wisdom and established the heavens by understanding&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a>). <a href="/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12</a> uses the same language, showing that wisdom is woven into the universe&#8217;s very framework. In establishing wisdom, God:<p>&#8226; Anchors all reality in His ordered, purposeful design.<p>&#8226; Guarantees that moral and spiritual laws are as fixed as physical ones.<p>&#8226; Provides a steady compass for every generation, so that even when society drifts, &#8220;He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and searched it out</b><p>Finally, He &#8220;searched it out.&#8221; This does not imply ignorance; rather, it pictures complete comprehension. <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a> marvels, &#8220;Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!&#8221; When God searches something, He plumbs its depths and fully understands its nuances&#8212;something no human mind can do. His searching means:<p>&#8226; Every facet of wisdom is exposed to His sight; nothing is hidden (<a href="/psalms/147-5.htm">Psalm 147:5</a>).<p>&#8226; He can apply wisdom perfectly in every circumstance, assuring us that His judgments are always right (<a href="/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; We are safe to follow His lead, for He has already explored every possible outcome.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/28-27.htm">Job 28:27</a> paints four movements&#8212;God looks, appraises, establishes, and searches&#8212;that together affirm His exclusive ownership and mastery of wisdom. Because He sees its essence, sets its value, builds creation upon it, and understands it completely, we can rest in the next verse&#8217;s conclusion: &#8220;Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding&#8221; (<a href="/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>). True wisdom is found by revering the One who already possesses it in full.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) The terms employed with reference to the Lord's knowledge of wisdom are remarkable. They are: (1) seeing, or intuition; (2) declaring or numbering, ratiocination; (3) preparing or establishing, determination; (4) searching out, or investigation. Each of these actions implies the operation of mind, and is so far opposed to the fatality of an impersonal law or the fixed necessity of an inevitable nature.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then did he see it, and declare it</span>. From the creation of the world, and before it, God foresaw all that was necessary to maintain his universe in the perfect order and the perfect beauty that he designed for it. At the Creation he, in a certain sense, "declared it," or set it forth, before such intelligences as then existed. Subsequently, in part to Adam, in part to Noah, in part to Moses, he further declared, by revelation, at any rate a portion of the design of his creation, and of the laws by which it was regulated. <span class="cmt_word">He prepared it, yea, and searched it out</span>. This is an inversion of what seems to us the natural order, whereof there are many examples. God must first have investigated and searched out, in his own secret counsels, the entire scheme of creation, and afterwards have proceeded to the "preparation" or "establishment" of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/28-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1443;&#1494;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;z)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_227.htm">Strong's 227: </a> </span><span class="str2">At that time, place, therefore</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He looked at [wisdom]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1453;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and appraised it;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1456;&#1505;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;sap&#183;p&#601;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5608.htm">Strong's 5608: </a> </span><span class="str2">To count, recount, relate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He established it</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1457;&#1437;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#277;&#183;&#7733;&#238;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3559.htm">Strong's 3559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be erect</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and searched it out.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;q&#257;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2713.htm">Strong's 2713: </a> </span><span class="str2">To penetrate, to examine intimately</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/28-27.htm">Job 28:27 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/28-27.htm">Job 28:27 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/28-27.htm">Job 28:27 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/28-27.htm">Job 28:27 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/28-27.htm">Job 28:27 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/28-27.htm">Job 28:27  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/28-27.htm">Job 28:27 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/28-27.htm">Job 28:27 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/28-27.htm">Job 28:27 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/28-27.htm">Job 28:27 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/28-27.htm">OT Poetry: Job 28:27 Then he saw it and declared it (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/28-26.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 28:26"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 28:26" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/28-28.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 28:28"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 28:28" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
