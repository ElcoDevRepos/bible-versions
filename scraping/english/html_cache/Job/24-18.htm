In biblical literature, water often symbolizes chaos and instability (<a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, <a href="/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20</a>). Foam, being light and temporary, indicates the lack of permanence and substance in the lives of those who do evil. This imagery aligns with the broader biblical theme that the wicked, despite their apparent success, ultimately have no lasting foundation (<a href="/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a>, <a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6</a>).<p><b>their portion of the land is cursed,</b><br>The concept of a "cursed" land ties back to the covenantal language found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience to God results in curses, including agricultural failure and loss of land. In the ancient Near Eastern context, land was a critical component of identity and blessing. A cursed land signifies divine disfavor and the removal of God's blessing, reflecting the consequences of living in opposition to God's will (<a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>).<p><b>so that no one turns toward their vineyards.</b><br>Vineyards in the Bible often symbolize prosperity and blessing (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, <a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1-8</a>). The absence of people turning toward the vineyards suggests desolation and abandonment, a reversal of the expected blessing. This imagery can be seen as a metaphor for the ultimate futility of the wicked's endeavors. Despite their efforts, they do not enjoy the fruits of their labor, echoing the theme of divine justice where the unrighteous do not prosper in the end (<a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and patience who endures immense suffering and questions the justice of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>In this context, Job is describing the fate of the wicked, who seem to prosper temporarily but ultimately face judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Represents the inheritance and blessings that are denied to the wicked due to their actions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/vineyards.htm">Vineyards</a></b><br>Symbolic of prosperity and fruitfulness, which the wicked are unable to enjoy due to the curse on their portion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_waters.htm">The Waters</a></b><br>Often symbolize chaos and instability, reflecting the transient and unstable nature of the wicked's prosperity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_transience_of_wickedness.htm">The Transience of Wickedness</a></b><br>The prosperity of the wicked is like foam on water&#8212;temporary and insubstantial.

"Locus obscurissimus" (Schulteus). Scarcely any two commentators agree even as to the subject on which Job proceeds to speak. Some regard him as giving his own judgment on the ultimate fate of the wicked; others, as anticipating what his opponents will say on the point. One recent expositor takes the passage as referring to the efforts made by the malefactors of vers. 14-16 to escape from justice, and to the discredit and difficulty in which they involve themselves. Another suggests that Job here calls attention to a fresh class of oppressors, viz. water-thieves (see Strabo, 16:18), who, starting in light boats from some island in a lake or river, plundered the neighbouring lands, making the portions of the landholders worthless, and causing them to neglect the cultivation, even of their vineyards. If we accept this view, the proper translation of the present verse will be, <span class="accented">Swift is he</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the water-thief) <span class="accented">upon the face of the waters</span>: <span class="accented">then is the portion of them who dwell in the land worthless</span>;
