In biblical terms, "light" often symbolizes truth, righteousness, and the presence of God (<a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4-5</a>). Rebellion against the light suggests a conscious choice to reject God's ways, akin to the actions of Satan and his followers (<a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-15</a>). This rebellion is not just ignorance but a deliberate turning away from what is right, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21-23</a>, where people knew God but chose not to honor Him.<p><b>not knowing its ways</b><br>This part of the verse suggests a lack of understanding or acknowledgment of the paths of righteousness. In <a href="/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18-19</a>, the path of the righteous is contrasted with the way of the wicked, which is like deep darkness. The ignorance here is willful, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>, where people are darkened in their understanding due to the hardness of their hearts. This ignorance is not merely intellectual but spiritual, indicating a refusal to accept divine guidance.<p><b>or staying on its paths</b><br>The imagery of "paths" is common in Scripture, representing the way of life one chooses to follow. <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a> describes God's word as a lamp to one's feet and a light to one's path, emphasizing the guidance provided by divine wisdom. The failure to stay on these paths indicates a departure from God's commandments and a life of sin, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/2-13.htm">Proverbs 2:13-15</a>, where those who leave the straight paths walk in darkness.
