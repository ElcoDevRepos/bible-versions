The concept of God stretching out His hand is often used in the Bible to signify divine intervention or judgment (<a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a>, <a href="/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>). It implies an active role of God in the affairs of humanity, demonstrating His sovereignty and power.<p><b>and strike his flesh and bones,</b><br>The request to strike Job's "flesh and bones" indicates a desire to inflict physical suffering. In ancient Near Eastern culture, physical health was often seen as a sign of divine favor, while illness or suffering could be interpreted as divine disfavor or punishment. This phrase highlights the severity of the test Satan proposes, aiming to affect Job's very being. The mention of "flesh and bones" underscores the comprehensive nature of the affliction, affecting both his physical and emotional state.<p><b>and he will surely curse You to Your face.&#8221;</b><br>Satan's assertion that Job will "curse You to Your face" is a direct challenge to Job's integrity and faith. The phrase "to Your face" suggests a bold and open renunciation of God, which in the cultural context would be considered the ultimate act of defiance and blasphemy. This reflects the central theme of the Book of Job: the testing of faith and the question of whether true piety is dependent on material blessings. The narrative sets the stage for exploring the nature of genuine faith and righteousness, independent of external circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who fears God and shuns evil.
