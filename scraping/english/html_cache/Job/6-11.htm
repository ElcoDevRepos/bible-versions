In the context of the Book of Job, he has lost his wealth, children, and health, leaving him in a state of profound suffering. This rhetorical question highlights his feeling of powerlessness. Biblically, strength often symbolizes the ability to endure trials (<a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>). Job's lament can be compared to the cries of other biblical figures who felt abandoned, such as David in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>). Theologically, this phrase underscores the human condition of frailty and the need for divine intervention. Job's lack of strength contrasts with the New Testament teaching that Christ's power is made perfect in weakness (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p><b>What is my future, that I should be patient?</b><br>Job questions the purpose of enduring his suffering when he sees no hopeful outcome. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the future was often seen as uncertain, and patience was a virtue tied to faith in God's promises. Job's struggle with patience reflects a common human experience of waiting on God's timing, as seen in the lives of Abraham and Sarah (<a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21:1-2</a>). This phrase also connects to the theme of eschatological hope found in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to be patient for the Lord's return (<a href="/james/5-7.htm">James 5:7-8</a>). Job's questioning of his future can be seen as a type of Christ, who, in His humanity, experienced anguish and questioned His path in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

The man who once &#8220;was the greatest of all the people of the east&#8221; (<a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>) now feels drained of every physical and emotional resource.<p>&#8226; Earlier he admitted, &#8220;My strength has dried up like clay&#8221; (echoing <a href="/psalms/22-15.htm">Psalm 22:15</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;My bones cling to my skin and flesh&#8221; (<a href="/job/19-20.htm">Job 19:20</a>) confirms the literal toll of suffering.<p>&#8226; Scripture never minimizes genuine weakness; yet it also reminds that &#8220;He gives power to the faint&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29</a>). Job&#8217;s lament is raw, but it lays the groundwork for the Lord to be seen as the true source of strength.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that I should still hope</b><p>Feeling powerless, Job wonders why he should &#8220;still hope.&#8221; The question is rhetorical&#8212;he sees no visible reason to keep expecting relief.<p>&#8226; Later he sighs, &#8220;Where then is my hope?&#8221; (<a href="/job/17-15.htm">Job 17:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Contrast the psalmist&#8217;s self-talk: &#8220;Put your hope in God&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a>).<p>&#8226; In gospel light we learn that &#8220;hope does not disappoint us&#8221; (<a href="/romans/5-5.htm">Romans 5:5</a>) because it rests in God&#8217;s character, not in our stamina. Job&#8217;s despair shows what happens when circumstances eclipse confidence in the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What is my future</b><p>Literally, &#8220;What is my end&#8230;?&#8221; Job&#8217;s outlook has shrunk to the immediate misery of boils, bereavement, and misunderstood grief.<p>&#8226; He earlier moaned, &#8220;My days&#8230; come to an end without hope&#8221; (<a href="/job/7-6.htm">Job 7:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the wider canon asserts, &#8220;I know the plans I have for you&#8230; plans to give you a future and a hope&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Even in the old covenant era the faithful could say, &#8220;You guide me with Your counsel, and afterward You will take me into glory&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/73-24.htm">Psalm 73:24</a>). Job&#8217;s words document how pain can cloud, but not cancel, the future God holds.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that I should be patient</b><p>Patience&#8212;steadfast endurance&#8212;feels impossible when tomorrow looks no different from today&#8217;s agony. Job&#8217;s friends offered lectures, not comfort, stretching his endurance even thinner.<p>&#8226; James points to this very scene: &#8220;You have heard of Job&#8217;s perseverance&#8221; (<a href="/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture calls us to &#8220;wait patiently for the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>) and reminds us, &#8220;You need to persevere so that&#8230; you will receive what He has promised&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-36.htm">Hebrews 10:36</a>).<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s question, therefore, exposes the human impossibility of patience apart from divine enabling; yet God will later vindicate Job and renew his capacity to endure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/6-11.htm">Job 6:11</a> captures the honest cry of a sufferer who sees no strength, no reason to hope, no visible future, and therefore no basis for patience. The verse is not a denial of God&#8217;s faithfulness but a snapshot of human frailty under extreme pressure. Cross-scriptural testimony answers each lament: the Lord Himself supplies strength, grounds hope, secures the future, and empowers patience. Job&#8217;s questions drive us to the only One who can fully answer them&#8212;our all-sufficient, promise-keeping God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Prolong my life.</span>--This is the literal rendering; but some understand <span class= "ital">be patient, </span>as in our phrase, <span class= "ital">long-</span>suffering.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What is my strength, that I should hope?</span> Eliphaz had suggested that Job might recover and be restored to his former prosperity (<a href="/job/5-18.htm">Job 5:18-26</a>).
