In the context of the Book of Job, Eliphaz is speaking to Job, suggesting that righteousness leads to blessings such as numerous descendants. This promise echoes the Abrahamic covenant in <a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>, where God promises Abraham that his descendants will be as numerous as the stars. The assurance of many offspring is also seen in the blessings given to Isaac and Jacob, reinforcing the idea that a large family is a sign of God's favor.<p><b>your descendants like the grass of the earth</b><br>The imagery of grass is used throughout the Bible to denote abundance and proliferation, as grass covers the earth in great numbers. This metaphor suggests not only quantity but also the idea of growth and renewal. In the cultural context, grass was a common and vital part of the agrarian landscape, symbolizing life and sustenance. This phrase can be connected to <a href="/psalms/72-16.htm">Psalm 72:16</a>, which speaks of the righteous flourishing like grass. The use of grass also subtly points to the transient nature of human life, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>, where human life is compared to grass that withers. However, in this context, the focus is on the blessing of numerous descendants, emphasizing God's provision and the continuation of one's lineage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Even though Eliphaz&#8217;s overall counsel is later rebuked (<a href="/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7</a>), the Spirit accurately records his words to reveal a timeless principle: God delights to make His goodness observable (<a href="/psalms/31-19.htm">Psalm 31:19</a>).<p>&#8226; For us, the verse invites expectancy&#8212;looking for tangible evidence of God at work in our families, much like the psalmist who remembers past deeds to fuel present trust (<a href="/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that your offspring will be many</b><p>&#8226; From Eden forward, fruitfulness is portrayed as a blessing (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>).

Eliphaz misapplies the principle to Job&#8217;s immediate pain, yet the truth itself stands: the Lord delights to vindicate His people and extend their influence across generations. Whether through physical children or spiritual heirs, God&#8217;s purpose is to fill the earth with those who know and honor Him, growing their legacy &#8220;like the grass of the earth.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Great.</span>--The word means also <span class= "ital">numerous, </span>which seems to suit the parallelism better here. The whole description is a very beautiful and poetical one of the perfect security of faith, though it is to a certain extent vitiated by its want of strict correspondence with facts, of which the very case of Job was a crucial instance. This was the special problem with which his friends had to deal, and which proved too hard for them. May we not learn that the problem is one that can only be solved in practice and not in theory?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great</span>. Little by little Eliphaz passes from a general description of the blessedness of those faithful ones who "despise not the chastening of the Almighty" (ver. 17) to a series of allusions which seem specially to touch Job's case. Without claiming prophetical inspiration, he ventures to promise him in the future "the exact reverse of all that he had experienced" in the past - "a safe home, flocks untouched, a happy and prosperous family, a peaceful old age" (Cook). The promises may have sounded in Job's ears as "a mockery" (ibid.); but it is creditable to the sagacity of Eliphaz that he ventured to make them. And thine offspring as the grass of the earth. The ordinary symbols for multitudinous-ness - the sand of the sea, and the stars of heaven - are here superseded by an entirely new one, "the grass of the earth." Undoubtedly it is equally appropriate, and perhaps more natural in a pastoral community. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/5-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You will know</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1469;&#1453;&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
