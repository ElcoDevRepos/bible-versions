Eliphaz is attempting to approach Job with caution, acknowledging the sensitivity of the situation. In the cultural context of the Ancient Near East, it was customary to offer counsel or wisdom in times of distress. Eliphaz's approach reflects the wisdom literature tradition, where dialogue and discourse are used to explore deep truths. This phrase sets the tone for a respectful yet probing conversation.<p><b>will you be wearied?</b><br>Eliphaz is concerned about Job's ability to handle further discussion or advice. This reflects the human tendency to become overwhelmed by grief and suffering. In the context of Job's immense loss and physical suffering, Eliphaz's question is both considerate and probing. It also highlights the tension between the need for comfort and the risk of exacerbating Job's distress. This phrase can be connected to <a href="/proverbs/25-11.htm">Proverbs 25:11</a>, which speaks of the value of a word spoken at the right time.<p><b>Yet who can keep from speaking?</b><br>Eliphaz feels compelled to speak, suggesting that the situation demands a response. This reflects the cultural expectation of offering wisdom and guidance, especially in times of crisis. The phrase underscores the human desire to make sense of suffering and to provide answers, even when they may not be welcome. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the lengthy dialogues that follow in the Book of Job, where friends attempt to rationalize Job's suffering. It also echoes the prophetic tradition, where speaking out is seen as a moral obligation, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

He strikes a note, however, which the friends all sound, namely, that it is the wicked who suffer, and that all who suffer must be wicked. This, in a variety of forms, is the sum and substance of what they have to say.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved?</span> rather, <span class="accented">If one</span> <span class="accented">assay a word against thee</span> <span class="accented">wilt thou be angry?</span> Eliphaz feels that what he is about to say will be unwelcome, and, as it were, apologizes beforehand.
