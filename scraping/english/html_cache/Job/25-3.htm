In the context of the Book of Job, Bildad is emphasizing God's sovereignty and the innumerable hosts of heaven, which include angels and celestial bodies. This echoes passages like <a href="/psalms/147-4.htm">Psalm 147:4</a>, where God is said to determine the number of stars and call them by name, highlighting His omniscience and omnipotence. The imagery of troops also suggests order and authority, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>, where Elisha's servant's eyes are opened to see the hills full of horses and chariots of fire, representing God's heavenly army. This reinforces the idea that God's power and resources are beyond human comprehension.<p><b>On whom does His light not rise?</b><br>This phrase speaks to the universality of God's presence and influence. Light is often used in Scripture as a metaphor for God's truth, guidance, and life-giving power, as seen in <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>, where Jesus is described as the true light that gives light to everyone. The rhetorical question implies that there is no one beyond the reach of God's illumination, aligning with <a href="/psalms/19-6.htm">Psalm 19:6</a>, which describes the sun's circuit and its pervasive influence. Culturally, light was a symbol of knowledge and purity, contrasting with darkness, which represented ignorance and evil. This phrase underscores the belief that God's revelation and moral order are accessible to all humanity, pointing to the inclusive nature of His divine plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bildad_the_shuhite.htm">Bildad the Shuhite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.
