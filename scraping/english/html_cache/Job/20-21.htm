In the context of the Book of Job, it reflects the idea of divine justice where the wicked, despite their temporary success, ultimately face ruin. This aligns with the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>, where the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous. The imagery of consumption can also be linked to the locust plagues described in <a href="/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a>, symbolizing total devastation. Historically, the ancient Near Eastern cultures often viewed material wealth as a sign of divine favor, making the loss of it a significant indicator of divine judgment.<p><b>thus his prosperity will not endure.</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the transient nature of the wicked's success. The theme of fleeting prosperity is echoed in <a href="/psalms/37-35.htm">Psalm 37:35-36</a>, where the wicked flourish like a green tree but soon vanish. The cultural context of Job's time placed great importance on lasting legacy and prosperity, often measured by land, livestock, and descendants. Theologically, this phrase underscores the biblical teaching that true and lasting prosperity is found in righteousness and obedience to God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>. The temporary nature of the wicked's prosperity can also be seen as a type of Christ's teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where treasures on earth are contrasted with treasures in heaven.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zophar_the_naamathite.htm">Zophar the Naamathite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.
