In the ancient Near Eastern context, vultures were often associated with death and decay, as they are scavengers that feed on carrion. The imagery suggests a person who is spiritually and morally lost, akin to someone who is already dead in a metaphorical sense. This aligns with the broader theme in the Book of Job, where Job's friends argue that suffering is a result of sin and divine punishment. The wandering aspect may also reflect the aimlessness and lack of direction that comes from being separated from God's guidance. In a broader biblical context, this can be compared to the Israelites' wandering in the wilderness due to their disobedience (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>).<p><b>he knows the day of darkness is at hand.</b><br>The "day of darkness" is a metaphor for impending judgment or calamity. In biblical literature, darkness often symbolizes evil, judgment, or the absence of God's presence (<a href="/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18-20</a>, <a href="/zephaniah/1-15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15</a>). This phrase suggests an awareness of impending doom, which could be interpreted as a form of divine retribution. The certainty of this knowledge implies an understanding of the moral order of the universe, where actions have consequences. In the context of Job, it reflects the belief of Job's friends that suffering is a direct result of sin. However, the narrative of Job challenges this simplistic view, as Job is described as a righteous man who suffers not because of his own sin, but as part of a larger divine purpose. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, though sinless, faced the "day of darkness" on the cross, bearing the judgment for humanity's sins (<a href="/matthew/27-45.htm">Matthew 27:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.
