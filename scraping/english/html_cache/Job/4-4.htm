In the context of Job, Eliphaz is acknowledging Job's past role as a source of wisdom and comfort to others. Biblically, the importance of words is emphasized in <a href="/proverbs/12-25.htm">Proverbs 12:25</a>, which states that "anxiety in a man's heart weighs him down, but a good word makes him glad." The imagery of steadying those who stumble can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual or moral support, akin to how Jesus is described as the Word who provides guidance and strength (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>). Historically, the role of a wise counselor was highly valued in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where oral tradition and spoken wisdom were primary means of teaching and support.<p><b>you have braced the knees that were buckling.</b><br>This phrase continues the metaphor of providing strength and support. The imagery of bracing knees suggests offering physical and emotional stability to those who are weak or faltering. In <a href="/isaiah/35-3.htm">Isaiah 35:3</a>, a similar exhortation is given: "Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees." This connection underscores a biblical theme of offering support to the weary and downtrodden. Culturally, the act of bracing or supporting someone was a sign of compassion and community responsibility. In a typological sense, this can be seen as a reflection of Christ's role as the one who strengthens and upholds believers, as seen in <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>, "I can do all things through him who strengthens me."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

His counsel lifted fellow believers who were faltering in faith or overwhelmed by hardship.<p>- Scripture consistently portrays timely, godly words as a stabilizing force:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Anxiety in a man&#8217;s heart weighs him down, but a kind word cheers him up&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/12-25.htm">Proverbs 12:25</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Gracious words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Therefore encourage one another and build each other up&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:11</a>).<p>- Job&#8217;s prior ministry of encouragement reflects the call every believer carries: to use speech that strengthens rather than weakens (<a href="/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a>).<p>- By highlighting Job&#8217;s former effectiveness, the verse sets the contrast for the chapters that follow&#8212;Job, once the encourager, now stands in need of encouragement himself (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-4.htm">2 Corinthians 1:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you have braced the knees that were buckling</b><p>- The image shifts from feet slipping to knees giving way, painting a fuller picture of total exhaustion. Job had been like a firm hand under the arms of weary saints.<p>- Isaiah employs the same metaphor: &#8220;Strengthen the weak hands and steady the feeble knees&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/35-3.htm">Isaiah 35:3</a>), a charge echoed in <a href="/hebrews/12-12.htm">Hebrews 12:12</a>. Job lived that charge before suffering struck.<p>- Practical ways Job had &#8220;braced the knees&#8221;:<p>&#8226; Sharing wisdom grounded in the fear of the LORD (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Intervening materially for the poor and destitute (<a href="/job/29-12.htm">Job 29:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Standing for justice when others were oppressed (<a href="/job/29-14.htm">Job 29:14&#8211;17</a>).<p>- The phrase also anticipates New Testament exhortations: &#8220;Bear one another&#8217;s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>). Job&#8217;s life modeled that principle long before Paul wrote it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/4-4.htm">Job 4:4</a> recalls a season when Job&#8217;s words and actions lifted the faltering and fortified the exhausted. Eliphaz acknowledges that God had used Job as a channel of strength&#8212;stabilizing stumbling feet and steadying shaking knees. The verse celebrates the power of godly encouragement, underscores our responsibility to uphold the weak, and sets the emotional groundwork for the book&#8217;s central tension: the encourager now needs encouragement, proving that even the strongest saints may one day rely on the compassion they once offered to others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy words have upholden him that was falling</span>.
