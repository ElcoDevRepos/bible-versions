In the context of Job, Leviathan symbolizes chaos and the untamable forces of nature, reflecting God's power over creation. The imagery of a chest as hard as a rock emphasizes the creature's invulnerability, suggesting that no human effort can subdue it. This can be seen as a metaphor for the trials and challenges that are beyond human control, pointing to the need for reliance on divine strength. The rock imagery is also reminiscent of God as a "rock" in other scriptures, symbolizing strength and protection (e.g., <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>).<p><b>as hard as a lower millstone!</b><br>The comparison to a lower millstone further emphasizes the creature's toughness. A lower millstone, used in grinding grain, was made of extremely hard stone to withstand constant friction and pressure. This analogy highlights the durability and resilience of Leviathan, suggesting that it is unyielding and unbreakable. In a broader sense, this can be seen as a reflection of God's unchanging nature and the steadfastness of His purposes. The millstone imagery also connects to other biblical passages where millstones symbolize judgment and destruction (e.g., <a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a>), reinforcing the idea of divine power and authority over all creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A righteous man tested by God through severe trials, including the loss of his wealth, health, and family.

Earlier the Lord said, &#8220;His rows of scales are his pride, tightly sealed together&#8221; (<a href="/job/41-15.htm">Job 41:15</a>); now He singles out the breastplate behind those scales.<p>&#8226; Scripture often connects the chest with the heart, the seat of life (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>). In Leviathan, the very place that ought to be vulnerable is fortified, highlighting how unreachable this monster is for any human weapon.<p>&#8226; Other biblical portraits echo this image of impenetrable armor: Goliath&#8217;s &#8220;coat of scale armor&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-5.htm">1 Samuel 17:5</a>), the demonic locusts whose &#8220;breastplates were like iron&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/9-9.htm">Revelation 9:9</a>), and the mythical Behemoth whose &#8220;bones are tubes of bronze&#8221; (<a href="/job/40-18.htm">Job 40:18</a>). Each scene underscores what God alone can master.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is as hard as a rock</b><p>&#8226; The comparison shifts from anatomy to geology. A rock, in Scripture, stands for durability and permanence (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-31.htm">Deuteronomy 32:31</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>). Saying Leviathan&#8217;s chest is rock-hard paints a creature impervious to spears, arrows, or human resolve.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word itself is &#8220;like a hammer that shatters rock&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/23-29.htm">Jeremiah 23:29</a>), reminding us that whatever humans deem undefeatable remains utterly breakable before the Lord who speaks.<p>&#8226; When Isaiah says, &#8220;I have set My face like flint&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/50-7.htm">Isaiah 50:7</a>), the prophet borrows the same imagery: unyielding resolve. Here, however, the stubborn hardness belongs to a beast that no person can break&#8212;again pushing Job to see the gulf between human strength and divine sovereignty (<a href="/job/40-9.htm">Job 40:9-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as hard as a lower millstone!</b><p>&#8226; The lower millstone was the heavier, stationary slab on which grain was crushed&#8212;an object famed for weight and resistance. Jesus later uses that same item to picture an inescapable burden (<a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a>); John sees it hurled into the sea to dramatize Babylon&#8217;s fall (<a href="/revelation/18-21.htm">Revelation 18:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Unlike the upper hand-turned stone, the lower millstone cannot be budged by ordinary muscle. Leviathan&#8217;s chest shares that immovability; any sword that strikes it will feel the rebound (<a href="/job/41-26.htm">Job 41:26</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/judges/9-53.htm">Judges 9:53</a> records a woman dropping an upper millstone that fatally wounded Abimelech. If the lighter stone could kill a warrior, how much more indomitable is a creature whose very flesh mimics the weight and solidity of the base stone itself?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/41-24.htm">Job 41:24</a> stacks images&#8212;breast, rock, lower millstone&#8212;to drive home a single point: Leviathan is built beyond human conquest. The verse magnifies the might of its Creator, who alone can probe what man cannot pierce. By displaying a chest harder than rock and millstone, God gently dismantles Job&#8217;s assumptions, calling him (and us) to revere the Lord who rules over every force, seen and unseen, and to rest in the certainty that nothing in creation rivals His power or slips from His control.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/41.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">His heart</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, his nature, his disposition.
