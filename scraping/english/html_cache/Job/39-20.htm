The comparison to a locust highlights the horse's ability to leap and move swiftly. In biblical times, locusts were known for their sudden and overwhelming presence, often used as a metaphor for armies (<a href="/joel/2-4.htm">Joel 2:4-5</a>). The horse's leaping can be seen as a symbol of power and readiness for battle, reflecting the might and control of God over creation. Horses were integral to warfare in ancient cultures, including the Egyptians and Assyrians, and their use in battle is frequently mentioned in the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/14-9.htm">Exodus 14:9</a>, <a href="/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28-29</a>).<p><b>striking terror with his proud snorting</b><br>The imagery of the horse's snorting conveys a sense of fearlessness and majesty. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the horse was a symbol of war and conquest, and its snorting could intimidate both enemies and onlookers. The proud snorting signifies confidence and strength, attributes that are often associated with divine power and authority. This can be connected to the broader theme of God's sovereignty and the awe-inspiring nature of His creation. The horse's role in battle, as seen in passages like <a href="/zechariah/10-3.htm">Zechariah 10:3</a>, underscores the idea of divine judgment and the execution of God's will through His creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, who undergoes severe trials and suffering.
