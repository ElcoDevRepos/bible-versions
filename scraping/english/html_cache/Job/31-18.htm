The reference to "from my youth" suggests a deep-seated moral foundation, indicating that Job's care for others was not a recent development but a consistent part of his character. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the role of a father was to provide, protect, and guide, which Job claims to have extended to those in need. This reflects the biblical principle of caring for the vulnerable, as seen in passages like <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>, which emphasizes looking after orphans and widows. Job's actions can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the Good Shepherd, caring for His flock with a father's love.<p><b>and from my mother&#8217;s womb I guided the widow&#8212;</b><br>The phrase "from my mother&#8217;s womb" is a hyperbolic expression indicating that Job's compassion was innate, almost as if it was part of his very nature from birth. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, widows were among the most vulnerable members of society, often lacking protection and provision. Job's claim to have "guided the widow" suggests he provided leadership, support, and advocacy for those who were marginalized. This aligns with the biblical mandate found in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>, where God is described as defending the cause of the widow. Job's actions prefigure the ministry of Jesus, who showed compassion to widows, such as in <a href="/luke/7-11.htm">Luke 7:11-15</a>, where He raises the widow's son at Nain, demonstrating His care and authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.
