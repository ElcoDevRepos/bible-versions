It implies that Job's knowledge is limited compared to God's eternal wisdom. The reference to "the first man" alludes to Adam, the first human created by God, as described in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>. This question underscores the theme of human limitations in understanding divine purposes, a central theme in the Book of Job. It also reflects the ancient Near Eastern belief in the wisdom of the ancients, suggesting that true wisdom comes from long experience and divine revelation, not from human presumption.<p><b>Were you brought forth before the hills?</b><br>This phrase uses poetic imagery to emphasize the antiquity and permanence of creation compared to human life. The "hills" symbolize the ancient and enduring aspects of the earth, often associated with stability and longevity. This imagery is reminiscent of <a href="/proverbs/8-25.htm">Proverbs 8:25</a>, where wisdom is personified and described as existing before the mountains and hills were formed. The question implies that Job's understanding is not as ancient or enduring as the creation itself, highlighting the vast difference between human and divine perspectives. This serves to remind readers of the eternal nature of God and His creation, contrasting with the temporal nature of human existence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Job&#8217;s friends argue that since Job is neither the first man nor the oldest, his assertions must be less reliable than traditional understanding.<p>&#8226; The point: human perspective is limited; only the Creator has absolute insight (<a href="/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13&#8211;14</a>; <a href="/romans/11-34.htm">Romans 11:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Were you brought forth before the hills?</b><p>&#8226; Eliphaz presses further (<a href="/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a>b), contrasting Job&#8217;s birth with the primordial &#8220;hills,&#8221; a poetic shorthand for creation&#8217;s earliest features (<a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>).<p>&#8226; By invoking terrain older than humanity, he underscores God&#8217;s eternal nature versus man&#8217;s temporal nature; see <a href="/proverbs/8-25.htm">Proverbs 8:25</a>, where wisdom says, &#8220;Before the hills, I was brought forth.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The logic: if Job did not exist before the mountains, he cannot lecture God on justice or suffering; his understanding is bound by time and space (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Eliphaz hopes to humble Job, steering him toward submission rather than debate (<a href="/job/5-8.htm">Job 5:8</a>; <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a> uses two vivid questions to humble Job: he was neither the original man nor older than the hills. Eliphaz argues that, because Job lacks primeval existence, he should defer to God&#8217;s timeless wisdom and the accumulated counsel of the faithful. The verse reminds us that our insight is finite, while God&#8217;s perspective is eternal and wholly trustworthy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Art thou the first man that was born?</span>--This is a retort upon <a href="/job/12-2.htm" title="No doubt but you are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.">Job 12:2</a>; <a href="/job/12-7.htm" title="But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach you; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell you:">Job 12:7</a>; <a href="/job/12-9.htm" title="Who knows not in all these that the hand of the LORD has worked this?">Job 12:9</a>, where Job had claimed equal knowledge for the inanimate creation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Art thou the first man that was born?</span> That is, "Dost thou claim to have the wisdom of that first human intelligence, which, proceeding direct from God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>), was without fault or flaw - a perfect intelligence, which judged all things aright?" It is not clear that Eliphaz had ever heard of Adam; but he evidently believed in a "first man," from whom all others were descended, and he attributed to this first man a mind and intellect surpassing those of all other men. His question is, of course, rather a scoff than an inquiry. He knows that Job makes no such foolish pretence; but he throws it in his teeth that, from what he has said, men might suppose he took some such view of himself. <span class="cmt_word">Or wast thou made before the hills?</span> This is a taunt of the same kind as the previous one, but intensified.
