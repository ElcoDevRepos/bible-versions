In ancient Near Eastern culture, burial in a valley was common, as valleys were fertile and symbolized rest and peace. The "clods" or soil being "sweet" indicates a harmonious return to the earth, reflecting the biblical theme of dust to dust (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>). This imagery contrasts with the suffering Job experiences, highlighting the irony of death being more comforting than life for the wicked. The sweetness of the earth may also symbolize the finality and equality of death, as all return to the ground regardless of their earthly status.<p><b>everyone follows behind him,</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the inevitability of death for all people. The imagery of a procession suggests a funeral, where mourners follow the deceased to their final resting place. It reflects the universal human experience of mortality, as echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:20</a>, where all return to dust. The phrase can also imply the influence or legacy of the deceased, as others continue in their path or remember their life. In a broader biblical context, it underscores the transient nature of life and the importance of living righteously, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>, which speaks of judgment after death.<p><b>and those before him are without number.</b><br>This phrase highlights the countless generations that have preceded the current one in death. It underscores the continuity of human existence and the vast history of humanity, where countless individuals have lived and died. This can be seen as a reminder of the brevity of life and the enduring nature of God's creation, as expressed in <a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10-12</a>, which encourages wisdom in numbering our days. The innumerable dead also point to the collective human experience of mortality, reinforcing the idea that death is the great equalizer. In a theological sense, it can be seen as a call to consider one's eternal destiny, as the multitude of those who have gone before serves as a testament to the certainty of death and the hope of resurrection through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and

Mean</div><b>The clods of the valley are sweet to him</b><p>&#8226; Job pictures the body settling peacefully beneath &#8220;the clods of the valley,&#8221; as though the very soil feels pleasant.<p>&#8226; The verse speaks literally of burial&#8212;earth covering the corpse&#8212;yet Job&#8217;s tone is ironic: even the wicked seem to rest undisturbed. Compare <a href="/job/3-17.htm">Job 3:17-19</a>, where &#8220;there the wicked cease from turmoil,&#8221; and <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>, which reminds us that all return to dust.<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;sweet&#8221; underscores that no immediate divine judgment appears at the grave. Instead of dread, there is quietness&#8212;echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:2-3</a>, where the same fate overtakes all.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Everyone follows behind him</b><p>&#8226; A large funeral cortege trails the casket, suggesting honor, public mourning, and respect&#8212;even for a life lived without fear of God.<p>&#8226; Job challenges his friends&#8217; assumption that visible blessings always track righteousness (cf. <a href="/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3-12</a>, where the psalmist envies the prosperity of the wicked).<p>&#8226; The scene mirrors historical burials of prominent men like Asa, who was laid in a magnificent tomb with spices (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-14.htm">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>). Outward ceremony can mask an unrepentant heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Those before him are without number</b><p>&#8226; Death&#8217;s procession is endless. Countless generations have already gone &#8220;before him&#8221;; he merely joins the multitude.<p>&#8226; The statement reinforces the universality of death (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>; <a href="/psalms/49-10.htm">Psalm 49:10</a>). Rich, poor, righteous, wicked&#8212;all face the same grave.<p>&#8226; Job uses this reality to argue that immediate circumstances are not the final measure of divine justice; ultimate accountability lies beyond this life (<a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>; <a href="/john/5-28.htm">John 5:28-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/21-33.htm">Job 21:33</a> observes that the wicked may enjoy a tranquil burial, complete with honor and a vast procession, joining the innumerable dead who have preceded them. Job&#8217;s point is straightforward: outward peace in death does not prove a life was pleasing to God. While the soil seems &#8220;sweet&#8221; and crowds mourn, real judgment awaits beyond the grave.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him.</span>--Death is robbed of its repulsiveness and horror, seeing that all will be glad to join in his funeral procession, and after him all men will draw (in endless procession), and before him they will be without number.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him</span>. In his mausoleum, by the side of the running stream, the very clods of the valley, wherein his tomb is placed, shall be sweet and pleasant to him - death thus losing half its terrors. <span class="cmt_word">And all men shall draw after him</span>. Some explain this of the lengthy funeral procession which follows his corpse to the grave, and take the next clause of the multitude, not forming part of the procession, who gather together at the tomb beforehand, waiting to see the obsequies; but, as Rosenmuller remarks, this explanation seems precluded by the previous mention of the funeral procession (ver 32), besides being otherwise unsatisfactory. The real reference is probably to the common topic of consolation implied in the "Omnes eodem cogimur" of Horace. He is happy in his death, or at any rate not unhappy, seeing that he only suffers the common fate. He will draw after him all future men, who will likewise inevitably perish, just as there are innumerable before him, who have travelled the same read and reached the same resting-place. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/21-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The clods</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1451;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ri&#7713;&#183;&#7687;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7263.htm">Strong's 7263: </a> </span><span class="str2">A clod (of earth)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the valley</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1445;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7717;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5158.htm">Strong's 5158: </a> </span><span class="str2">A stream, a winter torrent, a, valley, a shaft</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are sweet</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1469;&#1514;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#601;&#183;q&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4985.htm">Strong's 4985: </a> </span><span class="str2">To become or be sweet or pleasant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to him;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
