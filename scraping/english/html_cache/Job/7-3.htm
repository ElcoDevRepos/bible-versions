The term "allotted" suggests a predetermined portion, indicating Job's belief that his suffering is part of God's sovereign plan. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of divine providence, where human experiences, including suffering, are seen as part of a larger divine order. The "months of futility" highlight the prolonged nature of Job's suffering, emphasizing the endurance required in trials. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of enduring suffering, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures like Joseph and David, who also experienced extended periods of hardship before deliverance.<p><b>and nights of misery are appointed to me</b><br>The "nights of misery" suggest a time of darkness and restlessness, contrasting with the expected peace of nighttime. In the ancient world, nighttime was often associated with fear and uncertainty, as it was a time when people were most vulnerable. Job's reference to "nights" underscores the relentless nature of his suffering, affecting both day and night. The use of "appointed" implies a sense of inevitability and divine orchestration, reinforcing the idea that Job's trials are not random but part of a divine purpose. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the New Testament understanding of suffering, where believers are encouraged to find hope in God's ultimate plan, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>, which assures that all things work together for good for those who love God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

"Months of vanity" are "months of which he can make no use " - "months which are no good to him." It has been concluded from this theft some considerable time had elapsed since Job was stricken by his disease. But he is perhaps looking to the future as much as to the past, anticipating a long, lingering illness. Elephantiasis is a disease which often lasts for years<span class="cmt_word">. And wearisome nights are appointed to me</span>. To one stretched on a bed of sickness, the night is always more wearisome than the day. It has no changes, nothing to mark its flight. It seems almost interminable. In elephantiasis, however, it is a special feature of the disease that the sufferings of the patient are greatest at night. "In <span class="accented">elephantiasis ansesthetica</span>" says Dr. Erasmus Wilson, "a sense of dulness and heat pervades the surface, and there are sensations of tingling and prickling, and of burning heat. While the integument is insensible, there are deep-seated burning pains, sometimes of a bone or joint, sometimes of the vertebral column. <span class="accented">These pains are greatest at night</span>; <span class="accented">they prevent sleep</span>, <span class="accented">and give rise to restlessness and frightful dreams"</span> (Quain's 'Dictionary of Medicine,' vol. 1. p. 817). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/7-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3651.htm">Strong's 3651: </a> </span><span class="str2">So -- thus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I am allotted</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1443;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#7717;al&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hofal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5157.htm">Strong's 5157: </a> </span><span class="str2">To inherit, to occupy, to bequeath, distribute, instate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">months</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1495;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(yar&#183;&#7717;&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3391.htm">Strong's 3391: </a> </span><span class="str2">A lunation, month</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of futility,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1425;&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7723.htm">Strong's 7723: </a> </span><span class="str2">Evil, idolatry, uselessness</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and nights</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1500;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#234;&#183;l&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
