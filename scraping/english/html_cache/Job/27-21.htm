In the context of Job, it symbolizes the sudden and overwhelming calamity that befalls the wicked. The east wind is mentioned in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/exodus/10-13.htm">Exodus 10:13</a>, where it brings the plague of locusts upon Egypt, and in <a href="/jeremiah/18-17.htm">Jeremiah 18:17</a>, where it represents God's judgment on His people. The imagery of the east wind carrying someone away suggests a forceful and inescapable removal, emphasizing the powerlessness of the wicked against divine judgment.<p><b>and he is gone</b><br>This phrase underscores the finality and completeness of the judgment. The wicked are not merely displaced; they are utterly removed from their position and influence. This reflects the biblical theme of the transience of life and the futility of wickedness, as seen in <a href="/psalms/37-10.htm">Psalm 37:10</a>, where the wicked are described as being no more. The phrase also echoes the idea of divine retribution, where the wicked face consequences that are both swift and irreversible.<p><b>it sweeps him out of his place</b><br>The imagery of being swept away suggests a thorough and decisive action. In the ancient Near Eastern context, one's place was not just a physical location but also a symbol of status, security, and identity. To be swept out of one's place indicates a total loss of these elements. This can be connected to the broader biblical narrative of God's sovereignty and justice, where He uproots the wicked and establishes the righteous, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/2-22.htm">Proverbs 2:22</a>. The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and separation of the wicked from the presence of God, a theme that is further developed in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and patience who endures immense suffering and loss.
