In the context of the Book of Job, Job feels that God has handed him over to those who do not uphold justice. This sentiment echoes the experiences of other biblical figures who felt forsaken, such as Joseph, who was sold into slavery by his brothers (<a href="/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>), and David, who was pursued by King Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/24-11.htm">1 Samuel 24:11</a>). Theologically, this phrase can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's own experience, as He was delivered to the hands of unjust men during His trial and crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/26-45.htm">Matthew 26:45-50</a>). The term "unjust men" highlights the moral corruption and lack of righteousness in those who now have power over Job, contrasting with the justice and righteousness of God.<p><b>He has thrown me to the clutches of the wicked.</b><br>Here, Job describes his situation as being cast into the grasp of those who are morally corrupt and evil. The imagery of being "thrown" suggests a forceful and deliberate action, emphasizing Job's feeling of being completely at the mercy of malevolent forces. This can be compared to the experiences of the Israelites, who often found themselves oppressed by wicked nations (<a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>). The "clutches of the wicked" can also be seen as a type of spiritual warfare, where the righteous are besieged by evil, a theme that is prevalent throughout Scripture (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>). In a prophetic sense, this phrase can be related to the suffering of Christ, who was surrounded by wickedness and yet overcame it through His resurrection, offering hope to believers who face similar trials.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Yet Job also feels abandoned to the merciless judgment of his three friends, whose counsel intensifies his pain (<a href="/job/16-2.htm">Job 16:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/109-4.htm">Psalm 109:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; Though their accusations are wrong, Job sees God allowing their presence. Scripture consistently affirms that the Lord sometimes uses even unrighteous people to fulfill larger purposes, as with Joseph&#8217;s brothers (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>) or Assyria (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s lament anticipates the greater Sufferer: Jesus was &#8220;handed over to sinful men&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-7.htm">Luke 24:7</a>) even though He was perfectly righteous. This parallel reminds believers that suffering under injustice may align us with Christ (<a href="/1_peter/2-19.htm">1 Peter 2:19&#8211;23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He has thrown me to the clutches of the wicked</b><p>&#8226; Job moves from &#8220;delivered&#8221; to &#8220;thrown,&#8221; an image of being hurled defenseless into enemy hands. He feels violently exposed, like Daniel cast into the lions&#8217; den (<a href="/daniel/6-16.htm">Daniel 6:16</a>) or Jeremiah lowered into the cistern (<a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;The wicked&#8221; includes the cosmic adversary who struck his body with boils (<a href="/job/2-7.htm">Job 2:7</a>). While Satan acts with malice, God sets the limits, proving that even demonic hostility cannot move outside divine boundaries (<a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s words echo the psalmist: &#8220;Do not deliver me to the will of my foes&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/27-12.htm">Psalm 27:12</a>). The plea underlines a believer&#8217;s confidence that God controls the length and depth of every trial (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>).<p>&#8226; For readers, the verse teaches:<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s approval is not withdrawn because circumstances turn hostile (<a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31&#8211;39</a>).<p>&#8211; Righteous people may endure seasons where it appears God has &#8220;thrown&#8221; them away, yet His covenant love remains (<a href="/lamentations/3-31.htm">Lamentations 3:31&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8211; Suffering can be a stage where God&#8217;s vindication eventually shines brighter, as it did for Job (<a href="/job/42-12.htm">Job 42:12</a>) and supremely for Jesus in His resurrection (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23&#8211;24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/16-11.htm">Job 16:11</a> portrays a faithful servant acknowledging that the Almighty has allowed him to be delivered into unjust, even wicked, hands. The verse affirms God&#8217;s unchallenged sovereignty, the reality of undeserved suffering, and the certainty that such hardship fits within God&#8217;s righteous plan. Believers can rest assured that no hostile power can ultimately thwart God&#8217;s purposes or separate them from His steadfast love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">The ungodly </span>and <span class= "bld">the wicked </span>are the terms he retorts upon his friends, and they have certainly earned them.

All that Job had suffered at the hands of wicked men, the gibes of his "comforters," the insults and "derision ' of "base men" (<a href="/job/30-1.htm">Job 30:1, 8-10</a>), the desertion of many who might have been expected to have come to his aid, being by God's per-minion, is attributed by Job to God himself, who has "delivered" him up to these "ungodly" ones, and permits them to add to and intensify his sufferings. He was not so ruthlessly treated as his great Anti-type; he was not bound with thongs, or crowned with thorns, or smitten with a reed, or scourged, or crucified - even the smiting on the cheek, spoken of in ver. 10, was probably metaphorical; but he suffered, no doubt, grievously, through the scorn and contumely that assailed him, through his friends' unkindness, and his enimies' insolent triumph, and the rude jeers of the "<span class="accented">abjeets</span>" who made him their "song" and their "byword" (<a href="/job/30-9.htm">Job 30:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And turned me over into the hands of the wicked</span>. Job speaks as if God had wholly given him up, made him over to the wicked, to deal with him exactly as they chose. This, of course, was not so. If the malevolence of Satan was limited by the Divine will (<a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>; <a href="/job/2-6.htm">Job 2:6</a>); so, much more, would the malevolence of man be limited. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/16-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1453;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_410.htm">Strong's 410: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strength -- as adjective, mighty, the Almighty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has delivered me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1461;&#1443;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(yas&#183;g&#238;&#183;r&#234;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124;
