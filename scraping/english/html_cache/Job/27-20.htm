In biblical context, floods often symbolize chaos and judgment, as seen in the story of Noah (Genesis 6-9). The imagery of a flood conveys the idea of inescapable and consuming disaster. In the ancient Near East, floods were common and could devastate entire regions, making this a powerful metaphor for divine judgment. Theologically, this can be seen as a reflection of the consequences of wickedness, aligning with the broader themes of retribution found in the wisdom literature of the Bible.<p><b>a tempest sweeps him away in the night.</b><br>The tempest, or violent storm, is another symbol of divine judgment and power. In the Bible, storms often represent God's might and the suddenness of His actions, as seen in the story of Jonah (<a href="/jonah/1-4.htm">Jonah 1:4</a>). The mention of "night" adds an element of unexpectedness and vulnerability, as night is often associated with danger and uncertainty. This phrase can be connected to the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over creation and His ability to bring about justice in His timing. The imagery of a storm also foreshadows the New Testament account of Jesus calming the storm (<a href="/mark/4-35.htm">Mark 4:35-41</a>), highlighting His authority over nature and chaos.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man described as blameless and upright, who fears God and shuns evil.

He fears the vengeance of these whom he has oppressed and injured, the loss of his prosperity at any moment by a reverse of fortune, and a final retribution at the hand of God commensurate with his ill desert.
