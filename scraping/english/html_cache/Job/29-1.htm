This section marks the beginning of Job's final monologue before God responds. The term "discourse" indicates a formal and structured speech, suggesting Job's intent to present a well-reasoned argument or reflection. In the context of the Book of Job, this discourse is part of a series of speeches where Job defends his integrity and laments his suffering. Historically, the setting is in the land of Uz, a region whose exact location is uncertain but is often associated with Edom or northern Arabia. This geographical context places Job in a setting familiar with patriarchal traditions, similar to those of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The cultural context of the time valued wisdom and the ability to articulate one's thoughts, which is evident in Job's eloquent speeches. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of perseverance in faith amidst trials, as seen in <a href="/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>, which references Job's endurance. Job's discourse can be seen as a type of Christ in that both Job and Jesus experienced intense suffering and maintained their integrity, ultimately leading to a greater revelation of God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

The present chapter is concerned only with the former period; and gives a graphic description of the life led, in Job's time and country, by a great chieftain, the head of a tribe, not of mere nomads, but of perseus who had attained to a considerable amount of civilization. The picture is one primitive in its features, but not rude or coarse. It is entirely un-Jewish, and has its nearest parallel in some of the early Egyptian records, as the Stele of Beka, and the Instructions of Amen-em-hat ('Records of the Past,' vol. 2. pp. 11-16; vol. 10. pp. 7-10). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover Job continued his parable, and said</span> (see the comment on Job 27:1). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/29-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Again, Job</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1453;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_347.htm">Strong's 347: </a> </span><span class="str2">Job -- a patriarch</span><br /><br /><span class="word">continued</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1505;&#1462;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;sep&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3254.htm">Strong's 3254: </a> </span><span class="str2">To add, augment</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his discourse</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;l&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4912.htm">Strong's 4912: </a> </span><span class="str2">A pithy maxim, a simile</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and said:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1463;&#1469;&#1512;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/job/29-1.htm">Job 29:1 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/job/29-1.htm">Job 29:1 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/job/29-1.htm">Job 29:1 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/job/29-1.htm">Job 29:1 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/job/29-1.htm">Job 29:1 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/job/29-1.htm">Job 29:1  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/job/29-1.htm">Job 29:1 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/job/29-1.htm">Job 29:1 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/job/29-1.htm">Job 29:1 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/job/29-1.htm">Job 29:1 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/job/29-1.htm">OT Poetry: Job 29:1 Job again took up his parable (Jb) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/job/28-28.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Job 28:28"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Job 28:28" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/job/29-2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Job 29:2"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Job 29:2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
