In the context of the Book of Job, Job is responding to the intense suffering he has endured, which includes the loss of his wealth, health, and children. The use of "He" refers to God, whom Job perceives as the source of his trials. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern belief in divine sovereignty over all aspects of life, including suffering. Job's exhaustion is both physical and emotional, highlighting the human condition of reaching the limits of endurance. This sentiment is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/6-6.htm">Psalm 6:6</a>, where the psalmist expresses a similar sense of being worn out by grief.<p><b>You have devastated all my family.</b><br>Here, Job laments the complete destruction of his family, which is a central theme in his suffering. Historically, family was the cornerstone of social and economic life in the ancient Near East, and the loss of family members was not only a personal tragedy but also a social and economic catastrophe. Job's statement underscores the totality of his loss, as he had lost all his children in a single calamity (<a href="/job/1-18.htm">Job 1:18-19</a>). This devastation is a poignant reminder of the fragility of human life and the suddenness with which disaster can strike. Theologically, this phrase can be seen as a foreshadowing of the suffering of Jesus Christ, who also experienced abandonment and loss, fulfilling the role of the suffering servant as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Almighty, whom Job addresses in his lament, expressing his feelings of being overwhelmed and devastated.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_family.htm">Job's Family</a></b><br>Refers to Job's children and household, who have been tragically lost, contributing to Job's deep sense of loss and exhaustion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_friends.htm">Job's Friends</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are present in the account, offering misguided counsel and adding to Job's distress.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_uz.htm">The Land of Uz</a></b><br>The setting of Job's account, a place of ancient wisdom and prosperity, now a backdrop to Job's suffering.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_suffering.htm">Understanding Suffering</a></b><br>Suffering is a part of the human experience, and even the righteous, like Job, are not exempt from it.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/expressing_lament.htm">Expressing Lament</a></b><br>It is biblical to express our pain and confusion to God.

Earlier he asked, &#8220;What strength do I have, that I should still hope?&#8221; (<a href="/job/6-11.htm">Job 6:11</a>). Now he declares that strength is gone.<p>- The cry echoes David&#8217;s lament, &#8220;I am numb and badly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/38-8.htm">Psalm 38:8</a>), and Paul&#8217;s later testimony, &#8220;We were under great pressure... so that we despaired of life itself&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>).<p>- Job&#8217;s words affirm that even the hardest blows come under God&#8217;s sovereign allowance. He does not accuse God of injustice; he confesses what he feels: total weariness under divine weight (<a href="/job/9-18.htm">Job 9:18</a>).<p>- For readers, the verse validates seasons when believers feel spent. Scripture does not minimize pain; it records it honestly while pointing to the Lord who sustains (<a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have devastated all my family</b><p>- Job recalls the sudden loss of his children (<a href="/job/1-18.htm">Job 1:18-19</a>) and the estrangement of remaining relatives (<a href="/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13-14</a>). &#8220;Devastated&#8221; underscores the completeness of the blow&#8212;nothing is left untouched.<p>- Though the Sabeans, Chaldeans, fire, and wind were the immediate agents (<a href="/job/1-13.htm">Job 1:13-19</a>), Job sees behind secondary causes to God&#8217;s overarching rule (<a href="/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-37.htm">Lamentations 3:37-38</a>).<p>- Such devastation mirrors later laments: &#8220;You have made us a byword among the nations&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/44-13.htm">Psalm 44:13</a>) and foreshadows Christ&#8217;s solitary suffering when His disciples scattered (<a href="/matthew/26-31.htm">Matthew 26:31</a>).<p>- Job&#8217;s candid statement shows that faith does not deny wounds. It brings them into conversation with God, trusting Him with the hardest realities (<a href="/psalms/62-8.htm">Psalm 62:8</a>).<p>- The verse reminds believers that losses&#8212;family, relationships, community&#8212;may be severe, yet the Lord who permits them also promises ultimate restoration (<a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10-13</a>; <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/16-7.htm">Job 16:7</a> captures a double lament: utter personal exhaustion and the shattering of family life. Job traces both realities to God&#8217;s sovereign hand, not to accuse but to lay his anguish before the only One who can redeem it. The verse validates deep sorrow while pointing to a God who remains in control, invites honest lament, and ultimately restores what is broken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">But now he hath made me weary.</span>--He turns again, in his passionate plaint, to God, whom he alternately speaks of in the third person and addresses in the second.
