In the context of Job, Elihu is speaking about God's justice and His ability to make known the deeds of individuals. This aligns with the biblical theme that God is omniscient and aware of all human actions (<a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>). The idea of God revealing deeds is also seen in the prophetic literature, where God often sends prophets to call out the sins of the people (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>). This divine revelation serves as a call to repentance and a reminder of accountability before God.<p><b>and how arrogantly they have transgressed</b><br>The term "arrogantly" highlights the pride and self-sufficiency that often accompany sin. In biblical history, arrogance is frequently condemned as it leads individuals away from reliance on God (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). The transgression here refers to a willful violation of God's laws, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture. This phrase echoes the warnings given to Israel about the dangers of pride and disobedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-14.htm">Deuteronomy 8:14</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus Christ addresses the issue of arrogance and self-righteousness, particularly in His interactions with the Pharisees (<a href="/matthew/23-12.htm">Matthew 23:12</a>). The call to humility and repentance is central to the Christian message, emphasizing the need for a contrite heart before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A righteous man tested by God through severe trials, including loss of wealth, health, and family.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elihu.htm">Elihu</a></b><br>A younger friend of Job who speaks in chapters 32-37, offering a perspective on suffering and God's justice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who allows Job's testing and ultimately restores him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_friends.htm">Job's Friends</a></b><br>Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, who argue that Job's suffering is due to his sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_heavenly_court.htm">The Heavenly Court</a></b><br>The setting in the prologue where God permits Satan to test Job.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_revelation_of_sin.htm">God's Revelation of Sin</a></b><br>God, in His justice and mercy, reveals our transgressions not to condemn us but to lead us to repentance and restoration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_discipline.htm">The Purpose of Discipline</a></b><br>Divine discipline is a tool for growth and correction, intended to bring us back into alignment with God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_before_god.htm">Humility Before God</a></b><br>Recognizing our arrogance and transgressions should lead us to humility and a deeper reliance on God's grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_suffering.htm">The Role of Suffering</a></b><br>Suffering can be a means through which God communicates deeper truths about our character and His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>Acknowledging our sins is the first step toward experiencing God's forgiveness and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Job_36_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Job 36:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Job_36_9_God_s_purpose_in_revealing_sin.htm">How does Job 36:9 reveal God's purpose in showing people their transgressions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_divine_discipline_show_God_s_justice.htm">What role does divine discipline play in understanding God's justice in Job 36:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Job_36_9_aid_in_repentance.htm">How can Job 36:9 guide us in confessing and repenting from sin?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Job_36_9_Heb_12_6_God_s_discipline_link.htm">How does Job 36:9 connect with Hebrews 12:6 about God's discipline?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Job_36_9_lessons_daily.htm">How can we apply the lessons of Job 36:9 in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Job_36_9_God_s_justice_human_suffering.htm">What does Job 36:9 reveal about God's justice and human suffering?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Job_36_9_s_take_on_divine_discipline.htm">How does Job 36:9 challenge our understanding of divine discipline?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Job_36_9_discuss_sin_repentance.htm">In what ways does Job 36:9 address the concept of sin and repentance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_job_36.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Job 36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_verbal_plenary_inspiration.htm">How were Old Testament saints saved before Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_job_14_4_align_with_atonement.htm">In Job 14:4, how can anyone be made pure from something impure without contradicting other biblical texts about atonement and redemption?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_do_greedy_exploiters_thrive_unpunished.htm">If Job 20:19-20 suggests a direct correlation between greed and swift downfall, why do some wealthy exploiters seem to thrive indefinitely without facing apparent divine retribution?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_is_job_both_wicked_and_blameless.htm">In Job 22:5, Eliphaz accuses Job of great wickedness, yet Job 1:1 calls him blameless; how do we resolve this apparent contradiction?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Job 36:9 Mean</div><b>He tells them</b><p>God is not silent.

God, by his chastisements, makes men see what has been faulty in their life's work, in what respects they have been negligent, where they have lapsed into actual sin. Signal afflictions are a call to men to "consider their ways," and search out the nature of their offences. Some afflictions, as sickness and imprisonment, by depriving men of active employment, almost force them to engage in such a retrospect. <span class="cmt_word">And their transgressions that they have exceeded</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and their transgressions</span> <span class="accented">wherein they have behaved themselves proudly</span> (compare the Revised Version). In all sin, as it is a contempt of God's Law, there is an element of pride.
