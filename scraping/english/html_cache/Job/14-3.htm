In the context of Job's suffering, he questions why God would focus His attention on frail and flawed humanity. This echoes <a href="/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a>, where David marvels at God's mindfulness of man. The rhetorical question suggests Job's feeling of insignificance and vulnerability under divine observation. Historically, this reflects the ancient Near Eastern belief in a deity's omniscience and involvement in human affairs. Theologically, it raises questions about God's justice and mercy, themes central to the book of Job.<p><b>Will You bring him into judgment before You?</b><br>Here, Job questions the fairness of divine judgment on a being as fragile as man. This reflects the broader theme of theodicy in the book, where Job grapples with understanding God's justice amidst his suffering. The phrase suggests a courtroom setting, common in biblical literature, where God is the judge. This connects to passages like <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>, which speaks of God bringing every deed into judgment. It also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as the ultimate judge and advocate, as seen in <a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22 and 1</a> <a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1</a>, providing a type of Christ who intercedes for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man described as blameless and upright, who feared God and shunned evil.

Despite that fragility, God&#8217;s eyes remain on each person (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, the truth that God looks intently upon us brings both comfort and accountability. It assures us that no sorrow or injustice escapes His notice (<a href="/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>), and it reminds us that hidden sins are never hidden from Him (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The literal accuracy of these passages underscores God&#8217;s personal involvement with every individual. His watchful care is not symbolic; it is an ever-present reality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will You bring him into judgment before You?</b><p>&#8226; Job moves from God&#8217;s watchfulness to God&#8217;s courtroom. Knowing God sees all, Job asks whether that all-seeing eye will summon him to answer for every transgression. <a href="/psalms/143-2.htm">Psalm 143:2</a> echoes this: &#8220;Do not bring Your servant into judgment, for no one alive is righteous before You.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently teaches a real, future judgment. &#8220;God will bring every deed into judgment&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>), and &#8220;each of us will give an account of himself to God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>). Job&#8217;s question reflects that sober reality.<p>&#8226; Human righteousness cannot stand unassisted before a holy Judge (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>). Job senses the need for an Advocate, anticipating the Redeemer he later affirms: &#8220;I know that my Redeemer lives&#8221; (<a href="/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25</a>).<p>&#8226; For New-Covenant readers the answer is clear: judgment is certain, yet those who trust the risen Christ stand &#8220;justified by His blood&#8221; (<a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>). The same God who sees all has provided the way to stand blameless before Him (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Taking the verse literally urges believers to live in reverent obedience, knowing they will &#8220;receive what is due&#8221; for deeds done in the body (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>), while resting in the finished work of the Savior.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/job/14-3.htm">Job 14:3</a> joins wonder and trembling: the Creator fixes His eyes on fragile mortals, and that searching gaze leads inevitably to divine judgment.
