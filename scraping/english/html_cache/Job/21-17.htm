The imagery of a lamp being extinguished suggests the end of life or the cessation of prosperity. In the context of Job, this question challenges the assumption that the wicked always face immediate judgment. The "lamp" of the wicked being put out is a metaphor for their eventual downfall, but Job questions the frequency and timing of this event. This reflects the broader theme of theodicy in the book, where the righteous suffer while the wicked seem to prosper. The imagery is also seen in <a href="/proverbs/13-9.htm">Proverbs 13:9</a>, where the light of the righteous rejoices, but the lamp of the wicked will be put out, indicating eventual divine justice.<p><b>Does disaster come upon them?</b><br>This phrase questions the immediate retribution of the wicked. In the cultural and historical context of the Ancient Near East, there was a prevalent belief in retributive justice, where good was rewarded, and evil was punished swiftly. Job's rhetorical question challenges this belief, as he observes that the wicked often live in peace and prosperity without immediate disaster. This is a central theme in Job, contrasting with the views of his friends who insist that suffering is a direct result of personal sin. The question also echoes the sentiments found in <a href="/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, where the psalmist struggles with the prosperity of the wicked.<p><b>Does God, in His anger, apportion destruction?</b><br>This phrase addresses the role of divine justice and the timing of God's judgment. The concept of God apportioning destruction in His anger suggests a deliberate and measured response to wickedness. However, Job's experience and observations lead him to question the consistency and timing of this divine retribution. Theologically, this raises questions about God's sovereignty and justice, themes that are explored throughout the book. The idea of God apportioning destruction is also seen in prophetic literature, such as in <a href="/isaiah/13-9.htm">Isaiah 13:9</a>, where God's wrath leads to the destruction of the wicked. This phrase invites reflection on the nature of divine justice and the mystery of God's timing in dealing with human sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and patience who undergoes severe trials and questions the justice of God in the face of suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>A general term used to describe those who live in opposition to God's ways, often experiencing temporary prosperity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who is questioned by Job regarding the justice and timing of His judgments.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/disaster_and_destruction.htm">Disaster and Destruction</a></b><br>Events or outcomes that are seen as divine retribution or judgment upon the wicked.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/job's_friends.htm">Job's Friends</a></b><br>Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, who argue that suffering is a direct result of personal sin, a view Job challenges.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_mystery_of_divine_justice.htm">The Mystery of Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's timing and methods of justice are often beyond human understanding.

A &#8220;lamp&#8221; pictures a person&#8217;s life, influence, and prosperity (cf. <a href="/proverbs/13-9.htm">Proverbs 13:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-28.htm">Psalm 18:28</a>). Job has watched many godless people:<p>&#8226; Their &#8220;lamp&#8221; seems to burn steadily, sometimes brighter than that of the righteous.<p>&#8226; He challenges the easy formula of Bildad in <a href="/job/18-5.htm">Job 18:5-6</a> that the wicked are snuffed out quickly.<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a> echoes the same tension&#8212;Asaph sees arrogant people &#8220;always at ease,&#8221; yet knows their end will be sudden ruin.<p>Job is not denying God&#8217;s justice; he is exposing how rare immediate retribution appears on the ground. Scripture confirms that, while the lamp of the wicked will be extinguished, it is not always on our timetable (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Does disaster come upon them?</b><p>&#8220;Disaster&#8221; speaks of calamity, loss, or sudden reversal. Job&#8217;s friends insist these blows fall swiftly and predictably on evildoers; Job says, &#8220;Look around&#8212;how often?&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a> voices the same complaint: the wicked thrive, plant, and bear fruit.<p>&#8226; <a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a> wonders why God seems to tolerate wrongdoers without immediate catastrophe.<p>&#8226; Yet <a href="/proverbs/1-26.htm">Proverbs 1:26-27</a> warns that disaster will eventually &#8220;overtake&#8221; those who refuse wisdom.<p>The lesson: God&#8217;s timing may differ from human expectations. Disaster is certain but not always scheduled for public display in every earthly lifetime.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Does God, in His anger, apportion destruction?</b><p>Job acknowledges divine wrath and final judgment; his issue is with its apparent delay.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a> assures that the impenitent are &#8220;storing up wrath&#8221; for a revealed day of judgment.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9-10</a> explains the delay as mercy, not indifference; destruction will arrive like a thief.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a> shows the ultimate &#8220;portion&#8221; of destruction in the lake of fire.<p>Thus, even when temporal justice seems uneven, eternal justice is unwavering. God does not forget or overlook sin; He allots precise and righteous recompense.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Job&#8217;s threefold question pushes back against the simplistic idea that bad things always and promptly happen to bad people. The lamp of the wicked will be put out, disaster will come, and God will apportion destruction&#8212;but often later than human observers expect. Scripture guarantees eventual, perfect justice, reminding believers to trust God&#8217;s timing, remain patient, and keep an eternal perspective when present circumstances seem upside-down.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/job/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">How oft is the candle of the wicked put out?</span>--This and the following verse are either a concession on the part of Job, as much as to say, "I admit that it is as you say with the wicked;" or else they should be read interrogatively, "How often is it that we do see this? "<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How oft is the candle of the wicked put out?</span> This is not an exclamation, but a question, and is well rendered in the Revised Version, "How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out?" Is not the signal downfall of the wicked prosperous man a comparatively rare occur-fence? How oft cometh their destruction upon them*. When the problem here propounded came before Asaph, he seems to have solved it by the supposition that in all cases retribution visited the wicked in this life, and that they were cast down from their prosperity. "I went," he says, "into the sanctuary of God; then understood I the end of these men. Surely thou didst set them in slippery places; thou castedst them down into destruction. How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors. As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image" (<a href="/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17-20</a>). Job maintains that such a catastrophe happens but seldom, and that for the most part the wicked go down to the grave in peace. God distributeth sorrows in his anger. This is hot an independent clause. The sense runs on: <span class="accented">How off is it that the candle of the wicked is put out</span> <span class="accented">and that destruction cometh upon them</span> <span class="accented">and God showers sorrows upon them in his anger</span>?
