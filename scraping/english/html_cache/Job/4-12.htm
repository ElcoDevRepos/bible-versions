In the context of the Book of Job, this reflects the nature of divine communication, which can often be mysterious and not immediately understood. The idea of receiving a word secretly suggests a personal and intimate encounter with the divine, reminiscent of how God often communicated with prophets in the Old Testament, such as with Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/19-12.htm">1 Kings 19:12</a>, where God speaks in a "gentle whisper." This also highlights the theme of divine wisdom being hidden and only revealed to those whom God chooses, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/25-2.htm">Proverbs 25:2</a>.<p><b>my ears caught a whisper of it.</b><br>The imagery of a whisper suggests something faint and easily missed, requiring attentiveness and discernment to understand. This aligns with the biblical theme that God's voice can be subtle and requires a heart attuned to His presence, as seen in <a href="/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>, "Be still, and know that I am God." The whisper can also symbolize the elusive nature of understanding divine purposes, a central theme in the Book of Job, where human wisdom is contrasted with God's infinite understanding. This phrase may also evoke the idea of revelation being progressive, where full understanding is not immediate but unfolds over time, similar to how Jesus often spoke in parables, requiring listeners to seek deeper meaning (<a href="/matthew/13-10.htm">Matthew 13:10-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

Eliphaz is claiming a similar authority.<p>&#8226; At the same time, the wider narrative reminds us that not every claimed revelation is sound&#8212;God later says Eliphaz &#8220;has not spoken rightly&#8221; (<a href="/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7</a>). The verse is therefore recorded accurately, yet discerning readers must weigh it against the fullness of God&#8217;s revelation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Came to me</b><p>&#8226; The wording stresses personal reception: the message was not general but directed to Eliphaz himself, echoing individual callings like Samuel&#8217;s (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>) or Isaiah&#8217;s (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Personal encounters with God can shape one&#8217;s theology deeply, for better or worse.

It was night, and he had fallen asleep, when suddenly he was, or seemed to himself to be, awake. A horrible fear came over him, and all his limbs trembled and quaked. Then a spirit seemed to pass before his face, while every hair on his body rose up and stiffened with horror. It did not simply pass across him, but stood still, in a formless form, which he could see but not clearly distinguish. There was a deep hush. Then out of the silence there seemed to come a voice, a whisper, which articulated solemn words. "Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man," etc.? Supernatural visitations were vouchsafed by God to many besides the chosen people - to Laban, when he pursued Jacob (<a href="/genesis/31-24.htm">Genesis 31:24</a>), to Abimelech (<a href="/genesis/20-6.htm">Genesis 20:6</a>), to the Pharaoh of the time of Joseph (<a href="/genesis/41-1.htm">Genesis 41:1-7</a>), to his chief butler (<a href="/genesis/40-9.htm">Genesis 40:9-11</a>), and his chief baker (<a href="/genesis/40-16.htm">Genesis 40:16, 17</a>), to Balaam the son of Beer (<a href="/numbers/22-12.htm">Numbers 22:12, 20</a>; <a href="/numbers/23-5.htm">Numbers 23:5-10, 16-24</a>; <a href="/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3-9, 15-24</a>), to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28-35</a>; <a href="/daniel/4-1.htm">Daniel 4:1-32</a>), and others. The method and manner of these visitations raise a multitude of questions which it is impossible to answer, but are convincing evidence to all who believe Scripture to be true, that communications can pass between the spiritual and material worlds of a strange and mysterious character. The communication to Eliphaz may have been a mere vision, impressed upon his mind in sleep, or it may have been actually brought to him by a spiritual messenger, whom he could dimly see, and whose voice he was privileged to hear. Modern pseudo-science pronounces such seeing and hearing to be impossible. But poets are often clearer-sighted than scientists, and Shakespeare utters a pregnant truth when he says - <p><span class="accented">"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,<br />Than are dreamt of in your philosophy."</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now a thing was secretly brought to me</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a word</span> (or, <span class="accented">a message</span>) <span class="accented">was brought to me stealthily. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And mine ear received a little thereof</span>; rather, a <span class="accented">whisper</span> thereof (see the Revised Version, and comp. <a href="/job/26-14.htm">Job 26:14</a>, and the Vulgate, which gives <span class="accented">susurrus</span>). As the form of the vision was not distinct to Eliphaz's eyes (ver. 16), so neither were the words which were uttered distinct to his ears. He thinks himself able, however, to give the sense of them (see vers. 17-21). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/4-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now a word</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came to me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1453;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;lay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
