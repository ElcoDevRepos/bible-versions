In the ancient Near Eastern context, water was often seen as chaotic and uncontrollable, yet here it is depicted as being contained by God. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages that describe God's power over the natural world, such as <a href="/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>, where God is said to "lay the beams of His chambers on the waters." The act of wrapping waters in clouds can also be seen as a metaphor for God's provision and protection, as clouds often bring rain, which is essential for life. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God as the sustainer of creation.<p><b>yet the clouds do not burst under their own weight</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the miraculous nature of God's creation. Despite the immense weight of the water, the clouds do not collapse, illustrating God's wisdom and design. This can be connected to the idea of divine order in creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God brings order out of chaos. The stability of the clouds can also be seen as a metaphor for God's faithfulness and reliability, as He maintains the balance of nature. This imagery is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/jeremiah/10-13.htm">Jeremiah 10:13</a>, which speaks of God bringing forth the wind from His storehouses, further emphasizing His control over the elements.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man known for his patience and faithfulness amidst suffering.

God gathers and restrains it.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/33-7.htm">Psalm 33:7</a> reminds us, &#8220;He gathers the waters of the sea into a heap; He puts the depths into storehouses&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/38-34.htm">Job 38:34&#8211;35</a> shows God commanding rain directly: &#8220;Can you command the clouds so that a flood of water covers you?&#8221;.<p>The point is simple yet awe-inspiring: the vast, untamable waters answer to the Lord. He is not wrestling with the elements; He folds them up like cloth and keeps them exactly where He wants them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in His clouds</b><p>The wrapping happens &#8220;in His clouds.&#8221; Clouds serve as God&#8217;s appointed vessels, suspended in mid-air, carrying the water He has packaged.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a> paints a similar scene: &#8220;He makes the clouds His chariot; He walks on the wings of the wind&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a> adds, &#8220;The LORD is slow to anger and great in power&#8230; the clouds are the dust beneath His feet&#8221;.<p>By calling them &#8220;His&#8221; clouds, Job highlights both ownership and craftsmanship.

The conception is that of a vast treasury of water above the visible sky, which is kept there in apparent defiance of what we know as the laws of gravitation, and which all experience would show was liable to fall of itself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he makes the clouds, that we see floating in the atmosphere, contain and hold the waters on which the productiveness of the earth depends, and which he restrains, or allows to fall in fertilizing rain, at his pleasure (comp. <a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the cloud is not rent under them</span>.
