The lotus plants, often associated with water and marshy areas, provide a natural habitat for such a large creature. The imagery of concealment suggests protection and a natural camouflage, emphasizing the creature's integration into its environment. In biblical times, the lotus was a symbol of beauty and fertility, often found in regions like Egypt and Mesopotamia, which were known for their lush riverbanks. This description highlights the grandeur and mystery of God's creation, as Behemoth is depicted as a creature that thrives in the environment God has provided.<p><b>the willows of the brook surround him.</b><br>Willows are typically found near water sources, indicating a lush and fertile setting. The mention of a brook suggests a flowing water source, which is essential for sustaining life. In the ancient Near East, water was a precious resource, and areas with abundant water were seen as places of blessing and sustenance. The willows surrounding Behemoth further emphasize the creature's connection to its environment, illustrating the provision and care of God for all His creations. This imagery can also be seen as a metaphor for God's protection and the way He surrounds His people with His care, much like the willows encircle Behemoth. The passage invites readers to reflect on the majesty of God's creation and His sovereign control over all living things.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

him in their shade&#8221; (<a href="/job/40-22.htm">Job 40:22</a>a) continues God&#8217;s description of Behemoth, begun in <a href="/job/40-15.htm">Job 40:15&#8211;21</a>.<p>&#8226; The line paints a literal picture: an enormous, water-loving creature resting among thick aquatic vegetation.<p>&#8211; Compare <a href="/job/40-21.htm">Job 40:21</a>, &#8220;He lies under the lotus plants, hidden

animals, reinforcing that the Creator furnishes even massive beasts with adequate shelter.<p>&#8226; The concealment theme magnifies God&#8217;s workmanship. Though Behemoth&#8217;s bulk is immense (<a href="/job/40-16.htm">Job 40:16-18</a>), the vegetation still &#8220;conceals&#8221; him&#8212;evidence of a divinely balanced ecosystem (<a href="/genesis/1-25.htm">Genesis 1:25</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-24.htm">Psalm 104:24</a>).<p>&#8226; For Job, the image underscores how limited human perception is; what feels overwhelming to people fits seamlessly under God&#8217;s provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The willows of the brook surround him</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The willows of the brook surround him&#8221; (<a href="/job/40-22.htm">Job 40:22</a>b) shifts attention to the riverbank trees that encircle Behemoth.<p>&#8211; Willows thrive where water is plentiful (<a href="/isaiah/44-4.htm">Isaiah 44:4</a>), matching the creature&#8217;s marshy setting.<p>&#8211; <a href="/psalms/137-1.htm">Psalm 137:1</a> references willows beside rivers, highlighting their common presence along Middle-Eastern waterways.<p>&#8226; The surrounding willows stress safety and abundance:<p>&#8211; Shelter: leafy branches form a natural canopy, illustrating God&#8217;s care (<a href="/ezekiel/17-5.htm">Ezekiel 17:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8211; Sustenance: fresh foliage and constant water supply affirm the Creator&#8217;s ongoing provision (<a href="/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; The encirclement also hints at Behemoth&#8217;s unassailable security.

For Job&#8212;and for every reader&#8212;the scene calls for humbled awe: the God who effortlessly provides refuge for the greatest of animals is fully competent to oversee human circumstances as well.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/job/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The shady trees</span> (or, <span class="accented">the lotus trees</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>cover him with their shadow</span> (see the comment on ver. 21); the willows of the brook compass him round about.
