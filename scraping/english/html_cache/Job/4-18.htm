In the context of the Book of Job, this reflects the theme of human and celestial imperfection compared to God's perfect wisdom and justice. The term "servants" can be understood as referring to both human beings and celestial beings, such as angels. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that emphasizes the limitations of created beings, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/103-14.htm">Psalm 103:14</a>, which acknowledges human frailty. Theologically, this underscores the need for humility and reliance on God's grace rather than on one's own merit or status.<p><b>and He charges His angels with error</b><br>This phrase highlights the concept that even angels, who are often seen as messengers and servants of God, are not beyond reproach. This is consistent with other biblical references to the fallibility of angels, such as in <a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a> and <a href="/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>, where some angels are described as having sinned and being cast into darkness. Theologically, this serves as a reminder of the holiness and perfection of God in contrast to all of creation, including celestial beings. It also foreshadows the ultimate need for redemption and the role of Jesus Christ as the perfect mediator, who is described in <a href="/hebrews/1-4.htm">Hebrews 1:4</a> as being superior to the angels. This phrase can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament revelation of Christ's redemptive work, which addresses the imperfections of both humanity and the spiritual realm.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliphaz_the_temanite.htm">Eliphaz the Temanite</a></b><br>One of Job's three friends who comes to comfort him.

Even in them God does not trust implicitly, since he knows that they are frail and fallible, liable to err, etc., only kept from sin by his own sustaining and assisting grace (setup. <a href="/job/15-15.htm">Job 15:15</a>, where Eliphaz expresses the same belief in his own person). <span class="cmt_word">And his angels he charged with folly</span>; rather, <span class="accented">chargeth.</span> The <span class="accented">exact</span> meaning of the word translated "folly" is uncertain, since the word does not occur elsewhere.

The teaching clearly is that the angels are not perfect - the highest angelic excellence falls infinitely short of God's perfectness. Even angels, therefore, would be incompetent judges of God's doings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/job/4-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2005.htm">Strong's 2005: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
