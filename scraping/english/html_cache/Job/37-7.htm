The imagery of sealing implies a cessation or pause, indicating that God can halt human endeavors at His will. In the context of Job, this reflects the theme of divine authority over creation and human affairs. The sealing of hands can also symbolize God's protection or preservation, as seals were used in ancient times to secure and authenticate documents. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>, which calls for stillness to recognize God's sovereignty. The idea of God controlling human actions is consistent with the biblical narrative of God's omnipotence and His ability to intervene in human history.<p><b>so that all men may know His work</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the purpose behind God's actions: to reveal His power and deeds to humanity. The acknowledgment of God's work is a recurring theme in the Bible, emphasizing the importance of recognizing His hand in creation and history. This aligns with passages like <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>, which speaks of God's invisible qualities being understood through what has been made. The phrase suggests that through God's intervention, people are led to a greater awareness of His presence and authority. It also points to the ultimate goal of God's actions: to draw people to Himself and to foster a relationship based on recognition and reverence of His divine work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great faith and patience, Job is the central figure in the Book of Job.
