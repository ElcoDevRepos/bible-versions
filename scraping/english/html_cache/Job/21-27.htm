This phrase highlights Job's discernment and understanding of human nature, which is a recurring theme in wisdom literature. The word "behold" is often used in Scripture to draw attention to an important truth or revelation. Job's insight into their thoughts reflects the broader biblical theme of God knowing the hearts and minds of people, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>.<p><b>the schemes by which you would wrong me</b><br>Job accuses his friends of having malicious intentions, suggesting that their counsel is not only misguided but also harmful. The term "schemes" implies deliberate planning and deceit, which aligns with the broader biblical narrative of human sinfulness and the tendency to plot against others, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>. This accusation also foreshadows the New Testament's emphasis on the spiritual battle against deceit and falsehood, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11-12</a>. Job's experience can be seen as a type of Christ, who also faced wrongful accusations and schemes from those around Him, ultimately leading to His crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Job, a man of great faith and integrity who undergoes severe trials and suffering.
