The imagery of "snatching from the fire" suggests a dire situation, akin to rescuing someone from imminent destruction. This can be connected to <a href="/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>, where Joshua the high priest is described as a "brand plucked from the fire," symbolizing God's deliverance from judgment. The fire represents judgment or the consequences of sin, and the act of saving others reflects the Christian duty to evangelize and guide others away from spiritual peril. This aligns with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where believers are called to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>and to still others show mercy tempered with fear,</b><br>This part of the verse advises a balanced approach when dealing with those who are in error or sin. "Show mercy" indicates compassion and understanding, recognizing that all have sinned and require grace. However, "tempered with fear" suggests a cautious approach, aware of the potential for being influenced by sin. This reflects the wisdom found in <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, where the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. The fear here is not terror but a reverent awareness of God's holiness and the seriousness of sin. It also echoes <a href="/galatians/6.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>, which advises believers to restore others gently while being careful not to fall into temptation themselves.<p><b>hating even the clothing stained by the flesh.</b><br>This phrase uses vivid imagery to convey the need for purity and separation from sin. The "clothing stained by the flesh" symbolizes the corrupting influence of sinful behavior. In biblical times, clothing often represented one's status or condition, and stained garments would be seen as defiled. This can be linked to <a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>, where human righteousness is compared to "filthy rags." The call to hate even the clothing stained by sin underscores the importance of maintaining holiness and avoiding any association with sin. It reflects the call in <a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a> to "be holy, because I am holy," emphasizing the need for believers to pursue righteousness and avoid contamination by sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jude.htm">Jude</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally understood to be Jude, the brother of James and half-brother of Jesus.

Christians are called to maintain purity and avoid any association with sinful practices.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_the_lord.htm">Fear of the Lord</a></b><br>The fear mentioned in Jude is a reverent awe of God, which should guide believers in their interactions with others, ensuring that mercy is shown with a consciousness of God's holiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The call to save others highlights the communal aspect of the Christian faith.

Rather than standing back in criticism, we move toward them with the purpose of rescue. Paul models this in <a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>, &#8220;Brothers, if someone is caught in a trespass, you who are spiritual should restore him with a spirit of gentleness, but watch yourself, or you also may be tempted&#8221;. The command presumes we know and love the truth well enough to recognize danger and value a soul more than our comfort.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Snatching them from the fire</b><p>The picture is urgent&#8212;pulling someone out of flames moments before they are consumed. <a href="/amos/4-11.htm">Amos 4:11</a> uses similar language when God says, &#8220;I overthrew some of you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah; you were like a firebrand snatched from the blaze&#8221;. Eternal judgment is real (<a href="/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>), so decisive intervention matters.
