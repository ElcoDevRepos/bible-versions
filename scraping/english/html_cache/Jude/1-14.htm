He is mentioned in <a href="/genesis/5-21.htm">Genesis 5:21-24</a>, where it is noted that he "walked with God" and was taken by God, implying he did not experience death. Being the seventh generation from Adam, Enoch represents a line of faithful individuals in a period marked by increasing wickedness. His position as the seventh is symbolic of completeness and perfection in biblical numerology. Enoch's life and translation to heaven prefigure the ultimate redemption and transformation of believers.<p><b>also prophesied about them</b><br>This phrase indicates that Enoch, though not much is recorded in the canonical Old Testament, was believed to have spoken prophetically. The reference here is to a prophecy not found in the Hebrew Bible but in the apocryphal Book of Enoch, which was well-known in Jewish and early Christian circles. This prophecy serves as a warning against ungodly individuals, aligning with Jude's message against false teachers. It underscores the continuity of God's message through different ages and the consistency of divine judgment against sin.<p><b>Behold, the Lord is coming</b><br>This statement is a declaration of the certainty of the Lord's return, a central theme in Christian eschatology. It echoes the promises found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a> and <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>, where the coming of the Lord is associated with judgment and the establishment of His kingdom. The use of "Behold" serves to capture attention and emphasize the importance and imminence of this event. It reflects the anticipation and hope of believers for the fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>with myriads of His holy ones</b><br>The term "myriads" suggests an innumerable company, often interpreted as angels or the redeemed saints, accompanying the Lord at His return. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a> and <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>, where God's presence is associated with a vast assembly of holy beings. The "holy ones" signify those set apart for God's purposes, highlighting the majesty and authority of the Lord's coming. This phrase reinforces the theme of divine judgment and the ultimate triumph of righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/enoch.htm">Enoch</a></b><br>A significant figure in the Bible, Enoch is described as the "seventh from Adam."

Believers draw confidence from the Lord&#8217;s promised victory, while false teachers are soberly reminded that divine reckoning is both historic and inevitable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jude/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these.</span> The Revisers render it, <span class="accented">and to these also Enoch</span>... <span class="accented">prophesied.</span> In the apocryphal writing from which the passage is taken Enoch is styled, as here, "the seventh from Adam." <span class="accented">Seven</span> occurs in Scripture as a sacred symbolical number. Its introduction here, therefore, is very generally understood to claim a peculiar authority and finality for the prophecy emitted by Enoch. But it may be intended simply to mark the high antiquity of the prophecy, and its connection with the man who was distinguished from others of the same name mentioned in the oldest Scriptures (<a href="/genesis/4-17.htm">Genesis 4:17</a>; <a href="/genesis/25-4.htm">Genesis 25:4</a>; <a href="/genesis/46-9.htm">Genesis 46:9</a>) by his exceptional nearness to God. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Behold the Lord cometh</span> (literally, came) <span class="cmt_word">with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince</span> (that is, to <span class="accented">convict</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard</span> speeches (or, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">all the hard</span> <span class="accented">things</span>) which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. The "ten thousands of his saints" is better rendered "ten thousands of his holy ones," or, as the Revised Version gives it in the margin, "his holy myriads." For the "holy ones" here intended are the angels. The mention of this retinue of Jehovah is in accordance with the Hebrew idea which appears in such passages as <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2, 3</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a> (where the better reading is, "and the holy ones with him"); and appears again in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>, etc.). The clause, "among them," which might limit the ungodly to those in Israel, is omitted by the best authorities. The epithet "hard," which is applied to the "speeches," means hard in the sense of "harsh," not in the sense of "difficult to understand." It is the "churlish" which is applied to Nabal (<a href="/1_samuel/25-3.htm">1 Samuel 25:3</a>). In the original the whole emphasis of the sentence is on the "ungodly sinners," which words are thrown forward to the close, thus: "all the hard things which they uttered against him - these impious sinners!" Near the beginning of that remarkable specimen of ancient apocalyptic literature, the Book of Enoch (chapter 1:9), we find these words, "And behold, he comes with myriads of the holy, to pass judgment upon them, and will destroy the impious, and will call to account all flesh for everything the sinners and the impious have done and committed against him" (Schodde's rendering). This is the passage which Jude quotes. He does <span class="accented">so</span>, however, with some modification; for the original, as we now have it, does not contain any reference to the "hard speeches" of the men of impiety. The book itself has had a singular history. Some acquaintance with it is discovered as early as the 'Epistle of Barnabas,' the 'Book of Jubilees,' and the 'Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs.' It was freely used by the Fathers of the first five centuries. Though never formally recognized as canonical, it was in great esteem, largely accepted as a record of revelations, and regarded as the work of Enoch. It disappeared after Augustine's time, the only traces of its existence being some references to it in the writings of Syncellus and Nicephorus. From this time (about A.D. ) it was entirely lost sight of till rather more than a century ago, when the Abyssinian Church was discovered to possess an Ethiopic version of it. The well-known traveler, Bruce, obtained three copies of this version in 1773, and in 1821 an English translation was published by Archbishop Laurence. This was followed by a German translation by Hoffmann in 1833. The Ethiopic text itself was first issued by Archbishop Laurence in 1838, and afterwards in most scholarly fashion by Dillmann, in 1851, who also published a new German translation with important emendations in 1853. Since then much attention has been paid to the book. Within the last few years a corrected edition of Laurence's English translation has been published by the author of the 'Evolution of Christianity' (Kegan Paul and Co., 1881); while another edition, with an English translation and important explanatory matter, has been issued by Professor Schodde of Ohio (Andover, 1882). An attempt has been made by some to bring the composition of the book down to Christian times, so that Enoch should quote Jude, not Jude Enoch. But there is every reason to believe that it belongs to the <span class="date">second century B.C.</span> Certain portions of the book, however, are of later date. For it is scarcely possible to deny that it is the work of more than one hand. The original <span class="accented">seems</span> to have been written in Hebrew or Aramaic. We cannot be far astray, therefore, in accepting it as the composition of a Jew of Palestine dating between <span class="date">B.C. 166</span> and 110. It professes to give a series of revelations or visions received by Enoch, in which the fall of the angels, the punishment of unrighteous men, the reward of the godly, the coming of Messiah, the mystery of the world-weeks, and the secrets of the kingdom of nature, as well as those of the kingdom of grace, are shown him. That such a book should have been ascribed to Enoch is not strange. It was suggested by the account which is given of him in <a href="/genesis/5-21.htm">Genesis 5:21-24</a>. "The statements there left ample room," as Dr. Schodde well remarks, "for a vivid imagination to supply unwritten history, while antiquity and piety made Enoch a welcome name to give force and authority to a book, and the 'walking with God' of Enoch, and his translation to heaven, which correct exegesis has always read in this passage, founded his claim of having enjoyed close communion with God and having possessed superhuman knowledge." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jude/1-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Enoch,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7961;&#957;&#8060;&#967;</span> <span class="translit">(Hen&#333;ch)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1802.htm">Strong's 1802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Enoch, son of Jared and father of Methuselah.
