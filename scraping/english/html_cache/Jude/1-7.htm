It emphasizes a pattern of divine judgment against rebellion and immorality. The phrase suggests that the same principles of God's justice apply across different contexts and times.<p><b>Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them</b><br>Sodom and Gomorrah, along with the nearby cities of Admah and Zeboiim, were located in the region of the Dead Sea. Archaeological evidence suggests these cities were prosperous but were destroyed suddenly, consistent with the biblical account in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. Their destruction serves as a historical example of God's judgment against sin.<p><b>who indulged in sexual immorality and pursued strange flesh</b><br>The sins of Sodom and Gomorrah are often associated with sexual immorality, particularly acts that deviate from God's design for human sexuality. "Strange flesh" may refer to unnatural sexual relations, possibly including homosexual acts, as suggested by the Genesis account. This phrase underscores the gravity of their sin and the reason for their judgment.<p><b>are on display as an example</b><br>The destruction of these cities serves as a perpetual warning to others. Their fate is a visible, historical testament to the consequences of sin and rebellion against God. This example is meant to deter others from similar behavior by illustrating the severity of divine judgment.<p><b>of those who sustain the punishment of eternal fire</b><br>The phrase "eternal fire" indicates the severity and permanence of the judgment. It suggests not only the physical destruction of the cities but also an ongoing spiritual consequence. This aligns with other biblical references to eternal punishment for the wicked, such as in <a href="/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a> and <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>, emphasizing the seriousness of rejecting God's ways.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sodom_and_gomorrah.htm">Sodom and Gomorrah</a></b><br>Ancient cities mentioned in the Bible, known for their extreme wickedness and immorality.

This example is closely connected with the immediately preceding by the even as with which the verse opens; which phrase expresses a likeness between the two cases, to wit, between the reservation of those angels in bonds for the final judgment, and the fate of those cities as subjects of the penal vengeance of God. Two of those cities of evil memory, <span class="cmt_word">Sodom and Gomorrah,</span> are mentioned by name. The other two, Admah and Zeboim, are included in the phrase, <span class="cmt_word">and the cities about them.</span> Attention is rightly called by some of the commentators to the remarkable frequency with which the case of Sodom and Gomorrah is brought forward, both in the New Testament and in the Old, and to the use which Paul makes of it (as he finds it cited by Isaiah) in the great argument of <a href="/romans/9.htm">Romans 9</a>. The sin charged against these cities is stated in express terms to have been the same in kind with that of the angels - the indulgence of passion contrary to nature. They are described as having in <span class="cmt_word">like manner with these</span> (that is, surely, in like manner with these angels just referred to; not, as some strangely imagine, with these men who corrupt the Church) <span class="cmt_word">given themselves over to fornication, and gone after strange flesh.</span> The verbs are selected to bring out the intense sinfulness of the sin - the one being a strong compound form expressing unreserved surrender, the other an equally strong compound form denoting a departure from the law of nature in the impurities practiced. The sin has taken its name from the city with which the Book of Genesis so fearfully connects its indulgence. It forms one of the darkest strokes in the terrible picture which Paul has given us of the state of the ancient heathen world (<a href="/romans/1-27.htm">Romans 1:27</a>). With the Dead Sea probably in his view, the writer describes the doom of the cities as an <span class="accented">example</span> of or a <span class="accented">witness</span> to (the noun used being one that occurs again only in <a href="/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>, and bearing either sense) the retributive justice of God. They are <span class="cmt_word">set forth</span> (literally, <span class="accented">they lie before</span> us) <span class="cmt_word">for an example, suffering the vengeance</span> (rather, <span class="accented">the punishment</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of eternal fire.</span> So it is put by the Authorized Version and the Revised Version, as also by Wickliffe, Tyndale, Cranmer, the Genevan, and the Rhemish. There is much to be said, however, in favour of the order adopted by the Revised Version in its margin, viz. "set forth as an example of eternal fire, suffering punishment." It could not, except in a forced manner, be said that these cities, in being destroyed as they were, suffered the penalty of <span class="accented">eternal</span> fire, and continued to serve as an instance of that. But it could be said that, in being destroyed, they suffered punishment, and that the kind of punishment was typical of the eternal retribution of God. "A destruction," says Professor Lumby, "so utter and so permanent as theirs has been, is the nearest approach that can be found in this world to the destruction which awaits those who are kept under darkness unto the judgment of the great day." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jude/1-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In like</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(homoion)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3664.htm">Strong's 3664: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like, similar to, resembling, of equal rank.
