The use of "beloved" is common in New Testament epistles, reflecting the familial bond among early Christians (e.g., 1 <a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>). It underscores the pastoral care and concern Jude has for his readers.<p><b>Although I made every effort to write to you about the salvation we share</b><br>Jude initially intended to write a more general letter celebrating the common salvation shared by believers. This shared salvation refers to the gospel message of Jesus Christ, emphasizing unity in the core tenets of Christian faith. The phrase suggests that Jude's original intent was to encourage and affirm the believers in their shared experience of grace and redemption.<p><b>I felt it necessary to write and urge you</b><br>Jude's shift in focus from a general letter to a more urgent appeal indicates a pressing issue within the community. The necessity to write suggests an immediate threat to the faith, likely from false teachings or heretical influences. This urgency is mirrored in other New Testament writings, such as Paul's letters to the Galatians, where he addresses similar concerns about false doctrines.<p><b>To contend earnestly for the faith</b><br>The call to "contend earnestly" implies a vigorous defense of the Christian faith. The Greek word used here, "epagonizomai," conveys the idea of a struggle or fight, indicating that maintaining doctrinal purity requires active effort. This echoes Paul's exhortation to Timothy to "fight the good fight of the faith" (<a href="/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a>), highlighting the spiritual battle against false teachings.<p><b>Entrusted once for all to the saints</b><br>The faith referred to is the apostolic teaching and doctrine handed down to the early church. "Once for all" emphasizes the completeness and finality of this revelation, suggesting that no new doctrines are needed beyond what has been delivered. The term "saints" refers to all believers, indicating that this faith is a collective responsibility. This aligns with the idea in <a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>, where God&#8217;s final revelation is through His Son, Jesus Christ, and the teachings of the apostles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jude.htm">Jude</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as Jude, the brother of James and half-brother of Jesus.

That St. Jude had intended to write a <span class= "ital">longer</span> letter is pure conjecture, for which there is no evidence. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jude/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">author's reason for writing.</span> The statement of this is introduced by the conciliatory address, beloved - a form of address found twice again in this short Epistle (verses 17, 20). It occurs at great turning-points in all the Catholic Epistles, except for an obvious reason in 2 John. (See <a href="/james/1-16.htm">James 1:16, 19</a>; <a href="/james/2-5.htm">James 2:5</a> (who couples the term "brethren" with it); <a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-1.htm">2 Peter 3:1, 8, 14, 17</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2, 21</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1, 7, 11</a> 3John 2, 5, 11.) It is frequent also in the Pauline Epistles. It is only here, however, and in <a href="/3_john/1.htm">3 John 1:2</a> that it is introduced so near the beginning of an Epistle. The statement itself contains several expressions which demand notice. The phrase which the Authorized Version renders, <span class="cmt_word">When I gave all diligence,</span> is better rendered, <span class="accented">while I was giving all diligence</span>, with the Revised Version. In this particular form it occurs nowhere else in the New Testament; but it has close parallels in <a href="/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5</a> and <a href="/hebrews/6-11.htm">Hebrews 6:11</a>. The noun is the same as is translated "diligence" in <a href="/romans/12-8.htm">Romans 12:8</a>, and "business" in <a href="/romans/12-11.htm">Romans 12:11</a>. It is not certain whether the phrase expresses action here as well as earnest desire; but it indicates the position of the author, whether as seriously bethinking himself to write, or actually engaged in the task, when he had occasion to send the counsels given in this Epistle. The subject on which he had thought of addressing them was the <span class="cmt_word">common salvation</span> - the term "salvation" meaning here neither the <span class="accented">doctrine</span> nor the <span class="accented">means</span> of redemption, but the grace of redemption itself. And this grace is designated "common," or, as the better reading gives it, "our common salvation;" not with reference to any contrast of Jew with Gentile, but simply as a grace open to all, and in which writer and readers had an equal interest (comp. <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44</a>; <a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32</a>; and especially the "common faith" of <a href="/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>). The "like precious faith' of <a href="/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a> is a stronger expression, and probably points to a distinction, formerly existent, but now removed, between Jew and Gentile. The next phrase is rendered too weakly by the Authorized Version, <span class="cmt_word">It was needful for me to write unto you.</span> Neither does the Revised Version quite bring out the idea when it substitutes, <span class="accented">I was constrained to write unto you.</span> What is in view is an objective necessity; certain circumstances which had arisen and imperatively demanded writing. So that we might translate it, "necessity arose for me to write," or, "an emergency occurred constraining me to write." He was thus induced to write in the way of <span class="accented">exhorting</span> them. The particular subject of the exhortation is described as the duty of <span class="cmt_word">contending earnestly for the faith;</span> the contention being expressed by a strong term somewhat analogous to that used by Paul in <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>, and the "faith" being taken, not in the subjective sense of the quality or grace of belief, but in the objective sense of the things believed. This "faith" is declared to have been <span class="cmt_word">delivered once for all</span> (so, with the Revised Version; not <span class="accented">once delivered</span>, as the Authorized Version puts it, which might mean "once on a time") <span class="cmt_word">to the saints.</span> It is not stated <span class="accented">by whom</span> the deliverance was made. The unexpressed subject may be God, as some suppose who point to the analogy of <a href="/1_corinthians/11-23.htm">1 Corinthians 11:23</a> and 1 Cor 15:3; or it may be the apostles, as others hold who look to the analogy of such passages as <a href="/1_corinthians/11-2.htm">1 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-21.htm">2 Peter 2:21</a>, and especially the seventeenth verse of the present Epistle itself. The main point is, not the author or the instruments of the deliverance, but the fact that such a deliverance has taken place. What has been transmitted is carefully defined, not, indeed, as a system of doctrine, but at least as a sum or deposit of things necessary to be believed. This is said to have been given once for all, so that there is no repetition or extension of the gift. It is described; further, as committed, not to the Church as an organization, nor to any particular office-bearers, but to the saints in general. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jude/1-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Beloved,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Agap&#275;toi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Vocative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_27.htm">Strong's 27: </a> </span><span class="str2">From agapao; beloved.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[although] I made</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(poioumenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4160.htm">Strong's 4160: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I make, manufacture, construct, (b) I do, act, cause.
