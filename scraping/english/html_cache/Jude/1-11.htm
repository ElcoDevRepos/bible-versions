The term "woe" is often used in the Bible to express deep sorrow or impending doom, as seen in the prophetic books and the teachings of Jesus (e.g., <a href="/matthew/23.htm">Matthew 23</a>). It indicates a serious warning to those who are the subject of the statement, highlighting the gravity of their actions and the consequences that follow.<p><b>They have traveled the path of Cain;</b><br>Cain, the firstborn son of Adam and Eve, is known for murdering his brother Abel out of jealousy (<a href="/genesis/4.htm">Genesis 4:1-16</a>). The "path of Cain" symbolizes a way of life characterized by envy, hatred, and rebellion against God. Cain's actions led to his being cursed and marked by God, serving as a warning against allowing sin to dominate one's life. This phrase suggests that the individuals in question have chosen a similar path of disobedience and moral corruption.<p><b>they have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam;</b><br>Balaam was a prophet who, despite knowing God's will, sought personal gain by attempting to curse Israel for Balak, the king of Moab (Numbers 22-24). His "error" was his willingness to compromise his integrity for financial reward, leading others into sin (<a href="/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>). This phrase warns against the dangers of greed and the temptation to prioritize material wealth over spiritual truth, as Balaam's actions ultimately led to his downfall.<p><b>they have perished in Korah&#8217;s rebellion.</b><br>Korah, a Levite, led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, challenging their God-given authority (Numbers 16). His defiance resulted in divine judgment, as the earth opened up and swallowed him and his followers. This phrase serves as a caution against insubordination and the rejection of divinely appointed leadership. It underscores the importance of humility and submission to God's established order, as rebellion against God&#8217;s chosen leaders is equated with rebellion against God Himself.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cain.htm">Cain</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Adam and Eve, known for committing the first murder by killing his brother Abel out of jealousy and anger.

Throughout Scripture a &#8220;woe&#8221; is a solemn warning that destruction is near&#8212;see <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a> and <a href="/matthew/23-13.htm">Matthew 23:13</a>. By using the same language Jesus employed for hypocritical religious leaders, Jude assures believers that God is neither unaware nor indifferent. The Lord who said, &#8220;Vengeance is Mine; I will repay&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>) will deal decisively with those who corrupt the faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They have traveled the path of Cain</b><p>Cain&#8217;s story in <a href="/bsb/genesis/4.htm">Genesis 4</a> is more than the first murder; it is a portrait of worship without obedience.<p>&#8226; Cain offered &#8220;some of the fruit of the soil&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/4-3.htm">Genesis 4:3</a>) while Abel brought the firstborn of his flock. Cain chose convenience; Abel chose costly faith.<p>&#8226; When God rejected Cain&#8217;s offering, Cain refused repentance and nursed resentment that spilled into violence (<a href="/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;path of Cain&#8221; is therefore self-styled religion, lovelessness toward brothers, and refusal to submit to God&#8217;s revealed way. False teachers walk the same trail whenever they substitute human ideas for God&#8217;s truth and foster division rather than love.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam</b><p><a href="/bsb/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22&#8211;24</a> recount Balaam&#8217;s bizarre journey, but Jude zeroes in on motive. Balaam loved &#8220;the wages of wickedness&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Though God overruled Balaam&#8217;s curses, the prophet still counseled Moab to seduce Israel with immorality and idolatry (<a href="/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; His &#8220;error&#8221; is the notion that spiritual gifts can be commercialized and holiness negotiated.<p>&#8226; Modern counterparts: teachers who twist grace into license (<a href="/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a>), court popularity, and use ministry for personal gain (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>). Jude pictures them sprinting&#8212;&#8220;rushed headlong&#8221;&#8212;toward the same ruin Balaam met when he &#8220;was killed with the sword&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/31-8.htm">Numbers 31:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They have perished in Korah&#8217;s rebellion</b><p>Korah (<a href="/bsb/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>) challenged God&#8217;s appointed leaders, declaring, &#8220;All the congregation are holy&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/16-3.htm">Numbers 16:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The rebellion masked envy as spirituality, rejecting the authority God had established.<p>&#8226; The earth literally opened and swallowed Korah and those who sided with him (<a href="/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31-33</a>), a graphic reminder that despising God-given authority is despising God Himself (<a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Jude&#8217;s perfect-tense &#8220;have perished&#8221; underscores certainty: those who mimic Korah are as good as gone, even if judgment hasn&#8217;t yet appeared. Their doom is sealed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jude/1-11.htm">Jude 1:11</a> chains three Old Testament warnings into one urgent alert: false teachers may look different on the surface, but underneath they share Cain&#8217;s self-willed religion, Balaam&#8217;s greedy compromise, and Korah&#8217;s proud rebellion. The antidote is equally threefold&#8212;wholehearted obedience, pure motives, and humble submission to God&#8217;s Word and His appointed order. As we contend for the faith (<a href="/jude/1-3.htm">Jude 1:3</a>), we do so confident that Scripture is reliable, God is just, and every hidden motive will be brought to light (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jude/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) Three examples of similar wickedness: Cain, Balaam, Korah.<p><span class= "bld">Woe unto them</span>!--An echo of Christ's denunciations in the first three Gospels, whereby the description of these evil-doers takes for the moment a denunciatory form. The past tenses immediately following are owing to the writer's placing himself in thought at the moment when these men reap the consequences of their sins: their punishment is so certain, that he regards it as having come.<p><span class= "bld">In the way of Cain.</span>--The first great criminal; the first to outrage the laws of nature. Explanations to the effect that these libertines followed Cain by murdering men's <span class= "ital">souls</span> by their corrupt doctrine, or by persecuting believers, and other suggestions still more curious, are needlessly far-fetched. <a href="/john/8-44.htm" title2="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stayed not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.">John 8:44</a>, and <a href="/1_john/3-15.htm" title2="Whoever hates his brother is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.">1John 3:15</a>, are not strictly apposite: these ungodly men may have hated and persecuted the righteous, but St. Jude does not tell us so. Sensuality is always selfish, but by no means always ill-natured or malignant.<p><span class= "bld">Ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward.</span>--The Greek for "ran greedily" literally means "they were poured out in streams;" the Greek for "error" may also mean "deception." Hence three renderings are possible: (1) as the Authorised version; (2) "they ran greedily after the deception of Balaam's reward;" (3) "they were undone by the deception of Balaam's reward." The first is best. "Reward" in the Greek is the genitive of <span class= "ital">price.</span> Comp. "the <span class= "ital">rewards</span> of divination" (<a href="/numbers/22-7.htm" title2="And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.">Numbers 22:7</a>); "they <span class= "ital">hired</span> against thee Balaam" (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-4.htm" title2="Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when you came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.">Deuteronomy 23:4</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/13-2.htm" title2="Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: however, our God turned the curse into a blessing.">Nehemiah 13:2</a>). Here, again, far-fetched explanations may be avoided. The allusion lies on the surface--running counter to God's will from interested motives. Possibly, there may also be some allusion to Balaam's causing the Israelites to be seduced into licentiousness (<a href="/revelation/2-14.htm" title2="But I have a few things against you, because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.">Revelation 2:14</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jude/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - As in <a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a>, the darkest passages in the Old Testament history are again appealed to. While Peter, however, refers only to a single instance, Jude introduces three, and prefaces the whole by a <span class="accented">Woe!</span> such as the Gospels repeatedly attribute to Christ himself. <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain;</span> rather, <span class="accented">they went in the way of Cain.</span> The phrase is the familiar one for a habitual course of conduct (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="/acts/9-31.htm">Acts 9:31</a>; <a href="/acts/14-16.htm">Acts 14:16</a>, etc.). But what is the point of the comparison? Cain is supposed to be introduced as the type of murderous envy, of the persecuting spirit, or of those who live by the impulse of nature, regardless of God or man. In <a href="/john/3-12.htm">John 3:12</a> he is the type of all that is opposed to the sense of brotherhood, the murderer of the brother whose righteous works are an offence to him; but in the present passage he is introduced rather as the first and, in some respects, the most pronounced example of wickedness which the Old Testament offers - a wickedness defying God and destroying man. <span class="cmt_word">And ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward.</span> The "error" in view is a life diverted from righteousness and truth. The verb rendered "ran greedily," or "ran riotously," is a very strong one, meaning they "were poured out," and expressing, therefore, the baneful absoluteness of their surrender to the error in question. Otherwise the construction of the sentence is so far from obvious that various renderings are proposed: <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, "They gave themselves wholly up to the error of Balaam for the sake of a reward;" "By the seduction of Balaam's reward they committed excess of wickedness;" "They went to excess by Balaam's error, which was one determined by gain." The first of these is adopted, with some modification, by the Revised Version, and comes nearest the idea, which is that of men losing themselves in riotous excess for the sake of worldly advantage. The point of the analogy between Balaam and them, therefore, is, not his enticing Israel to idolatry or to immorality, as some understand it, but the covetous spirit which the Old Testament and the New alike attribute to the prophet of Pethor, to which also the Book of Numbers carries back the entire debasement of his character and perversion of his gifts. <span class="cmt_word">And perished in the gainsaying of Core.</span> The term which is very fitly rendered "gainsaying" by the English Version here ("contradiction" in the Rhemish Version; "treason" in Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Genevan) denotes properly an opposition expressing itself in words. It is, therefore, aptly applied to the rebellion of Korah and his company, who "gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you," etc. (<a href="/numbers/16-3.htm">Numbers 16:3</a>). The analogy between the two cases, consequently, is limited by some to the assertion of an unregulated liberty, the assumption of a self-invented holiness, or the adoption of a worship which was alien to God. It lies in the broader idea of a contemptuous and determined assertion of self against divinely appointed ordinances. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jude/1-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Woe</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8016;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(ouai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3759.htm">Strong's 3759: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woe!, alas!, uttered in grief or denunciation.
