In biblical context, angels are created beings with specific duties and realms of authority. The reference here is often linked to <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6:1-4</a>, where "sons of God" are interpreted by some as angels who left their heavenly domain to cohabit with human women. This act of rebellion is seen as a violation of God's established order. The concept of angels having specific domains is supported by passages like <a href="/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>, where angelic beings are assigned to particular nations or regions.<p><b>but abandoned their proper dwelling</b><br>The term "abandoned" suggests a willful departure from their designated place. This act of leaving their "proper dwelling" implies a rejection of God's authority and order. Theologically, this can be seen as a parallel to humanity's fall, where Adam and Eve abandoned their state of innocence. The angels' abandonment is a grave sin, reflecting a desire to operate outside of God's will. This rebellion is echoed in <a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>, which also speaks of angels who sinned and were cast into hell.<p><b>these He has kept in eternal chains under darkness</b><br>The imagery of "eternal chains" and "darkness" signifies a state of confinement and judgment. This is not a physical binding but a spiritual one, indicating a restriction of their power and influence. The "darkness" symbolizes separation from God's presence, often associated with judgment and punishment. This aligns with the Jewish tradition found in the Book of Enoch, which describes fallen angels being bound until the day of judgment. The concept of spiritual imprisonment is also seen in <a href="/revelation/20.htm">Revelation 20:1-3</a>, where Satan is bound for a thousand years.<p><b>bound for judgment on that great day</b><br>The "great day" refers to the final judgment, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. This day is characterized by God's ultimate justice being executed upon all creation, including rebellious angels. The certainty of this future judgment is a warning and a promise, emphasizing God's sovereignty and righteousness. This eschatological event is detailed in passages like <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a> and <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>, where all beings are judged according to their deeds. The binding of these angels until that day underscores the inevitability of divine justice and the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Spiritual beings created by God, some of whom rebelled against Him by not staying within their assigned roles or domains.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/proper_dwelling.htm">Proper Dwelling</a></b><br>The specific realm or position that God assigned to the angels, which they abandoned.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_chains.htm">Eternal Chains</a></b><br>Symbolic of the restraint and judgment that God has placed upon these rebellious angels.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/darkness.htm">Darkness</a></b><br>Represents the separation from God's presence and the spiritual state of these angels awaiting judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_on_that_great_day.htm">Judgment on that Great Day</a></b><br>Refers to the future time when God will execute final judgment on all beings, including these angels.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Just as the angels were judged for abandoning their roles, believers are called to remain faithful to God's commands and purposes for their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_spiritual_warfare.htm">The Reality of Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Understanding that there are spiritual forces opposed to God can help Christians remain vigilant and reliant on God's strength.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>God's judgment on the angels demonstrates His ultimate authority and the certainty of His justice, encouraging believers to trust in His righteous plans.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_rebellion.htm">The Consequences of Rebellion</a></b><br>The fate of the angels serves as a warning about the serious consequences of turning away from God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_final_judgment.htm">Hope in Final Judgment</a></b><br>While judgment is a sobering reality, it also assures believers that God will ultimately set all things right, providing hope and motivation to persevere in faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jude_1_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jude 1:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jude_1_6_Consequences_of_defying_God.htm">How does Jude 1:6 illustrate the consequences of abandoning God's authority?

Like humanity, they were given the capacity to obey or rebel. Jude&#8217;s reminder echoes <a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>, which speaks of angels who sinned and were &#8220;cast into hell and committed to chains of gloomy darkness.&#8221; Scripture consistently treats these events as literal history, underscoring God&#8217;s unwavering justice toward every order of creation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who did not stay within their own domain</b><p>The phrase shows that certain angels left the sphere God had assigned to them.<p>&#8226; God establishes clear boundaries for His creatures (<a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Stepping outside those boundaries is willful rebellion (<a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a> confirms that these angels &#8220;did not keep their own position of authority.&#8221; God&#8217;s moral order is non-negotiable: to cross it is to invite judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but abandoned their proper dwelling</b><p>Their &#8220;proper dwelling&#8221; was the heavenly realm. <a href="/genesis/6-1.htm">Genesis 6:1&#8211;4</a> describes &#8220;sons of God&#8221; who took human wives, producing the Nephilim. Jude&#8217;s readers would have recognized that event as an example of angels abandoning their appointed sphere. Peter links the same episode to Christ&#8217;s proclamation to &#8220;the spirits in prison&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/3-19.htm">1 Peter 3:19&#8211;20</a>).

Angels who overstepped their God-given roles are now chained, awaiting a final, fearsome judgment. Their fate underscores both God&#8217;s holiness and His protective care for those who remain faithful.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jude/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The second instance of Divine judgment is taken from the angelic world. The copula connects it closely with the former, and gives it some emphasis: "angels, too," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, angels not less than the people selected by God to be a people for himself, have been examples of the terrible law of Divine retribution. The particular class of angels are defined as <span class="cmt_word">those who kept not their first estate;</span> or better, <span class="accented">their own principality.</span> The idea conveyed by the term here is that of <span class="accented">lordship</span> rather than <span class="accented">beginning.</span> It is the term which is held by most commentators to be used as a title of angels in such passages as <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, etc., where mention is made of "principalities." In the present passage Tyndale, Cranmer, the Genevan and our Authorized Version agree in rendering it "first estate." But the Rhemish gives "principality," and Wickliffe has "princehood." Those seem right, therefore, who take the reference to be to the Jewish idea of a peculiar dignity or lordship held by the angels in creation. The sin alleged as the reason for the penalty which the writer recalls to the minds of his readers is that they failed to keep this lordship, and <span class="cmt_word">left their proper habitation;</span> by which latter clause a descent to a different sphere of being is intended. The penalty itself is this - that God <span class="cmt_word">hath kept them in everlasting chains</span> (or, <span class="accented">bonds</span>, with the Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.</span> It is well to retain the rendering "kept" in this clause, instead of the "reserved" of the Authorized Version. For the verb used in describing the sin and that used in describing the penalty are the same. As they "kept not their lordship," God has <span class="accented">"kept</span> them in everlasting bonds." The word by which the idea of the <span class="accented">everlasting</span> is expressed is a peculiarly strong one, occurring only once again in the New Testament, viz. in <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>, where it is applied to God's <span class="accented">"eternal</span> power." It designates these bonds as bonds from which there never can be escape. The <span class="accented">place</span> of this present penal detention is declared to be "under darkness." The term selected for the <span class="accented">darkness</span>, again, is an unusual one, occurring only here, in verse 13, and in <a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4, 17</a>, and possibly <a href="/hebrews/12-18.htm">Hebrews 12:18</a>. It means the densest, blackest darkness, and is used both in Homer and in the apocryphal literature (Wisd. 17:2) of the darkness of the nether world. This darkness, as Dean Alford observes, is "considered as brooding over them, and they under it." But this present penal detention is itself the prelude to a still more awful doom - "the judgment of the great day" (cf. <a href="/acts/2-20.htm">Acts 2:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-17.htm">Revelation 6:17</a>). There is a similar, but less definite, statement on the subject of angelic sin and penalty in <a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>. But these representations differ greatly from others (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>), where the air or the heavenly places appear as the scenes occupied by evil spirits, and these spirits possess freedom. In the New Testament, indeed, there are no passages, except those in Peter and Jude, which speak of fallen angels as at present in bonds. Even in <a href="/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>, the statement is of a fate <span class="accented">prepared</span>, and nothing more. The difference in the two representations is due probably to a difference in the subjects. Other passages refer to the devil and his angels. But in the present passage there is nothing to indicate that the fall of Satan is in view. The sin suggested by the context is not the sin of pride, but a sin against nature. The reference, therefore, is taken to be to the Jewish idea that amatory passion is not limited to the creatures of earth, and that some angels, yielding to the spell of the beauty of the daughters of men, forsook their own kingdom, and entered unto unnatural relations with them. The Jewish belief is seen in the story of Asmodeus in the Book of Tobit; it is found by Josephus (who has been followed by not a few modern interpreters) in <a href="/genesis/6-1.htm">Genesis 6:1-4</a>; and it is given with special distinctness in the Book of Enoch. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jude/1-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(te)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5037.htm">Strong's 5037: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, both.
