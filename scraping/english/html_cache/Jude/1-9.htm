He is often associated with spiritual warfare and protection of God's people, as seen in <a href="/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13, 21</a> and <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a>. His role as an archangel signifies his authority and power in the heavenly realm.<p><b>when he disputed with the devil</b><br>This phrase suggests a confrontation between Michael and the devil, also known as Satan. The devil is depicted as the adversary of God and His people throughout Scripture, beginning with his role in the fall of humanity in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. The dispute indicates a spiritual battle, reflecting the ongoing cosmic struggle between good and evil.<p><b>over the body of Moses</b><br>The reference to the body of Moses is unique to this passage, as the Old Testament does not detail this event. <a href="/deuteronomy/34-5.htm">Deuteronomy 34:5-6</a> states that Moses died in Moab and was buried by God in an undisclosed location. This secrecy may have been to prevent idolatry or misuse of Moses' remains. The dispute over Moses' body highlights the significance of Moses as a prophet and leader in Israel's history.<p><b>did not presume to bring a slanderous charge against him</b><br>Michael's restraint in not bringing a slanderous accusation against the devil demonstrates humility and respect for divine authority. This restraint contrasts with the behavior of false teachers, who are often quick to speak against spiritual authorities. It underscores the importance of leaving judgment to God.<p><b>but said, &#8220;The Lord rebuke you!&#8221;</b><br>Michael's response, "The Lord rebuke you," shows reliance on God's authority rather than his own. This echoes <a href="/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>, where the Lord rebukes Satan. It emphasizes the principle that ultimate judgment and rebuke belong to God alone.

Resist the devil, and he will flee from you&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a>).<p>- The phrase affirms that ultimate power belongs to the Lord alone (<a href="/psalms/62-11.htm">Psalm 62:11</a>). Our victory is secured when we stand clad in His strength and armor (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Michael&#8212;a mighty, faithful archangel&#8212;illustrates humble dependence on God. In a hidden heavenly courtroom, he faced the devil over Moses&#8217; body but refused to act independently or abusively. Instead, he stood on the Lord&#8217;s side, appealed to the Lord&#8217;s authority, and left judgment to the Lord&#8217;s timing. Jude uses this moment to teach believers that true spiritual authority flows from submission, not self-assertion; from reverence, not railing; and from confidence in the Lord, not confidence in ourselves.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jude/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The irreverent and unbridled speech of these "filthy dreamers" is now contrasted with the self-restraint of one of the "dignities" of the angelic world. The point of the contrast is sufficiently clear. The incident itself is obscure. <span class="cmt_word">But Michael the archangel.</span> With the exception of <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a>, where he is described as warring with the dragon, this is the only mention which the New Testament makes of Michael. It is entirely in harmony, however, with the Old Testament representation. It is only in the Book of Daniel that he is named there, but he appears as the champion and protector of Israel against the world-powers of heathenism. He is "one of the chief princes" (<a href="/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>), "your prince" (<a href="/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a>), "the great prince" (<a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>), who gives help against Persia, and stands for the chosen people. He is also introduced in the Book of Enoch, and the view given of him there is like that in Jude. He is "the merciful, the patient, the holy Michael" (40:8). He belongs to that developed form which the doctrine of angels took towards the close of Old Testament revelation, when the ideas of distinction in dignity and office were added to the simpler conception of earlier times. In the apocryphal books we find a hierarchy with seven archangels, including Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel. <span class="cmt_word">When contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.</span> These last words occur in <a href="/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>, where they are addressed by the Lord to Satan. The term used for "disputed" points to a contention in words. The phrase rendered "railing accusation" by the English Version, and "invective" by others, means rather a judgment or "sentence savouring of evil-speaking," as Alford puts it. Following the Rhemish Version, therefore, the Revised Version renders it a "railing judgment." What is meant, then, is that Michael restrained himself, leaving all judgment and vengeance even in this case to God. But what is the case referred to? The Targum of Jonathan, on <a href="/deuteronomy/34-6.htm">Deuteronomy 34:6</a>, speaks of Michael as having charge of the grave of Moses, and there may be something to the same effect in other ancient Jewish legends (see Wetstein). But with this partial exception, there seems to be nothing resembling Jude's statement either in apocryphal books like that of Enoch or in the rabbinical literature, not to speak of the canonical Scriptures. Neither is the object of the contention quite apparent - whether it is meant that the devil attempted to deprive Moses of the honour of burial by impeaching him of the murder of the Egyptian, or that he sought to preserve the body for idolatrous uses such as the brazen serpent lent itself to, or what else. The matter, nevertheless, is introduced by Jude as one with which his readers would be familiar. Whence, then, comes the story? Some have solved the difficulty by the desperate expedient of allegory, as if the body of Moses were a figure of the Israelite Law, polity, or people; and as if the sentence referred to the giving of the Law at Sinai, the siege under Hezekiah, or the rebuilding under Zerubbabel. Others seek its source in a special revelation, or in some unrecorded instructions given by Christ in explanation of the Transfiguration scene. Herder would travel all the way to the Zend-Avesta for it. Calvin referred it to oral Jewish tradition. Another view of it appears, however, in so early a writer as Origen, viz. that it is a quotation from an old apocryphal writing on the <span class="accented">Ascent</span> or <span class="accented">Assumption of Moses</span>, the date of which is much disputed, but is taken by some of the best authorities (Ewald, Wieseler, Dillmann, Drummond) to be the first decade after the death of Herod. This is the most probable explanation; and Jude's use of this story, therefore, carries no more serious consequences with it than the use he afterwards makes of the Book of Enoch. Beyond what could be gathered from a few scattered references and quotations in the Fathers and some later writings, the book in question remained unknown for many centuries. But in the year 1861 a considerable part of it, which had been discovered in the Ambrosian Library of Milan, was given to the public by Ceriani, in an Old Latin version, and since that time various editions of it have been published. Ewald observes that the quotation "shows how early the attempt was made to describe exactly the final moment of the life of Moses, and to weave into this description a complete answer to the questions which arose concerning his highest glory, and his guilt or innocence" ('History of Israel,' 2, page 226, Eng. trans.). Some who are not prepared to accept the theory that the passage is a quotation from this ancient book, understand Jude to refer to a traditional expansion of Scripture, based partly on the narrative of the death of Moses in Deuteronomy, and partly on the scene between Joshua and Satan in <a href="/zechariah/3.htm">Zechariah 3</a>. So, for example, Professor Lumby, who is of opinion that the mention of <span class="accented">Jannes</span> and <span class="accented">Jambres</span> in <a href="/2_timothy/3-8.htm">2 Timothy 3:8</a>, and certain passages in Stephen's speech as reported in <a href="/acts/7.htm">Acts 7</a>, show that there were current among the Jews "traditional explanations of the earlier history, which had grown round the Old Testament narrative." (On the Assumption <span class="accented">of Moses</span>, and the spread of legend on the subject of the death of Moses, see Schurer's 'The Jewish People in the Time of Christ,' volume 3, div. 2. pages 80-83, Clark's translation.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jude/1-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But [even]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
