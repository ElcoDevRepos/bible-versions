It reflects the biblical theme that God's judgment is impartial and all-encompassing, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6-11</a>, where God is described as rendering to each person according to their deeds. The concept of divine judgment is rooted in the Old Testament, with prophetic books like Isaiah and Jeremiah frequently warning of God's impending judgment on nations and individuals. The idea of judgment is also central to the teachings of Jesus, who spoke of a final judgment in parables such as the Sheep and the Goats (<a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>).<p><b>and to convict all the ungodly</b><br>The term "ungodly" refers to those who live in opposition to God's will and righteousness. This conviction is not merely a legal declaration but involves a moral and spiritual awakening to one's sinful state. The conviction of the ungodly is a theme found throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8</a>, where the Holy Spirit is said to convict the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment. This conviction serves as a precursor to judgment, highlighting the need for repentance and transformation.<p><b>of every ungodly act of wickedness</b><br>This phrase underscores the comprehensive nature of God's judgment, which includes every act of wickedness. The Bible consistently portrays God as a righteous judge who sees and evaluates all human actions (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). The emphasis on "every" act highlights the thoroughness of divine judgment, leaving no sin unaddressed. This aligns with the biblical teaching that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>), necessitating divine intervention and redemption.<p><b>and every harsh word spoken against Him</b><br>Words hold significant weight in biblical teaching, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36-37</a>, where Jesus warns that people will give account for every careless word spoken. This phrase highlights the seriousness of blasphemy and slander against God, which are seen as direct affronts to His holiness and authority. The Bible frequently warns against speaking against God, as seen in the experiences of the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/21-5.htm">Numbers 21:5-6</a>) and the admonitions in the Psalms and Proverbs about the power of the tongue.<p><b>by ungodly sinners.</b><br>The repetition of "ungodly" emphasizes the moral and spiritual state of those who oppose God. The term "sinners" is used throughout Scripture to describe those who live in rebellion against God's commands. This phrase serves as a reminder of the biblical teaching that all humanity is in need of salvation due to sin (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>). The distinction between the righteous and the ungodly is a recurring theme in the Bible, with the ultimate hope being the redemption and transformation of sinners through faith in Jesus Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jude.htm">Jude</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as Jude, the brother of James and half-brother of Jesus.

Scripture consistently affirms that a final, universal judgment is coming (<a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>). Because the Judge is holy, His verdicts are perfectly just. For believers, this truth stirs gratitude&#8212;our penalty has been borne by Christ (<a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>). For the unrepentant, it is a sober warning that every life will one day be reviewed before a righteous throne.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To convict all the ungodly</b><p>Next, Jude stresses that the purpose of the judgment is &#8220;to convict all the ungodly.&#8221; &#8220;Convict&#8221; here is courtroom language: God will present undeniable evidence establishing guilt (<a href="/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19</a>). The term &#8220;ungodly&#8221; surfaces repeatedly in Jude (vv. 4, 15, 18), underscoring lives lived without reverence for God (<a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>). While the Spirit now convicts hearts (<a href="/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8</a>), a day is coming when that inner conviction becomes an unanswerable public verdict.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Every ungodly act of wickedness</b><p>The scope of the evidence is exhaustive: &#8220;every ungodly act of wickedness.&#8221; Nothing slips through the cracks (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>; <a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5-6</a>). Each deed that disregards God&#8217;s character will be brought to light. For the redeemed, Christ&#8217;s finished work covers our record (<a href="/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>). Yet His Lordship also motivates us to renounce ungodliness and live uprightly as we await His appearing (<a href="/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Every harsh word spoken against Him</b><p>Jude adds that even &#8220;every harsh word spoken against Him by ungodly sinners&#8221; will be examined. Jesus taught the same: &#8220;I tell you that men will give an account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36-37</a>). Words reveal the heart (<a href="/luke/6-45.htm">Luke 6:45</a>). Scoffing and blasphemy may sound bold now, but each affront to God&#8217;s name will one day be confronted (<a href="/psalms/73-9.htm">Psalm 73:9</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-3.htm">2 Peter 3:3-7</a>).
