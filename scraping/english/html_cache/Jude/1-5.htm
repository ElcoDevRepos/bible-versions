Like Peter, who wrote, &#8220;I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-12.htm">2 Peter 1:12</a>), Jude stresses the value of repetition so that believers stay anchored in truth and guarded against error (see also <a href="/2_peter/3-1.htm">2 Peter 3:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1</a>). Awareness is not the same as vigilance, so Jude sounds the alarm again.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I want to remind you that</b><p>The verb &#8220;remind&#8221; signals pastoral concern, not mere information transfer. Jude is lovingly stirring their memories to prompt:<p>&#8226; Humble gratitude&#8212;remembering God&#8217;s past acts fuels worship (<a href="/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Holy fear&#8212;recalling divine judgment nurtures reverent obedience (<a href="/luke/12-5.htm">Luke 12:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Discernment&#8212;history lessons become present safeguards against false teachers infiltrating the church (Jude v.4; <a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>after Jesus had delivered His people out of the land of Egypt</b><p>By naming &#8220;Jesus,&#8221; Jude testifies that the pre-incarnate Son actively shepherded Israel in the Exodus. Scripture unites the Old and New Testaments in one continuous story:<p>&#8226; &#8220;All drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Before Abraham was born, I am&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>).<p>&#8226; The Angel of the LORD who led Israel (<a href="/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19</a>) is now revealed as the eternal Son who saves His people.<p>Thus, the literal rescue from Egypt&#8212;plagues, Passover, parted sea&#8212;foreshadows Jesus&#8217; greater redemption from sin (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13-14</a>). Deliverance is God&#8217;s gracious initiative, accomplished by the same Savior we trust today.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He destroyed those who did not believe</b><p>Salvation brings responsibility; unbelief invites judgment. Though the entire nation crossed the Red Sea, an entire generation perished in the wilderness because &#8220;they were not able to enter, because of unbelief&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/3-19.htm">Hebrews 3:19</a>; <a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-35</a>). Jude&#8217;s point is razor-sharp:<p>&#8226; Privilege does not guarantee perseverance.<p>&#8226; Initial participation does not equal enduring faith (<a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s past judgments certify His future actions against present rebels (<a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4-6</a>).<p>For Jude&#8217;s audience, this warning targets false teachers and any who follow them. Genuine believers heed the caution, examining themselves to remain in the faith (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>) and clinging to the grace that both saves and keeps (Jude v.24).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jude/1-5.htm">Jude 1:5</a> links memory with maturity. The same Jesus who miraculously freed Israel later judged the faithless, proving He is both Savior and Judge. Remembering this history cultivates gratitude, reverence, and discernment, urging believers to persevere in true, obedient faith while rejecting the unbelief that invites destruction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jude/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5-7) We now enter upon the main body of the Epistle.

Y</span>ou have once for all been taught all that I want to say to you; so that I need only remind you, there is no need to instruct. (Comp. <a href="/context/romans/15-14.htm" title2="And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brothers, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.">Romans 15:14-15</a>, where see Notes; <a href="/2_peter/1-12.htm" title2="Why I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though you know them, and be established in the present truth.">2Peter 1:12</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-21.htm" title2="I have not written to you because you know not the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth.">1John 2:21</a>.) "All things" probably has special reference to Old Testament history, as what follows seems to show.<p><span class= "bld">How that the</span> <span class= "bld">Lord.</span>--"How that" depends upon "remind," not upon "have known." There is very strong evidence in favour of substituting "Jesus" for "the Lord;" a most remarkable reading, showing how, in Christian language, the Man Jesus had become identified with the Eternal Son. The use of "Christ" in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm" title2="And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.">1Corinthians 10:4</a>, though less striking, is similar. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jude/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-7.</span> - Three instances of the judgments of God are now referred to. They are cited as typical examples of the Divine retribution, with which the readers can be taken to be familiar, and which they will recognize to give point to the terror of the condemnation overhanging the men in question. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The first is taken from the history of Israel. It is introduced, not as a contrast with what precedes, but as a natural transition from it. It is given, too, as a matter quite within their knowledge, and of which consequently they need only to be reminded. The Authorized Version is short of the mark in several respects here. What the writer expresses is not the mere fact that he is to do a certain thing, but that he has the wish to do so. Hence the <span class="cmt_word">now I desire to put you in remembrance</span> of the Revised Version is preferable to the <span class="accented">I will therefore</span>, etc., of the Authorized Version. The next clause is more decidedly astray. For the term rendered" once" means "once for all," and the knowledge is given as a present possession. Hence the rendering should be <span class="cmt_word">though ye know once for all;</span> or better, <span class="accented">knowing as ye do</span> once <span class="accented">for all</span> - a form of expression which might be paraphrased in our English idiom, as Mr. Humphry rightly observes, "though ye have known all along." There is, however, very considerable difficulty in the reading here. It varies between "ye know <span class="accented">this"</span> which is accepted by the Authorized Version, "ye know <span class="accented">all things"</span> which is preferred by the Revised Version, and "ye <span class="accented">all</span> know" which, though poorly accredited, is yet supposed by Professor Herr to be not improbably the original. The documentary evidence is, on the whole, on the side of "all things;" and if this is adopted, the universal term will naturally be limited by the context to a knowledge of all that is pertinent to the point in question. This knowledge of the principles at issue in the case of these evil men, and of the retributive deeds of God by which these principles have been signally vindicated, is a reason why Jude needs simply to refresh the memories of his readers, and not to tell them anything new. In the second half of the verse there is a still more serious difficulty in the text. Instead of the term "Lord," some of the very best authorities read "Jesus." If this must be accepted, we have an act of the Jehovah of the Old Testament ascribed to the <span class="accented">Jesus</span> of the New Testament. But this would be an entirely unexampled usage. For, while the New Testament not unfrequently introduces the name of <span class="accented">Christ</span> when it refers to deeds of grace or claims of honour which the Old Testament connects with the name of Jehovah (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>, etc.), it never does this with that name of the Redeemer of the New Testament which specially marks his human nature and origin. Hence Professor Herr speaks of the reading "Jesus" here as a blunder, however supported. The ordinary reading may, therefore, be adhered to, especially as it is by no means ill accredited, having on its side two of the primary uncials and other weighty authorities. These clauses are peculiar in other respects. They speak not of "the people" as the Authorized Version puts it, but rather of "a people." And this is not without its purpose. For the idea is not simply that the ancient Israel experienced both redemption and judgment at the hands of their Lord, but that Israel's Lord, by bringing Israel out of Egypt, secured a people for himself, though he had also to destroy unbelievers among them. Again, the phrase rendered "afterward" by the Authorized Version means strictly "the second time," as is noticed by the margin of the Revised Version. What is intended, therefore, may be that Israel was the subject of two great deeds on Jehovah's part - in the first instance a redeeming deed, in <span class="accented">the second instance</span> a punitive deed. And his purpose in seeking a people for himself was not inconsistent with his doing what he did in this second instance. What, then, is referred to? Those seem to interpret it best who take it to be a general reference to the wilderness-fate of unbelieving Israel, rather than to any single instance of the terrors of the Divine judgment, such as that reported in <a href="/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1-9</a>. It is far-fetched to suppose that the event in view is one so remote from the deliverance of Israel from Egypt as the Babylonian captivity. We may compare with this verse, therefore, such passages as <a href="/psalms/106-12.htm">Psalm 106:12-21</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16-4:5</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jude/1-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Although you are fully aware of this,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#948;&#972;&#964;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eidotas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Participle Active - Accusative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I want</span><br /><span class="grk">&#946;&#959;&#973;&#955;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(boulomai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Middle or Passive - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1014.htm">Strong's 1014: </a> </span><span class="str2">To will, intend, desire, wish.
