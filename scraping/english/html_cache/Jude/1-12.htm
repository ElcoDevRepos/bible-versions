In the context of the early church, "love feasts" were communal meals shared among believers, often associated with the Lord's Supper. These gatherings were meant to foster unity and love, but the presence of false teachers posed a threat to the spiritual health of the community. The imagery of hidden reefs emphasizes the subtle and destructive nature of these individuals, who could cause spiritual ruin if not identified and addressed.<p><b>shamelessly feasting with you but shepherding only themselves</b><br>The false teachers are described as participating in the communal meals without shame, highlighting their hypocrisy and self-centeredness. The role of a shepherd is to care for the flock, but these individuals are only concerned with their own interests. This behavior contrasts sharply with the example of Christ, the Good Shepherd, who lays down His life for the sheep (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>). The self-serving nature of these men is a warning against leaders who prioritize personal gain over the well-being of the community.<p><b>They are clouds without water, carried along by the wind</b><br>Clouds without water promise rain but deliver none, symbolizing the emptiness and deceit of the false teachers' teachings. They appear to offer spiritual nourishment but fail to provide any real substance. The imagery of being "carried along by the wind" suggests instability and lack of direction, echoing <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>, which warns against being "tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine." This phrase underscores the futility and danger of following teachings that lack the truth of God's Word.<p><b>fruitless trees in autumn, twice dead after being uprooted</b><br>Fruitless trees in autumn are expected to bear fruit, but these do not, symbolizing the lack of spiritual fruit in the lives of the false teachers. The phrase "twice dead" may refer to their spiritual barrenness and ultimate judgment. Being "uprooted" suggests a finality in their rejection and removal from the community of believers. This imagery aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/7-19.htm">Matthew 7:19</a>, where trees that do not bear good fruit are cut down and thrown into the fire, emphasizing the seriousness of spiritual fruitlessness and the consequences of leading others astray.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jude.htm">Jude</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as Jude, the brother of James and Jesus.

A reef that can&#8217;t be seen rips open a ship; likewise, these men secretly tear at the body of Christ. Their presence within the celebration of Christian unity makes them all the more treacherous. <a href="/2_peter/2-13.htm">2 Peter 2:13</a> echoes the thought: &#8220;They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions as they feast with you&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shamelessly feasting with you but shepherding only themselves</b><p>The indictment deepens: they eat beside true believers &#8220;without fear,&#8221; yet their only concern is self-interest.

Wind-tossed instability recalls <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>, where immature believers are &#8220;blown here and there by every wind of teaching.&#8221; Instead of anchoring people in solid doctrine, the false teachers drift and drag others with them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Fruitless trees in autumn, twice dead after being uprooted</b><p>Autumn is harvest time; a barren tree then is worse than useless. Jesus warned, &#8220;Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-19.htm">Matthew 7:19</a>). Jude intensifies the image:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Fruitless&#8221; &#8211; outward barrenness proves there is no inward life (<a href="/luke/13-6.htm">Luke 13:6-9</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Uprooted&#8221; &#8211; no longer drawing nourishment; final judgment is certain (<a href="/john/15-6.htm">John 15:6</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Twice dead&#8221; &#8211; dead in sin now (<a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>) and destined for the second death later (<a href="/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a>).

But in any case we must probably read <span class= "ital">rocks</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>that on which those who meet them at your love-feasts will be wrecked (see Notes on <a href="/context/1_corinthians/11-20.htm" title2="When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.">1Corinthians 11:20-22</a>)--not "spots," which is borrowed from <a href="/2_peter/2-13.htm" title2="And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;">2Peter 2:13</a>. But it is just possible that as <span class= "ital">spiloi, </span>St. Peter's word, may mean either "spots" or "rocks" (though most commonly the former), so St. Jude's word (<span class= "ital">spilades</span>) may mean either "spots" or "rocks" (though almost invariably the latter). In an Orphic poem of the fourth century, <span class= "ital">spilades</span> means "spots "; but this is rather late authority for its use in the first century. Here "rocks" is the safer translation. St. Peter is dwelling on the sensuality of these sinners, and for him "spots" is the more obvious metaphor. St. Jude, in tracing an analogy between them and Cain, would be more likely to select "rocks." These libertines, like Cain, turned the ordinances of religion into selfishness and sin: both, like sunken rocks, destroyed those who unsuspectingly approached them. On the difference of reading respecting the word for "feasts of charity," or "love-feasts," see Note on <a href="/2_peter/2-13.htm" title2="And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;">2Peter 2:13</a>. Possibly the name <span class= "ital">Agapae</span> for such feasts comes from this passage. Had it been common when St. Paul wrote 1 Corinthians 11, he would probably have made a point of it; love-feasts in which there was no love. (Comp. <a href="/1_peter/5-14.htm" title2="Greet you one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.">1Peter 5:14</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jude/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - The next two verses carry on the description of the men in a running fire of epithets and figures, short, sharp, and piercing, corresponding also at certain points with <a href="/2_peter/2-13.htm">2 Peter 2:13-17</a>. <span class="cmt_word">These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear.</span> What is referred to appears not to be ordinary friendly gatherings or occasions for the interchange of affection, but the well-known <span class="accented">agapae</span>, or love-feasts, of the primitive Church, the meals provided in connection with the Lord's Supper, at which rich and poor sat down together. In adopting the rendering "spots," the English Version follows Tyndale, Cranmer, the Genevan, and the Rhemish, and is followed by some good interpreters on the ground that the term, though formally different, is essentially the same as that in <a href="/2_peter/2-13.htm">2 Peter 2:13</a>. The word itself, however, properly means "rocks," and therefore the point may be that their immoral conduct makes these men like treacherous reefs, on which their fellows make shipwreck. So the Revised Version gives "hidden rocks" in the text, and transfers "spots" to the margin. The "without fear," which is usually attached to the third clause, is connected by some with the second, in which case it expresses the reckless, irreverent spirit in which these men joined in the sacred <span class="accented">agape.</span> The last clause, "feeding [or, 'pasturing'] themselves," describes them further as having no regard to the proper object of these love-feasts in ministering to Christian fellowship and the holy sense of brotherhood, but as using them simply as a means for the saris-faction of their own appetites and the furtherance of their own base ends. Compare the evils referred to by Paul in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-21.htm">1 Corinthians 11:21</a>, and the description of the shepherds in <a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>, and <a href="/isaiah/56-11.htm">Isaiah 56:11</a>. "They are like shepherds," says Humphry, "that have themselves for their flocks, feasting themselves, not their sheep, and doing this without fear of the chief Shepherd, who has his eye upon them." <span class="cmt_word">Clouds they are without water, carried about of winds;</span> or, <span class="accented">carried past by winds.</span> Like rainless clouds, the sport of the uncertain breezes, yielding nothing for the fruitfulness of earth, these empty, volatile, inconstant men disappoint the expectation of the Church and do it no service. Trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots. The Authorized Version is less happy than usual in its rendering of the first clause. The Revised Version, in adopting "autumn trees" instead of "trees whose fruit withereth," returns to the renderings of the earlier versions, Wickliffe giving "harvest trees," Tyndale and Cranmer "trees without fruit at gathering-time," and the Rhemish "trees of autumn." The idea of <span class="accented">uselessness</span> and <span class="accented">unfruitfulness</span>, which was expressed in the previous figure, is repeated, but in a more absolute form, in this new figure. The late autumn is not the time, from the Eastern point of view, for the putting forth of fruit. The tree then becomes bare, barren, leafless. So is it with these men. Nor is it only that they have no fruit to show. The capacity of fruitfulness is extinct within them. The possibility of recovering it is gone from them. They are as dead to all good service as trees are which are rooted out as hopelessly useless. The phrase, "twice dead," may mean no more than "utterly dead." The point, however, is rather this - that they are dead, not only in respect of barrenness - which is a death in life - but in respect of the extinction of all vitality. <span class="cmt_word">Raging</span> (or, <span class="accented">wild</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame;</span> or <span class="accented">shames</span>, as the original gives it; that is to say, <span class="accented">shameful deeds</span>, or, it may be, the <span class="accented">degrading lusts</span> which inspire their unlicensed life (Huther). This comparison recalls at once the figure in <a href="/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Wandering stars, to whom is</span> (or, <span class="accented">has been</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.</span> In the Book of Enoch (chapter 18:14) the angel shows the prophet "a prison for the stars of heaven, and for the host of heaven," and in the next verse it is explained that "the stars that roll over the fire are they who have transgressed the command of God before their rising, because they did not come forth in their time." It is possible that Jude had this in mind here, as the language of earlier chapters of the same book may have suggested others of Jude's figures. If the "wandering stars" are to be identified with any particular order of the heavenly bodies, it will be with the comets rather than the planets, the movements of the former seeming, to the common eye, so much the more erratic. The doom which is declared to be in reserve, no doubt takes its form so far from the immediate figure of the comet vanishing into the unseen. But the idea expressed is not so much that of suddenness as that of certainty and irreversibility. It is the doom which Christ himself pronounces to be <span class="accented">prepared</span> (<a href="/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>), and, therefore, inevitable and perpetual. In confirmation of this statement of the certainty of the doom, the readers are next reminded of the Lord's judicial coming, and of that as the subject of prophecy. The prophecy in question, though not one of those recorded in the canonical Hebrew Scriptures, seems to have been familiar enough to the readers to make it a natural and pertinent thing to quote it. So Paul cites heathen authors or common popular sayings in support of his statements. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jude/1-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">These [men]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Houtoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">are</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eisin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
