The term "servant" reflects a position of submission and loyalty, common among early Christian leaders. This echoes the language used by other apostles, such as Paul (<a href="/romans/1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>) and James (<a href="/james/1.htm">James 1:1</a>), emphasizing their role as messengers of the Gospel. Jude's use of "Jesus Christ" affirms the divine authority and messianic role of Jesus, central to Christian belief.<p><b>and a brother of James</b><br>Jude is likely referring to James, the leader of the Jerusalem church and author of the Epistle of James, who was also a half-brother of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55</a>, <a href="/mark/6-3.htm">Mark 6:3</a>). This familial connection lends credibility and authority to Jude's message, as James was a respected figure in the early church. The mention of James rather than Jesus as a brother highlights Jude's humility and the early church's focus on spiritual rather than familial ties.<p><b>To those who are called</b><br>The term "called" refers to those who have been invited or chosen by God to be part of His people. This concept is rooted in the Old Testament, where Israel is described as God's chosen people (<a href="/isaiah/43.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>). In the New Testament, this calling is extended to all believers in Christ (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28-30</a>). It signifies a divine initiative and purpose, underscoring the grace and sovereignty of God in salvation.<p><b>loved by God the Father</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the foundational Christian belief in God's love for His people. It reflects the intimate relationship between God and believers, as seen throughout Scripture (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16, 1</a> <a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9-10</a>). God's love is portrayed as unconditional and eternal, providing assurance and comfort to the faithful. This love is the basis for the believers' identity and security in their faith.<p><b>and kept in Jesus Christ</b><br>The concept of being "kept" suggests protection and preservation by Jesus Christ. This assurance of security is a recurring theme in the New Testament, where believers are depicted as being safeguarded by Christ's power and intercession (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28-29</a>, <a href="/1_peter/1-5.htm">1 Peter 1:5</a>). It highlights the ongoing work of Christ in the lives of believers, ensuring their perseverance and ultimate salvation. This phrase reassures the faithful of their eternal security in Christ amidst trials and false teachings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jude.htm">Jude</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, identifying himself as a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James.

Not to speak of its occurrence as the name of the son of Jacob, and as the name of two individuals in the line of the ancestry of Jesus (<a href="/luke/3-26.htm">Luke 3:26, 30</a>), it appears as the name of several persons belonging to New Testament times. These include one of the brethren of the Lord (<a href="/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55</a>; <a href="/mark/6-3.htm">Mark 6:3</a>); the apostle who is called in our Authorized Version "the brother of James," but who may rather be "the son of James" (<a href="/luke/6-16.htm">Luke 6:16</a>; <a href="/john/14-22.htm">John 14:22</a>; <a href="/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>); the traitor Iscariot; the writer of this Epistle; the rebel leader of Galilee (<a href="/acts/5-37.htm">Acts 5:37</a>); the man of Damascus to whose house Ananias was directed to go (<a href="/acts/9-11.htm">Acts 9:11</a>); the delegate, surnamed Barsabas, who was sent with Paul and Barnabas from the mother Church to Antioch (<a href="/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22, 27, 32</a>). The writer attaches a twofold designation to his personal name. First, he terms himself "a servant of Jesus Christ," as the Revised Version puts it, not "the servant of Jesus Christ," with the Authorized Version. The curious fact has been noticed that this passage and <a href="/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a> (in which latter, however, we have the plural form) are the only passages in which the Authorized Version inserts the definite article in the designation of the author of any New Testament book. He gives himself thus the same title as is adopted by the James whose name heads another of the Catholic Epistles, and who is taken to be his brother. It is not certain, however, what breadth of meaning is to be ascribed to the phrase. The term, "servant of Jesus Christ," or its cognate, is used as a general description of the Christian believer, apart from all reference to any particular position in the Church (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-22.htm">1 Corinthians 7:22</a>, etc.; <a href="/ephesians/6-6.htm">Ephesians 6:6</a>). It does not carry a strictly official sense. It seems never to designate the apostolic office as such, unless some qualifying clause is added. It stands without any such addition, it is true, in <a href="/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a> and <a href="/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>. But in the former it is applied to two comrades, one of whom is not an apostle; and in the latter the person so described is in all probability not one of those who appear in the lists of the apostles. In other passages (<a href="/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="/titus/1-1.htm">Titus 1:1</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>) it is coupled with the official term "apostle." It is claimed by some of the best expositors, however, that in this passage, as in some others, it has an intermediate sense, meaning one who, while not an apostle proper, was charged with the apostolic work of preaching and ministering. If that is so, the writer presents himself as one occupying the kind of position which is assigned to Barnabas, Timothy, and others in the Book of the Acts. But he describes himself further as the "brother of James." The title has nothing like it elsewhere in the inscriptions of the Epistles, and, as the particle which connects it with the former clause indicates, it points to something not merely additional, but distinctive. The distinction is the relationship to another person in the Church, better known and more influential than himself. For the James here mentioned is generally, and we believe rightly, identified, not with the brother (or son) of Alpheus who appears among the twelve, but with the Lord's brother, who is represented by the Book of the Acts as in pre-eminent honour and authority in the mother Church of Jerusalem. Jude, therefore, might have called himself the "brother of the Lord." He abstains from doing so, it is supposed by some, because that title had become the recognized and almost consecrated name of James. Or it may rather be that he shrank from what might seem an appeal to an earthly kinship which had been sunk in a higher spiritual relationship. The choice of the title is at the same time a weighty argument against his belonging to the twelve. Unable to put forward any apostolic dignity or commission as his warrant for writing, and as his claim upon his readers' attention, he places himself beneath the shield of the more eminent name of a brother, who also was the author of an Epistle in all probability extensively circulated before this one was put forth. Those to whom he writes are also most carefully described. The terms of this threefold designation are unusual and somewhat difficult to construe. The text itself is not quite certain. The Received Text and our Authorized Version give the reading "sanctified," which has the support of one or two documents of good character, and is still accepted, chiefly on the ground of intrinsic fitness, by some scholars of rank. It must be displaced, however, by the reading "beloved," which has on its side three of the five primary uncials (the Vatican, Sinaitic, and Alexandrian) as well as important versions and patristic quotations, and is accepted by the best recent authorities. This, however, gives us so unusual a combination, "beloved in God the Father," that some are driven to the conclusion that the preposition has got somehow into a wrong place. Dr. Herr pronounces the connection to be "without analogy," and to admit of "no natural interpretation;" and the great critical edition of Messrs. Westcott and Herr marks the clause as one which probably contains some primitive error. Taking the terms, however, as the vast preponderance of documentary evidence presents them, we have three brief descriptions of the readers, all sufficiently intelligible, and each obviously in point. The most general of the three descriptive notes is the "called." The idea of a "call" pervades all Scripture. It appears in a variety of applications, of which the most distinctive is that of a call into the Messianic kingdom. This call is ascribed usually, we may perhaps say universally, to God himself In the Gospels we find the term <span class="accented">"called"</span> contrasted with the term <span class="accented">"elect"</span> or <span class="accented">"chosen"</span> (<a href="/matthew/22-14.htm">Matthew 22:14</a>), so that the call is of uncertain issue. On the other hand, in the Epistles, at least in Pauline passages of great doctrinal significance (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28, 30</a>; <a href="/romans/11-29.htm">Romans 11:29</a>, etc.), the election appears as the cause, the call as the result; and the latter then is of certain issue, or, in the language of theology, <span class="accented">effectual.</span> It is held by many that throughout the Epistles, or at least throughout the Pauline group, the term has uniformly the sense of a call not merely to the membership of the Church, but to final salvation. Whether this is the case, and how the usage of the Epistles is to be harmonized with that of the Gospels, are questions which require further consideration. It appears, however, that in the Epistles the idea of the election and the idea of the call often lie so near each other that they seem to be different expressions of one Divine act, and that an act which makes its object sure. In passages like the present, the "called" seems parallel to the "elect" of the inscriptions of 1 Peter and 2 John, and probably has the deeper Pauline meaning - a meaning which has its roots no doubt in the Old Testament conception of the certain election of a believing remnant under the theocracy (<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-20.htm">Isaiah 59:20</a>, etc.). The parties addressed are described more particularly as "beloved in God the Father." The difficulty which is felt by the best interpreters of the present day in explaining the preposition "in" as it stands in this unusual connection, appears also in the renderings of the old English Versions. Tyndale and Cranmer, indeed, follow the Received Text, and translate "sanctified in God the Father." The Genevan also gives "sanctified of God the Father." But Wickliffe and the Rhemish Version follow the other text (which is that of the Vulgate), and translate it, the former, "to thes that ben loued that ben in God the fadir;" the latter, "to them that are in God the father beloved." The difficulty is met by a variety of doubtful expedients. Some cut the knot by imposing upon the preposition the sense of "by" or the equally alien sense of "on account of." Some take it to mean "in the case of God," or "as regards God," which comes nearer the point, but is yet short of what is intended. Others would render it "within the sphere of God," understanding the readers to be described as the objects of the writer's love - a love which is no mere natural affection, but inspired by God and of spiritual motive; the objection to which is that it is out of harmony with the other designations, which describe the readers from the view-point of the Divine care. The idea, therefore, seems to be that they are the objects of the Divine love, that they have been that and continue to be that in the way of a gracious union and fellowship with himself, into which they have been introduced by God the Father. The preposition, therefore, has the mystical force which it has in the familiar phrase, "in Christ" - a force which it may also have where God is the subject. All the more so that the title "God the Father" seems to refer usually, if not exclusively, to God as the Father of Christ. The third clause describes the readers, according to the Authorized Version, as preserved in Jesus Christ. Here the Authorized Version follows Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Rhemish Version. That rendering has also been adopted by some recent interpreters of importance. It is wrong, nevertheless. For there is no instance elsewhere of the carrying over of a preposition from one clause to another in such a connection as this. Not less mistaken is Wickliffe's "kept of Jesus Christ." The Genevan Version, however, gives the correct rendering, "reserved to Jesus Christ," and the Revised Version translates it very aptly, "kept for Jesus Christ." The verb is the one which is used in <a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a> to describe the inheritance as "reserved." It occurs frequently in the Gospels, somewhat rarely in the Pauline Epistles, and there oftenest in those of latest date (<a href="/1_timothy/5-22.htm">1 Timothy 5:22</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-14.htm">1 Timothy 6:14</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>). It occurs with marked frequency in the Catholic Epistles and the Apocalypse. It is most characteristic of 1 John, 2 Peter, and Jude among these Epistles. The idea is that of being preserved by the Divine power until the coming of Christ - a preservation of which there was the more need to be assured in face of the falling away which threatened the Churches, and had indeed begun in some. Christ prayed his Father to keep, through his own Name, those that were given him (<a href="/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11</a>). Paul prays God to keep his converts blameless unto the coming of Christ (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>). These designations tell us nothing of the locality or circumstances of the readers, but limit themselves to spiritual characteristics. The relations in which the several clauses stand to each other is also a matter of dispute. The Authorized Version makes them coordinate clauses, "To them that are sanctified... and preserved... and called." It is better to take the "called" as the subject, and the two participles as the qualifying epithets, translating, with the Revised Version, "To them that are called, beloved in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ." But it perhaps best represents both the force and the order of the original to render it, "To them that are beloved in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ, called ones." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jude/1-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jude,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#959;&#973;&#948;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Ioudas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2455.htm">Strong's 2455: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Judas, the name of ten Israelites; also of the posterity of one of them and its region.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a servant</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(doulos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1401.htm">Strong's 1401: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) (as adj.) enslaved, (b) (as noun) a (male) slave.
