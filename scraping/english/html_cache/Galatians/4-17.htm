Their zeal is not for the spiritual well-being of the Galatians but rather for their own agenda.

This tactic of isolation is a common strategy used by those who wish to control or manipulate others, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/18.htm">Proverbs 18:1</a>, which warns against isolation leading to selfish desires. The historical context shows that early Christian communities were vulnerable to such divisions, which could weaken their faith and unity.<p><b>so that you may be zealous for them</b><br>The ultimate goal of the Judaizers is to win the Galatians' allegiance, not to Christ, but to themselves and their legalistic teachings. This reflects a broader biblical warning against idolatry and allegiance to anything other than God, as seen in <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>.

Scripture often recognizes sincere enthusiasm: &#8220;For I testify about them that they are zealous for God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2</a>).<p>Yet discerning zeal involves:<p>&#8226; Testing motives (<a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Observing fruit (<a href="/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Comparing teaching with the apostolic gospel (<a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>).<p>Outward eagerness can mask inward error, so Paul alerts them to look beneath the surface.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but not in a good way.</b><p>Zeal divorced from truth harms rather than helps.

Paul&#8217;s rivals possess energy, but it is:<p>&#8226; Misapplied&#8212;aimed at enforcing law-keeping rather than faith in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Misleading&#8212;driving believers back into bondage (<a href="/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>).<p>True zeal harmonizes with love and truth (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-3.htm">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Instead, they want to isolate you from us,</b><p>The tactic is separation.

Isolation works by:<p>&#8226; Casting doubt on Paul&#8217;s credentials (<a href="/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Questioning the sufficiency of grace (<a href="/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Creating an &#8220;us versus them&#8221; mindset that erodes fellowship (<a href="/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7-9</a>).<p>Healthy shepherds gather; false shepherds scatter and corral for their own ends (<a href="/john/10-12.htm">John 10:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that you may be zealous for them.</b><p>The endgame is allegiance.

Zeal can be a disguise for manipulation&#8212;cutting believers off from sound teachers to secure personal devotion. Measure every message by the gospel of grace, stay connected to trustworthy fellowship, and reserve wholehearted zeal for the Lord Jesus, not for those who court followers for themselves.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/galatians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17-20) All this eagerness to court your favour springs from an interested motive: they wish to make a sect of you, in which they shall be masters and courted in their turn. Not but that it is a good thing for teachers and taught--you and I--to seek favour with each other, so long as it is done disinterestedly, and that, too, when I am absent as well as when I am present. My heart yearns towards you. I cannot forget that you owe your life, as Christians, to me. Now, once more, it seems as if all that long travail has to be gone over again. You must be re-fashioned in the likeness of Christ, as the infant is fashioned in the form of man. Would that I could be with you and speak in a different tone, for how to deal with you I do not know.<p>(17) <span class= "bld">They zealously affect you.</span>--"Zealously affect" is a single word in the Greek, and means "to show zeal towards," "to court," "to curry favour with," "to canvass eagerly, so as to win over to their side." The subject of this verse is the Judaising teachers.<p><span class= "bld">They would exclude you.</span>--They desire to separate you from the rest of the Gentile churches, and to make a sect by itself, in which they themselves may bear rule. All the other Gentile churches had accepted the freer teaching of St. Paul; the Judaising party wished to make of Galatia an isolated centre of Judaism. They did this with personal motives, "not well"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> from honest and honourable motives--but with a view to secure their own ascendancy.<p><span class= "bld">That ye might affect them.</span>--The same word as "zealously affect" above and in the next verse. They expect to have all this zeal on their part returned to them in kind. With them it is the proselytizing zeal of the faction leader; from you they expect the deferential zeal of devoted followers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They zealously affect you, but</span> <span class="cmt_word">not well</span> (<span class="greek_word">zhlou = sin u(ma = ou) kalw = </span>); <span class="accented">they admire you in no good way.</span> Of the several senses of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, those of "envy," "emulate," "strive after," are plainly unsuitable in this verse and the one which follows. So also are the senses "to be zealous on one's behalf, to be jealous of one," which in Hellenistic usage crept into it, apparently from its having been in other senses adopted to represent the Hebrew verb <span class="accented">qinne</span>, and borrowing these from this Hebrew verb. The only phase of its meaning which suits the present passage is that which it perhaps by far the most frequently presents in ordinary Greek, though not so commonly in the Septuagint and in the New Testa ment, namely, "to admire," "deem and pronounce highly fortunate and blessed." When used in this sense, it has properly for its object a person; but with a suitable qualification of meaning it may have for its object something inanimate. Very often is the accusative of the person accompanied with the genitive of the ground of gratulation, as Aristophanes, 'Ach.,' 972, <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> "I congratulate, admire, you for your cleverness;" see also 'Equit.,' 834; 'Thes moph.,' 175; 'Vesp.,' 1450; but not always; thus Demosthenes, 'Fals. Legat.,' p. 424, "(<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>) they admire and congratulate and would each one be himself the like;" 'Adv. Lept.,' p. 500 (respecting public funeral orations), "This is the custom of men admiring (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) virtue, not of men looking grudgingly upon those who on its account are being honoured;" Xenophon, 'Mere.,' 2:1,19. "Thinking highly of themselves, and praised and admired (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">by</span> others;" Josephus, 'C. Ap.,' 1:25, "(<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) admired by many." It thus seems to be often just equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, with the sense of which latter verb it is brought into close neighbourhood in Aristophanes, 'Nubes,' 1188, "' Blessed (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span>), Strepsiades, are you, both for being so wise yourself and for having such a son as you have,' - thus will my friends and fellow-wardsmen say, in admiration of me (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>)." Probably this is the sense in which the apostle uses the verb in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>, <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1ff7;</span>, "I rejoice in your felicity with an infinite joy;" referring to the intense admiration which he felt of their present felicity, in their having been betrothed a chaste maiden to Christ; not till the next verse introducing the mention of his fear lest this paradisaical happiness might be darkened by the wiles of Satan. It is in a modified shade of the same sense that the word is employee - where it is rendered "covet earnestly" in our Authorized Version in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-31.htm">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-1.htm">1 Corinthians 14:1, 39</a>. In the passage now. before us, then, <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> probably means "they admire you," that is, they tell you so. They were expressing strong admiration of the high Christian character and eminent gifts of these simple-minded believers; the charisms which had been bestowed upon them (<a href="/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2</a>); their virtues, in contrast especially with their heathen neighbours; their spiritual enlightenment. No doubt all this was said with the view of courting their favour; but <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> can hardly itself mean "court favour," and no instance of its occurring in this sense has been adduced; and this rendering of the verb breaks down utterly in ver. 18. The persons referred to must, of course, be understood as those who were busy in instilling at once Judaizing sentiments and also feelings of antipathy to the apostle himself, as if he were their enemy (ver. 16). The Epistle furnishes no indication whatever that these persons were strangers coming among them from without, answering, for example, to those spoken of in <a href="/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a> as disturbing the Antiochian Church. It is quite supposable that the warning which, not long after the writing of this Epistle, the apostle addressed to the Ephesian elders at Miletus (<a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29, 30</a>), when putting them on their guard against those who "from among their own selves should rise up speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them," was founded in part upon this experience of his in the Galatian Churches. Galatian Churchmen it may well have been, and no other, who now (as the apostle had just been apprised) were employing that <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, that "kind suave speech" and that "speech of compliment and laudation," which in <a href="/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a> he describes as a favourite device of this class of deceivers, to win the ear of their unwary brethren. "In no good way;" for they did it insincerely and with the purpose of drawing them <span class="accented">into</span> courses which, though these men themselves knew it not, were nevertheless fraught with ruin to their spiritual welfare. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, they would</span> <span class="cmt_word">exclude you;</span> or, us (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">nay<span class="cmt_word"></span>,</span> <span class="accented">rather</span>, <span class="accented">to shut you out is their wish.</span> The reading "us," noticed in the margin of the Authorized Version, is probably a merely conjectural emendation made in the Greek text by Beza, wholly unsupported by manuscript authority. The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span> is adversative to the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, the secondary thought of the preceding clause, in the same way as the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span> in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-7.htm">1 Corinthians 2:7</a> is adversative to the secondary negative clauses of ver. 6. The verb "shut out," with no determinative qualification annexed, must have it supplied from the unexpressed ground for the "admiration" denoted by the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. The high eminence of spiritual condition and happiness on the possession of which these men were congratulating their brethren, they would be certainly excluded from if they listened to <span class="accented">them.</span> Compare the phrase, "who are unsettling you," driving you out of house and home, in ch. 5:12, where see note. <span class="cmt_word">That ye might affect them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">that ye may admire themselves.</span> The position of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> makes it emphatic. We may paraphrase thus: that, being detached from regard to my teaching, and made to feel a certain grave deficiency on your own part in respect to acceptableness with God, ye may be led to look up as disciples to these kind-hearted sympathetic advisers for instruction and guidance. The construction of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, which in ordinary Greek is the present <span class="accented">indicative</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> being the form for the present <span class="accented">subjunctive</span>, is precisely similar to that of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">1 Corinthians 4:6</a>. When it is considered how punctually St. Paul is wont to comply with the syntactical rule with reference to <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, and that these two remarkable deflections therefrom are connected with contract forms of verbs in -<span class="greek">&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, Ruckert's suggestion seems to be perfectly reasonable, that the solecism lies, not in the syntactical construction, but in the grammatical in flexion, contracting -<span class="greek">&#x1f79;&#x3b7;</span> into -<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> instead of into-<span class="greek">&#x1ff6;</span>. This form of contraction may have been a provincialism of Tarsus, or it may have been an idiotism of St. Paul himself. Other expedients of explanation which have been proposed are intolerably harsh and improbable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/4-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Those people] are zealous for you,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#918;&#951;&#955;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Z&#275;lousin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2206.htm">Strong's 2206: </a> </span><span class="str2">From zelos; to have warmth of feeling for or against.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[but] not</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8016;</span> <span class="translit">(ou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3756.htm">Strong's 3756: </a> </span><span class="str2">No, not.
