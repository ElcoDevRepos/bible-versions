These individuals were respected for their close association with Jesus and their leadership roles. The term highlights the human tendency to revere certain individuals based on their status or position. This phrase underscores the importance of recognizing that spiritual authority and wisdom come from God, not merely from human accolades.<p><b>whatever they were makes no difference to me;</b><br>Paul emphasizes that the status or reputation of these leaders does not influence his message or mission. This reflects the principle that the gospel's truth is not dependent on human authority but on divine revelation. Paul&#8217;s apostolic authority was directly from Christ, as he had previously stated in <a href="/galatians/1.htm">Galatians 1:1</a>. This phrase also serves as a reminder that the gospel transcends human hierarchies and social structures.<p><b>God does not show favoritism&#8212;</b><br>This statement aligns with the biblical teaching that God is impartial and judges based on righteousness rather than external appearances or social status. <a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a> and <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a> echo this sentiment, affirming that God&#8217;s grace and truth are available to all, regardless of their background. This principle is foundational to the gospel message, which is inclusive and universal.<p><b>those leaders added nothing to me.</b><br>Paul asserts that the leaders in Jerusalem did not alter or add to the gospel he preached. This reinforces the idea that the gospel he received was complete and divinely revealed. It also highlights the unity of the message among the apostles, despite their different ministries. This phrase assures the Galatians that Paul's gospel is authentic and consistent with the teachings of the other apostles, as seen in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a> during the Jerusalem Council.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who wrote the letter to the Galatians, defending his apostleship and the gospel he preached.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The place where Paul met with the other apostles to discuss the gospel he was preaching to the Gentiles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>- The leaders in the early church, including Peter, James, and John, who were considered pillars of the church.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_galatians.htm">The Galatians</a></b><br>- The recipients of Paul's letter, a group of churches in the region of Galatia.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>- The ultimate authority who does not show favoritism, emphasizing the equality of all believers before Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_impartiality.htm">God's Impartiality</a></b><br>God does not show favoritism, and neither should we.

"I did indeed hold conference with them privately; but with all their advantages, real or assumed, I learnt nothing from them that I did not already know, and they ended by recognising the independence and validity of my mission."<p><span class= "bld">But of these who seemed to be somewhat.</span>--Translate rather, <span class= "ital">But from those who are reputed to be somewhat.</span> The phrase corresponds to "them which are of reputation" in <a href="/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>; and here, as there, it is important to keep the present tense. It is not only "those who <span class= "ital">were</span> of authority at the Council," but "those who <span class= "ital">are</span> the great authorities with you Galatians now." The Apostle speaks with a certain amount of irony. "From these very great authorities, these persons of such especial reputation [I got nothing]."<p><span class= "bld">Whatsoever they were.</span>--We shall, perhaps, not be wrong in keeping to the Authorised version, though some of the best commentators translate rather, <span class= "ital">What they</span> (once) <span class= "ital">were,</span> with a stress on "were," and referring to the advantage which they possessed over St. Paul in having "known Christ after the flesh" through their early call to the Apostleship.<p><span class= "bld">God accepteth no man's person.</span>--This phrase is a curious instance of a Greek expression framed after the analogy of the Hebrew, and yet in the process contracting a different signification, through the influence of the idiomatic use of one of the Greek expressions involved. "To accept the face" in the Old Testament is used in a good sense of "showing favour" to any one, but without any imputation of partiality. "To accept the face" (or <span class= "ital">person</span>) in the New Testament always carries with it the idea of partiality; the word for "face" being idiomatically used for "a mask," and hence coming to mean "the outward, assumed, accidental characteristics of a man" as opposed to his real and inward character. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/22-16.htm" title="And they sent out to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God in truth, neither care you for any man: for you regard not the person of men.">Matthew 22:16</a>; <a href="/luke/20-21.htm" title="And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that you say and teach rightly, neither accept you the person of any, but teach the way of God truly:">Luke 20:21</a>; <a href="/acts/10-34.htm" title="Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:">Acts 10:34</a>; <a href="/romans/2-11.htm" title="For there is no respect of persons with God.">Romans 2:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-9.htm" title="And, you masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.">Ephesians 6:9</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-25.htm" title=" But he that does wrong shall receive for the wrong which he has done: and there is no respect of persons.">Colossians 3:25</a>; <a href="/james/2-1.htm" title="My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.">James 2:1</a>; <a href="/james/2-9.htm" title="But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.">James 2:9</a>; <a href="/jude/1-16.htm" title="These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaks great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.">Jude 1:16</a>.) The meaning here is that even if the elder Apostles had "seen with their eyes," and "looked upon and handled the Word of Life" (<a href="/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1John 1:1</a>), God would not regard the advantages implied in this more than any other external advantage of birth, position, natural gifts, &c. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But of these who seemed to be somewhat</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">now from those who were reputed to be somewhat.</span> The conjunction <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> does not seem to be adversative here, but simply introductory of a new particular. The writer is about to introduce, which he does in the next five verses (6-10), a fresh illustration of the independent position, which in point both of doctrine and of ministerial footing he held in relation to the first apostles and to the heads of the Jerusalemite Church, and at the same time of the full recognition which in both respects these had accorded to him. The construction of this sentence, as it proceeds, is interrupted and changed. When St. Paul wrote, <span class="accented">from those who were reputed to be somewhat</span>, he would seem to have meant to add, "I received nothing fresh either in knowledge of the gospel or in authority as Christ's minister," or some-tiring to that effect; but in his indignant parenthesis asserting his independence with respect to those whom his gainsayers in Galatia would seem to have pronounced his superiors, both in knowledge and in office, he loses sight of the beginning of the sentence, and begins it afresh in another form with the words (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), <span class="accented">for they who were of repute</span>, etc. <span class="accented">Reputed to be somewhat</span>; that is, thought highly cf. The phrase is of frequent occurrence, both in Greek and in Latin authors. It is obvious that he refers to the twelve and the leaders of the mother Church of Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">of what sort they at any time were maketh no matter to me.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (of what sort) is suggested by the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> (somewhat), and the <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (they were) by the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (reputed); from those reputed to be somewhat whatever they really were. The comparison of the usage of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in other passages (<a href="/acts/26-29.htm">Acts 26:29</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-18.htm">1 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>; <a href="/james/1-24.htm">James 1:24</a>) hardly favours the specific interpretation, "how great." In respect to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;</span>, in a classical author, as Bishop Light foot observes, we should have no hesitation in taking it as equivalent to <span class="accented">cunque.</span> But the word occurs in the New Testament in thirty-one ether places, and in not one is it <span class="accented">eunque</span>, but always the adverb of time, either "sometime," "in time past," as above, <a href="/galatians/1-13.htm">Galatians 1:13, 23</a>; <a href="/john/9-13.htm">John 9:13</a>; or "any time," as <a href="/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:5</a>. The latter shade of meaning seems the more appropriate here. The <span class="accented">any time</span>, though not to be limited to, would, however, cover the time when the twelve were in personal attendance upon our Lord - a circumstance which St. Paul's detractors were no doubt wont to hold up as a mark of distinction not possessed by him. It seems best to take of <span class="accented">what sort</span> as dependent upon the following words, <span class="accented">maketh no matter to me.</span> This last clause is not exactly equivalent to "I care not," as if it were an almost supercilious waving aside of the consideration; it is rather a grave assertion of a matter of fact. Whatever were the gifts of knowledge and spiritual insight which the twelve or other heads of the Jerusalemite Church possessed, or whatever their ministerial privileges or authority, whether derived from personal intercourse with the Lord Jesus when upon earth or in any other way, Paul's knowledge of the gospel and Paul's apostolic authority were neither of them at all affected by them. Now, at the time that he is writing this Epistle, he was just the same in respect to the possession of the essential truth of the gospel and to his apostolic authority as if he had had no intercourse with the spiritual rulers of the Jewish Church. <span class="cmt_word">God accepteth no man's person</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The order of the words in the Greek throws especial emphasis upon "person:" <span class="accented">person of man God accepteth not</span>; that is, it is never on account of his person that God accepteth a man. This phrase, "accept a man's person," is of frequent occurrence in the Bible. In the New Testament it is always used in a bad sense, which in the Old is by no means the case. This difference is due, as Bishop Lightfoot observes, to the secondary sense of <span class="accented">actor's mask</span> attaching to the Greek noun, the actor on the Greek stage, as also on the Roman, being wont to wear a mask suited to the character in which he appeared; whence also <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> got to signify this character itself. The corresponding technical term among the Romans was <span class="accented">persona</span>, a word never used of the natural face, as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> was. This explains the adoption of this last term in its Anglicized form by our English translators in the phrase now before us. With the like metaphorical application of the idea as that which was so common among the Romans, the word "<span class="accented">per</span>son" seemed well fitted to denote the part, or certain accessories of the part, which a man plays on the stage, so to speak, of human life, in contradistinction to his more interior and essential character. The phrase denotes accepting a man, for example, for his worldly rank or position, for his office, for his nationality, even for his Church status (see <a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1, 9</a>; <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-17.htm">1 Peter 1:17</a>). The special adjuncts of a man's <span class="accented">person</span> referred to in the present passage are those of the outward call aforetime to be apostles and personal attendants upon the Lord Jesus while upon earth, and, in the case of St. James the Lord's brother, personal relationship to him. And St. Paul means to intimate that <span class="accented">his</span> knowledge of Divine truth and <span class="accented">his</span> ministerial fidelity and efficiency might be as real and as great, if God's will were so, as the knowledge and ministerial fidelity and efficiency of the twelve and St. James, whom his gainsayers were honouring so far above him merely for their <span class="accented">person's</span> sake. God made no such difference between him and them, but wrought with him just as much. <span class="cmt_word">For they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>); <span class="accented">for to me they who were of repute in conference added nothing.</span> The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, as it stands here, appears related to the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 2. I laid before them my gospel; they imparted to me nothing fresh (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). Thus Chrysostom and Theodoret. In <a href="/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a>, where the same verb occurs (see note), there is nothing to accentuate the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, as there is here. The "for" appears related to the foregoing clause. That God does not respect man for his person was evidenced by the fact that Paul's knowledge of the gospel was already so complete and his work was so honoured by God, that those whose <span class="accented">person</span> seemed to many so markedly superior to his, found that all they had to do was to frankly recognize his teaching as already adequate and complete, and his work as standing on a perfectly equal footing with their own. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/2-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as for</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#960;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(Apo)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_575.htm">Strong's 575: </a> </span><span class="str2">From, away from.
