This issue was significant in the early church as it addressed the core of the gospel message and the nature of salvation by grace through faith.<p><b>because some false brothers</b><br>The term "false brothers" indicates individuals who claimed to be part of the Christian community but were not genuine in their faith or intentions. These individuals were likely Judaizers, who insisted that Gentile Christians must adhere to Jewish customs. This reflects the tension between Jewish and Gentile believers in the early church.<p><b>had come in under false pretenses</b><br>These false brothers infiltrated the Christian community with deceitful intentions. Their presence was not for fellowship or genuine faith but to impose legalistic practices. This highlights the early church's struggle with maintaining doctrinal purity and the challenges of false teachings.<p><b>to spy on our freedom in Christ Jesus</b><br>The freedom mentioned here refers to liberation from the Mosaic Law's requirements, emphasizing salvation through faith in Christ alone. This freedom was a central theme in Paul's teachings, contrasting the new covenant of grace with the old covenant of the law. The false brothers sought to undermine this freedom by reintroducing legalistic bondage.<p><b>in order to enslave us</b><br>The goal of these false brothers was to bring believers back under the yoke of the law, which Paul equates with spiritual slavery. This reflects the broader biblical theme of freedom versus bondage, where true freedom is found in Christ, and any return to legalism is seen as a regression to slavery.

After years of fruitful ministry among Gentiles, he traveled to Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1-2</a>) to address whether new believers must keep the Mosaic Law, especially circumcision. The &#8220;issue&#8221; is not a minor misunderstanding but a threat to the very gospel he preached (<a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>). &#8226; Notice that Paul treats doctrinal purity as a present, pressing matter&#8212;faithfulness to Christ demands action in the moment, not after the fact (Jude 3; <a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because some false brothers</b><p>&#8220;False brothers&#8221; are people who wear the label &#8220;Christian&#8221; yet deny its message by what they add to or subtract from it. &#8226; Paul faced them often (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-26.htm">2 Corinthians 11:26</a>); John saw them leave because they were never truly of the faith (<a href="/1_john/2-19.htm">1 John 2:19</a>). &#8226; Jesus warned His disciples to beware of wolves in sheep&#8217;s clothing (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>).

It seems, on the whole, best to supply the missing clause thus: "But (or, <span class= "ital">though</span>) on account of false brethren . . . [I was urged to have him circumcised]." The leaders of the Church at Jerusalem took the ground, not of insisting upon circumcision as a necessity, but rather advising it as a matter of policy, to allay the ill feeling excited against St. Paul by designing men, traitors in the camp, who, though Christians in name, were Jews at heart. Many commentators, however, adopt the rendering of the Authorised version: "And that because of false (or rather, <span class= "ital">the false</span>) brethren," understanding that he was not compelled to be circumcised. The reason why Titus was not circumcised was the evidently interested and treacherous motives of the Judaising partisans who clamoured for it.<p><span class= "bld">Unawares brought in, who came in privily.</span>--These two words correspond to each other in the Greek, and bring out in a graphic and forcible way the insidious and designing character of the party most violently opposed to St. Paul. Professing to be Christians, they were really Jews of the narrowest sort, who only entered into the Church to spy into and restrict its liberties.<p><span class= "bld">Which we have in Christ Jesus.</span>--The Christian Church is the Messianic kingdom, which derives all its attributes directly from its Head.

The rendering of our English Version represents the connection with the preceding sentence quite correctly. The designation, "false brethren," after the analogy of "false apostles," "false prophets" (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <a href="/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>), were those who were not really brethren in Christ, but had superinduced the profession of such over a state of mind radically incompatible with it; not children of God through faith in Christ Jesus," but only simulating faith in Christ; outwardly "baptized into Christ," but not inwardly, and therefore not really. The loud demand which those false brethren were making, that all Gentile converts should be circumcised, was distinctly rested by them upon the principle that otherwise those converts were not qualified for sonship in God's family or for admission to Church fellowship with, at any rate, the believing circumcision. This demand of theirs, made upon this pernicious principle, it was that had raised the present controversy, and had brought Paul and his fellow-deputies to Jerusalem. If, under such circumstances, Titus, with St. Paul's concurrence, had consented to be circumcised, then, whatever the motive of his consenting, it would have seemed to those false brethren, and not to them only, but indeed to the Church at large, that all had agreed in recognizing the soundness of that principle of theirs that circumcision was indispensable for perfect Divine acceptance. This consideration, we may believe, Titus and St. Paul now urged upon those who, not themselves alleging that principle, nor even allowing it to be true, yet, on other grounds, were recommending and pressing for Titus's circumcision. And the argument prevailed with them. They withdrew that pressure of theirs, and consented to leave Titus to stand there before the Church and the world, a claimant of full admission to all Christian fellowship while still in uncircumcision. It was those false brethren themselves, then, that made it impossible at the present juncture that those who held fast to the truth of the gospel should accept counsels of compromise or conciliation. In matters of indifference (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>) there is a time for conciliation - this no one could ever be more ready to see and act upon than St. Paul; but there is also a time for the unbending assertion of truth, and the clamours of the false brethren made the present to be one of the latter kind. In that particular juncture of Church development, the doctrine itself of the absolute justification of men through faith in Christ was at stake. If Titus was not qualified for Christian fellowship by simply his faith in Christ, then neither was he qualified for acceptance with God by simply his faith. <span class="accented">Without warrant brought in.</span> In the compound verbal <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>, appears to point, not so much to the manner in which they had been brought in, as <span class="accented">e.g. stealthily</span>, <span class="accented">craftily</span>, as to the circumstance that they had no business to be brought in at all; they were an <span class="accented">alien</span> brood. The Greek glosselogists, Hesychius, Photius, and Suidas, render it <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e. alien.</span> In <a href="/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, reference is made to the alien character of the teaching spoken cf. The apostle's feeling is that men who do not accept the truth that through faith in Christ we are justified, and through faith only, have no proper place in the Church of Christ (comp. <a href="/galatians/5-4.htm">Galatians 5:4, 5</a>). If the question be asked - Who brought them in? the parable of the tares suggests the answer - The devil (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/11-15.htm">2 Corinthians 11:15</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-11.htm">2 Corinthians 2:11</a>). Who came in privily (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">a set of men who without warrant came in.</span> The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> in the verb has the same force as it has in <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>. So also in <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); to <span class="accented">spy out that liberty of ours which</span>, etc. These men had come into the Church <span class="accented">prepared</span> to detect and to regard with the keenest dislike anything, either in doctrine or in Church action, which would infringe upon their own legalism, and to wage war upon it. For this notion of hostile intent is strongly suggested by the verb "to spy out" (cf. <a href="/2_kings/10-3.htm">2 Kings 10:3</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/19-3.htm">1 Chronicles 19:3</a>; and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in <a href="/joshua/2-2.htm">Joshua 2:2</a>). The infinitive (of purpose), viewed in reference to the men themselves, can be understood only of their disposed-ness to make this use of their membership; for they can hardly be supposed to have entered into the Church for that definite object; but the apostle views them as emissaries of the great enemy; Satan's design thus to wage war with our gospel liberty (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13, 15</a>) is by a bold figure ascribed in this infinitive to his instruments. This <span class="accented">liberty</span> means the whole spirit of freedom which faith in Christ imparts to the Christian, including, for one thing, his emancipation from the yoke of ceremonialism, but containing also more. <span class="cmt_word">That they might bring us into bondage</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>], The reading of six of the uncial manuscripts is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>; of three, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>; of one, -<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The variation in the <span class="accented">mood</span> of the verb is immaterial; for the construction of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> (of purpose) with an indicative, though strange to the eye of the student of classical Greek, is not foreign to the writers of the New Testament; but the variation in the <span class="accented">voice</span> affects the sense. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> would mean "bring into bondage to themselves," which most probably is not the writer's meaning; he apparently means:rather, "deprive us of our liberty by enslaving us to the Law" (cf. ch. 4:25; 5:1).
