In this context, "they" refers to the churches in Judea, who had not yet met Paul in person. This highlights the importance of testimony and reputation in the early church, as well as the challenges of communication in the ancient world.<p><b>The man who formerly persecuted us:</b><br>This phrase refers to Paul's past as a zealous Pharisee who actively persecuted Christians (<a href="/acts/8-3.htm">Acts 8:3, 9</a>:1-2). His transformation from persecutor to apostle is a powerful testament to the grace of God. It also serves as a reminder of the radical change that can occur through faith in Christ, echoing themes of redemption and forgiveness found throughout Scripture.<p><b>is now preaching the faith:</b><br>Paul's conversion and subsequent mission to preach the Gospel demonstrate the transformative power of encountering Christ. His preaching was centered on the death and resurrection of Jesus, fulfilling the prophecies of the Old Testament (Isaiah 53, <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>). This also underscores the idea that God can use anyone, regardless of their past, to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>he once tried to destroy:</b><br>Paul's initial efforts to destroy the Christian faith were rooted in his deep commitment to Jewish law and tradition. His dramatic shift to becoming a proponent of the very faith he sought to eliminate illustrates the theme of divine intervention and calling. This transformation is a type of Christ's own death and resurrection, symbolizing new life and purpose.

The <span class="accented">object</span> to the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is always something which is announced, never a thing which is required (cf. <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10</a>; <a href="/acts/5-42.htm">Acts 5:42</a>; <a href="/acts/10-36.htm">Acts 10:36</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>); so that "faith" here cannot mean the faith which men are to render to Jesus, but the doctrine which they are to believe, to wit, that Jesus is Christ the Saviour. We have here the early beginnings of that objective sense in which afterwards the word got to be so commonly used in the Church to denote the Christian doctrine (see Bishop Lightfoot's essay 'Galatians,' pp. 154-158). In the second clause, "which he was sometime making havoc of," the "faith" is identified with the Church which held it (comp. ver. 13). We may heartily accept Estius's comment, cited by Meyer, "Quia Christi fidelibus fidem extorquere nitebatur," while we still think it intolerably harsh to understand "faith," as Meyer does, in a subjective sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/1-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7974;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;san)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
