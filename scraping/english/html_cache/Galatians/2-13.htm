The "other Jews" likely refers to Jewish Christians who were influenced by Peter's actions. This reflects the tension in the early church between Jewish and Gentile believers, a significant issue addressed in the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). The term "hypocrisy" indicates a failure to live consistently with the truth of the Gospel, which teaches that in Christ, there is no distinction between Jew and Gentile (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). This incident underscores the struggle within the early church to fully embrace the implications of the Gospel for all people, regardless of ethnic background.<p><b>so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray</b><br>Barnabas, known as the "son of encouragement" (<a href="/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>), was a respected leader in the early church and a close associate of Paul. His being "led astray" highlights the powerful influence of peer pressure and the challenge of maintaining doctrinal purity. Barnabas's involvement emphasizes the seriousness of the situation, as he was a key figure in the mission to the Gentiles (Acts 13-14). This incident serves as a warning about the dangers of compromising the Gospel message and the importance of standing firm in the truth. It also illustrates the human tendency to falter, even among strong leaders, and the need for accountability within the Christian community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter (Cephas)</a></b><br>An apostle of Jesus Christ, known for his leadership in the early church.

These were Jewish believers in Antioch who had already embraced salvation by grace through faith (<a href="/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19&#8211;21</a>). By identifying them as &#8220;other,&#8221; Paul distinguishes them from Peter, yet shows how easily an entire group&#8212;people who genuinely loved Christ&#8212;can drift when strong voices exert pressure (<a href="/exodus/23-2.htm">Exodus 23:2</a>; <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).<p>&#8226; They had witnessed Gentiles receiving the Spirit (<a href="/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44&#8211;48</a>).<p>&#8226; They knew the Jerusalem church&#8217;s verdict that circumcision was not required for salvation (<a href="/acts/15-7.htm">Acts 15:7&#8211;11</a>).<p>Still, earthly ties and cultural habits remained powerful, reminding us that prior convictions must continually be surrendered to the clear teaching of Scripture (<a href="/mark/7-8.htm">Mark 7:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>joined him</b><p>These believers &#8220;joined him&#8221;&#8212;literally lining up behind Peter&#8217;s example.

Their decision was not the product of new revelation but of social pressure: certain men &#8220;from James&#8221; had arrived (<a href="/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a>), and fear replaced faith.<p>&#8226; Peer pressure inside the church can be subtler than persecution from outside (<a href="/john/12-42.htm">John 12:42&#8211;43</a>).<p>&#8226; A single compromise rarely stays isolated; it invites company (<a href="/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in his hypocrisy</b><p>&#8220;Hypocrisy&#8221; means pretending to be something you are not. Peter had eaten freely with Gentile believers (<a href="/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a>), affirming their full inclusion. By withdrawing, he implied they were second-class. Jesus condemned this very duplicity (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>; <a href="/luke/12-1.htm">Luke 12:1</a>). Here, hypocrisy appears not as overt doctrinal denial but as behavior contradicting known truth&#8212;yet Paul calls it what it is, because actions preach louder than words (<a href="/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that</b><p>The phrase signals consequence: Peter&#8217;s vacillation set off a chain reaction. Scripture often highlights the ripple effect of sin: &#8220;A little leaven leavens the whole batch&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/5-9.htm">Galatians 5:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>). What begins in one heart soon shapes an entire fellowship (<a href="/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by their hypocrisy</b><p>Notice the shift from Peter&#8217;s hypocrisy to &#8220;their&#8221; hypocrisy. Once others joined, the collective behavior gained its own momentum. Wrongdoing reinforced wrongdoing (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>). Group complicity can numb individual conscience, making repentance harder (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>even Barnabas</b><p>Barnabas&#8212;whose name means &#8220;son of encouragement&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>)&#8212;had championed Gentile inclusion from the start (<a href="/acts/11-22.htm">Acts 11:22&#8211;26</a>; 13:2-3). Paul&#8217;s surprise (&#8220;even Barnabas&#8221;) underscores how far-reaching the damage was. If a mature, mission-minded leader can stumble, none of us are immune (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>). Reputation or past faithfulness never grants a lifelong exemption from vigilance (<a href="/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was led astray</b><p>The verb points to being pulled off course, not a deliberate U-turn. Yet the result is the same: deviation from the gospel&#8217;s freedom (<a href="/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>). Spiritual drift often feels gradual and defensible until confronted by Scripture (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-1.htm">Hebrews 2:1</a>). Paul&#8217;s public rebuke (<a href="/galatians/2-14.htm">Galatians 2:14</a>) served both to rescue the erring and to protect the flock (<a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>; Jude 23).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/galatians/2-13.htm">Galatians 2:13</a> reveals how quickly respected believers can slip into hypocritical conduct when cultural fear overrides gospel conviction. Peter&#8217;s withdrawal from Gentile fellowship prompted the &#8220;other Jews,&#8221; and astonishingly even Barnabas, to follow, demonstrating that:<p>&#8226; Leadership carries weight&#8212;our choices guide others for good or ill.<p>&#8226; Hypocrisy is not merely spoken deceit; it is any behavior contradicting revealed truth.<p>&#8226; Group sin multiplies impact, endangering even seasoned saints.<p>Therefore, steadfast adherence to the clear, grace-centered message of Christ is essential, no matter who wavers or what pressures arise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/galatians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">The other Jews . . .</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span> converts from Judaism, as distinct from Gentile converts, in the Church at Antioch.<p><span class= "bld">Dissembled.</span>--The "dissimulation," or "hypocrisy" (the literal sense of the Greek word), consisted in suppressing their real convictions, and acting as if from a set of convictions different from their real ones.<p><span class= "bld">Barnabas also.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">even Barnabas,</span> my own familiar friend, and so recently my ally in pleading the cause of the Gentiles.
