The law, given to Israel at Mount Sinai, served as a guide and a means to reveal sin (<a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>). The promises of God, particularly the promise to Abraham, were based on faith and grace (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). Paul clarifies that the law is not in opposition to these promises but serves a different purpose. The law was a temporary measure until the coming of Christ, who fulfills the promises (<a href="/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>).<p><b>Certainly not!</b><br>Paul emphatically denies any contradiction between the law and God's promises. This strong negation underscores the harmony in God's plan of salvation. The law and the promises work together in God's redemptive history, with the law highlighting humanity's need for a Savior and the promises pointing to the fulfillment in Christ (<a href="/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-12</a>).<p><b>For if a law had been given that could impart life,</b><br>The hypothetical scenario Paul presents emphasizes the limitations of the law. The law, while holy and just, was never intended to impart spiritual life or righteousness (<a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>). It was a guardian until Christ came (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>). The inability of the law to give life points to the necessity of faith in Jesus, who offers eternal life (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<p><b>then righteousness would certainly have come from the law.</b><br>Paul concludes that if the law could have provided righteousness, there would have been no need for Christ's sacrificial death. Righteousness, in the biblical sense, is a right standing before God, which the law cannot achieve due to human sinfulness (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>). Instead, righteousness is a gift from God through faith in Jesus Christ (<a href="/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>). This underscores the central message of the gospel: salvation by grace through faith, not by works of the law (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, addressing the churches in Galatia regarding the role of the Law and faith in Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatians.htm">Galatians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a group of early Christian communities in the region of Galatia, struggling with the influence of Judaizers who insisted on adherence to the Mosaic Law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mosaic_law.htm">Mosaic Law</a></b><br>The body of laws given to Moses in the Old Testament, which includes moral, ceremonial, and civil laws.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promises_of_god.htm">Promises of God</a></b><br>Refers to the promises made by God, particularly those given to Abraham, which are fulfilled in Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judaizers.htm">Judaizers</a></b><br>A group within the early church advocating for the necessity of following Jewish laws and customs, including circumcision, for salvation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_the_law.htm">The Purpose of the Law</a></b><br>The law was never intended to impart life or righteousness.

In Christ, the promise is fulfilled, righteousness is granted, and eternal life is received&#8212;by faith alone, exactly as God intended from the beginning.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/galatians/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21-24) If the Law was thus inferior to the promise, does it therefore follow that it is contrary to it? By no means. The Law could not indeed give life; it could not justify, or place in a state of righteousness. Its real result was rather to place all men in a state of sin. But by so doing it prepared the way for the fulfilment of the promise in all who put faith in Christ. The Law was a close and strict, yet salutary, discipline to make us fit for faith in Christ.<p>(21) <span class= "bld">The promises.</span>--Here, as in <a href="/galatians/3-16.htm" title="Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He said not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.">Galatians 3:16</a>, the plural, because the promise to Abraham was several times repeated, and afterwards ratified to his descendants.<p><span class= "bld">For if . . .</span>--The argument which follows begins with a concession.

He who is justified has life--both true spiritual life in the present and eternal life in the future. That the Law could not justify had been shown in <a href="/galatians/3-11.htm" title="But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.">Galatians 3:11</a> and in <a href="/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.">Romans 3:20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is the Law then against the promises of God?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>;). "Against" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>), as <a href="/galatians/5-23.htm">Galatians 5:23</a>; <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-30.htm">Matthew 12:30</a>. Since the apostle has already (vers. 15-18) disposed of the notion that the Law may have superseded or essentially qualified the promise, this word "against" can hardly intend adverse action of that kind, but rather imports simply contrariety of spirit or purpose. This objection the apostle meets by stating that the spirit and purpose of the Law were not contrary to the promises, inasmuch as the Law did not offer to interfere with the work which the promises were to do, but was designed, to be auxiliary to their function by preparing the way for its discharge. <span class="cmt_word">God forbid</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). The tone of abhorrence with which the apostle negatives the inference (see note on Galatians 2:17) is due, not so much to its mere unreasonableness, as to the almost blasphemous character which he feels to attach to the notion. To think that one unquestionable revelation of the faithful, unchangeable God can be contrary in spirit or purpose to another equally unquestionable revelation of his! <span class="cmt_word">For if there had been a Law given which could have given life</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>,); <span class="accented">for if a Law had been given such as could make alive.</span> The construction of the article in the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, is similar to that in <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="/romans/2-14.htm">Romans 2:14</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/acts/10-41.htm">Acts 10:41</a>). The noun is first put undetermined, a narrowing determination with the article being then added: "If [in the Law of Moses] had been given a Law such as," etc. By fastening attention upon the Law as unable "to make alive," the apostle marks its character as contrasted with the new covenant, the characteristic function of which is that of imparting a life-giving Spirit. The Law made men feel their sin, their spiritual incapacitation, "the body of death" which enthralled them (<a href="/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>.); but the grace which should instil into their souls the life of love which they lacked, it had not to bestow. So far only reaches the unfavourable estimate of the Law's function given here: it was not "able to make alive." <span class="cmt_word">Verily righteousness should have been by the Law</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>); <span class="accented">in very deed then from the Law would have accrued righteousness.</span> "In very deed then." But as the case now stands, it is a delusion to think it can, as the unbelieving Jews do, and as some of you seem minded to do. <span class="greek">&#x1f4c;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, as <a href="/luke/23-47.htm">Luke 23:47</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-25.htm">1 Corinthians 14:25</a>. If the Law could have quickened men with spiritual life it would have brought them justification. This is what the apostle here affirms. But why so? That in the economy of grace there is no justification without spiritual quickening, nor spiritual life without justification, we are clearly apprised by many passages of St. Paul's own writings, notably by <a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1-10</a>. The explanation, however, is probably this: in the apostle's view, the gift of the indwelling Spirit, to sanctify us and enable us for living a spiritual life, is conditioned by a state of acceptableness with God; until we have been brought into a state of grace, we are not qualified to receive this the supreme proof of Divine love. It is "because we are sons that God sends the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father" (<a href="/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>). If, then, the Law can be supposed capable of imparting the Spirit of life, it must be supposed capable of antecedently imparting righteousness. The "inheritance" of Abraham's seed includes both, both accruing to them from faith. So far was the Law from having these gifts to bestrew, that on the one hand, Moses' ministering of the Law to the people was a ministration of condemnation (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6-9</a>), and on the other, it brought quickening, indeed, but not to the sinner's spirit, but to his sin (<a href="/romans/7-9.htm">Romans 7:9</a>). intensifying its malignity and working death (ibid., vers. 10-13). These views, so explicitly expressed by the apostle in the two nearly contemporaneous Epistles just cited, reveal to us what was in his mind when writing, the words before us, and may be properly adduced to explain them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/3-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Is] the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
