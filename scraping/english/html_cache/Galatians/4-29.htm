Isaac was the child of promise, born to Sarah, while Ishmael was born to Hagar, Sarah's maidservant. This occurred during the patriarchal period, a time when God's covenant with Abraham was being established. The phrase sets the stage for understanding the allegory Paul uses to illustrate the conflict between those who rely on the law and those who live by faith.<p><b>however, the son born by the flesh</b><br>Ishmael is the son born according to the flesh, representing human effort and natural descent. His birth was a result of Abraham and Sarah's attempt to fulfill God's promise through their own means, rather than waiting for God's timing. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the futility of human effort in achieving divine purposes, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/romans/9-8.htm">Romans 9:8</a>, which contrasts children of the flesh with children of the promise.<p><b>persecuted the son born by the Spirit</b><br>Isaac, the son born by the Spirit, symbolizes the fulfillment of God's promise through divine intervention. The persecution mentioned refers to the mocking and hostility Ishmael showed towards Isaac, as recorded in <a href="/genesis/21-9.htm">Genesis 21:9</a>. This conflict is emblematic of the tension between those who live according to the flesh and those who live by the Spirit, a theme Paul explores in <a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-17</a>. It also prefigures the persecution faced by believers who live by faith, as seen throughout the New Testament.<p><b>It is the same now</b><br>Paul draws a parallel between the historical conflict and the present situation in the Galatian church. Just as Ishmael persecuted Isaac, those who adhere to the law (Judaizers) are persecuting those who live by faith in Christ. This reflects the ongoing struggle between legalism and grace, a central theme in Paul's letters. The statement underscores the timeless nature of this conflict, as believers continue to face opposition from those who rely on human effort rather than divine grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, addressing the churches in Galatia to correct doctrinal errors and encourage them in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The child of promise, born to Abraham and Sarah, representing those born according to the Spirit.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/ishmael.htm">Ishmael</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Hagar, representing those born according to the flesh, who persecuted Isaac.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatia.htm">Galatia</a></b><br>A region in Asia Minor where the churches Paul is addressing are located.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hagar_and_sarah.htm">Hagar and Sarah</a></b><br>Hagar, the bondwoman, and Sarah, the free woman, are used allegorically by Paul to represent two covenants.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_persecution.htm">Understanding Persecution</a></b><br>Just as Ishmael persecuted Isaac, those who are born of the flesh will often persecute those born of the Spirit.

It seems doubtful whether the Hebrew can really mean more than "playing." The Jewish traditions added that Ishmael took out the child Isaac and "shot at him with arrows under pretence of sport."

(For the phrase, "after," or "according to, the Spirit," see note on ver. 23.) It must be conceded that the apostle somewhat strains the expression in applying it to the case of Isaac; but he does it for the purpose of exhibiting the manner of his birth as homogeneous with that of his antitypes; for these are they of whom it is the more characteristically true; for they are begotten through the Spirit's agency, into the Spirit's kingdom, to be to the uttermost perfected by the Spirit. The imperfect <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, was persecuting, points to the scene presented to our view in <a href="/genesis/21-9.htm">Genesis 21:9</a>, in the midst of which intervenes the injunction," Cast out," etc.; or possibly the apostle regards what then took place as one among other incidents exhibiting the same animus on the part of Ishmael. We cannot doubt that St. Paul points to the word "mocking," which occurs in the passage referred to. At the feast held in honour of Isaac's being weaned, "Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking." The same Hebrew verb is used of insult and disrespect in <a href="/genesis/39-14.htm">Genesis 39:14</a>, "<span class="accented">He</span> hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock <span class="accented">us</span>;" so again ver. 17. The Septuagint, as we now have it, instead of "mocking," has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "at play with Isaac her son;" which would indicate no unkindness on Ishmael's part, but suggest the idea that Sarah's resentment was simply a movement of jealous feeling, roused by her seeing Ishmael assuming a position of equality with a child of hers. But the apostle disregards this interpretation, if indeed the words, "with Isaac her sons" had already then been interpolated into the passage. As those words are not in the Hebrew, the participles lacking any such explanatory adjunct, would fail of itself to express this idea. It is further rendered improbable by the disparity in age between the two lads; for Isaac, having been just weaned, would be only two or three years old, whilst Ishmael would be sixteen or seventeen. It is much more likely that Ishmael, having arrived at these years, participated in Hagar's feelings of jealousy and disappointment that this child should have come to supersede him in the position which, but for this, he might have held in the family; and that, on the occasion of this "great feast," by which the aged pair were celebrating their pious joy ever this "child of promise" as well as very markedly signalizing his peculiar position as Abraham's heir, the elder-born indulged himself in ill-natured and very possibly profane ridicule of the circumstances under which Isaac was born. Hagar's feelings towards her mistress had of old been those of upstart insubordination (<a href="/genesis/16-4.htm">Genesis 16:4</a>). That both mother and son were very greatly in the wrong is evidenced by the sanction which Heaven accorded to the punishment with which they were visited. The critics (see Wetstein) quote the following passage from the rabbinical treatise, 'Bereshith rabb.,' 53, 15. "Rabbi Asaria said: Ishmael said to Isaac, 'Let us go and see our portion in the field;' and Ishmael took bow and arrows, and shot at Isaac, and pretended that he was in sport." St. Paul's view, therefore, of the import of the Hebrew participle rendered "mocking" is corroborated by the rabbinical interpretation of the word - a consideration which in such a case is of no small weight. The particular word, "persecuted," with which the apostle describes Ishmael's behaviour to his half-brother, was, no doubt, like the expression, "born after the Spirit," suggested by the antitypal case to which he is comparing it. But the features justifying its application to Ishmael viewed as typical were these - spiteful jealousy; disregard of the will of God; antipathy to one chosen of God to be Abraham's seed; abuse of superior power. <span class="cmt_word">Even so it is</span> now (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">even so</span> he <span class="accented">does now.</span> The full sentence represented by this elliptic one is: "even so now does he that is born after the flesh persecute him that is born after the Spirit." This was a fact with which the apostle's experience was but too familiar. In <span class="accented">Asia</span> Minor itself, as the Acts abundantly testifies, from city to city had he been dogged by the animosity of the "children of Hagar." No doubt something of this had been witnessed even in the Galatian towns, of the evangelization of which we have no equally full particulars; there, too, we may believe, St. Paul's converts had had to note the abhorrence with which their master was regarded by the adherents of the old religion; and it was natural that this should have a tendency to lessen his hold upon their minds; for were not the Jews the ancient Israel of God, the depositaries of his revelations? Moreover, the hostility which harassed <span class="accented">him</span> would also alight more or less upon <span class="accented">them</span> as being disciples of his (see Jerusalem that is above; etc. Galatians 6:12, and note). All this might make some of them the more ready to listen to Judaizing suggestions.
