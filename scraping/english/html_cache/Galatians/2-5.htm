The context is the early church's struggle to define the role of the Mosaic Law in the life of Christian believers. Paul&#8217;s refusal to yield underscores the importance of maintaining the purity of the gospel message, which is based on faith in Christ alone, not adherence to the law. This moment of resistance is crucial in the history of the early church, as it sets a precedent for the inclusion of Gentiles without the requirement of following Jewish customs.<p><b>so that the truth of the gospel</b><br>The "truth of the gospel" refers to the core message of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, apart from works of the law. This truth is central to Paul's teaching and is emphasized throughout his letters, particularly in Romans and Ephesians. The gospel's truth is that all people, Jew and Gentile alike, are justified by faith. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who fulfilled the law and the prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>) and offered salvation to all who believe in Him (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<p><b>would remain with you</b><br>Paul's concern is for the Galatian believers, ensuring that they continue in the true gospel without being swayed by false teachings. The phrase indicates the apostle's pastoral care and his desire for the Galatians to remain steadfast in their faith. This echoes Jesus' parable of the sower, where the seed (the word of God) must fall on good soil to produce fruit (<a href="/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13:1-23</a>). Paul&#8217;s efforts to preserve the gospel's truth are also seen in his other letters, where he warns against false teachers and encourages believers to hold fast to the teachings they received (<a href="/2_timothy/1-13.htm">2 Timothy 1:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who wrote the letter to the Galatians, defending the truth of the Gospel and his apostolic authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_brothers.htm">False Brothers</a></b><br>- Individuals who infiltrated the early Christian community to impose Jewish legalistic practices on Gentile believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>- A Greek believer and companion of Paul, who was not compelled to be circumcised, symbolizing the freedom of the Gospel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The city where the early church leaders met to discuss the issue of Gentile believers and the law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatian_churches.htm">Galatian Churches</a></b><br>- The recipients of Paul's letter, who were being influenced by Judaizers to follow Jewish law.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_gospel_purity.htm">The Importance of Gospel Purity</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s refusal to yield to the false brothers underscores the necessity of maintaining the purity of the Gospel message.

These last used advice and persuasion; the false brethren demanded with clamour (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, <a href="/acts/15-5.htm">Acts 15:5</a>). The phrase rendered <span class="accented">for an hour</span> occurs also <a href="/john/5-35.htm">John 5:35</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-8.htm">2 Corinthians 7:8</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-15.htm">Philemon 1:15</a>. There seems to be an underlying allusion to those occasions on which the apostle did, as he says, "to the Jews become as a Jew, to the weak, weak" (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-20.htm">1 Corinthians 9:20, 22</a>); but this he would not do when dealing with false brethren, whose aim was in effect to turn gospel freedom into legal slavery. <span class="accented">We</span>; I, Barnabas, Titus. The words <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> most certainly belong to the original text. Not merely does only one uncial manuscript omit them, but their omission would leave behind a sentence self-convicted of absurdity. For it would run thus: "But because of the false brethren without warrant brought in, a set of men who without warrant came in to spy out our liberty, that they might degrade us into slavery, we yielded for a season with subjection, that the truth of the gospel might lastingly abide with you;" - yielded, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by circumcising Titus; for this is what this reading most probably supposes St. Paul to have done. In this sentence the vituperative description of the false brethren, so extended and so intensely emphatic, instead of being an implied argument in favour of the course of action which the apostle states he adopted, namely, concession to those men, both lacks all motive for its introduction here, and works wholly in favour of the opposite course, of resistance to their wishes. The only suitable and logical description of those for whose sake the concession would have been made would have been that they were brethren meaning well, but weak in the faith, who should, by concession for a season, be won over to more perfect accord with the gospel. (On this reading, see Alford, and the fuller discussion of it in Bishop Lightfoot, pp. 121-123.) <span class="accented">By subjection</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;</span>): <span class="accented">in the way of subjection.</span> As <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span> In the other passages in which it occurs means the habit or spirit of subjection, and never an act of submission (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/9-13.htm">2 Corinthians 9:13</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-11.htm">1 Timothy 2:11</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4</a>), it probably denotes here subjection of spirit to those who were so authoritatively laying upon us their injunctions, he might give way in a point of this kind in a spirit of brotherly concession; but he would bow to no man's imperative injunction. The article before <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;</span> is the article before an abstract noun, as in <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-17.htm">2 Corinthians 1:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That the truth of the gospel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>).

The "truth" is that enunciated in ver. 16, and that it is the very essence of the gospel is declared <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>. The refusal of Church fellowship to a believer of this gospel except he were circumcised, by just inference vitiated and, indeed, nullified the truth that faith in Christ is the sole and sufficient ground of justification. <span class="cmt_word">Might continue with you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>). Might never cease to have its home with you, to be believingly entertained by you. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> is an intensified form of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>. The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is used as in <a href="/galatians/1-18.htm">Galatians 1:18</a>, where see note. It is possible that, as Alford observes, the Galatians may not specially have been in St. Paul's mind at that time, but only the Gentile Churches in general; and that for greater impressiveness he applies to the particular what was only shared by it in the general. It is, however, supposable that the cases of the several Churches which he had then lately founded with Barnabas were much in his thoughts at that time; for, as is shown by his numerous references to his specific intercessory prayer, his spirit was incessantly conversant with "all the Churches" (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-28.htm">2 Corinthians 11:28</a>); and he was anxiously cognizant of efforts made from the very first by legalizing Christians to pervert their faith. It is not certain that <a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a> records the first occasion of his visiting the "Galatic country;" he may have been there and founded "the Churches of Galatia" before the occurrences described in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>; and the opinion is even held by many that Iconium and Derbe, belonging to the Roman province of Galatia, were two of "the Churches of Galatia" (see Introduction, p. 2). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/2-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">We did {not} give in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7988;&#958;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eixamen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1502.htm">Strong's 1502: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give way, yield, submit.
