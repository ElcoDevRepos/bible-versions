Paul is addressing the Galatians to emphasize that faith, not the law, is the basis of righteousness. The "so also" indicates a continuation of thought, linking the faith of the Galatians to that of Abraham, a foundational figure in Jewish history.<p><b>&#8220;Abraham believed God,</b><br>Abraham's belief is a pivotal moment in biblical history, first recorded in <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>. This belief was not merely intellectual assent but a deep trust in God's promises. Abraham's faith is significant because it predates the Mosaic Law, underscoring that righteousness comes through faith, not legal adherence. Abraham's journey from Ur to Canaan, as described in Genesis, demonstrates his trust in God's guidance and promises, despite not having the law to guide him.<p><b>and it was credited to him</b><br>The term "credited" is an accounting term, implying that righteousness was accounted to Abraham's spiritual ledger. This concept of imputation is central to Christian theology, where faith results in righteousness being attributed to the believer. This idea is further explored in <a href="/romans/4.htm">Romans 4</a>, where Paul elaborates on how Abraham's faith was counted as righteousness before circumcision, reinforcing that faith, not works, is the basis of justification.<p><b>as righteousness.&#8221;</b><br>Righteousness here refers to being in right standing with God. In the cultural and historical context of the Old Testament, righteousness was often associated with adherence to the law. However, Abraham's example shows that righteousness is granted through faith. This anticipates the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, whose life, death, and resurrection fulfill the law and provide the ultimate means of righteousness for believers. The prophetic nature of Abraham's faith points to the coming of Christ, who embodies the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham and his descendants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>A key patriarch in the Bible, known for his faith and obedience to God.

From the patriarch to the present, righteousness is granted through faith, not law-keeping.

The gospel has always been a matter of faith, always grounded in God&#8217;s gracious accounting, and always resulting in a right relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/galatians/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6-14) These prolific results are due to faith, and not to the Law; just as it was faith which won for Abraham that imputed righteousness. Faith was the cause, blessing the consequence, which extends to all the spiritual descendants of Abraham. The Scripture distinctly foresaw this when it declared that the heathen too (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> those who believe from among the heathen) should be blessed in Abraham. The effects of the Law are just the opposite of this. Where faith brings a blessing the Law brought a curse. The Law never made any man accepted as righteous. This is a privilege reserved for faith. The Law demands a literal fulfilment, which is impossible. Hence the Law entailed a curse, which Christ has removed by taking it upon Himself. Thus the blessing promised to Abraham, and the outpouring of the Spirit included in it, have been opened out to Gentiles as well as Jews, and indeed to all who give in their adhesion to Christ by faith.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">Even as.</span>--The argument is here very condensed. Ideas lie close together in the Apostle's mind which are some distance apart in ours. He asks whether, in bestowing the gifts of the Spirit upon the Christian Church, God made use of the medium of the Law or of faith. The answer he assumes to be faith; and his thoughts fly at once to that crucial instance of faith--the faith of Abraham.<p><span class= "bld">Abraham believed God . . .</span>--Quoted from the LXX. version of <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm" title="And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.">Genesis 15:6</a>.

This, he now adds, was in exact conformity with what was recorded of Abraham; as soon as Abraham heard the promise made to him, "So shall thy seed be," he believed it, and by the hearing of faith was justified. The mutual correspondence of the two cases lay in this, that in imparting to those believers the Holy Spirit, God showed that they were in his favour, were justified people, simply because of their faith; even as Abraham was shown to be in his favour, having likewise by faith been justified. The apostle weaves into his sentence the very words of <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>, as they appear in the Septuagint, with scarcely any modification; the Septuagint reading thus: <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>. But in doing so he both himself feels, and will have his readers feel, that they are words of <span class="accented">Scripture</span> from which, as such, reliable conclusions might be drawn, as is shown by the next verse. In the Hebrew, however, the passage runs as in our Authorized Version, "He believed in the Lord, and he accounted it to him for righteousness." The words are quoted with substantially the like agreement with the Septuagint and divergence from the Hebrew also in <a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>, and by St. James in his Epistle (<a href="/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>) (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;</span>, etc.). "It was reckoned;" in the Hebrew, "he reckoned it;" "it," that is, his believing: God regarded it as imparting to him perfect acceptableness, his sins no longer disqualifying him for being an object of the Divine favour. It is of the greatest importance to take note what the kind of faith was which God reckoned to him for righteousness. It was not simply a persuasion that what God says must be true. As Calvin remarks, Cain might have a hundred times exercised faith in what God had said to him, without thereby receiving righteousness from God. The reason why Abraham was justified by believing was this: a promise had been given him by God of his fatherly goodness towards him; and this word of God's he embraced as certainty. The faith, therefore, which the apostle is thinking of is the faith which has respect to some word of God which is of such a sort that reliance upon it will enable a man to repose in God's love to him for time and for eternity. The reference to Abraham's case which St. Paul makes in such very brief terms he expands in the fourth chapter of his Epistle to the Romans to a considerable length, ending with these words: "Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was reckoned to him [for righteousness]; but for our sake also, unto whom it shall be reckoned, who believe on him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, who was delivered up for our offences, and was raised for our justification." Christ's death and resurrection are God's word and guarantee to the whole human race, assuring us of his forgiveness and of his offer to us of eternal life. If we hear this word with faith, committing ourselves to his love, God on that ground at once justifies also us. It is evident that, in the apostle's view, the word "righteousness," as used in the recited passage of Genesis, does not mean "a righteous act," - that is, that Abraham's believing God's promise was viewed by Heaven with approval; but complete acceptableness investing Abraham himself. In consideration of that exercise of faith God accounted him a righteous man. The Greek phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "was reckoned for righteousness," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> reckoned as being righteousness, is similar to <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>, "reckoned as nought" (<a href="/acts/19-27.htm">Acts 19:27</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "reckoned for circumcision" (<a href="/romans/2-26.htm">Romans 2:26</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, "reckoned for a seed" (<a href="/romans/9-8.htm">Romans 9:8</a>). Are we to lifter from these two verses, 5 and 6, that in the apostle's view all who received spiritual gifts were thereby proved to be, or to have been, justified persons and in enjoyment of the Divine favour? We can hardly think this. The phenomena disclosed to us in the two Epistles addressed to the Corinthians. as to the moral and spiritual behaviour of some at least of their body, tend to show that individuals possessed of charisms were found in some instances to make a very vainglorious use of them, and needed to be reminded that the thaumaturgic gifts were of a fleeting character and of incomparably less value than qualities of moral goodness. Certainly Christ himself has told us that "many" will at the last be found to have been possessed of such miraculous gifts, whom nevertheless he "never knew." One of the very apostles was a Judas. Perhaps the solution is this: companies of men were dealt with in the diffusion of these gifts according as they were characterized, viewed each as a whole, though there might be individuals in each company imperfectly, very superficially, some perhaps not at all, animated by the sentiment generally prevailing in the body. If a community as a whole was pervaded extensively by a spirit of frank acceptance of the gospel doctrine and of pious devotion, its members brought by baptism into the "body which is Christ," the Holy Spirit made such a community his habitation (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16, 17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>), and diffused his gifts among its members diversely and to all appearance Indiscriminately (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>); at all events not in such wise discriminately as that degrees of personal holiness and acceptableness before God could at all be estimated as standing in proportion to the outward brilliancy of thaumaturgie gifts severally possessed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/3-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So also,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#952;&#8060;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Kath&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2531.htm">Strong's 2531: </a> </span><span class="str2">According to the manner in which, in the degree that, just as, as.
