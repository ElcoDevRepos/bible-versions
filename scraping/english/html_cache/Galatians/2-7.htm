In the context of <a href="/galatians/2.htm">Galatians 2</a>, Paul is addressing the issue of whether Gentile converts need to follow Jewish law. The "contrary" suggests a shift from the expectation that all apostles should preach the same message to the same audience. This highlights the diversity of early Christian mission work and the recognition of different roles within the Church.<p><b>they saw that I had been entrusted</b><br>The use of "entrusted" implies a divine commission or responsibility given to Paul. This reflects the early Church's understanding of apostolic authority as being divinely appointed. Paul's calling is affirmed by the leaders in Jerusalem, showing unity in the Church's mission despite different audiences.<p><b>to preach the gospel to the uncircumcised</b><br>The "uncircumcised" refers to Gentiles, who were not part of the Jewish covenant community. This mission to the Gentiles was a significant development in the early Church, breaking traditional Jewish boundaries. It fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the inclusion of the Gentiles (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>) and aligns with Jesus' Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>just as Peter had been to the circumcised</b><br>Peter's mission to the "circumcised" refers to his primary focus on Jewish audiences. This division of labor among apostles shows the strategic approach of the early Church in spreading the gospel. Peter's role is consistent with his actions in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, where he preaches to Jews at Pentecost. This also reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' words in <a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18-19</a>, where Peter is given a foundational role in the Church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle to the Gentiles, who is defending his ministry and apostleship in the letter to the Galatians.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter (Cephas)</a></b><br>One of the original apostles, primarily ministering to the Jews, also known as the circumcised.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_uncircumcised.htm">The Uncircumcised</a></b><br>Refers to the Gentiles, non-Jewish people, to whom Paul was called to preach the gospel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_circumcised.htm">The Circumcised</a></b><br>Refers to the Jewish people, to whom Peter was primarily ministering.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem_council.htm">Jerusalem Council</a></b><br>The event where the apostles and elders met to discuss the inclusion of Gentiles in the church, affirming Paul's ministry to the Gentiles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/distinct_callings_in_ministry.htm">Distinct Callings in Ministry</a></b><br>God calls different people to different ministries.

Nevertheless, in the main, Peter was the head of the Church of the circumcised, Paul of that of the uncircumcised. But how completely the substance of Peter's doctrine was one with that of Paul's is strikingly evinced by his two Epistles (see <a href="/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>). It is difficult to feel that St. Paul could have written as he here does, if he was aware that St. Peter had been constituted by the Lord Jesus to be his own vicar upon earth, supreme over the whole Church and all its ministers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/2-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">On the contrary,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8016;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(tounantion)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Comparative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5121.htm">Strong's 5121: </a> </span><span class="str2">On the contrary, on the other hand.
