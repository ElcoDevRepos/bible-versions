The term "foolish" suggests a failure to understand or apply spiritual truths. In the biblical context, wisdom is often associated with the fear of the Lord and understanding His ways (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The Galatians' foolishness is in their departure from the gospel of grace that Paul had preached to them. This echoes the Old Testament prophets who often called Israel foolish for turning away from God (<a href="/jeremiah/4-22.htm">Jeremiah 4:22</a>).<p><b>Who has bewitched you?</b><br>The use of "bewitched" implies a form of spiritual deception or manipulation. In the ancient world, magic and sorcery were common, and the term suggests that the Galatians have been led astray by false teachings, possibly by Judaizers who insisted on adherence to the Mosaic Law for salvation. This reflects the spiritual battle against false doctrines that Paul addresses in other letters, such as in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3-4</a>, where he warns against being led astray from the simplicity in Christ.<p><b>Before your very eyes</b><br>Paul emphasizes that the Galatians had a clear understanding of the gospel message. The phrase suggests that they had been given a vivid and unmistakable presentation of the truth. This could refer to Paul's own preaching and teaching among them, which was done with clarity and power, as seen in <a href="/acts/13.htm">Acts 13-14</a> during his missionary journeys.<p><b>Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.</b><br>The crucifixion of Jesus is central to the gospel message, representing the atoning sacrifice for sin. Paul stresses that this was clearly communicated to the Galatians, leaving them without excuse for turning to another gospel. The crucifixion fulfills Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant. It also connects to the typology of the Passover lamb, as Jesus is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The portrayal of Christ crucified is a reminder of the sufficiency of His sacrifice, contrasting with the insufficiency of the law for salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatians.htm">Galatians</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, the Galatians were a group of churches in the region of Galatia, which is in modern-day Turkey.

It is not as if you were ignorant of better things. The crucified Saviour, the one great object of faith, has been preached before you in a way too plain to be mistaken. It has been written, as it were, in large characters before your eyes. It could only be some kind of evil enchantment or fascination that has prevented you from looking upon it. You have given up Christ and gone back to the Law. Yet, let me ask you--and surely no other proof is needed--all this outpouring of spiritual gifts that you have enjoyed since you became Christian, to what do you owe it? Is that due to the Law and works, or is it due to Christ and faith in Him? The one system is spiritual, the other is carnal and material. Will you begin with what is high and descend to what is low? Will you by such a declension practically admit that all the persecutions that you underwent were undergone in a mistaken cause? (I can hardly believe it.) At this present moment the gift of spiritual grace and miraculous power still in some measure continues, and where it is seen, is it not in clear connection--not with legal observances--but with faith in Christ?<p>In the last section of the last chapter the Apostle had been gradually working away from the historical retrospect with which he had begun to the doctrinal polemic in which he is about to engage, and now he addresses the Galatians with impassioned directness and earnestness, upbraiding them with their shameful apostasy.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Foolish.</span>--The same word as that which is used in <a href="/luke/24-25.htm" title="Then he said to them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:">Luke 24:25</a>, "O ye fools and slow of heart," and in <a href="/romans/1-14.htm" title="I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.">Romans 1:14</a>, "wise and foolish," <a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm" title="But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.">1Timothy 6:9</a>, and <a href="/titus/3-3.htm" title="For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.">Titus 3:3</a>, but not the same as that which is used in <a href="/matthew/7-26.htm" title="And every one that hears these sayings of mine, and does them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, which built his house on the sand:">Matthew 7:26</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-17.htm" title="You fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?">Matthew 23:17</a>; <a href="/luke/11-40.htm" title="You fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?">Luke 11:40</a>; <a href="/romans/1-22.htm" title="Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,">Romans 1:22</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-20.htm" title="Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?">1Corinthians 1:20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honorable, but we are despised.">1Corinthians 4:10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-19.htm" title="For you suffer fools gladly, seeing you yourselves are wise.">2Corinthians 11:19</a>, &c. The combination, "fools and slow of heart," helps to bring out its meaning. "Slow of heart" refers to deadness of the moral affections; "fools" and "foolish" to the absence or undisciplined condition of the reasoning faculty. The Gauls of Galatia were a people intellectually shallow and frivolous. A little reason and reflection would have kept them from so gross an inconsistency. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O foolish Galatians</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>).

The transporting feeling of elevation and joy with which, in <a href="/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19-21</a>, the apostle describes himself as crucified with Christ to the Law, and as living in Christ and through Christ, makes him the more keenly sensible of the senseless folly shown by the Galatians in taking up the observance of the Law. <span class="cmt_word">Who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truths?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>; [Receptus adds, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>]); <span class="accented">who in his envy did bewitch you</span>?

In common Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;</span>, to treat one with malignant words, means either to slander, belie, blacken character, or to cast upon him primarily words conveying baleful spells, and then, in later usage very frequently, baleful spells of any kind, and more especially spells from the "evil eye" (Aristotle, Plutarch); in the language of old English superstition, "forelook" or "overlook." Indeed, so closely did this last notion cling to the verb, as to have suggested to Greek grammarians for its etymology, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "to kill with the eyes." The more scientific etymologists of recent days derive it from <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1ffd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span>, speak; as if it were "to bespeak a man." The nouns <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, following the senses of the verb, express the ideas, either of envious detraction or of sorcery (see Schneider; Passow; Liddell and Scott). In the New Testament the word occurs only here. In the Septuagint we meet with it in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-54.htm">Deuteronomy 28:54</a>, where, for the words, "His eye shall be evil towards his brother," we have <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, meaning apparently, "He shall grudge with his eye his brother;" and so again in ver. 56, the same phrase is used analogously of the tender woman, "She shall grudge with her eye her husband;" Ecclus. 14:6, "There is not a worse man (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>) than he that grudges his own self;" ibid. ver. 8, "Evil is (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;</span>) he that grudgeth with his eye. In Scripture, both in the Old Testament and the New, and in the Apocrypha, the phrases, "the eye being evil," "the evil eye," following the Hebrew, always denote envy, ill nature, stinginess (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-9.htm">Deuteronomy 15:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-54.htm">Deuteronomy 28:54, 56</a>; <a href="/proverbs/23-6.htm">Proverbs 23:6</a> [comp. <a href="/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9</a>, "a bountiful eye"]; <a href="/matthew/20-15.htm">Matthew 20:15</a>; <a href="/mark/7-22.htm">Mark 7:22</a>). Nowhere either in the Scriptures or in the Apocrypha is there any reference to "forelooking," unless perchance the <span class="accented">me'onen</span>, <a href="/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10</a> (Authorized Version, "observer of times"), is etymologically connected with the Hebrew word for "eye," which, however, few critics suppose. Ignatius, 'Ad Romans', 3, has <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "never grudged any man." This Septuagintal use of the verb presents, as the reader will observe, a somewhat different shade of meaning to any of those cited above from the lexicons. Following, however, its guidance, we may understand the apostle as here asking, "Whoso ill-natured jealousy was it that did light upon you?" and as intending to convey these two ideas: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the envy of their once happy state which actuated the agent referred to; and, <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by <span class="accented">implication</span>, the baleful effect wrought by the envier upon them. The aorist of the verb seems to point to a decisive result. He had, it is hinted, succeeded in his wish; he had robbed them of the blessedness which had excited his jealousy. In respect to the former idea, elsewhere (<a href="/galatians/4-17.htm">Galatians 4:17</a>, "They would fain shut you out") the apostle ascribes the action of their misleaders to sinister designs against their well-being. It is, indeed, this thought that inspires the extreme severity of his language above in <a href="/galatians/2-4.htm">Galatians 2:4</a>; the <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, of whom he here speaks, belonged to, or derived from, <span class="accented">them.</span> In short, the pathetic question here before us breathes the like indignation and vexation as that in <a href="/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>, "Ye were running on well: who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?" - the last words of which passage, though not admissible here in the text, would, however, if there, form a perfectly correct explanatory clause. The more distinctly to mark the effect actually produced by the envier, very many commentators have enwoven into their interpretation of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, besides its Septuagiutal sense, its other sense of blasting with some kind of charm: "The malignity," Chrysostom writes, "of a demon whose spirit [or, 'breath'] had blasted their prosperous estate." Great use has been made, in particular, by many, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Jerome and, according to Estius, by Thomas Aquinas, of the superstition of the "evil eye," which, in the countries bordering on the Mediterranean, has in all ages been so rife. Bishop Lightfoot, in his interesting note on the passage, offers the following paraphrase: "Christ's death in vain? O ye senseless Gauls, what bewitchment is this? I placarded Christ crucified before your eyes. Ye suffered them to wander from this gracious proclamation of your King. They rested on the withering eye of the sorcerer. They yielded to the fascination and were riveted there. And the life of your souls has been drained out of you by that envious gaze." It may, however, be questioned whether the apostle would have recognized his own thought in this thorough-going application of the superstition of the "evil eye." It is doubtful whether he used the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> with reference to any species of sorcery at all; but if he did, he may have intended no more than this: "What envious ill-wisher has by some strange, inexplicable sorcery so wrought upon you? Or, how can I explain your behaviour, except that you have been acting under some binding spell? Surely such folly is well-nigh inconceivable with men in free possession of their own souls." But <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> each of these two renderings of the passage is open to the objection that St. Paul, in writing <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, either might have intended to express by the word "envious grudging," according to its Sep-tuagintal use, or he might have meant some kind of sorcery according to a common acceptation of the term, but could hardly have meant to convey both senses together.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/3-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">O</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8046;</span> <span class="translit">(&#332;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5599.htm">Strong's 5599: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary interjection; as a sign of the vocative case, O; as a note of exclamation, oh.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">foolish</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#957;&#972;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(ano&#275;toi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Vocative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_453.htm">Strong's 453: </a> </span><span class="str2">Foolish, thoughtless.
