In the biblical context, "knowing God" implies a personal and relational knowledge, not just intellectual awareness. The Galatians, primarily Gentiles, were previously unaware of the one true God, Yahweh, as revealed in the Hebrew Scriptures. This ignorance is contrasted with the intimate relationship believers are called to have with God through Jesus Christ. The concept of knowing God is central to the biblical narrative, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/9-24.htm">Jeremiah 9:24</a>, where God desires that people understand and know Him.<p><b>you were slaves</b><br>The term "slaves" here is metaphorical, indicating bondage or servitude to spiritual forces or systems. In the Greco-Roman world, slavery was a common institution, and the imagery would have been powerful for the Galatian audience. Spiritually, this slavery refers to the bondage of sin and idolatry. <a href="/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16-18</a> discusses how people are slaves to whatever they obey, whether sin leading to death or obedience leading to righteousness. The use of "slaves" underscores the lack of freedom and autonomy experienced by those outside of Christ.<p><b>to those who by nature are not gods</b><br>This phrase highlights the idolatrous practices of the Galatians before their conversion. The "gods" mentioned are likely the pagan deities worshiped in the region, which were prevalent in the Greco-Roman world. These deities, such as Zeus and Hermes, were part of a pantheon that demanded worship and offerings. However, Paul emphasizes that these entities are not gods by nature, echoing the Old Testament's denunciation of idols, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, where idols are described as man-made and powerless. This distinction is crucial, as it sets the stage for understanding the supremacy of the one true God and the futility of idol worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatians.htm">Galatians</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, the Galatians were a group of churches in the region of Galatia, which is in modern-day Turkey.

In their old heathen state they had been in bondage to gods that were no gods. From this bondage they had been delivered. They had been raised to a true knowledge of God, and received a Father's recognition from Him. How then could they possibly think of returning to a system of mere ceremonialism. All this painful observance of times and seasons could only make the Apostle think that his labours on their behalf had been thrown away.<p>(8) <span class= "bld">Them which by nature are no gods.</span>--The gods of the heathen are called by St. Paul "devils." (See <a href="/1_corinthians/10-20.htm" title="But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.">1Corinthians 10:20</a> : "The things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils, and not to God.")<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span>); a strongly adversative conjunction, belonging to the whole sentence comprised in this and the next verse, which are closely welded together by the particles <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>. In contravention of God's work of grace just described, they were renouncing their sonship and making themselves slaves afresh. Then (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>). The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>, with its balancing <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>, here, as often is the case, unites together sentences not in their main substance strictly adverse to each other, but only in subordinate details contrasted, of which we have an exemplary instance in <a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. In such cases we have often no resource in English but to leave the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> untranslated, as our Authorized Version commonly does; "indeed" or "truly," for example, would be more or less misleading. The truth is, the apostle in these two verses is heaping reproach upon the Galatian Judaizers; first, in this verse, for their former (guilty) ignorance of God and their idolatries, and then, in the next verse, for their slighting that blessed friendship with God which they owed only to his preventing grace. In dealing with Gentile Christians the apostle repeatedly is found referring to their former heathenism, for the purpose of enforcing humility or abashing presumption, as for example in <a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-25</a>; <a href="/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8, 9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-2.htm">1 Corinthians 12:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-13, 17</a>. In the case of the Galatians his indignation prompts him to use a degree of outspoken severity which he was generally disposed to forbear employing. The "then" is not defined, as English readers might perhaps misconstrue the Authorized Version as intending, by the following clause, "not knowing God," which in that version is "when ye knew not God" - a construction of the words which the use of the participle would hardly warrant; rather the time referred to by the adverb is the time of which he has before been speaking, when God's people were under the pedagogy of the Law. This, though when compared with Christ's liberty a state of bondage, was, however (the apostle feels), a position of high advancement as compared with that of heathen idolaters. These last were "<span class="accented">far</span> off," while the Israelites were "<span class="accented">nigh"</span> (compare the <span class="accented">passages</span> just now referred to). During that time of legal pedagogy the Galatians and their forefathers, all in the apostle's view forming one class, were wallowing in the mire of heathenism. <span class="cmt_word">When ye knew not</span> <span class="cmt_word">God</span> (<span class="greek_word">ou)k ei)do/te Qeo/n</span>); <span class="accented">ye knew not God and</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> "Knowing not God" describes the condition of heathens also in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:5</a>," Not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles which know not (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) God;" <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8</a>, "Rendering vengeance to them that know not (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) God." Both of these passages favour the view that the apostle does not in the least intend in the present clause to <span class="accented">excuse</span> the idolatries which he goes on to speak of, but rather to describe a condition of godlessness which, as being positive rather than merely negative, inferred utter pravity and guiltiness. He uses <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> with the participle here, in place of the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> in the two <span class="accented">passages c</span>ited from the <span class="accented">Thessalonians</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> intending to state an historical fact viewed absolutely - a sense which is made clear in English by substituting an indicative verb for the participle. <span class="cmt_word">Ye did service unto</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">served</span>; devoted yourselves to. The verb is, perhaps, used here in that milder sense in which it frequently occurs; as in <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>; <a href="/luke/15-29.htm">Luke 15:29</a>; <a href="/luke/16-13.htm">Luke 16:13</a>; <a href="/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6, 25</a>; <a href="/romans/14-18.htm">Romans 14:18</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>. The Revised Version, however, gives "were in bondage to" in the present instance, but "serve" in the <span class="accented">passages now</span> cited. The aorist, instead of an imperfect, describes the form of religious life which they then led as a whole. <span class="cmt_word">Them which by nature are</span> <span class="cmt_word">no gods</span> (<span class="greek_word">toi = fu/sei mh\ ou = si</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). The Textus Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, which would apparently mean "which arc not gods by nature, but only in your imagination;" like "There be that are called gods," in <a href="/1_corinthians/8-5.htm">1 Corinthians 8:5</a> - Zeus, Apollo, Here, etc., mere figments of imagination (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>). The more approved reading suggests rather the idea that the objects they worshipped might not be non-existent, but were certainly not of a Divine nature; "by nature," that is, in the kind of being to which they belong (<a href="/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a>; Wisd. 13:1, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The question may be asked - If they were not gods, what then were they? The apostle would probably have answered, "Demons;" for thus he writes to the Corinthians (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>): "The things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), and not to God." Alford renders, "to gods which by nature exist not," etc.; but the more obvious sense of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is that of a copula merely (comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/13-9.htm">2 Chronicles 13:9</a>, Septuagint, "He became a priest (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>)"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/4-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Formerly,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
