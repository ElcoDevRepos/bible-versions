Knowing God implies an intimate, personal relationship rather than mere intellectual acknowledgment. In the biblical context, this knowledge is akin to the covenant relationship God established with Israel (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>). It signifies a shift from the old covenant, based on the law, to the new covenant, based on grace through faith in Jesus Christ (<a href="/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10-12</a>).<p><b>or rather are known by God</b><br>This correction emphasizes God's initiative in the relationship. It reflects the biblical theme of divine election and grace, where God chooses and knows His people (<a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14-15</a>, <a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>). This knowledge is not just awareness but a deep, loving relationship, as seen in the Hebrew concept of "yada" (to know), which implies intimacy and care (<a href="/genesis/18-19.htm">Genesis 18:19</a>).<p><b>how is it that you are turning back to those weak and worthless principles?</b><br>Paul is addressing the Galatians' temptation to revert to the Jewish law and rituals, which he describes as "weak and worthless." These principles refer to the elementary spiritual forces or basic principles of the world (<a href="/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a>). Historically, this reflects the Judaizers' influence, who insisted on adherence to the Mosaic Law for salvation. Paul argues that these principles are powerless to save and enslave rather than liberate (<a href="/colossians/2-20.htm">Colossians 2:20-23</a>).<p><b>Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the folly of returning to legalism after experiencing the freedom of the gospel. The imagery of slavery contrasts with the freedom believers have in Christ (<a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>). Historically, the Galatians were Gentiles who had been enslaved by pagan practices before knowing Christ. Paul warns against exchanging one form of bondage for another, highlighting the sufficiency of Christ's redemptive work (<a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, addressing the churches in Galatia.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatians.htm">Galatians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a group of early Christians in the region of Galatia who were being influenced by Judaizers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judaizers.htm">Judaizers</a></b><br>A group of individuals advocating for adherence to Jewish laws and customs, including circumcision, for salvation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in the verse, emphasizing the relationship between God and believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/principles.htm">Principles (Stoicheia)</a></b><br>Refers to the basic elements or principles of the world, often interpreted as the Jewish law or pagan practices.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_identity_in_christ.htm">Understanding Our Identity in Christ</a></b><br>As believers, we are known by God, which signifies a deep, personal relationship.

The former, however, is the verb more commonly used in this relation; by St. John, in his First Epistle, where so much is said of knowing God, exclusively; although in other relations he, both in Epistle and Gospel, uses the two verbs interchangeably. The expression, "to know God," is one of profound pregnancy; denoting nothing less than that divinely imparted intuition of God, that consciousness of his actual being, viewed in his relation to ourselves, which is the result of truly "believing in him." Moreover, as it is knowing a personal Being, between whom and ourselves mutual Action may be looked for, it implies a mutual conversancy between ourselves and him, as the term "acquaintance" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), as used in <a href="/luke/2-44.htm">Luke 2:44</a> and 23. 49, naturally does. So that "having gotten to be known of God" is very nearly equivalent to having been by God brought to be, to speak it reverently, on terms of acquaintanceship with him; and this does indeed seem to be meant in <a href="/1_corinthians/8-3.htm">1 Corinthians 8:3</a>. The Galatian believers had in very truth gotten to know God, if they had learnt to cry out unto him, "Abba, Father." And the remembrance of this happy experience of theirs, which he had, we may suppose, himself witnessed in the early days of their discipleship, prompts him to introduce the correction, "or rather to be known of God." Their having attained such a consciousness of sonship had been, as he writes, ver. 7, "through God;" he it was that had sent forth his Sen that his people might receive the adoption of sons; he that had sent forth his Spirit into their hearts to give them the sense of sonship; he had shown that he knew, recognized them to be his (<a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>), by gifting them with the blissful prerogative of knowing what he was to them. The correction of "knowing" by "being known" is analogous to that of "apprehend" by "being apprehended" in <a href="/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12</a>. The pragmatic value of this correcting clause is to make the Galatians feel, not only what a wilful self-debasement it was on their part, but also what a slight put upon the Divine favours shown to them, that they should frowardly repudiate their filial standing to adopt afresh that servile standing out of which he had lifted his people. What was this but a high-handed contravening of God's own work, a frustration of his gospel? And this by them whom only the other day he had rescued from the misery and utter wickedness of idolatry! <span class="cmt_word">How turn ye again</span>; or, back (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">how turn ye back again.</span> An abrupt change from the form of sentence which the foregoing words naturally prepared us for; which might have been such as we should have by simply omitting the "how." As if it were, "After having gotten to be known of God, ye are turning back again - how can ye? - to the weak," etc. This "how," as in <a href="/galatians/2-14.htm">Galatians 2:14</a>, is simply a question of remonstrance; not expecting an answer, it bids the person addressed consider the amazing unseemliness of his proceeding (so <a href="/matthew/22-12.htm">Matthew 22:12</a>; comp. also <a href="/1_timothy/3-5.htm">1 Timothy 3:5</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17</a>).

The description is relative rather than absolute. The horn-book, useful enough for the mere child, is of no use whatever to the grown-up lad who has left school. In <a href="/hebrews/7-18.htm">Hebrews 7:18</a> mention is made of "the weakness and unprofitableness" of the Levitical Law relative to the expiation of sin; which is not precisely the aspect of the Law which is here under view. The word "beggarly" was probably in the writer's mind contrasted with "the unsearchable riches of Christ" (<a href="/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage!</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>;); <span class="accented">whereunto ye desire to be in bondage over again</span>? The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is here, differently from ver. 8, contrasted with the condition of a son enjoying his full independence (see ver. 25 and <a href="/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>). It would be an insufferable constraint and degradation to the full-grown son to be set to con over and repeat the lessons of the infant school. <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, afresh, over again, intensifies <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> by adding the notion of making a fresh start from the commencing-point of the course indicated. The application of these words, together especially with the phrase, "turn back again," in the preceding clause, to the case of the Galatian converts from idolatrous heathenism, has suggested to many minds the idea that St. Paul groups the ceremonialism of heathen worship with that of the Mosaic Law. Bishop Lightfoot in particular has here a valuable note, in which, with his usual learning and breadth of view, he shows how the former might in <span class="accented">its ritualistic element</span> have subserved the purpose of a disciplinary training for a better religion. Such a view might be regarded as not altogether out of harmony with the apostle's spirit as evinced in his discourses to the Lyeaonians and the Athenians (<a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/acts/14-15.htm">Acts 14:15-17</a>; <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/acts/17-22.htm">Acts 17:22-31</a>). But though in his wide sympatheticalness he might, if discoursing with heathens, have sought thus to win them to a better faith, he is hardly just now in a mood for any such sympathetic tolerance. He is much too indignant at the behaviour of these Galatian revolters to allow that <span class="accented">their</span> former religious ceremonies could have been good enough to be admitted to group with those of the Law of Moses: he has just before adverted to their former heathenism for the very purpose of (so to speak) setting them down - a purpose which would be a good deal defeated by his referring to that cult of theirs as in any respect standing on a level with the cult of the Hebrews. Indeed, it may be doubted whether, at the utmost limit to which he would at any time have allowed himself to go, in the "economy" which he unquestionably was used to employ in dealing with souls, he would, however, have gone so far as to class the divinely appointed ordinances of Israel, the training-school of God's own children, with the ritual of demon-inspired worships. It is much easier to suppose that the apostle identifies the Galatian Churchmen with God's own people, with whom they were now in fact <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, blended in corporal identity with them. God's children had heretofore been in bondage to the A, B, C, of the Law, but were so no longer; if any of those who were now God's children took it in hand to observe that Law, then were they, though not in their individual identity, yet in their corporate identity, turning <span class="accented">back again</span> to the A, B, C, from which they had been emancipated. The former experience of Israel was <span class="accented">their</span> experience, as the "fathers" of Israel were their fathers (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1</a>); which experience they were now setting themselves to renew. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/4-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">now that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#957;&#8166;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(nyn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3568.htm">Strong's 3568: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle of present time; 'now'; also as noun or adjective present or immediate.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you know</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#957;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(gnontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1097.htm">Strong's 1097: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary verb; to 'know' in a great variety of applications and with many implications.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">God,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#920;&#949;&#972;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Theon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2316.htm">Strong's 2316: </a> </span><span class="str2">A deity, especially the supreme Divinity; figuratively, a magistrate; by Hebraism, very.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">or rather</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#8118;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(mallon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3123.htm">Strong's 3123: </a> </span><span class="str2">More, rather.
