In the context of Galatians, Paul is addressing the issue of legalism and the tendency to compare oneself to others. The Greek word for "test" (&#948;&#959;&#954;&#953;&#956;&#940;&#950;&#969;) implies a careful examination or proving of one's actions. This aligns with <a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>, where believers are encouraged to examine themselves to see if they are in the faith. The cultural context of the early church involved communal living and shared responsibilities, but Paul stresses individual accountability before God. This testing is not for self-righteousness but to ensure one's actions align with God's will.<p><b>Then he will have reason to boast in himself alone,</b><br>Boasting in oneself is not about pride but about having confidence in one's own faithfulness and obedience to God. In the broader biblical narrative, boasting is often condemned when it is self-centered or dismissive of God's role (e.g., <a href="/james/4-16.htm">James 4:16</a>). However, Paul here suggests a form of boasting that is rooted in personal integrity and the fulfillment of one's God-given responsibilities. This is reminiscent of <a href="/1_corinthians/1-31.htm">1 Corinthians 1:31</a>, where boasting is only appropriate in the Lord. The historical context of the Galatian church involved Judaizers who boasted in external adherence to the law, but Paul redirects this to internal, genuine faith.<p><b>and not in someone else.</b><br>This phrase warns against the danger of comparing oneself to others, which can lead to either pride or discouragement. In the early church, there was a temptation to measure one's spiritual status by the actions or failures of others, particularly in the context of Jewish and Gentile believers. Paul encourages believers to focus on their own walk with God, as seen in <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>, where each person will give an account of themselves to God. This individual focus does not negate community but ensures that one's faith is personal and authentic, not reliant on the spiritual state of others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, addressing the churches in the region of Galatia.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatian_churches.htm">Galatian Churches</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, consisting of early Christian communities in the region of Galatia.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judaizers.htm">Judaizers</a></b><br>A group influencing the Galatian churches, advocating for adherence to Jewish law alongside Christian faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/christian_believers.htm">Christian Believers</a></b><br>The general audience of the letter, encouraged to live by the Spirit and not by the flesh.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law, which is a central theme in the letter as Paul contrasts it with living by faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_accountability.htm">Personal Accountability</a></b><br>Each believer is responsible for their own spiritual growth and actions.

Let a man judge his own work, not by comparison with others, but by the ideal standard, then he will see what it is worth and how much he has to boast of. His boasting will be at least real, and not based upon any delusive comparisons. He must stand or fall by himself. He must bear the weight of his own virtues and his own sins. By them he will be judged, and not by any fancied superiority or inferiority to others. For the thought, compare <a href="/context/2_corinthians/10-12.htm" title="For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.">2Corinthians 10:12-14</a>.<p>(4) <span class= "bld">Prove.</span>--<span class= "ital">Test,</span> or <span class= "ital">examine,</span> by reference to an objective standard.

In <a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, the substantive seems to mean "boast," that is, what is said in boasting, as distinguished from <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the action of uttering a beast. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, with its derivatives - a favourite term with St. Paul - often appears to mean "rejoicing" rather than" boasting" (cf. <a href="/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>); but it seems desirable as a rule to render it by "glorying," with the understanding that the writer has frequently the joyous state of feeling more prominently in his view than the utterance of self-gratulation. What the apostle meant by "having one's ground of glorying in regard to one's own self alone," is well illustrated by what he says respecting himself in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>, "Our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward." he had been himself in the habit of testing his conduct and spirit by the standard of Christ's law; and this was the fruit. <span class="cmt_word">And not in another</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">and not in regard to that neighbour of his.</span> The article probably points to that neighbour with whom he has been comparing himself; and so, perhaps, also in <a href="/romans/2-1.htm">Romans 2:1</a>. But it may be simply "his neighbour;" "the man who is other than himself;" as it is in <a href="/1_corinthians/6-1.htm">1 Corinthians 6:1</a> and 1 Cor 10:24, in neither of which passages has any particular "other person" been before referred to. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/6-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Each one</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7957;&#954;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hekastos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1538.htm">Strong's 1538: </a> </span><span class="str2">Each (of more than two), every one.
