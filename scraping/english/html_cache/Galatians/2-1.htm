The fourteen years likely refer to the time after his conversion, emphasizing the long duration of his independent ministry. This time frame highlights Paul's development and the establishment of his apostolic authority, independent of the original apostles.<p><b>I went up again to Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem was the center of early Christianity and the location of the original apostles. Paul's return to Jerusalem signifies a pivotal moment in his ministry, possibly related to the Jerusalem Council described in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, where issues of Gentile conversion and adherence to Jewish law were addressed. This visit underscores the importance of unity and doctrinal clarity within the early Church.<p><b>accompanied by Barnabas</b><br>Barnabas, a respected leader in the early Church, was known for his role in encouraging and supporting Paul (<a href="/acts/9-27.htm">Acts 9:27</a>). His presence with Paul in Jerusalem adds credibility to Paul's mission and message. Barnabas was a bridge between Jewish and Gentile believers, reflecting the inclusive nature of the Gospel.<p><b>I took Titus along also</b><br>Titus, a Greek and uncircumcised believer, represents the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith without the need for adherence to Jewish ceremonial law. His presence at this meeting in Jerusalem serves as a living testimony to the acceptance of Gentiles, aligning with Paul's message of justification by faith alone.

Fourteen years of fruitful ministry set the stage; Jerusalem is revisited to confirm unity; Barnabas adds witness and credibility; Titus embodies the Gentile freedom won by Christ. The verse assures believers today that the gospel Paul preached&#8212;salvation by grace through faith apart from works&#8212;was affirmed at the highest level of the early church and remains the unchanging good news for all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/galatians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>II.</span><p>(1-10) The argument proceeds, still taking the shape of vivid personal retrospect:--The next visit at which I had any communication with the elder Apostles was after an interval of fourteen years. That, too, only served to bring out at once the independence and the soundness of my teaching. I spoke on the subject freely to the whole Church, and besides I had private conferences with the leaders; but no alteration was made either in my teaching or in my practice. One crucial instance was that of Titus, my companion, who, Gentile as he was, was not compelled to be circumcised, though his circumcision was urged upon me, not by the free motion of the Apostles themselves, but to silence the malicious rumours set on foot by certain Judaising spies who had found their way into our midst. To these Barnabas and I did not give way for a moment. And the upshot of the matter was that my mission was fully recognised by the leading Apostles, and that we agreed to go different ways--they to the Jews, we to the Gentiles--with the one condition, which I needed no prompting to accept, that we should not forget the poor.<p>Thoughts and arguments crowd in upon the Apostle with great vehemence. His amanuensis cannot take them down fast enough. Sentences are begun and not rightly ended, and much of the sense is left to be supplied by conjecture. The general drift of the passage is sufficiently plain, but there is much uncertainty about the details. This will appear in the Notes which follow.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Fourteen years after.</span>--From what date is this fourteen years to be reckoned? The phrase "I went up <span class= "ital">again"</span> seems to be decisive in favour of reckoning it from the visit to Jerusalem just mentioned. We should therefore have to add the three years of <a href="/galatians/1-18.htm" title="Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.">Galatians 1:18</a>, in order to reach the date of the Apostle's conversion The relation of the present narrative to that in the Acts will be more fully discussed in an excursus. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus A: On the Visits of St. Paul to Jerusalem.</span>)<p>In the meantime, it may be assumed that there appear to be sufficient reasons for identifying the visit to Jerusalem here described with that recorded in Acts 15, commonly known as the Council of Jerusalem, which is placed by the best chronologists about A.D. 50 or 51.<p><span class= "bld">And took Titus with me also.</span>--In the corresponding passage (<a href="/acts/15-2.htm" title="When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.">Acts 15:2</a>) we are told that "certain others" were sent with Paul and Barnabas. St. Paul mentions especially Titus because of the part which he subsequently played in the history of the Council, and because of the importance of this for his present argument.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/2-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Fourteen</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#949;&#954;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#963;&#963;&#940;&#961;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(dekatessar&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Genitive Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1180.htm">Strong's 1180: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fourteen.
