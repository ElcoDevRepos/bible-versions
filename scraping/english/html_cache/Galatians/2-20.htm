In the context of Paul's letter to the Galatians, it emphasizes the believer's identification with Christ's crucifixion, symbolizing the death of the old self and its sinful nature. Historically, crucifixion was a Roman method of execution, reserved for the most serious offenders, highlighting the gravity of sin and the extent of Christ's sacrifice. This concept is echoed in <a href="/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>, where Paul speaks of the old self being crucified with Him, indicating a break from the power of sin.<p><b>and I no longer live</b><br>This indicates a transformation in the believer's life. The old self, characterized by sin and separation from God, is considered dead. This aligns with <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, which states that anyone in Christ is a new creation. The cultural context of the time emphasized personal identity and honor, but Paul shifts the focus from self to Christ, challenging the prevailing cultural norms.<p><b>but Christ lives in me</b><br>This phrase highlights the indwelling presence of Christ in the believer's life, a central tenet of Christian faith. It reflects the mystery of the union between Christ and the believer, as described in <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>, "Christ in you, the hope of glory." This indwelling is not just a metaphor but a real spiritual presence that empowers and guides the believer.<p><b>The life I live in the body</b><br>Paul acknowledges the physical existence of believers, who continue to live in their earthly bodies. This phrase underscores the tension between the spiritual reality of being in Christ and the practical aspects of living in a fallen world. It reflects the dual nature of Christian existence, as seen in <a href="/philippians/1-21.htm">Philippians 1:21-24</a>, where Paul discusses the desire to depart and be with Christ versus remaining in the flesh for fruitful labor.<p><b>I live by faith in the Son of God</b><br>Faith is the means by which believers live out their new life in Christ. This faith is not a one-time event but a continuous, active trust in Jesus. The Son of God title affirms the divinity of Christ and His unique relationship with the Father. <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a> defines faith as the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen, emphasizing the believer's reliance on Christ's promises.<p><b>who loved me and gave Himself up for me</b><br>This phrase encapsulates the personal nature of Christ's sacrificial love. The use of "me" highlights the individual aspect of salvation, making it personal and intimate. The historical context of sacrificial systems in Judaism, where offerings were made for atonement, is fulfilled in Christ's ultimate sacrifice. <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a> echoes this sentiment, urging believers to walk in love as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us. This act of love is the foundation of the believer's faith and new life in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, Paul is addressing the churches in Galatia, emphasizing the transformative power of faith in Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ (Jesus)</a></b><br>Central to this verse, Jesus is the one with whom believers are crucified, symbolizing the death of the old self and the birth of a new life in Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatia.htm">Galatia</a></b><br>A region in modern-day Turkey where the recipients of this letter resided.

The prominent idea in the first half of this clause had been the release from that burdensome ceremonial which the Judaising party wished to bind upon Christian consciences. By a natural transition, the Apostle's thought had passed from what the Law could not do to what Christianity could do.<p>The Law could not make men righteous before God. In Christ they were made righteous. How? Here, too, there was death. The Christian died with Christ to something else besides the Law. With his eye fixed upon the cross, he died a spiritual death and rose to a new spiritual life. The "old man" in him, the self-seeking and sinful element in his nature, is slain, and for it is substituted a life of such close and intimate communion with Christ that it seems as if Christ Himself were dwelling in the soul. Living upon the earth in a body of human flesh, as he is, he is animated by an intense faith in the Saviour who has given him such proofs of self-sacrificing love.<p>Here we come upon the same vein of mysticism that is developed in Romans 6. One main way of conceiving of the specially Christian life is through the idea of union with Christ. This idea, when ultimately pressed to precise logical definition, must necessarily contain a certain element of metaphor. Consciousness, rigorously examined, tells us that even in the most exalted souls there is no such thing as an <span class= "ital">actual</span> union of the human and divine. At the same time, there is possible to man an influence from above so penetrating and so powerful that it would seem as if the figure of union could alone adequately express it. Nor ought this to be questioned or denied because the more common order of minds do not find themselves capable of it. (See the Notes on Romans 6, and <span class= "ital">Excursus G</span> to that Epistle.)<p><span class= "bld">I am crucified . . .</span>--The idea is something more than that of merely "dying with Christ"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> imitating the death of Christ after a spiritual manner: it involves, besides, a special reference to the cross. It is through the power of the cross, through contemplating the cross and all that is associated with it, that the Christian is enabled to mortify the promptings of sin within him, and reduce them to a state of passiveness like that of death.<p><span class= "bld">Nevertheless I live.</span>--This death unto sin, death upon one side of my nature, does not hinder me from having life upon another side. The fact is that I live in a truer sense than ever before.<p><span class= "bld">Yet not I.</span>--It is, however, no longer the old natural man in me that lives: it is not that part of the human personality which has its root in matter, and is "of the earth, earthy," but that part which is re-formed by the Spirit of Christ.<p><span class= "bld">Now.</span>--In my present condition as a Christian opposed to the old condition prior to the conversion.<p><span class= "bld">In the flesh.</span>--In this bodily human frame; man though I be. The Christian is outwardly the same as other men; it is his inner life which is "hid with Christ in God."<p><span class= "bld">By the faith.</span>--The article is better omitted: <span class= "ital">by faith.</span> The Apostle does not quite go so far as to say that faith is the cause of his physical life, though we may see, by other passages, that he is at least prepared to look upon faith as the great pledge, and even cause, of the physical resurrection. Here he is speaking of faith rather as the element or atmosphere in which the Christian lives. He is, as it were, <span class= "ital">steeped</span> in faith.<p><span class= "bld">Of the Son of God</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> faith of which the Son of God is the object; faith <span class= "ital">in</span> the Son of God.<p>There is a curious variation of reading here. Some ancient authorities (including the Codex Vaticanus) instead of "faith in the Son of God," have "faith in God and Christ." This might appear to have some internal probability, as the less obvious expression of the two; but it may be perhaps explained satisfactorily in another way. On the whole, it seems best to abide by the Received text, which is that of the majority of MSS.<p><span class= "bld">Who loved me.</span>--Christ died for the whole world, but each individual Christian has a right to appropriate His death to himself. The death of Christ was prompted by love, not for the abstraction humanity, but for men as individuals. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - This verse brings out into fuller detail the several points bound up in the succinct statement of ver. 19. <span class="cmt_word">I am crucified with Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">I have been crucified with Christ.</span> I am on the cross, fastened thereto with Christ; the object, therefore, with him of the Law's abhorrence and anathema. If we ask, how and when he became thus blended with Christ in his crucifixion, we have the answer suggested by himself in <a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3, 6</a>, "Are ye ignorant, that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?" - "that our old man was crucified with him?" It was by believing in Christ and being baptized into him; comp. <a href="/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>, "All ye who were baptized into Christ did put on Christ " - words which have to be taken in connection with the reference to "faith in Christ" in ver. 26. The perfect tense of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> points to a continued state of being, following upon that decisive crisis of his life; the apostle images himself as still hanging on the cross with Christ, while also sharing in his resurrection-life; his "old man" is on the cross, while his spirit partakes in and is renewed by Christ's life in God (<a href="/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6, 8, 11</a>). The <span class="accented">pragmatism</span> of the passage, however, that is, its relevancy to the subject discussed by him with St. Peter, consists in the twofold statement: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the Law as a ceremonial institute has now nothing to do with him nor he with it, except as mutually proclaiming their entire disseverment the one from the other; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that nevertheless, while thus wholly apart from the Law, he has life in God, as he further proceeds to declare. <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless I live</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>). Notwithstanding all the Law's anathema, I am alive unto God (comp. <a href="/romans/6-11.htm">Romans 6:11</a>), the object of his love, and an heir of his eternal life. With this exalted blessedness of mine the Law cannot in the slightest degree meddle, by any determination which it will fain propound of cleanness or uncleanness. No ceremonial pollution of its constituting can touch this my life. My own life and my fellow-believer's life in God is infinitely removed from the possibility of receiving taint of pollution through eating (say) of blood, or suet, or pork, or through touching a leper or the remains of a deceased man. Nothing of this kind can mar or stain my righteousness or my fellow-believer's righteousness. Both he and I, sharing in the like "life" and righteousness, rejoice and exult together; let the Law denounce us for unclean as loudly and as bitterly as it will. Nay, if I were to allow myself to be disquieted by any such denouncement of pollution, I should, in fact, be allowing myself to harbour misgivings and unbelief touching the very essence of the grace of Jesus Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">and yet no longer I</span>, <span class="accented">but Christ liveth in me.</span> It was essential to the apostle's argument that he should assert <span class="accented">himself</span> to be, in spite of the Law's anathema, "alive," in the full possession of life in God; but he hastens to qualify this assertion by explaining how entirely he owes this life of his to Christ; and, in his eagerness to do this, he compresses the assertion and the qualification in one clause so closely together as, in a way not at all unusual with him, well-nigh to wreck the grammatical construction. A method, indeed, has been proposed by critics of disposing this clause with respect to the preceding in such a manner as to make the sentence run quite smoothly; thus: <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: that is, as given in the margin of the Revised English Version, "I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I that live, but Christ liveth in me." But not only does this method of construing altogether efface the apostle's assertion of his being alive notwithstanding the Law's malediction - an assertion which agrees so thoroughly with the defiant tone of the argument, but the abruptness of the construction as presented in the ordinary reading of the passage is its very recommendation; for such uncouthness of style is wont to show itself in St. Paul's more eager, impassioned passages. "No longer I;" as in those old days when I prided myself on being an especial favourite of Heaven, eminently righteous through meritorious doings of my own, through my punctilious observance in particular of all that the Law prescribes for gaining and maintaining ceremonial sanctity (comp. <a href="/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4, 6</a>). "In <span class="accented">those</span> days it was I that was alive; it is not so now." The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "I was alive," of <a href="/romans/7-9.htm">Romans 7:9</a>, serves again as a perfect illustration of the <span class="accented">phraseology</span> of the present passage; only we have still to bear in mind that the apostle is at present contemplating the ceremonial aspect of his old life, rather than, as in the Romans, the moral; the two being no doubt, however, in his former Pharisee scheme of religion, essentially conjoined. The in-being of Christ is to be understood as blending in one the two notions, of Christ as the ground of our acceptableness before God and of our being alive unto God, and of Christ as the motive spring of true practical well-doing (<a href="/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>). The two things, though notionally distinct, cannot exist apart, but the former is the more prominent idea here<span class="cmt_word">. And the life which I now live in the flesh</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;</span>). "Life" still denotes his spiritual state of being, and not his moral activity, though by inference in-relying this latter; as if it were "the life which I now possess." The construction of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;</span> is paralleled by the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>, "the death that he died, he died," and the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc7;</span>, "the life that he liveth, he liveth," of <a href="/romans/6-10.htm">Romans 6:10</a>. "Now," as well as "no longer," stands in contrast with his old life in Judaism. But, on the other hand, "in the flesh," viewed in conjunction with (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) "in faith," or "by faith," must be taken as in <a href="/philippians/1-22.htm">Philippians 1:22</a>, that is, as contrasted with the future life; while we are in the flesh "we walk by faith, not by sight" (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I live by the faith of the Son of God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">I live by faith</span>, the faith <span class="accented">which is in the Son of God.</span> By faith, not by works of the Levitical Law. It was by faith in Christ that I first became partaker of this life; it is by faith in Christ that I continue to partake of it; letting go my faith in Christ, I partake of the life no longer. The especial relevancy of this statement of the apostle's, whether with respect to the matters agitated at Antioch, or with respect to any such revival of Levitical notions of acceptableness with God as was now perplexing the Churchmen of Galatia, is the warning which it implicitly conveys that, to revert to Levitical notions of uncleanness or of righteousness, was to sin against faith in Christ, and therewith against the very essence of a Christian's spiritual life. It was the strong sense which the apostle had of the absolutely fatal tendency of such relapses towards Judaism that inspired the deep pathos which here tinges his language. Hence the magnificent title by which he recites Christ's personality, "the Son of God;" possessing as such an absolutely commanding claim to his people's adherence, which they <span class="accented">dare</span> not decline. Hence, too, the words which follow. <span class="cmt_word">Who loved me, and gave himself for me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">who loved me</span>, <span class="accented">and gave himself up for me.</span> Fain would the reader realize to his mind the fervid, thrilling tones and accent of voice in which the apostle, while uttering these words, would give vent to the sentiment which so powerfully swayed his whole life, and which he so vividly describes in writing to the Corinthians: "The love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that one died for all, therefore all died [namely, to all but him]. and he died fur all, that they which live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again" (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14, 15</a>). The same appropriation of Christ's love to his own individual self which the apostle here gives utterance to, "who loved <span class="accented">me</span>, and gave himself up for <span class="accented">me</span>," may every human creature also express in whom only is the faith which takes hold of his love. In fact, the apostle speaks thus for the very purpose of prompting every individual believer who hears him to feel and say the same. This, he indicates, should be <span class="accented">their</span> feeling just as much as his; a sentiment just as irresistibly regulative of their life. Why not? <span class="accented">Do they</span> not also owe to him all their hope on behalf of their souls? For the expression, "gave himself up," comp. <a href="/galatians/1-4.htm">Galatians 1:4</a> and note. The Greek verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is distinguished from the simple <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "gave himself," by its bringing more distinctly into view the notion of Christ's giving himself over into the hands of those who sought his life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/2-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I have been crucified with</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#973;&#961;&#969;&#956;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(synestaur&#333;mai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Middle or Passive - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4957.htm">Strong's 4957: </a> </span><span class="str2">To crucify together with.
