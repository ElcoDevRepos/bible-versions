It suggests an appeal to reason and understanding, emphasizing the importance of the message that follows. Paul often uses direct questions to engage his audience and provoke thought.<p><b>you who want to be under the law,</b><br>The "law" here refers to the Mosaic Law, which includes the commandments and regulations given to Israel. Some Galatians were being influenced by Judaizers who insisted that Gentile Christians must observe the Jewish law to be truly saved. This reflects a broader conflict in the early church regarding the role of the law in the life of a believer, as seen in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a> and the Jerusalem Council.<p><b>do you not understand</b><br>Paul challenges the Galatians' comprehension of the law's true purpose. This rhetorical question implies that their desire to adhere to the law stems from a misunderstanding. Paul often contrasts the law with faith in Christ, as seen in <a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20-22</a>, where he explains that righteousness comes through faith, not the law.<p><b>what the law says?</b><br>Paul is likely referring to the deeper, spiritual meaning of the law, which points to Christ and the promise of salvation through faith. The law serves as a tutor leading to Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>). In the context of <a href="/galatians/4.htm">Galatians 4</a>, Paul will go on to use the allegory of Hagar and Sarah to illustrate the difference between living under the law and living under the promise of grace. This reflects the broader biblical theme that the law reveals human sinfulness and the need for a savior, as seen in <a href="/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, addressing the issue of legalism and the Judaizers who were influencing the Galatian church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatians.htm">Galatians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a group of early Christians in the region of Galatia who were being swayed by teachings that emphasized adherence to the Jewish law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law, which includes the commandments and regulations given to the Israelites in the Old Testament.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judaizers.htm">Judaizers</a></b><br>A group within the early church advocating that Gentile converts must adhere to Jewish law, including circumcision, to be true Christians.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, he is central to the argument in the surrounding passages, representing faith and the promise of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_law's_purpose.htm">Understanding the Law's Purpose</a></b><br>The law was given to reveal sin and point to the need for a Savior.

He is not launching a cold lecture; he is inviting conversation. Like a shepherd calling sheep back to the fold, he says, &#8220;Tell me,&#8221; signaling that he wants hearts engaged, not just minds informed. This tone echoes his earlier plea in <a href="/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a> &#8211; &#8220;Who has bewitched you?&#8221;&#8212;and mirrors Jesus&#8217; compassionate questions to His disciples (<a href="/luke/24-38.htm">Luke 24:38</a>). By starting this way, Paul reminds readers that truth is best received in relationship and that correction is an act of love (<a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you who want to be under the law,</b><p>Here Paul identifies his audience: believers flirting with legalism. They were saved by faith (<a href="/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2</a>) yet now longed for the security of external rules.<p>&#8226; The phrase exposes a heart posture, not merely an intellectual position. Wanting the law means trusting human obedience more than Christ&#8217;s obedience (<a href="/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul knows the Mosaic code cannot grant life (<a href="/galatians/3-21.htm">Galatians 3:21-22</a>); it only reveals sin (<a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>). Choosing law-reliance is like Israel craving Egypt again after tasting God&#8217;s freedom (<a href="/exodus/16-3.htm">Exodus 16:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross reference <a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1-4</a>, which shows that sacrifices under the law were &#8220;a shadow of the good things to come,&#8221; never the substance. Law-dependence always ends in bondage, not blessing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>do you not understand</b><p>This piercing question exposes the irony: those championing the law have missed its message. Paul is not attacking their intelligence; he is challenging their discernment (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The law, rightly read, drives us to Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24-25</a>). If someone &#8220;understands,&#8221; that understanding culminates in faith, not self-effort (<a href="/romans/10-4.htm">Romans 10:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus made the same point to experts in Scripture: &#8220;You search the Scriptures&#8230; yet you refuse to come to Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39-40</a>). Knowing verses is not the same as grasping their intent.<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s gentle rebuke encourages self-examination (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>). Are we reading merely to confirm bias or to hear God&#8217;s heart?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what the law says?</b><p>Paul is about to quote <a href="/bsb/genesis/16.htm">Genesis 16&#8211;21</a>, showing how the very law the Galatians admire teaches the superiority of promise over performance.<p>&#8226; The story of Hagar and Sarah illustrates two covenants: one from Mount Sinai (slavery) and one from the Jerusalem above (freedom) (<a href="/galatians/4-22.htm">Galatians 4:22-31</a>).<p>&#8226; Even within the Pentateuch, God&#8217;s pattern is grace first, law later: promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>) came centuries before Moses. <a href="/romans/4-13.htm">Romans 4:13-16</a> reinforces that inheritance rests on faith, &#8220;so that it may rest on grace.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Thus the law &#8220;says&#8221; more than commands; it speaks of God&#8217;s redemptive plan culminating in Christ (<a href="/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27</a>). To stay under the law after Christ has fulfilled it (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>) is to ignore the law&#8217;s own testimony.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/galatians/4-21.htm">Galatians 4:21</a> confronts believers tempted by legalism. Paul lovingly invites them to listen, exposes their misplaced desire to live under rules, questions their true comprehension, and points them back to the law&#8217;s deeper message: it testifies to salvation by promise, not performance. The verse calls every generation to renounce self-reliance and rest in the finished work of Christ, where true freedom is found.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/galatians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21-31) The next eleven verses contain an elaborate argument from the history of the two sons of Abraham, as types of the two covenants, in further proof that freedom is the essential character of the Christian dispensation.<p>We have seen that St. Paul applies the history of the natural Israel allegorically to the spiritual Israel; and not only does he do this with reference to the history of the formed theocracy, but he goes back to its origin in the time of the patriarchs, and traces there the first beginnings of the separation between the Law and the promise. The same history had been already allegorically treated by Philo. The treatment of it by St. Paul is, however, quite different, and in keeping with the line of argument followed in the context.<p>The points of parallelism, which are drawn out in much detail, may be exhibited thus:--<p><span class= "ital">Jewish Church.</span><p><span class= "ital">Christian Church.</span><p>The bondwoman, Hagar.<p>The freewoman, Sarah.<p>Son of the bondwoman, Ishmael.<p>Son of the freewoman, Isaac.<p>Natural birth (the flesh).<p>Supernatural birth (the promise).<p>Mount Sinai. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tell me, ye that desire to be under the Law</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). After the outburst of affectionate earnestness expressed in the last four verses, the apostle seems to have paused, reflecting in what way he could the most effectually convince these Galatian legalists of their error. At length, a consideration occurs to him, which he impetuously so to speak hastens to abruptly sot before them. He has before (<a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>) shown to the Galatian believers that they were "Abraham's seed." He now means to show that, as children of Abraham through faith in Christ, they stood on a far higher footing than the children of the Sinai covenant did - a position which, by subjecting themselves afresh to the Law, they would forego. The verb "desire" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), as here introduced, intimates that this aspiration of theirs was a mere freak of self-will, there being nothing in the circumstances to prompt it. So in ver. 9, "Ye desire to be in bondage." In consequence of there being no article with <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, some would render <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> "under Law," that is, Law viewed <span class="accented">in</span> g<span class="accented">enere</span>, as in <a href="/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>. But the whole scope of the Epistle resists this view. The apostle's contention with the Galatian perverters of the truth is not concerning Christians being subject to Law absolutely, but concerning their being subject to a Law of outward ceremonial observance; that is, to the Law of Moses; for there was no other system of positive ordinances by which, as of Divine authority, they could imagine themselves to be bound. The noun <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used without the article, like other <span class="accented">monadic</span> nouns with an understood specific reference (for examples, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); as it is also <a href="/romans/2-23.htm">Romans 2:23</a>; <a href="/romans/3-31.htm">Romans 3:31</a>; <a href="/romans/4-13.htm">Romans 4:13, 14</a>; <a href="/romans/5-13.htm">Romans 5:13</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-20.htm">1 Corinthians 9:20</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-21.htm">Galatians 2:21</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-5.htm">Galatians 4:5</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5, 6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Do ye not hear the Law?</span> (<span class="greek_word">to\n no/mon</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>;); <span class="accented">to that Law give ye no heed</span>? The article is here prefixed to <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> to make the repetition of the noun the more telling; just as it is in <a href="/romans/2-23.htm">Romans 2:23</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, hear, like our "listen to," means "take to heart what it says;" as in <a href="/matthew/10-14.htm">Matthew 10:14</a>; <a href="/luke/16-29.htm">Luke 16:29, 31</a>. There is no reason for attributing to the verb such a sense of listening to an <span class="accented">oral</span> utterance as should warrant us in supposing, that the apostle is thinking in particular of the Galatian Christians as in the habit of "hearing" the Pentateuch and ether Old Testament Scriptures read, whether in Jewish synagogues (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14, 15</a>; <a href="/acts/15-21.htm">Acts 15:21</a>) or in Christian assemblages. That such Scriptures in the Septuagint Version were customarily read aloud when Christians assembled for united worship, especially in the absence or dearth of other inspired writings, is more than probable: we know from Justin Martyr ('Apol.,' 1. p. 83) that such was the custom from Sunday to Sunday in his days, when there were <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> also available for such use. Moreover, the existence of such a custom helps us to understand how it was that the apostle could here, as in <a href="/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1</a>, presuppose with Christian believers an acquaintance with the contents of the Pentateuch. But we require more here than the thought, "Are ye not wont to hear the Law read?" It is rather an acquaintance with its contents, and taking due account of them, that he demands of his readers. Some uncial manuscripts have <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, read, instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. This reading of the text would only imply, not without a touch of sarcasm, the sense which the more accredited reading, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, may be understood as directly denoting. The use of the word "Law" to denote at once the system of Mosaic legislation and the historical record in which it is embedded, is remarkable. The Jews were accustomed to designate the Pentateuch by this term (comp. <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>; <a href="/luke/16-16.htm">Luke 16:16</a>; <a href="/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>); and whoever would fain subject themselves to the positive enactments of the Mosaic Law as possessing Divine authority, would of course feel themselves bound also to accept the teaching of the historical record as clothed with the like authority. The apostle himself also accepted both as alike coming from God; only he required that the Divine purpose in both should be clearly understood and be suitably complied with. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/4-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Tell</span><br /><span class="grk">&#923;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#964;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(Legete)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">me,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(moi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
