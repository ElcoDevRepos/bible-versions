In the context of Galatians, Paul has been discussing the importance of living by the Spirit and bearing one another's burdens. "Nevertheless" suggests a shift to a practical application of these spiritual principles.<p><b>the one who receives instruction in the word</b><br>This phrase refers to the believer who is being taught the truths of the Christian faith. In the early church, instruction in the word was crucial for spiritual growth and understanding. The "word" here is the gospel message and the teachings of Jesus Christ. This aligns with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to teach others to observe all that He has commanded.<p><b>must share in all good things</b><br>This implies a reciprocal relationship between the teacher and the student. "All good things" can be understood as material support, encouragement, and other forms of assistance. This principle is echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-11.htm">1 Corinthians 9:11</a>, where Paul speaks about the right of those who sow spiritual things to reap material benefits. It reflects the communal nature of the early church, where resources were shared among believers (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>).<p><b>with his instructor</b><br>The instructor is the one who imparts spiritual knowledge and guidance. In the early church, this would often be an apostle, elder, or teacher. The relationship between the instructor and the student is one of mutual respect and support. This is consistent with the biblical principle of honoring those who labor in teaching and preaching, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>.

Even at this early date there seems to have been a more or less organised system of instruction in the Church. Teaching was regarded as a separate function, though those who took part in it do not seem as yet to have formed a separate class. See <a href="/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1</a>; <a href="/romans/12-7.htm" title="Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teaches, on teaching;">Romans 12:7</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/12-28.htm" title="And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.">1Corinthians 12:28-29</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm" title="And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;">Ephesians 4:11</a>; <a href="/james/3-1.htm" title="My brothers, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.">James 3:1</a> ("masters" should be rather "teachers").

It is, in fact, here merely a conjunction of transition: not in any degree adversative; for the exhortation to liberality towards our teachers is perfectly germane to the preceding topics of carrying one another's loads, and so carrying our own pack. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, etymologically "to fill with sound," thence signifies "to din a thing into another person's mind with inculcation or constant repetition," in which sense it occurs in <a href="/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21, 24</a>, of the persistent repetition of a slanderous report. So early as in Hippocrates (Liddell and Scott) the verbal substantive <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is used for "instruction;" and the verb, though not occurring in Attic writers, seems to have continued in use in other dialects, to reappear at length in the Common Dialect of Greek. Accordingly, it is found in the sense of "instruct" in <a href="/luke/1-4.htm">Luke 1:4</a>; <a href="/acts/18-25.htm">Acts 18:25</a>; <a href="/romans/2-18.htm">Romans 2:18</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-19.htm">1 Corinthians 14:19</a>. It does not denote instruction by question and answer in particular, but simply the inculcating of knowledge. Recently as the Galatian Churches had been founded, it appears from this passage that there were already persons among them whose particular business it was to give religious instruction to their fellow-Christians; so much their business, that they were on this ground entitled to receive from those they taught liberal help in temporal things. Such persons were doubtless included among the "elders" whom Paul and Barnabas appointed in the several Churches which they planted (<a href="/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>). It is noticeable, further, that the order of men alone singled out as entitled to such secular assistance is characterized as a teaching order; so characterized, per-hops, because teaching religious truth was the most prominent and characteristic of their functions. In his First Epistle to Timothy (<a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>), written, probably, some years later, "the elders who labour in Word and teaching (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>)" are particularized as those among the "presiding elders" who are the "most especially" entitled to liberal payment; the form of expression, however, implying that elders whose function lay in other duties than that of teaching were likewise entitled to liberal consideration. The teaching elders would require, more than other Church officers, leisure from worldly avocations for the study of God's Word and his truth, and for the actual discharge of their especial work in private as well as in public (comp. <a href="/acts/6-4.htm">Acts 6:4</a>; <a href="/acts/20-20.htm">Acts 20:20</a>). The direction here given would apply, as to the case of resident teachers, so also to that of persons who travelled about in the dissemination of the faith; as we learn from <a href="/1_corinthians/9-4.htm">1 Corinthians 9:4-14</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-7.htm">2 Corinthians 11:7-12</a>. In <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12, 13</a> the apostle commends to the "high estimation" of the disciples "those who laboured among them, and were ever them in the Lord, and admonished them (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); The expression "the Word" is used without any further qualification to designate the Christian doctrine, as in <a href="/mark/2-2.htm">Mark 2:2</a>; <a href="/mark/4-14.htm">Mark 4:14</a>; <a href="/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4</a>; <a href="/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-14.htm">Philippians 1:14</a>. So the Christian religion is styled "the Way" in <a href="/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>; <a href="/acts/19-9.htm">Acts 19:9</a>. "Share;' the verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> and its derivatives are frequently used with reference to that kind of "fellowship" or "partnership" which is evinced by our liberally sharing with the object of it in our worldly means. If we "count a minister our partner (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)," as St. Paul writes to Philemon (ver. 17), we shall not begrudge him frank and generous help in any direction. Thus <a href="/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a>, "Communicating to the necessities of saints," is properly "sharing with them in generous sympathy." So <a href="/philippians/4-14.htm">Philippians 4:14</a>, "had fellowship with (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) my affliction" points to liberal temporal assistance. Similarly, generous sympathy embodied in money gifts is styled "communion," or "partnership," in <a href="/romans/15-26.htm">Romans 15:26</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-13.htm">2 Corinthians 9:13</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-5.htm">Philippians 1:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-16.htm">Hebrews 13:16</a>; as also <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "ready to communicate," expresses one ready to show such sympathy, in <a href="/1_timothy/6-18.htm">1 Timothy 6:18</a>. The apostle regards, and would have others regard, such offices of kindness with a fine delicate feeling, not as giving as if from a higher level of condition, but as sharing with brothers, with whom all things are held in common. Chrysostom and others consider the word to point to an interchange or barter of goods, spiritual and temporal, referring to <a href="/1_corinthians/9-11.htm">1 Corinthians 9:11</a>. "In all good things;" in all good things of this life which he himself possesses. "Good things" as in <a href="/luke/12-18.htm">Luke 12:18, 19</a> ("my goods"); Luke 16:25; the preposition "in," as in <a href="/matthew/23-30.htm">Matthew 23:30</a>, "partakers in the blood of the prophets." The exact import of this clause, which has been variously interpreted, is best appreciated by our taking account of the warmth of indignant feeling with which the apostle is writing. This clearly transpires both from the words, "be not deceived," and from the assurance, "God is not mocked." The apostle had evidently in his eye a certain course of conduct which he indignantly denounces as a "sneering at God." This feeling prompts him to accentuate his exhortation addressed to the cold-hearted, stingy Christians whom he has in view, by adding this clause, which is in effect, "in every possible way;" namely, by giving them respect and good will as well as maintenance. To no other Church does he address such direct admonition respecting the liberal treatment of its teachers, though, perhaps, indirect admonition may be detected in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7-11</a>. No doubt the news he had just heard from Galatia made him feel the necessity of dealing with them roundly on this point. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/6-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">However,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the one who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
