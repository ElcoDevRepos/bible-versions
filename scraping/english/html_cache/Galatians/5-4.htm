In the context of Galatians, Paul is confronting the Judaizers, who insisted that Gentile Christians must follow Jewish customs, including circumcision, to be saved. Historically, the Law was given to Israel as a covenant at Mount Sinai, serving as a guide to holiness and a means to reveal sin (<a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>). However, Paul emphasizes that justification, or being declared righteous before God, cannot be achieved through the Law (<a href="/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>). This reflects the broader biblical narrative that righteousness comes through faith, as exemplified by Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>, <a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>).<p><b>have been severed from Christ</b><br>The imagery of being "severed" suggests a cutting off or separation, indicating a serious spiritual consequence. In the New Testament, Christ is often depicted as the vine, and believers as branches (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>). To be severed from Christ implies losing the vital connection that sustains spiritual life. This separation occurs when individuals rely on the Law rather than faith in Christ for salvation. Theologically, this underscores the exclusivity of Christ as the source of salvation (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>) and the futility of attempting to earn God's favor through human effort.<p><b>you have fallen away from grace</b><br>"Fallen away from grace" suggests a departure from the principle of grace, which is unmerited favor from God. Grace is central to the gospel message, as salvation is a gift from God, not a result of works (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). The Galatians' attempt to be justified by the Law represents a shift from reliance on God's grace to self-reliance. This echoes the warning in <a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4-6</a> about the dangers of turning away from the grace of God. Theologically, this phrase highlights the tension between law and grace, emphasizing that grace is the foundation of the New Covenant, fulfilled in Jesus Christ (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, <a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, addressing the churches in Galatia about the dangers of legalism and the importance of faith in Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatians.htm">Galatians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a group of early Christians in the region of Galatia who were being influenced by Judaizers to follow Jewish law for justification.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judaizers.htm">Judaizers</a></b><br>A group within the early church advocating that Gentile converts must adhere to Jewish law, particularly circumcision, to be justified.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in Christianity, whose grace and sacrifice are the means of justification, as opposed to adherence to the law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law, which some early Christians believed was necessary for salvation alongside faith in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/justification_by_faith_alone.htm">Justification by Faith Alone</a></b><br>Emphasize that justification comes through faith in Jesus Christ, not by adherence to the law.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is a favourite word with St. Paul, occurring twenty-seven times in his Epistles, including twice in the Hebrews, whilst in the rest of the New Testament it occurs only once, and that in the Pauline St. Luke (<a href="/luke/13-7.htm">Luke 13:7</a>). Its proper meaning is "to make inoperative," "make of no effect," as above (<a href="/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a>).

The present tense is the present of design or endeavour; the result in this case being, in fact, unattainable (<a href="/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10, 21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye are fallen from grace</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">ye have fallen from</span> the state of <span class="accented">grace.</span> "Grace" denotes the condition of acceptance with God into which faith in Christ brings us. Cf. <a href="/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>: "Through whom we have had our access by faith into this grace wherein we stand." The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> is used as in <a href="/2_peter/3-17.htm">2 Peter 3:17</a>, "Lest - <span class="accented">ye</span> <span class="accented">fall from</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) your own steadfastness." So <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, <a href="/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5</a>, "Remember whence thou hast fallen [<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>: Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>]." In classical Greek the verb was frequently used as a set term to describe those who, in the alternating success of adverse factions in the several independent cities of Greece, were compelled by a more powerful adverse party to submit to exile; its correlative verb being <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>. This fact leads Bishop Lightfoot, having an eye to the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span> of <a href="/galatians/4-30.htm">Galatians 4:30</a>, to render <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> here, "<span class="accented">are driven forth and banished</span> with Hagar your mother." But this very idiomatic colour of meaning it seems very precarious to give to the word in the Greek of St. Paul. The more general signification of the term is amply sustained by its use in Plutarch as cited by Wetstein. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/5-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{You} who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7989;&#964;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hoitines)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3748.htm">Strong's 3748: </a> </span><span class="str2">Whosoever, whichsoever, whatsoever. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">are [trying] to be justified</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#952;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(dikaiousthe)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Middle or Passive - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1344.htm">Strong's 1344: </a> </span><span class="str2">From dikaios; to render just or innocent.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
