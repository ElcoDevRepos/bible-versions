His presence with Paul in Jerusalem is significant as it underscores the unity and fellowship between Jewish and Gentile believers. Titus is mentioned in other New Testament writings, such as 2 Corinthians and the Epistle to Titus, highlighting his role in the early church. His companionship with Paul during this critical time in the church's history emphasizes the acceptance of Gentile believers without the need for adherence to Jewish customs.<p><b>was compelled to be circumcised</b><br>Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham, and it became a central issue in the early church as it expanded to include Gentile believers. The fact that Titus, a Greek, was not compelled to be circumcised is a testament to the early church's struggle with the question of whether Gentile converts needed to follow Jewish law. This decision aligns with the conclusions of the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15), which determined that Gentile believers were not required to be circumcised, emphasizing salvation through faith in Jesus Christ alone.<p><b>even though he was a Greek</b><br>Titus being a Greek highlights the cultural and ethnic diversity within the early Christian community. Greeks were often seen as outsiders by Jewish believers, and their inclusion without the requirement of circumcision was a radical departure from traditional Jewish customs. This phrase underscores the universality of the Gospel message and the breaking down of barriers between Jews and Gentiles, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>, where Paul speaks of Christ as our peace, who has made both groups one.

The result of the private conference with the Judaic Apostles is not given till <a href="/galatians/2-7.htm" title="But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed to me, as the gospel of the circumcision was to Peter;">Galatians 2:7</a>; but without waiting for this, the Apostle turns aside to give one emphatic piece of evidence that his practice in regard to the Gentile converts was not interfered with. The question of principle was raised in the case of Titus, and there he stood his ground, in spite of the pressure that was put upon him.<p>In addition to its bearing upon the main argument, there is probably a special reason for this mention of the case of Titus. At the beginning of his second missionary journey, on taking with him his youthful convert Timothy, St. Paul made so much of a concession to Jewish prejudices as to have him circumcised (<a href="/acts/16-3.htm" title="Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.">Acts 16:3</a>). We shall see later that this gave rise to a charge of inconsistency, which the Judaising party in Galatia were not slow to make use of. (See <a href="/galatians/5-11.htm" title="And I, brothers, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offense of the cross ceased.">Galatians 5:11</a>, and Notes there.) There was indeed some real inconsistency, but not more than any one who is engaged in the struggles of active life will constantly find himself drawn into. The meeting at Jerusalem was a crisis in the history of the Church. The question of principle was at stake. Concession herein would have been ruinous and fatal, and the Apostle stood firm. On the other hand, the circumcision of Timothy was merely a practical compromise to smooth the way for the preaching of the gospel in new regions. The Apostle was too wise to incur needless opposition, which would bar the way to essential truths on a point which, though in some of its aspects involving principle, was yet in others of quite minor importance. Besides, there is this to be noticed, that whereas Titus was by descent wholly a Gentile, Timothy was, on his mother's side, a Jew.<p>Turning to the phraseology of the passage, we may observe that the opening clause would be better translated, <span class= "ital">But not even was Titus</span> . . . <span class= "ital">compelled to be circumcised.</span> "Not even" refers to the prominence which Titus assumed as being associated with St. Paul in his ministry. This was a special reason for insisting upon his circumcision; and yet he was not circumcised.<p><span class= "bld">Being a Greek.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">a Gentile.</span> It is observed that the Peshito version translated the word here rendered "Greek" by "Aramaean" or "Syrian." All idea of pure Hellenic descent has dropped out of it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;</span>); <span class="accented">and yet.</span> "Though I explicitly stated to the leading men in the Church of Jerusalem what I taught respecting the relation of Gentile converts to circumcision and the Mosaic Law, yet in the end they, by their support, enabled us to withstand the pressure which was for a while applied for getting Titus circumcised." <span class="cmt_word">Neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f1d;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">not even was Titus who was with me</span>, <span class="accented">being a Greek</span>, <span class="accented">compelled to be circumcised.</span> This, St. Paul intimates, was a crucial case. Titus was a Gentile pure; not (like Timothy) having one parent of Jewish extraction and therefore capable of being identified with the Jewish people, but Gentile-born of both parents. The clause, '"who was with me," after ver. 1, was quite unnecessary for mere definition; in fact, it is not added for definition, but to mark the close association with an uncircumcised Gentile which the apostle openly displayed at Jerusalem. He took him with him, we may suppose, when he came before the Church at its public assemblies; when he appeared before the select meeting of the apostles and elders; when he joined the brethren in the agapae and the Lord's Supper - occasions of fraternal communion, in which the presence of a "dog," "an uncircumcised Greek," would be tenfold obnoxious. We cannot, by the way, but marvel at St. Paul's great courage in thus acting. Not only was this paraded fellowship with Titus sure to give deep offence to the vast majority of his Christian brethren, but it might also well expose him to serious personal risks among the highly inflammable populace of the city. At Jerusalem his "soul was among lions." The two clauses, "who was with me, being a Greek," illustrate the "not even." Openly displayed as was Titus's companionship with St. Paul before the eyes of all the Jews, both believers and unbelievers,and Gentile as he was known to be, yet not even in his case was circumcision persistently insisted upon. The aorist tense of <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> is significant of the ultimate result; it implies that an attempt was made to get Titus to submit to the rite, but failed. We must observe that St. Paul does not write,"I was not compelled to circumcise Titus," but "Titus was not compelled to be circumcised." This appears to make a material difference. By putting it as he has done, the apostle intimates that it was to Titus himself that the pressure was applied. Titus was plied, we may suppose, with theological argument, with appeals to his brotherly sympathies, with appeals to his prudent care for public peace, with threats of social and religious excommunication, and with stern, indignant remonstrance. But sustained, as he all through knew himself to be, by at least St, Paul, if not also by his fellow-deputies, he through it all maintained his firm stand upon his liberty. The "we" of the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 5, no doubt, includes at least Titus. The question, however, arises - Who were they that for a while endeavoured to force circumcision upon Titus? The converts from the sect of the Pharisees, mentioned by St. Luke (<a href="/acts/15-5.htm">Acts 15:5</a>), are naturally the first to occur to our minds. But the moulding of the sentence in the next verse discountenances this solution. We cannot help identifying the "false brethren" there spoken of with just those very Pharisean converts - men who had simply thrown the cloak of professed Christian discipleship over the old Pharisean legalism still wholly clung to. But if we suppose this, we cannot imagine that the writer would have said that Titus was not compelled to be circumcised "<span class="accented">by</span> reason of those false brethren," if these had been the very persons alluded to as having tried to compel him. It is more probable that the persons alluded to were certain influential members of the Jewish Church, with a strong body, perhaps, of the elders of that Church, having possibly the concurrence even of James and of Cephas. James and the elders, on a later occasion (<a href="/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18-26</a>), urged Paul himself to undertake the performance of certain Mosaical observances, with the view of conciliating the believers of Jerusalem. It is, therefore, quite supposable, at this earlier and as yet immature stage in the development of the practical application of the evangelical doctrine, that Titus was now being dealt with in a somewhat similar manner. But whoever they were that were doing it, it is plain that, in effect, they were working towards the same practical result as the most eager of the Mosaist legalists, only by a different mode of approach. Titus in particular was fastened upon for this assault, apparently <span class="accented">because</span> St. Paul had brought him with him as a crucial instance whereupon to try the general question. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/2-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Yet</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(all&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
