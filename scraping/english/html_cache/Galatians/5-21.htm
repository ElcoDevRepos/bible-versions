Biblically, envy is condemned as it reflects a lack of trust in God's provision and plan. In the Old Testament, envy led to Cain's murder of Abel (<a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5-8</a>) and Joseph's brothers selling him into slavery (<a href="/genesis/37-11.htm">Genesis 37:11, 28</a>). The New Testament continues this theme, warning against envy as a work of the flesh that opposes the Spirit (<a href="/james/3-14.htm">James 3:14-16</a>). Envy is contrasted with the contentment and gratitude that believers are called to exhibit (<a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-13</a>).<p><b>drunkenness,</b><br>Drunkenness is repeatedly condemned in Scripture as it leads to a loss of self-control and moral decay. <a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a> warns that wine is a mocker and strong drink is raging. In the New Testament, believers are called to be sober-minded and filled with the Spirit rather than wine (<a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>). Drunkenness is often associated with pagan practices and idolatry, as seen in the excesses of the Roman Empire, where alcohol was used in various religious and social rituals.<p><b>orgies,</b><br>Orgies refer to excessive indulgence in sensual pleasures, often linked to pagan worship practices in the ancient world. The Greco-Roman culture, prevalent during the time of Paul's writing, was known for its licentious festivals and feasts, which often included sexual immorality. Such behavior is contrary to the holiness and purity that God calls His people to (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-5</a>). The Bible consistently calls for sexual purity and self-control, reflecting God's design for human relationships.<p><b>and the like.</b><br>This phrase indicates that the list of sinful behaviors is not exhaustive. Paul acknowledges that there are many other actions and attitudes that are contrary to the Spirit. This open-endedness serves as a warning to believers to be vigilant against all forms of sin, not just those explicitly listed. It emphasizes the need for discernment and the guidance of the Holy Spirit in identifying and avoiding sin (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-18</a>).<p><b>I warn you, as I did before,</b><br>Paul's repetition of this warning underscores its seriousness. He had previously warned the Galatians about the consequences of living according to the flesh (<a href="/galatians/1-9.htm">Galatians 1:9</a>). This reflects the pastoral concern Paul has for the spiritual well-being of the church. The repetition also serves as a reminder of the consistent message of the Gospel, which calls for repentance and transformation through Christ.<p><b>that those who practice such things</b><br>The term "practice" implies a habitual lifestyle rather than an isolated incident. It refers to a pattern of behavior that is unrepentant and persistent. This distinction is important, as it differentiates between those who struggle with sin and seek forgiveness and those who willfully continue in sin. The New Testament consistently calls believers to a life of holiness and transformation (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1-2</a>).<p><b>will not inherit the kingdom of God.</b><br>This phrase is a sobering reminder of the eternal consequences of sin. The kingdom of God represents the reign and rule of God, both in the present and in the future. To inherit the kingdom is to partake in the blessings and eternal life promised to believers. This warning echoes Jesus' teachings in the Gospels, where He speaks of the necessity of righteousness and repentance to enter the kingdom (<a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>). It serves as a call to examine one's life and ensure alignment with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, addressing the churches in Galatia with a message of warning and instruction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatia.htm">Galatia</a></b><br>A region in modern-day Turkey where the recipients of the letter were located.

These belong properly to the third group, and should have been placed in the same verse with them.

This fourth group represents sins of excess. Here, too, the apostle touches a form of vice, to which abundant testimony shows the Galatians, as well as other branches of Celts, to have been especially prone. It was, perhaps, this marked feature of the Galatian nationality in particular that led St. Peter, in addressing the Churches of "Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia," to speak (<a href="/1_peter/4-3.htm">1 Peter 4:3</a>) of their having formerly walked in "lasciviousness, lusts, wine-bibbings, revellings, carousings (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), and abominable idolatries." <span class="cmt_word">And such like</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">and those</span> (works) <span class="accented">which arc like to these. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">of the which I forewarn you</span>, <span class="accented">even as I did forewarn you.</span> The construction of the accusative <span class="greek">&#x1f05;</span> is precisely similar to that of <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="/john/8-54.htm">John 8:54</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>.

"As I did forewarn you;" this previous warning was probably given at his very first preaching of the gospel to them he would no doubt at once speak plainly to people, very commonly sunk in vice and excess, of the awards of the "judgment to come." <span class="cmt_word">That they which do such things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>): <span class="accented">that they which practise such things.</span> The present tense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is more suitable than the aorist, as being the language of warning with reference to future conduct (cf. <a href="/romans/2-2.htm">Romans 2:2, 3, 7-10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall not inherit the kingdom of God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). The apostle uses the same words in writing to the Corinthians with reference to the sins to which they were the most prone (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</a>). So <a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>, "No fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, which is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God." This "kingdom" is also referred to in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>, "Walk worthily of God who calleth you into his own kingdom and glory" ("His own!" Astonishing prospect!); <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:5</a>, "That ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer;" <a href="/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a>, "will save me unto his heavenly kingdom." The like designation of the future felicity is given by St. Peter (<a href="/2_peter/1-11.htm">2 Peter 1:11</a>), "entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ," and by St. James (it. 5), "heirs of the kingdom which he [God] promised to them that love him." It is derived from our Lord's own teaching, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/matthew/25-34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a>, "Inherit the kingdom prepared for you;" <a href="/luke/12-32.htm">Luke 12:32</a>, "It is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom." It is the manifestation and consummation of "that kingdom of heaven," or "kingdom of God," heralded by Christ and his forerunner as "at hand," which the Prophet Daniel had pointed forward to (<a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13, 14, 18</a>). Bondage to "the flesh" in this life is constantly declared throughout the New Testament to form an insuperable bar to an entrance into that exalted state. And what is the alternative prospect? This the Apostle Paul does not here specify, though elsewhere he does so with awful emphasis; as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/romans/2-8.htm">Romans 2:8</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/5-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[and] envy;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#966;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(phthonoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5355.htm">Strong's 5355: </a> </span><span class="str2">Envy, a grudge, spite.
