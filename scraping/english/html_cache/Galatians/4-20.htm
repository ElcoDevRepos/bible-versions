This reflects the personal nature of his ministry, emphasizing the importance of face-to-face interaction in resolving misunderstandings and providing guidance. In the early church, personal visits were crucial for teaching and maintaining doctrinal purity, as seen in <a href="/acts/15-36.htm">Acts 15:36</a> where Paul suggests revisiting the churches to see how they are doing. The desire to be present also highlights the limitations of written communication in conveying tone and emotion.<p><b>and change my tone</b><br>Paul acknowledges the sternness of his previous words and expresses a desire to alter his approach. This indicates his flexibility and sensitivity to the needs of the Galatians, showing that his ultimate goal is their spiritual well-being, not merely correction. The tone of a letter was significant in the ancient world, as it could affect the reception and effectiveness of the message. Paul's willingness to change his tone suggests a pastoral heart that prioritizes reconciliation and understanding over rebuke.<p><b>because I am perplexed about you</b><br>Paul's perplexity reveals his deep concern and confusion over the Galatians' spiritual state. Despite having received the gospel, they are turning to legalistic practices, which Paul finds bewildering. This reflects the broader theme of Galatians, where Paul defends the gospel of grace against the Judaizers' influence. His perplexity is similar to his reaction in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>, where he fears the Corinthians might be led astray from their pure devotion to Christ.

Bishop Lightfoot writes, "<span class="accented">But</span>, speaking of my presence, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">would I had been present</span>," etc. But this explanation is not necessary. The imperfect verb <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, like the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="/acts/25-22.htm">Acts 25:22</a> and the <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a>, denotes a movement as it were which had just been stirring in the mind, but which for good reasons is now withdrawn: "I could almost wish - but long distance and pressure of other duties make it impossible." Thus much in explanation of the withdrawal of the wish. The wish itself was occasioned by the feeling that the yearning desire of his soul might perhaps be more likely to be achieved if, by being on the spot, he were enabled to adapt his treatment to a more distinct consciousness of the circumstances than he can possibly now have. "To be present with you;" the very words are repeated from ver. 18. It was well both with you and with me when I was with you: would that I could be with van now I (On <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>,," this very hour," see note on ch. 1:9.) <span class="cmt_word">And to change my voice</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). The tense of the infinitive <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> hardly allows us to take the word as meaning "from moment to moment according to the rapidly varying emergencies." This would have been expressed rather by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. The question then arises - Change: from what to what? to which a great variety of answers have been proposed. The clue is probably supplied in the words, "be present with you this very hour." This <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, contrasting as it does the very present with the former occasions on which the apostle had been with them, suggests that he meant that the tone of his utterance would need to be different if amongst them just now from what it had then been. Then, it was the simple, un-anxious, joyous, exposition of the blessed gospel, untrammelled by fear of being misunderstood; such a way of speaking as one would be naturally drawn on to pursue who found himself addressing those whom he could confide in, and who were disposed frankly and lovingly, with an honest and good heart, to drink in from his lips the simple faith. Perhaps he might now find it necessary to replace that mode of utterance by guarded words, by stern reasoning, by the refuting of wilful misconceptions, by exposing and abashing cavil and objection. <span class="cmt_word">For I stand in doubt of you</span>; or, I <span class="accented">am perplexed for you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">am perplexed about you.</span> Compare <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "I am in good courage concerning you" (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-16.htm">2 Corinthians 7:16</a>). As "<span class="accented">in"</span> the Corinthians the apostle found ground for good courage, so "in" the Galatians he found ground for perplexity. This explains his wishing that he were with them. He would in that case be less unable to clearly understand their state of mind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/4-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[how]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I wish</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7972;&#952;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;thelon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2309.htm">Strong's 2309: </a> </span><span class="str2">To will, wish, desire, be willing, intend, design. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I could be</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(pareinai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Infinitive Active<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3918.htm">Strong's 3918: </a> </span><span class="str2">From para and eimi; to be near, i.e. At hand; neuter present participle time being, or property.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4314.htm">Strong's 4314: </a> </span><span class="str2">To, towards, with.
