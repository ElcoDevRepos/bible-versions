In biblical context, "foolish" often refers to a lack of spiritual insight or wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). The Galatians had been influenced by Judaizers who insisted on adherence to the Mosaic Law for salvation, which Paul saw as a regression from the truth of the Gospel. This echoes Jesus' rebuke of the Pharisees for their spiritual blindness (<a href="/matthew/23-17.htm">Matthew 23:17</a>).<p><b>After starting in the Spirit,</b><br>The "Spirit" refers to the Holy Spirit, who initiates the believer's journey of faith. This aligns with the New Testament teaching that salvation begins with the work of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5-6</a>). The Galatians had experienced the Spirit's power and presence, as seen in the miraculous works among them (<a href="/galatians/3-5.htm">Galatians 3:5</a>). This phrase underscores the transformative power of the Spirit in the believer's life, contrasting with the works of the law.<p><b>are you now finishing in the flesh?</b><br>"Finishing in the flesh" suggests a reliance on human effort rather than divine grace. In biblical terms, "flesh" often symbolizes human weakness and sinfulness (<a href="/romans/8-8.htm">Romans 8:8</a>). The Galatians were attempting to achieve spiritual maturity through adherence to the law, which Paul argues is futile. This reflects the broader biblical theme that righteousness and sanctification come through faith and the Spirit, not through human effort (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>, <a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3-4</a>). The contrast between "Spirit" and "flesh" is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, emphasizing the new covenant of grace over the old covenant of law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, addressing the churches in Galatia with a corrective message.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatians.htm">Galatians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a group of early Christians in the region of Galatia who were being influenced by Judaizers to follow the Mosaic Law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judaizers.htm">Judaizers</a></b><br>A group of individuals who taught that Christian converts must adhere to certain Jewish laws, including circumcision, to be truly saved.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_spirit.htm">Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, who initiates and sustains the believer's spiritual life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/flesh.htm">Flesh</a></b><br>In this context, it refers to human effort and reliance on the law for salvation, as opposed to reliance on the Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_legalism.htm">The Danger of Legalism</a></b><br>Legalism shifts focus from faith in Christ to human efforts and adherence to the law.

By "the flesh" is here meant the Law, which, though described as spiritual in Horn. vii. 14, and though it really was spiritual in view of its origin, in another aspect--as imposing a system of literal obedience upon its adherents--was carnal, "earthly," rigid, petty, and low. It had none of that sublime expansiveness and aspiration which belongs to faith. It was a grievous reversing of the whole order of progress--to begin with faith, and, instead of completing with faith that which faith had begun, to fall back upon a condition of things which was shared with the Christian by the unemancipated Jew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">are ye so foolish</span>? <span class="accented">having begun with the Spirit</span>, <span class="accented">are ye now finishing with the flesh</span>? <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, as contrasted with <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;</span>, means the element of spiritual existence (comp. the use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>) into which they had been brought at their conversion by the Holy Spirit's influence; including the spiritual sensibility and spiritual activity which had at first marked their Christian life, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> joy in God in the sense of pardon, adoption (<a href="/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>), love to God, affectionate attachment to their spiritual teacher (<a href="/galatians/4-14.htm">Galatians 4:14, 15</a>), brotherly love among themselves: at that hour all their soul was praise, joy, love. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f76;</span> denotes a lower, merely sensuous kind of religiousness, one busying itself with ceremonial performances, observance of days and festivals (<a href="/galatians/4-10.htm">Galatians 4:10</a>), distinctions of meats, and other matters of ceremonial prescription; with petty strivings and disputings, of course, about such points, as if they really mattered at all; in which kind of religiousness the former tone of love, joy, sense of adoption, praise, had evaporated, leaving their souls dry, earthly (comp.
