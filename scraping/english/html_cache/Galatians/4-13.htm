This phrase suggests that his initial visit to the Galatians was unplanned, possibly due to a health issue that required him to stay in the region. The nature of the illness is not specified, but it highlights Paul's vulnerability and humanity. This aligns with <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7-10</a>, where Paul speaks of a "thorn in the flesh," which some scholars suggest could be a chronic ailment. The mention of illness also underscores the providence of God, using Paul's weakness to further the spread of the Gospel.<p><b>that I first preached the gospel to you.</b><br>Paul's preaching to the Galatians marks the beginning of their exposure to the Christian message. The phrase indicates that despite his illness, Paul was committed to his mission of spreading the Gospel. This reflects the urgency and importance of his message, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>, where Paul declares he is not ashamed of the Gospel. The Galatians' initial reception of the Gospel is significant, as it laid the foundation for the church in that region.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> is the common word for "being sick," as <a href="/luke/4-40.htm">Luke 4:40</a>; <a href="/luke/7-10.htm">Luke 7:10</a>; <a href="/john/11-3.htm">John 11:3</a>, etc. It is possible that the apostle meant to say that the Galatians might not unnaturally have thought themselves treated slightingly in that his remaining among them so long was owing to illness and not to his own choice; but that yet, for all that, they had shown themselves most eager in welcoming their involuntary visitor. The words, however, do not require to be thus construed, and in all probability intend no more than to bring back to their remembrance the disorder under which he was then suffering. The illness would seem to have been of a nature to make his personal appearance in some way unsightly, and even repulsive; for the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, spat out, of the next verse suggests even the latter idea. Evidently this disorder, as also the one noted in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7, 8</a>, did not disqualify him for ministerial work altogether. He adverts to the circumstance, as making it yet more remarkable and more grateful to his feelings, that, notwithstanding the disagreeable aspect which in some way his disorder presented to those about him, they had cherished his presence among them with so much kindness as they did and also with such reverential respect. How it was that his illness brought about this protracted stay, whether it was that he fell ill while journeying through the country so as to be unable to pursue his way to his ulterior destination, or whether the remarkable healthiness of the climate either first attracted him thither or detained him there for convalescence (see Bishop Lightfoot, 'Galatians,' p. 10, note 2, for the character of the climate at Angora, the ancient Ancyra), it is impossible for us to determine. It is noticeable that St. Chrysostom's comments on the passage appear to show that he considered the apostle to be simply stating the circumstances <span class="accented">under which</span> and not those <span class="accented">in consequence of which</span> he preached the gospel to them; and so also OEcumenius and Theophylact paraphrase <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, suggesting the conjecture that they and St. Chrysostom understood the words as equivalent to "during a period of infirmity of the flesh." But this gives to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> with an accusative a sense which, to say the least, is not a common one. Is this illness of body to be connected with the affliction, most probably a bodily affliction, mentioned in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7, 8</a>, "the stake in the flesh"? This latter affliction has been discussed very fully by Dean Stanley and Meyer on the Corinthians, by Bishop Lightfoot in his commentary on the Galatians, and by Dr. Farrar in his ' Life of St. Paul.' It appears to have first befallen the apostle after the "revelations" accorded to him fourteen years before he wrote his Second Epistle to the Corinthians, which he is supposed to have done in the autumn of A.D. . This would bring us back to about A.D. . The apostle's first visit to Galatia, according to Bishop Lightfoot, p. 22, took place about A.D. . When we consider that no doubt many of those wearing labours and hardships, interspersed with frequent suffering of gross personal outrage, recounted in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-27</a>, had been undergone in the eight first of those fourteen years (the stoning at Lystra certainly had), it must seem very precarious to conjecture that the malady here referred to was a recurrence of just that particular disorder experienced eight years before. How many other ailments might not the apostle have been subject to, amid the cruel allotment of suffering and hardship which prevailingly marked his course! It is quite as probable, to say the least, that he may then have been suffering in health or in limb from some assault of personal violence recently undergone. St. Luke gives no particulars whatever of this portion of St. Paul's journey, which is only just mentioned in <a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a>. The apostle visited Corinth for the first time not many months after this first sojourn in Galatia; and it is interesting to observe that he speaks of his having then ministered to them in "feebleness" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/2-3.htm">1 Corinthians 2:3</a>), in a manner strongly suggestive of bodily weakness. <span class="cmt_word">At the first</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">the first time</span> - an expression plainly implying that there had been a subsequent sojourn. Respecting this latter visit, all we know is what we have so cursorily stated in <a href="/acts/18-23.htm">Acts 18:23</a>; unless, perchance, we may be able to draw some inferences relating to it from what we read in this Epistle itself. Chronologers are pretty well agreed in placing the commencement of this third apostolical journey about three years after the commencement of the second. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/4-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">You know</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#7988;&#948;&#945;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Oidate)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it was because of</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(di&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">an illness</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#963;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(astheneian)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_769.htm">Strong's 769: </a> </span><span class="str2">From asthenes; feebleness; by implication, malady; morally, frailty.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[that] I first preached the gospel</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8016;&#951;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#951;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eu&#275;ngelisam&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2097.htm">Strong's 2097: </a> </span><span class="str2">From eu and aggelos; to announce good news especially the gospel.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to you.</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
