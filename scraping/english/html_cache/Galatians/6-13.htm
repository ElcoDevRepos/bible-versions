In the context of Galatians, Paul addresses the Judaizers, who insisted that Gentile converts must adhere to Jewish law, including circumcision. Historically, the Jewish law, or Torah, was given to the Israelites as a covenant with God, but it was impossible to keep perfectly. Paul points out that even those who are circumcised, symbolizing their commitment to the law, fail to uphold it entirely. This echoes Jesus' criticism of the Pharisees in <a href="/matthew/23-3.htm">Matthew 23:3</a>, where He condemns them for not practicing what they preach. The inability to keep the law underscores the need for grace and faith in Christ, as Paul argues throughout Galatians.<p><b>yet they want you to be circumcised</b><br>The Judaizers' insistence on circumcision for Gentile believers was not merely a cultural or traditional preference but a theological imposition. Circumcision was a sign of the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>), but in the New Covenant, Paul teaches that faith in Christ, not adherence to the law, is what justifies a person (<a href="/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>). The pressure to conform to this ritual reflects a broader struggle in the early church between Jewish and Gentile believers, as seen in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a> during the Jerusalem Council. This insistence on circumcision was a way to maintain control and assert superiority, rather than a genuine concern for spiritual well-being.<p><b>that they may boast in your flesh</b><br>The phrase "boast in your flesh" indicates a superficial and prideful motivation behind the Judaizers' demands. Their focus was on outward appearances and human achievements rather than inward transformation and spiritual truth. This boasting is contrasted with Paul's teaching in <a href="/galatians/6-14.htm">Galatians 6:14</a>, where he declares that his only boast is in the cross of Christ. The emphasis on "flesh" also connects to Paul's broader theme in Galatians of contrasting the works of the flesh with the fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-23</a>). The Judaizers' desire to boast in the flesh of others reveals their misunderstanding of the gospel, which calls for a new creation in Christ (<a href="/galatians/6-15.htm">Galatians 6:15</a>), not adherence to external rituals.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, addressing issues of legalism and the true essence of the Gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_galatian_churches.htm">The Galatian Churches</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, who were being influenced by Judaizers to adopt Jewish customs, including circumcision, as necessary for salvation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judaizers.htm">Judaizers</a></b><br>A group within the early church advocating for the necessity of following Jewish law, including circumcision, for Gentile converts.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/circumcision.htm">Circumcision</a></b><br>A physical act and Jewish custom that was being wrongly emphasized as necessary for salvation by the Judaizers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cross_of_christ.htm">The Cross of Christ</a></b><br>Central to Paul's message, representing the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice for salvation, apart from the law.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_legalism.htm">The Danger of Legalism</a></b><br>Legalism can distort the Gospel by adding human requirements to God's grace.

"For;" pointing back to the words," only that," "for no other reason than that," of the previous verse. The apostle means, it is from no zeal for the Law itself that they do what they do, for they are at no pains to keep the Law; but only with the object of currying favour with the Jews. The present participle <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> is the reading more generally accepted, though the perfect <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> has a competing amount of documentary authentication. The perfect is so much the easier reading to understand ("not even those who have actually been circumcised") as to be much more likely to be a correction displacing <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> than the converse hypothesis of the latter being a correction of the other borrowed from ver. 3. "They who are being circumcised" may be understood of a party, <span class="accented">including those who first set the movement ageing</span>, who were one after another undergoing the rite. Another turn is given to this participial phrase, as meaning "who are eager for circumcision," "who are all for being circumcised, the circumcision party." Bishop Lightfoot is in favour of this view, referring to "the apt quotation" from an apocryphal book, in which the phrase appears used in this very sense (see his note). It is a sense grammatically difficult to sustain from the usage of the New Testament; for <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="/galatians/1-23.htm">Galatians 1:23</a>, which has been cited on its behalf, does not bear it out. But the passion of scorn with which the apostle writes make the supposed strain upon strict grammatical propriety not altogether improbable. "Themselves;" this is inserted with allusion to the zeal shown by those men, both the first promoters and those drawn in by them, in urging upon <span class="accented">others</span> the observance, not indeed of the whole Law, but of certain of its prescriptions. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> is used similarly in <a href="/romans/2-26.htm">Romans 2:26</a>; <a href="/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24</a>. The sense seems founded upon the notion of watching the Law to see what it requires, as one is endeavouring to carry it out. The article is wanting before <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, though specifically denoting the Law of Moses, as in <a href="/romans/2-25.htm">Romans 2:25, 27</a>, and often. <span class="cmt_word">But desire to have</span> <span class="cmt_word">you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">but they desire you to receive circumcision</span>, <span class="accented">that in your flesh they may have whereof to glory.</span> The conjunction <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span> is used in its proper original sense, "instead of that." All that they want is that in their intercourse with the Jews they may have your circumcision to refer to as evidence of the high respect which they and you as influenced by them have for the Law. "See! so far from trampling upon the Law, we and these our brethren too are adopting the very badge of the servants of the Law." The word "flesh" is in this clause used in its strictly literal signification. The account which the apostle here gives of the motives actuating this particular section of Judaizing reactionaries was no doubt grounded on specific information which he had just received. But such information, both in respect to its general probability and to its grave importance, was doubtless corroborated to his own mind by large experience which he had had elsewhere among the Gentile Churches of the behaviour of unsteady and imperfectly instructed Gentile converts. In almost every important place where Gentiles were won to the faith, there were previously existing communities of Jews (<a href="/acts/15-21.htm">Acts 15:21</a>); and contact with these must have given rise to an endless diversity of relations both of attraction and of repulsion. Everywhere, from the very first, the contact of Christianity with Judaism gave birth to varying phases of Judaico-Christian-ism such as afterwards developed into monstrous forms of error. It was no new thing with the apostle that he should find himself called upon to check, on the part of weak or insincere brethren, a tendency to draw towards Judaism at the cost of not merely unseemly but even fundamentally fatal compliances. The peril was always very near, and had to be constantly watched and guarded against. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/6-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
