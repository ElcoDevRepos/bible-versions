The "blessing" refers to the spiritual benefits and joy they experienced. This question implies a change in their attitude, possibly due to the influence of false teachers. In the broader context of Galatians, Paul is concerned about the Galatians turning away from the true Gospel to a legalistic approach. This phrase echoes the theme of <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6</a>, where Paul expresses astonishment at their quick desertion of the Gospel.<p><b>For I can testify that, if it were possible,</b><br>Paul emphasizes his personal knowledge and experience with the Galatians. His use of "testify" suggests a deep, personal relationship and a firsthand understanding of their previous devotion. This phrase underscores the sincerity and intensity of their past commitment to him and the Gospel message. It also highlights Paul's role as an apostle and his authority to speak on such matters.<p><b>you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.</b><br>This hyperbolic expression illustrates the depth of the Galatians' previous love and dedication to Paul. It suggests a willingness to make great personal sacrifices for him, indicating the strong bond they once shared. Some scholars suggest this may hint at a physical ailment Paul suffered, possibly related to his eyes, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-11.htm">Galatians 6:11</a> where he mentions writing with large letters. This phrase also reflects the cultural context of the time, where expressions of loyalty and sacrifice were often conveyed through vivid imagery.

The inference which has been drawn from this passage, that St. Paul suffered from an affection of the eyes, hardly seems to hold good. The "eyes" may be mentioned only as something peculiarly dear and precious. Comp. the Old Testament phrase, "to keep as the apple of an eye" (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-10.htm" title="He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/17-8.htm" title="Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of your wings,">Psalm 17:8</a>; <a href="/proverbs/7-2.htm" title="Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of your eye.">Proverbs 7:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where is then</span> (or, <span class="accented">what was then</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the blessedness ye spake of?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> [Receptus <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>;); <span class="accented">where</span>, <span class="accented">then</span>, <span class="accented">is that gratulation of yourselves</span> (or, <span class="accented">of yours</span>)?

This latter reading may be taken to mean: either, "Of what sort, then, was that gratulation of yours? "that is, what was its value in respect to the depth of conviction on which it was founded? - <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> being <span class="accented">qualis</span>, as <a href="/luke/10-22.htm">Luke 10:22</a>; <a href="/luke/19-3.htm">Luke 19:3</a>, etc., which would bring us to much the same result as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: or, "How great, then, was that gratulation of yours!" But the "then" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>) comes in lamely; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("at that time") would have been more in place; and, further, it is questionable whether the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> of admiration ever occurs without the wonder taking a tinge of inquiry, as, for example, <a href="/mark/6-2.htm">Mark 6:2</a>; <a href="/luke/5-21.htm">Luke 5:21</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>, which would be out of place here. With the more approved reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, the apostle asks, "What is, then, become of that gratulation of yourselves?" The "then" recites the fact, implied in the description given of their former behaviour, that they did once felicitate themselves on the apostle's having brought them the gospel. This is more directly brought into view in the words which follow. As the verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> means "pronounce happy," as <a href="/luke/1-48.htm">Luke 1:48</a> and <a href="/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>, the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> denotes "pronouncing one to be happy;" as <a href="/romans/4-6.htm">Romans 4:6, 9</a>. So Clement of Rome ('Ad Cor.,' 50), who weaves the apostle's words into his own sentence with the same meaning. This felicitation must have been pronounced by the Galatians upon themselves, not upon the apostle; the apostle would have spoken of himself on the object of their <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, not of their <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">For I bear</span> <span class="cmt_word">you record</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">for I bear you witness</span>; testify on your behalf; the phrase always denoting commendation (<a href="/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-13.htm">Colossians 4:13</a>).

The verb denotes a deliberate, almost solemn, averment. <span class="cmt_word">That, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and</span> <span class="cmt_word">have given them to me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>,); <span class="accented">that</span>, <span class="accented">if possible</span>, <span class="accented">ye had spirted out your eyes to give them to me.</span> The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, occurs in the Septuagint of <a href="/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/11-2.htm">1 Samuel 11:2</a>, Hebrew, "bore out the eyes." The omission of the <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;</span>, which is rejected by recent editors, perhaps intimates the certainty and readiness with which they would have done it; but the particle occurs very sparingly in the New Testament as compared with classical Greek. There seems something strange in the specification of this particular form of evidencing zealous attachment. If there had otherwise appeared any question of making gifts, the apostle might have been construed to mean, "Ye were ready to give me anything, your very eyes even;" but this is not the case. Possibly the particular mention of "the Churches of Galatia" in <a href="/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1</a> may have been occasioned by their having shown an especial readiness, even at the apostle's second sojourn among them, to take part in the collection referred to; or by their having been the first Churches he came to in that particular tour, the directions which he gave to them being given also to all the Churches he went on to visit; but on this point see Introd. p. 16. The tone of <a href="/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6-10</a> does not betoken especial open-handedness on their part, unless, perhaps, the words, "let us not grow weary," hint at a liberality once displayed but now declined from. On the whole, this specification of "eyes" seems rather to point to there having been something amiss with the apostle's own eyes, either from ophthalmia or as the effect of personal outrage perpetrated upon him. It is especially deserving of notice how the apostle, in the two clauses of this verse, links together their joy in their newly found Christian blessedness with their grateful love to himself; the latter fact is adduced as proof of the former. Their gospel happiness, he feels, was indissolubly woven in with their attachment to him: if they let go their joy in Christ Jesus, as, apart from any qualification to be acquired by observances of the Law of Moses, their all-sufficient righteousness, they must also of necessity become estranged from him, who was nothing if not the exponent and herald to them of that happiness. This consideration is of great moment for the right understanding of the next verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/4-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">What</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(pou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4226.htm">Strong's 4226: </a> </span><span class="str2">Genitive case of an interrogative pronoun pos otherwise obsolete; as adverb of place; at what locality.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">then [has become]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
