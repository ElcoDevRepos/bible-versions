In the Greco-Roman world, a paidagogos was often a slave entrusted with the care of a child, guiding them until they reached maturity. This metaphor illustrates the role of the Mosaic Law in guiding the Israelites. The law served as a moral and ethical guide, highlighting sin and the need for a savior. It was not the final solution but a temporary measure until the coming of Christ. This concept is echoed in <a href="/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7</a>, where Paul explains that the law makes people aware of sin.<p><b>to lead us to Christ</b><br>The purpose of the law was to prepare the way for Christ, pointing to the need for redemption and a savior. The law's requirements and sacrifices foreshadowed the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus. In the Old Testament, the sacrificial system and the prophecies about the Messiah (such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>) pointed forward to Christ's redemptive work. The law's inability to provide complete righteousness highlighted the necessity of Christ's atoning sacrifice, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1-4</a>, which discusses the law as a shadow of the good things to come.<p><b>that we might be justified by faith</b><br>Justification by faith is a central tenet of Christian doctrine, emphasizing that righteousness before God is not achieved through works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ. This principle is rooted in the Abrahamic covenant, where Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>). Paul reiterates this in <a href="/romans/3-28.htm">Romans 3:28</a>, stating that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. This shift from law to faith marks the transition from the old covenant to the new covenant, where believers are declared righteous through their faith in Christ's finished work on the cross.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Galatians, addressing the churches in Galatia about the role of the Law and faith in Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galatia.htm">Galatia</a></b><br>A region in modern-day Turkey where the recipients of the letter were located.

The Greek word is that from which is derived the English "pedagogue." Originally it meant the slave who was placed in charge of a child, and whose duty it was to conduct it to school. The idea is that of moral rather than of intellectual discipline. The care of the "pedagogue" ceased where that of the school-master began, but it was he who had more especially to form the character of the child. Horace notes as a peculiar advantage of his own that his father himself had taken the place of pedagogue to him (<span class= "ital">Sat.</span> i. 6, 81, 82).<p><span class= "bld">To bring us unto Christ.</span>--The words "to bring us," it will be seen, are supplied. They may be retained, provided that the metaphor is not pressed to the extent of supposing that Christ represents the schoolmaster proper to whom the child is led by the pedagogue slave. The work of Christ as a <span class= "ital">Teacher</span> is not what the Apostle has in mind. It is rather a higher kind of guardianship, which is to succeed that of the Law, and to which the Law <span class= "ital">hands over</span> its pupil. Once brought within the guardianship of Christ, and so made a member of the Messianic kingdom, the Christian is <span class= "ital">justified by faith,</span> he receives an amnesty for his past sins, and is accounted righteous before God.

The Law hath done with us (says the apostle) the work of a child's caretaker (<span class="accented">paedagogus</span>), with an eye to Christ, to whom we have now been banded over. (For the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, see note on ver. 23.) <span class="accented">Paedagogus</span> has no equivalent in the English language; "pedagogue," "schoolmaster," "tutor," "guardian," are all inadequate, covering each one an area of thought more or less quite different. "Tutor," as the masculine of "governess," comes perhaps nearest; but a tutor to a gentleman's children is generally an educated man, and often of like rank in life with those he is with; whereas a <span class="accented">paedagogus</span> was usually a slave - an element of thought probably very near to the apostle's consciousness in his present use of the term. In illustration of this and other points bearing upon this subject, the reader will be interested by a passage cited by Bishop Lightfoot out of Plato's 'Lysis' (p. 208, C). Socrates is questioning a young friend. "' They let you have your own ruling of yourself: or do they <span class="accented">not</span> trust you with this, either?' 'Trust me with it, indeed!' he said. 'But as to this, who has the ruling of you?' 'This man here,' he said, 'a <span class="accented">tutor.</span> 'Being a slave, eh?' 'But what of that?' said he; 'yes; only, a slave of our own.' 'An awfully strange thing this,' I said, 'that you, freeman that you are, should be under the ruling of a slave. But further, what does this tutor of yours, as your ruler, do with you?' 'He takes me,' said he, 'to a teacher's house, of course.' 'Do they rule you too, the teachers?' ' Certainly, of course.' 'A mighty number it seems of masters and rulers does your father think proper to set over you.'" Teaching, except possibly of the very first rudiments, was not the <span class="accented">padagogus's</span> business, but only the general care and superintendence of his charge - taking him to and back from his teachers' houses or the schools of physical training, looking after him in his play hours, and the like. In applying to the Law the figure of a <span class="accented">paedagogus</span>, the features which the apostle had in view were probably these: the childhood or non-age of those under its tutelage; their withdrawal from free parental intercourse; their degraded condition probably as being under servile management; the exercise over dram of unsympathizing hardness (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>, "Though ye have ten thousand <span class="accented">tutors</span> in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers"); coercive discipline; the rudimentary character of their instruction (this particular, however, is likewise of questionable application); the temporary and purely provisional nature of the condition under which they were placed; its termination in the full enjoyment of freedom and of participation in their father's inheritance. The clause, "unto Christ," can hardly mean "to bring us to Christ," tempting as this interpretation may seem, in view of the verbal constituent (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span>)" bring" in <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, and of the fact that it was one part of the duty of the child's keeper to take him to his school. For there are the following objections to taking it so: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The child-keeper's relation to his charge did not end with his taking him to school, but continued on throughout his non-age; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the function of Christ is not viewed here as instruction; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> if this construction had been in the apostle's view, he would have written <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, as in the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> ("to the teacher's house") of the passage above cited from Plato. We must, therefore, understand the preposition as in the preceding verse, "with a view to." The next clause is the explanation. <span class="cmt_word">That we might be justified by faith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">in order that by faith we might get justified.</span> This clause is the most important part of the sentence. Not from the Law was to come righteousness; the Law was no more than introductory or preparatory; righteousness (once more the apostle reminds the Galatians) was to come to us as a free gift through Christ, upon simply our faith, the Law having now nothing to do with us. Hence the emphatic position of the words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>. The apostle does not, in the present connection, make it his business to explain in what way the Law was preparatory, which he does in <a href="/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>; his purpose at present is to insist upon its purely provisional character. What we have here is a description of the relation of the Law to God's people viewed collectively; but we can hardly fail to be reminded, that this experience of the collective people of God very commonly finds its counterpart in respect to the ethical bearing of the Law in the experience of each individual believer. Only, we have still to bear in mind that the apostle is thinking of the Law just now more in its ceremonial aspect than its ethical. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/galatians/3-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8037;&#963;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;ste)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5620.htm">Strong's 5620: </a> </span><span class="str2">So that, therefore, so then, so as to.
