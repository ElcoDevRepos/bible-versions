The investigation process reflects the administrative practices of the time, where accusations were thoroughly examined before any action was taken. This mirrors the biblical principle of establishing truth through multiple witnesses (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). The careful verification process underscores the seriousness of the conspiracy against King Xerxes and the integrity of Mordecai, who reported it.<p><b>both officials were hanged on the gallows</b><br>The execution of the officials, Bigthana and Teresh, who plotted against the king, demonstrates the severe consequences of treason in ancient Persia. The term "gallows" may refer to a wooden structure used for hanging or impalement, a common method of execution in the ancient Near East. This act of justice serves as a reminder of the divine protection over the king and the unfolding of God's providential plan, as Mordecai's loyalty is later rewarded, playing a crucial role in the deliverance of the Jewish people.<p><b>And all this was recorded in the Book of the Chronicles in the presence of the king</b><br>The recording of events in the royal chronicles signifies the importance of documentation in the Persian court. These records were official documents that preserved significant occurrences and decisions. This practice ensured that Mordecai's good deed was not forgotten, setting the stage for future developments in the narrative. The mention of the king's presence emphasizes the authenticity and authority of the record. This act of recording parallels the biblical theme of God's remembrance of righteous deeds (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>) and foreshadows the eventual recognition and elevation of Mordecai, which is pivotal in the story of Esther.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>A Jew living in Susa, the capital of Persia, who uncovers a plot against King Xerxes.
