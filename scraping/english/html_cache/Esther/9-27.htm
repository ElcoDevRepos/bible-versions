The binding nature of this decision reflects the seriousness with which they approached the commemoration of their deliverance. In biblical context, binding agreements were often made before God, indicating a solemn vow (see <a href="/nehemiah/10-29.htm">Nehemiah 10:29</a>). This act of binding themselves can be seen as a covenantal action, reminiscent of other covenants in the Old Testament, such as those made by the Israelites at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3-8</a>).<p><b>that they and their descendants</b><br>The inclusion of descendants emphasizes the perpetuity of the observance. It underscores the importance of passing down faith and traditions through generations, a common theme in Jewish culture (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>). This ensures that the memory of God's deliverance is not forgotten and that future generations understand their identity and history.<p><b>and all who join them</b><br>This phrase opens the observance to proselytes and those who align themselves with the Jewish people. It reflects the inclusive nature of the Jewish community, allowing others to partake in their religious and cultural practices. This inclusivity can be seen in other parts of Scripture, such as the acceptance of Ruth, a Moabite, into the Jewish community (<a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16-17</a>).<p><b>should not fail to celebrate these two days</b><br>The emphasis on not failing to celebrate indicates the importance of consistency and faithfulness in religious observance. The two days refer to the 14th and 15th of Adar, as established earlier in the chapter. This regular celebration serves as a reminder of God's providence and protection, similar to other feasts like Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>).<p><b>at the appointed time each and every year</b><br>The phrase underscores the importance of timing in religious observance. The appointed time is crucial, as it aligns with the historical events being commemorated. This mirrors other biblical feasts that are celebrated at specific times, such as the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34</a>). The annual repetition ensures that the story of Esther and the deliverance of the Jews remains a living tradition.<p><b>according to their regulation</b><br>This indicates that there were specific guidelines or rules established for the observance of Purim. These regulations would have included the reading of the Megillah (Book of Esther), feasting, and giving gifts to the poor. The establishment of regulations ensures uniformity and order in worship, akin to the detailed instructions given for other Jewish feasts (Leviticus 23).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jews.htm">Jews</a></b><br>The Jewish people who were living in the Persian Empire during the time of Esther.
