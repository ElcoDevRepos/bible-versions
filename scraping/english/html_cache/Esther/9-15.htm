This timing is significant as it marks the celebration of Purim, a festival commemorating the deliverance of the Jewish people from Haman's plot. The fourteenth day is the day after the Jews defended themselves against their enemies, as decreed by King Ahasuerus, following the intervention of Queen Esther.<p><b>the Jews in Susa came together again</b><br>Susa, the capital of the Persian Empire, was a central location for the events of the Book of Esther. The gathering of the Jews signifies unity and collective action in the face of adversity. This unity is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where the people of Israel often come together to seek God's deliverance, as seen in the stories of Joshua and the Judges.<p><b>and put to death three hundred men there</b><br>This action was part of the Jews' defense against those who sought to destroy them, as permitted by the king's edict. The number 300 may symbolize completeness or divine intervention, as seen in other biblical narratives like Gideon's victory over the Midianites with 300 men (Judges 7). The execution of justice here reflects the biblical principle of retributive justice, where the wicked face consequences for their actions.<p><b>but they did not lay a hand on the plunder</b><br>Refraining from taking plunder demonstrates the Jews' focus on survival and justice rather than material gain. This restraint echoes the command given to Saul in <a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>, where he was instructed to destroy the Amalekites and not take plunder, highlighting obedience to God's will over personal enrichment. It also underscores the moral high ground the Jews maintained, distinguishing their actions from those of their enemies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>The Jewish queen of Persia who played a crucial role in saving her people from destruction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>Esther's cousin and guardian, who became a prominent leader among the Jews and was instrumental in the events leading to their deliverance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>The antagonist who plotted to annihilate the Jews, whose downfall led to the Jews' victory.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/susa.htm">Susa</a></b><br>The capital city of the Persian Empire, where the events of Esther primarily take place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews_in_susa.htm">The Jews in Susa</a></b><br>The Jewish community residing in the capital, who defended themselves against their enemies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_providence_and_protection.htm">Divine Providence and Protection</a></b><br>The events in <a href="/esther/9-15.htm">Esther 9:15</a> highlight God's providential care and protection over His people, even in foreign lands and under oppressive regimes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_restraint.htm">Obedience and Restraint</a></b><br>The Jews' decision not to take plunder demonstrates obedience to God's principles and a focus on justice rather than material gain.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_and_unity.htm">Courage and Unity</a></b><br>The gathering of the Jews in Susa to defend themselves shows the importance of courage and unity in the face of adversity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/historical_continuity.htm">Historical Continuity</a></b><br>The Jews' actions in Esther reflect a continuation of God's commands throughout their history, emphasizing the importance of faithfulness to God's word.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Esther_9_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Esther 9:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Esther_9_15_Jews_actions_show_God_s_justice.htm">How does Esther 9:15 demonstrate God's justice through the Jews' actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_self-defense_from_Esther_9_15.htm">What lessons on self-defense can Christians learn from Esther 9:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Esther_9_15_Romans_12_19_vengeance_link.htm">How does Esther 9:15 connect to Romans 12:19 about vengeance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Esther_9_15_inspire_courage.htm">In what ways can Esther 9:15 inspire courage in facing persecution today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Esther_9_15_Unity_s_importance.htm">How does Esther 9:15 illustrate the importance of unity among God's people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_extra_day_for_Susa_Jews_defense.htm">Why did the Jews in Susa need an additional day to defend themselves in Esther 9:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Esther_9_15_and_divine_justice.htm">How does Esther 9:15 align with the concept of divine justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Esther_9_15_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in Esther 9:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_esther_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Esther 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_feast_of_purim.htm">What is the Feast of Purim?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_allow_more_killing_in_esther_9_13-15.htm">Esther 9:13&#8211;15: Why would an additional day of killing be sanctioned, and does this align with other biblical teachings on mercy and restraint?
