In the Persian court, the king's word was law, and his commands were executed promptly. This urgency may also indicate the king's curiosity or eagerness to please Esther, whom he favored. The king's authority and the swift execution of his orders are consistent with the absolute power Persian monarchs wielded, as seen in other parts of the Book of Esther and historical records of Persian rule.<p><b>&#8220;and bring Haman,</b><br>Haman, the antagonist in the story, holds the position of prime minister, second only to the king. His inclusion in the banquet is significant, as it sets the stage for the unfolding of Esther's plan to reveal his plot against the Jews. Haman's presence is crucial for the narrative's development, highlighting the tension between him and Esther. This moment foreshadows the eventual downfall of Haman, a theme of divine justice and reversal found throughout the book.<p><b>so we can do as Esther has requested.&#8221;</b><br>Esther's request to host a banquet is part of her strategic plan to save her people. Her approach demonstrates wisdom and patience, as she carefully sets the stage to reveal Haman's plot. This phrase underscores Esther's influence and the favor she has found with the king, which is pivotal for the deliverance of the Jewish people. Esther's actions can be seen as a type of intercession, drawing parallels to the mediating role of Christ.<p><b>So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</b><br>The banquet is a central event in the narrative, symbolizing Esther's courage and the unfolding of God's providence. Banquets were significant in Persian culture, often used for political and social purposes. Esther's preparation of the banquet shows her active role in God's plan, reflecting themes of divine sovereignty and human responsibility. The setting of the banquet also connects to other biblical feasts, which often serve as moments of revelation and turning points in God's redemptive history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who reigned over 127 provinces from India to Cush.

God&#8217;s providence often unfolds quickly when His moment arrives (<a href="/genesis/41-32.htm">Genesis 41:32</a>; <a href="/isaiah/46-11.htm">Isaiah 46:11</a>).<p>- Xerxes&#8217; haste reveals a heart already inclined toward Esther&#8212;reminding us that &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is a stream of water in the hand of the LORD; He directs it wherever He pleases&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>- By acting at once, the king unwittingly accelerates the very plan God will use to save His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and bring Haman</b><p>- Summoning Haman alone elevates him in appearance, yet sets him on a path toward judgment. The wicked often walk boldly into their own snare (<a href="/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a>; <a href="/esther/7-10.htm">Esther 7:10</a>).<p>- God positions every character&#8212;Esther, Xerxes, and even Haman&#8212;for His redemptive purposes (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p>- For believers, this line affirms that no enemy can maneuver outside the boundaries of God&#8217;s sovereign design.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so we can do as Esther has requested.</b><p>- The king pledges full cooperation before even hearing the specifics. Esther&#8217;s prior fasting and courage meet a suddenly pliable monarch&#8212;clear evidence of divine favor (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>; 5:2).<p>- God grants influence to His servants when they seek Him first (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<p>- The verse also highlights Esther&#8217;s humility; she makes a request, not a demand, and God honors that posture (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</b><p>- Esther&#8217;s advance preparation signals faith: she readied the banquet before receiving the king&#8217;s permission, anticipating God&#8217;s answer (<a href="/mark/11-24.htm">Mark 11:24</a>).<p>- Banquets in Scripture often serve as turning points&#8212;victory meals set against looming threats (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>).<p>- While Haman enjoys favored status for the moment, &#8220;Pride goes before destruction&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>); the very table of honor will become the scene of his unraveling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/5-5.htm">Esther 5:5</a> captures a moment of swift royal action, divinely steered circumstances, and faithful preparation. Xerxes&#8217; haste, Haman&#8217;s invitation, the king&#8217;s readiness to honor Esther, and the ensuing banquet together reveal God&#8217;s unseen hand moving history toward deliverance. The verse reassures believers that when we act in obedient faith, God orchestrates even the hearts of rulers&#8212;and the schemes of the wicked&#8212;to fulfill His gracious purposes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/5-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Hurry,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#183;ha&#774;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4116.htm">Strong's 4116: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be liquid, flow easily, to hurry, promptly</span><br /><br /><span class="word">commanded</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
