The Jews' assembly for defense was a response to the edict issued by King Ahasuerus, allowing them to protect themselves against their enemies (<a href="/esther/8-11.htm">Esther 8:11</a>). This self-defense was not an act of aggression but a necessary measure for survival, reflecting the biblical principle of self-preservation seen in other scriptures, such as Nehemiah's defense of Jerusalem (<a href="/nehemiah/4-13.htm">Nehemiah 4:13-14</a>).<p><b>and rid themselves of their enemies.</b><br>The Jews' actions were a fulfillment of the decree that permitted them to destroy those who sought their harm (<a href="/esther/8-11.htm">Esther 8:11</a>). This reflects the ongoing theme of divine justice and protection for God's people, reminiscent of the deliverance narratives in the Old Testament, such as the Exodus from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>). The term "enemies" underscores the persistent hostility faced by the Jewish people, a theme that runs throughout biblical history.<p><b>They killed 75,000 who hated them,</b><br>The large number of those killed indicates the significant threat against the Jewish people. This event is a historical example of the enmity between the descendants of Esau (Amalekites) and Jacob (Israelites), as seen in the conflict with Haman, an Agagite (<a href="/esther/3.htm">Esther 3:1</a>). The number 75,000, while literal, also symbolizes the completeness of the victory God granted His people, similar to other instances where God delivered Israel from their foes (<a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10-11</a>).<p><b>but they did not lay a hand on the plunder.</b><br>This restraint from taking plunder is significant, as it mirrors the command given to King Saul in <a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>, where he was instructed to destroy the Amalekites and take no spoils. The Jews' decision to refrain from plundering demonstrates their focus on justice rather than material gain, aligning with the biblical principle of righteousness over greed (<a href="/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>). This act of self-control also serves as a type of Christ, who, though having all authority, chose humility and self-sacrifice (<a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>The Jewish people living in the provinces of King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I) who were under threat due to Haman's decree.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus</a></b><br>The Persian king who reigned over a vast empire and whose decree initially threatened the Jews.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_provinces.htm">The Provinces</a></b><br>The various regions under the rule of King Ahasuerus where the Jews resided and defended themselves.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_the_jews.htm">Enemies of the Jews</a></b><br>Those who sought to harm the Jewish people, empowered by Haman's initial decree.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly.htm">The Assembly</a></b><br>The gathering of the Jews to defend themselves, which was a collective act of self-preservation and divine deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_providence_and_protection.htm">Divine Providence and Protection</a></b><br>The Jews' victory is a testament to God's providential care and protection over His people, even in dire circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/righteous_restraint.htm">Righteous Restraint</a></b><br>The decision not to take the plunder demonstrates a commitment to righteousness and integrity, prioritizing justice over material gain.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_and_community_action.htm">Unity and Community Action</a></b><br>The collective assembly of the Jews highlights the importance of unity and community action in facing challenges and threats.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The Jews' defense was an act of faith, trusting in God's deliverance while actively participating in their own protection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/historical_continuity_of_god's_faithfulness.htm">Historical Continuity of God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>This event is part of the larger account of God's faithfulness to Israel, encouraging believers to trust in God's unchanging nature.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Esther_9_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Esther 9:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Esther_9_16_God_s_protection_shown.htm">How does Esther 9:16 demonstrate God's protection over His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_justice_from_Esther_9_16.htm">What lessons on justice can we learn from Esther 9:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Esther_9_16_and_Romans_12_19_link.htm">How does Esther 9:16 connect to Romans 12:19 about vengeance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Esther_9_16_s_victory_today.htm">How can we apply Esther 9:16's message of victory in our lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Faith_s_role_in_Esther_9_16_events.htm">What role does faith play in the events described in Esther 9:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Jews_kill_75_000_in_Esther_9_16.htm">Why did the Jews kill 75,000 people in Esther 9:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Esther_9_16_and_a_loving_God.htm">How does Esther 9:16 align with the concept of a loving God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Esther_9_16_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in Esther 9:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_esther_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Esther 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/are_there_records_of_75,000_deaths.htm">Esther 9:16: Are there historical or archaeological records confirming the death of 75,000 enemies throughout the Persian Empire in such a short time?

On the whole history, Bishop Wordsworth well remarks, "It shows the recklessness of human life, even of their own subjects, which then prevailed among the sovereigns of the most celebrated nations of the Eastern world; and it displays the ruinous consequences which would have resulted to human civilisation if Ahasuerus (Xerxes) had been victorious at Salamis. If Greece had not triumphed in that struggle with Asia, Oriental ruthlessness and Oriental polygamy might have become dominant in the West, and greater difficulties would have obstructed the progress of civilisation and Christianity. The Book of Esther reveals to us that the hand of God wrought for the deliverance of mankind at the Straits of Salamis, and on the banks of the Asopus at Plataea, as well as for the preservation of the Jews in the provinces of Persia."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> did as the edict directed them (<a href="/esther/8-11.htm">Esther 8:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And had rest from their enemies</span>.

The smaller number is more in harmony with the 500 killed at Susa than the larger one. FESTIVAL HELD, AND FEAST OF PURIM INSTITUTED (<a href="/esther/9-17.htm">Esther 9:17-32</a>). A natural instinct led the Jews, so soon as their triumph was accomplished, to indulge themselves in a day of rest and rejoicing (ver. 17). After toil there is need of repose; and escape from a great danger is followed, almost of necessity, by "gladness." The writer of the Book of Esther, practising his usual reticence, says nothing of the character of the "gladness;" but we can scarcely be wrong in believing it to have been, in the main, religious, and to have included gratitude to God for their deliverance, the ascription of praise to his name, and an outpouring of the heart before him in earnest and prolonged thanksgiving. The circumstances of the struggle caused a difference, with regard to the date of the day of rejoicing, between the Jews of the capital and those of the provinces. The metropolitical Jews had two days of struggle, and could not "rest" until the third day, which was the 15th of Adar (ver. 18); the provincial Jews began and ended their work in one day, the 13th, and so their thanksgiving-day was the 14th, and not the 15th of the month (ver. 17). The consequence was, that when Mordecai and Esther determined on commemorating the wonderful deliverance of their time by an annual festival, analogous to that of the passover, to be celebrated by all Jews everywhere throughout all future ages, some hesitation naturally arose as to the proper day to be kept holy. If the 14th were kept, the provincial Jews would be satisfied, but those of Susa would have cause of complaint; if the 15th were the day selected, the two parties would simply exchange feelings. Under these circumstances it was wisely resolved to keep both days (ver. 21). Nothing seems to have been determined as to the mode of keeping the feast, except that both days were to be "days of feasting and joy," and days upon which the richer members of the community should send "portions" and "gifts" to the poorer ones (ver. 22). The name, "feast of Purina," was at once attached to the festival, in memory of Haman's consultation of the lot, the word "Pur" meaning "lot" in Persian (ver. 24). The festival became a national institution by the general consent of the Jews everywhere (ver. 27), and has remained to the present day among the most cherished of their usages, it falls in early spring, a month before the passover, and occupies two days, which are still those fixed by Mordecai and Esther, the 14th and 15th of Adar. The day preceding the feast is observed as a fast day, in commemoration of Esther's fast before going in uninvited to the king (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/9-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The rest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
