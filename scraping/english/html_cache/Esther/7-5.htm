His reign is historically placed between 486-465 BC. The setting is the royal palace in Susa, the capital of the Persian Empire. Esther, a Jewish woman who became queen, is in a position of influence, which is significant given the patriarchal society of the time. This moment occurs during a banquet Esther has prepared, highlighting her strategic and courageous approach to addressing the threat against her people. The king's willingness to listen to Esther reflects the favor she has found in his eyes, a recurring theme in the narrative.<p><b>&#8220;Who is this, and where is the one who would devise such a scheme?&#8221;</b><br>The king's question is a direct response to Esther's revelation of a plot to annihilate her people, the Jews. This plot was orchestrated by Haman, the king's advisor, who had manipulated Xerxes into signing a decree for the destruction of the Jews. The king's inquiry shows his ignorance of the full implications of Haman's plan, as well as his immediate concern for Esther's safety. This moment is pivotal, as it sets the stage for the exposure and downfall of Haman. The language used indicates a sense of urgency and a demand for justice. This scene echoes themes of divine providence and justice found throughout the Bible, such as in the story of Joseph, where God turns intended harm into good (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>). Esther's role as an intercessor for her people can be seen as a type of Christ, who intercedes on behalf of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_xerxes.htm">King Xerxes (Ahasuerus)</a></b><br>The Persian king who reigned over 127 provinces from India to Cush.
