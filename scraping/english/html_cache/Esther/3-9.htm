It highlights the absolute power of the king in the Persian Empire, where his decisions were final and unchallengeable. This approach is seen in other biblical accounts, such as Nehemiah's request to King Artaxerxes (<a href="/nehemiah/2-5.htm">Nehemiah 2:5</a>).<p><b>let a decree be issued to destroy them</b><br>The decree refers to a legal and binding order in the Persian Empire, which was known for its extensive and efficient administrative system. The phrase "to destroy them" indicates a planned genocide against the Jewish people, reminiscent of previous threats to their existence, such as Pharaoh's decree in <a href="/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>. This reflects the recurring theme of anti-Semitism throughout history.<p><b>and I will deposit ten thousand talents of silver</b><br>Ten thousand talents of silver was an enormous sum, equivalent to hundreds of tons of silver, indicating the seriousness and scale of Haman's proposal. This financial incentive underscores the corruption and moral decay within the Persian court. The use of money to influence decisions is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in the betrayal of Jesus for thirty pieces of silver (<a href="/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a>).<p><b>into the royal treasury</b><br>The royal treasury was the central financial institution of the Persian Empire, responsible for collecting and managing the empire's wealth. This phrase suggests that Haman was attempting to bribe the king, appealing to his economic interests. The mention of the treasury also highlights the materialistic values of the empire, contrasting with the spiritual values upheld by the Jewish people.<p><b>to pay those who carry it out</b><br>This indicates that Haman planned to hire mercenaries or officials to execute the decree, reflecting the organized and systematic nature of the proposed genocide. It parallels the use of Roman soldiers in the crucifixion of Jesus, where state power was employed to carry out an unjust act. This phrase also underscores the theme of human depravity and the lengths to which individuals will go to achieve their evil purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>A high-ranking official in the Persian Empire, Haman is the antagonist in the Book of Esther.
