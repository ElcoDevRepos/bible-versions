The robe likely signifies a garment worn by the king himself, indicating a transfer of royal favor. The horse, often used in royal processions, symbolizes power and prestige. Entrusting these to a noble prince underscores the importance of the task and the honor being bestowed. This reflects the hierarchical structure of the Persian court, where only the most trusted and esteemed officials would be given such responsibilities. The robe and horse can be seen as types of Christ's righteousness and authority, which believers are clothed with and partake in through faith.<p><b>Let them array the man the king wants to honor</b><br>The act of arraying someone in royal garments is a public declaration of the king's favor. In the context of Esther, this is a pivotal moment where Mordecai, a Jew, is to be honored, highlighting the reversal of fortunes that is a recurring theme in the book. This act prefigures the ultimate honor given to Jesus Christ, who, though initially rejected, is exalted by God. It also echoes Joseph's elevation in Egypt, where he was clothed in fine linen and given authority, symbolizing God's providential care and the elevation of the humble.<p><b>and parade him on the horse through the city square</b><br>The city square was a central place of gathering and commerce, making it the ideal location for a public display of honor. This parade is not just a personal accolade but a public spectacle, ensuring that the king's favor is widely recognized. The public nature of this honor can be compared to Christ's triumphal entry into Jerusalem, where He was publicly acknowledged as King. It also serves as a foreshadowing of the ultimate public recognition of Christ's lordship at His second coming.<p><b>proclaiming before him, &#8216;This is what is done for the man whom the king is delighted to honor!&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The proclamation serves as a verbal confirmation of the honor being bestowed, ensuring that all witnesses understand the significance of the event. This mirrors the biblical principle that true honor comes from God, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>, where God honors those who honor Him. The phrase also reflects the theme of divine justice and reversal found throughout Scripture, where God exalts the humble and brings down the proud. This public declaration can be seen as a type of the ultimate vindication and honor that believers will receive from God, as promised in <a href="/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who ruled over 127 provinces from India to Cush.
