The king's gate was a place of official business and judgment, indicating Mordecai's role as a government official. This location is significant throughout the Book of Esther, as it is where Mordecai first learned of the plot against the Jews (<a href="/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19-23</a>). His return here after being honored by the king underscores his character, contrasting with Haman's pride. The king's gate also symbolizes a place of influence and decision-making, highlighting Mordecai's growing importance in the Persian Empire.<p><b>But Haman rushed home, with his head covered in grief.</b><br>Haman's reaction of rushing home with his head covered is a sign of deep shame and mourning. In ancient Near Eastern culture, covering one's head was a common expression of distress or humiliation (<a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>). This moment marks a turning point in Haman's fortunes, as his plans to destroy Mordecai and the Jews begin to unravel. The contrast between Haman's earlier pride and his current disgrace is stark, illustrating the biblical theme of the downfall of the proud (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). Haman's grief foreshadows his impending doom and serves as a reminder of the consequences of opposing God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>A Jew living in Susa, the capital of the Persian Empire, who had previously saved King Xerxes from an assassination plot.
