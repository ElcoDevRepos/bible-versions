Xerxes, also known as Ahasuerus, was the son of Darius the Great and ruled over the Persian Empire. The third year of his reign suggests a time when Xerxes was consolidating his power and establishing his authority across the vast empire. This period is significant as it precedes his famous campaign against Greece, which culminated in the battles of Thermopylae and Salamis.<p><b>Xerxes held a feast</b><br>Feasts were a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures, often used to display wealth, power, and generosity. This particular feast is notable for its grandeur and length, lasting 180 days, as described later in the chapter. Such feasts were also political tools, used to secure loyalty and demonstrate the king's ability to provide for his subjects. The opulence of the feast reflects the wealth and resources of the Persian Empire at its height.<p><b>for all his officials and servants</b><br>The inclusion of officials and servants indicates a hierarchical structure within the Persian court. Officials likely included high-ranking administrators and advisors who played crucial roles in governance. Servants, while lower in status, were essential for the functioning of the royal household. This gathering underscores the importance of maintaining a strong and loyal administrative body to support the king's rule.<p><b>The military leaders of Persia and Media were there</b><br>The presence of military leaders highlights the strategic importance of this gathering. Persia and Media were the core regions of the empire, and their military leaders were crucial for maintaining control and expanding the empire's borders. This assembly may have served as a council of war, where military strategies and campaigns were discussed. The inclusion of Media reflects the dual nature of the empire, which was a coalition of Persian and Median elements.<p><b>along with the nobles and princes of the provinces</b><br>The nobles and princes represent the regional leaders who governed the various provinces of the empire. Their presence at the feast signifies the king's need to secure the allegiance of these local rulers, who wielded significant power in their respective regions. This gathering would have been an opportunity for Xerxes to reinforce his authority and ensure the stability of his rule across the diverse and expansive empire. The mention of provinces highlights the administrative complexity of the Persian Empire, which was divided into satrapies, each governed by a satrap or provincial governor.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/x/xerxes.htm">Xerxes (Ahasuerus)</a></b><br>The king of Persia, known for his vast empire and opulent lifestyle.

At so important a gathering, the feasting was a very obvious adjunct; and besides the coming campaign, a successful war had just been concluded in Egypt, and rejoicings for the past might have mingled with high hopes for the future, when the whole strength of the empire should be put forth to crush the presumptuous foe who had dared to measure swords with the "king of kings."<p><span class= "bld">Nobles.</span>--The word in the Hebrew, <span class= "ital">partemim,</span> occurring here, in <a href="/esther/6-9.htm" title="And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man with whom the king delights to honor, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.">Esther 6:9</a>. and <a href="/daniel/1-3.htm" title="And the king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;">Daniel 1:3</a>. is a Persian word, literally meaning "first."
