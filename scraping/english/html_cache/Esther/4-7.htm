His actions and experiences are pivotal to the narrative. Mordecai's communication here is crucial as it sets the stage for Esther's intervention. The phrase indicates Mordecai's role as a witness and informant, highlighting his awareness of the political machinations against the Jews. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's people being aware and proactive in the face of adversity, as seen in the stories of Joseph and Daniel.<p><b>including the exact amount of money that Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury</b><br>Haman, an Agagite and high-ranking official, harbors deep animosity towards the Jews, particularly Mordecai. His willingness to pay a substantial sum to the royal treasury underscores the depth of his hatred and the seriousness of the threat. This financial transaction is a bribe to secure royal approval for his genocidal plan. The mention of money highlights the corrupting influence of wealth and power, a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in the betrayal of Jesus for thirty pieces of silver.<p><b>in order to destroy the Jews</b><br>The intent to destroy the Jews is a recurring threat throughout biblical history, reflecting the spiritual warfare against God's chosen people. This phrase connects to the broader narrative of anti-Semitism and the survival of the Jewish people against overwhelming odds. It echoes earlier biblical events, such as Pharaoh's decree in Exodus, and foreshadows future persecutions. Theologically, it points to the enduring covenant between God and Israel, and the ultimate protection and deliverance promised to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>A Jew living in Susa, the capital of the Persian Empire, and the cousin and guardian of Esther.

The faithful sharing of truth in a hostile environment mirrors moments like Joseph relaying dreams to Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-25.htm">Genesis 41:25</a>) and Daniel revealing Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s dream (<a href="/daniel/2-24.htm">Daniel 2:24&#8211;28</a>). Each scene shows God&#8217;s people speaking up at critical junctures, reminding us that silence is never neutral when God&#8217;s covenant people are threatened.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all that had happened to him</b><p>Mordecai recounts the chain of events&#8212;his refusal to bow (<a href="/esther/3-2.htm">Esther 3:2&#8211;4</a>), Haman&#8217;s rage (<a href="/esther/3-5.htm">Esther 3:5</a>), and the empire-wide edict (<a href="/esther/3-12.htm">Esther 3:12&#8211;15</a>). By rehearsing history, he equips Esther with clarity, just as Moses reviewed Israel&#8217;s story before entering Canaan (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-1.htm">Deuteronomy 1:1&#8211;3</a>). God repeatedly calls His people to remember so that obedient action can follow.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>including the exact amount of money</b><p>Haman offered &#8220;ten thousand talents of silver&#8221; (<a href="/esther/3-9.htm">Esther 3:9</a>)&#8212;an astronomical sum intended to purchase genocide. Scripture often spotlights specific numbers to underline accountability: Judas bargained for thirty pieces of silver (<a href="/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a>), and Ananias and Sapphira lied about a precise figure (<a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1&#8211;3</a>). God&#8217;s Word traces every coin, exposing corrupt motives and assuring nothing escapes His notice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that Haman had promised to pay</b><p>Haman&#8217;s pledge reveals how evil schemes masquerade as fiscal policy. He weaponizes wealth much like Balak tried to hire Balaam to curse Israel (<a href="/numbers/22-5.htm">Numbers 22:5&#8211;7</a>). The episode underscores <a href="/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>&#8212;&#8220;Riches profit not in the day of wrath.&#8221; No amount of money can override God&#8217;s covenant with His people (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into the royal treasury</b><p>By targeting the empire&#8217;s coffers, Haman appeals to royal self-interest, a tactic echoed when Daniel&#8217;s accusers invoked Persian law to trap him (<a href="/daniel/6-4.htm">Daniel 6:4&#8211;9</a>). Earthly kingdoms often value revenue over righteousness, yet <a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a> reminds us, &#8220;The earth is the LORD&#8217;s, and the fullness thereof.&#8221; Ultimately, every treasury belongs to God, not to scheming officials.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in order to destroy the Jews</b><p>Here the mask fully drops: genocide, not policy, is the goal. This echoes Pharaoh&#8217;s decree in <a href="/exodus/1-15.htm">Exodus 1:15&#8211;22</a> and later Herod&#8217;s slaughter in <a href="/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16</a>. Behind each plot stands the ancient enmity foretold in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>. Yet every attempt to erase God&#8217;s people only magnifies His deliverance, culminating in the Cross where apparent defeat became victory (<a href="/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>&#8226; Mordecai&#8217;s detailed report equips Esther with truth, enabling courageous intervention.<p>&#8226; The passage highlights God&#8217;s meticulous oversight&#8212;He tracks both events and exact sums.<p>&#8226; Haman&#8217;s bribe showcases how evil hides behind economic justifications, but divine justice exposes every motive.<p>&#8226; Scripture&#8217;s recurring pattern is clear: hostile powers may plot Israel&#8217;s destruction, but covenant promises stand unbreakable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sum of money</span>.
