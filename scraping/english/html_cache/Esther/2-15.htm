Her father, Abihail, is mentioned to emphasize her Jewish heritage, which plays a crucial role in the narrative. Mordecai, her cousin, adopts her, highlighting the close-knit family structures typical in Jewish culture. This adoption also sets the stage for Mordecai's protective and guiding role in Esther's life, which is pivotal in the unfolding events of the book.<p><b>And when it was her turn to go to the king,</b><br>This phrase indicates the process by which young women were presented to King Xerxes (Ahasuerus) as potential queens. The Persian custom involved a lengthy preparation period, emphasizing the importance of physical beauty and presentation in the royal court. Esther's turn signifies her entry into a critical moment of divine providence, where her actions would have significant implications for her people.<p><b>she did not ask for anything except what Hegai, the king&#8217;s trusted official in charge of the harem, had advised.</b><br>Esther's decision to rely solely on Hegai's advice demonstrates her wisdom and humility. Hegai, as the king's eunuch and official in charge of the harem, had insider knowledge of what would please the king. Esther's trust in his guidance reflects her strategic thinking and discernment, qualities that would later be crucial in her role as queen. This also shows her ability to gain favor with those in authority, a recurring theme in her story.<p><b>And Esther found favor in the eyes of everyone who saw her.</b><br>Esther's favor with others is a testament to her character and the divine favor upon her life. This favor is not merely due to her physical beauty but also her demeanor and grace. The concept of finding favor is a recurring biblical theme, often associated with God's blessing and purpose. Esther's favor with all who saw her foreshadows her future influence and the pivotal role she will play in the deliverance of her people, paralleling the favor found by other biblical figures such as Joseph and Daniel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>A Jewish orphan raised by her cousin Mordecai, chosen to be queen of Persia.

By recording Abihail&#8217;s name, the writer affirms that Esther&#8217;s rise is no accident of chance; it is rooted in God&#8217;s sovereign orchestration of a specific family line.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Adoption by Mordecai: &#8220;the uncle from whom Mordecai had adopted her as his own daughter&#8221;</b><p>Mordecai&#8217;s guardianship showcases God&#8217;s provision for the orphaned (<a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>). His faithful care anticipates how God positions people to protect His purposes, just as He placed Joseph in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/45-7.htm">Genesis 45:7</a>). Esther learned covenant faith, courage, and discernment in Mordecai&#8217;s home&#8212;qualities that later save the nation (<a href="/esther/4-14.htm">Esther 4:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Her appointed moment: &#8220;when it was her turn to go to the king&#8221;</b><p>The phrase underscores the divine timing threaded through the book (<a href="/esther/4-14.htm">Esther 4:14</a>, <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>). After a year of mandated beauty treatments (<a href="/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12</a>), Esther steps into the decisive moment God had prepared. The narrative reminds us that waiting seasons equip believers for precise appointments (<a href="/psalms/37-7.htm">Psalm 37:7</a>, <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Reliance on wise counsel: &#8220;she did not ask for anything except what Hegai &#8230; had advised&#8221;</b><p>Hegai, already &#8220;pleased&#8221; with her (<a href="/esther/2-9.htm">Esther 2:9</a>), knows what will appeal to the king.

God grants Esther winsomeness that transcends culture, preparing the court&#8212;and ultimately the empire&#8212;to receive her intercession (<a href="/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/2-15.htm">Esther 2:15</a> highlights God&#8217;s providence in every detail of Esther&#8217;s life&#8212;her family line, her adoption, her strategic timing, her humble wisdom, and the favor He bestows. By choosing counsel over self-indulgence and walking in humility, Esther becomes the vessel through whom God will preserve His people. The verse invites believers to trust God&#8217;s timing, heed godly guidance, and depend on the favor He alone grants for His redemptive purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Abihail, the uncle of Mordecai</span>.
