The Jews in Susa faced a unique situation compared to those in other parts of the empire. The assembly on the thirteenth and fourteenth days of the month of Adar was a defensive measure against the decree that allowed their enemies to attack them. This assembly highlights the unity and determination of the Jewish people in the face of potential annihilation. The two-day assembly in Susa contrasts with the single day of defense observed by Jews in other regions, emphasizing the intensity of the threat in the capital. This period of defense is a fulfillment of the reversal of fortune orchestrated by God through Esther and Mordecai, as seen earlier in the narrative.<p><b>So they rested on the fifteenth day,</b><br>The rest on the fifteenth day signifies the completion of their deliverance and the cessation of hostilities. This rest is not merely physical but also a spiritual and emotional relief from the threat of destruction. The concept of rest is a recurring theme in the Bible, often associated with God's deliverance and provision, as seen in the Sabbath rest (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>) and the rest promised in the Promised Land (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10</a>). The rest on the fifteenth day also sets the stage for the establishment of the Feast of Purim, a celebration of God's providence and protection.<p><b>making it a day of feasting and joy.</b><br>The transition from defense to celebration underscores the dramatic reversal of the Jews' fortunes. Feasting and joy are common responses to divine deliverance in the Bible, as seen in the celebrations following the Israelites' escape from Egypt (Exodus 15) and the dedication of the temple (<a href="/ezra/6-16.htm">Ezra 6:16-22</a>). The day of feasting and joy in Susa becomes a prototype for the annual observance of Purim, a festival that commemorates the survival of the Jewish people and God's faithfulness. This celebration is a reminder of the joy that comes from God's salvation, a theme echoed in the New Testament with the joy of salvation through Jesus Christ (<a href="/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10-11</a>). The establishment of Purim as a day of feasting and joy also serves as a type of the ultimate deliverance and celebration found in Christ's victory over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons /
