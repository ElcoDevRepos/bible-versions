Banquets were significant in Persian culture, often used for political and social purposes. The "second day" suggests a period of deliberation and anticipation, highlighting the gravity of Esther's request. This setting is reminiscent of other biblical feasts where significant events unfold, such as the Last Supper in the New Testament.<p><b>the king asked once more</b><br>The repetition of the king's question underscores his genuine interest and willingness to grant Esther's request. It reflects the king's favor towards Esther, which is crucial given the hierarchical and patriarchal nature of Persian society. This persistence also mirrors the biblical theme of persistence in prayer and petition, as seen in the parable of the persistent widow in <a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18:1-8</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Queen Esther, what is your petition?</b><br>Addressing her as "Queen Esther" acknowledges her royal status and the respect she commands. Esther's position as queen is pivotal, as it provides her the platform to intercede for her people. This mirrors the intercessory role of Christ, who advocates on behalf of humanity before God, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>.<p><b>It will be given to you.</b><br>The king's assurance reflects the absolute power he holds and his readiness to exercise it in Esther's favor. This promise of fulfillment echoes God's promises to His people throughout Scripture, where faith and obedience lead to divine provision and intervention, as seen in <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>.<p><b>What is your request?</b><br>The king's inquiry invites Esther to speak boldly, highlighting the importance of timing and wisdom in making requests. This moment parallels the biblical principle of approaching God with confidence, as encouraged in <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>, where believers are urged to come boldly to the throne of grace.<p><b>Even up to half the kingdom, it will be fulfilled.&#8221;</b><br>This hyperbolic expression was a common royal idiom, indicating generosity and willingness to grant significant requests. It underscores the king's favor and the potential impact of Esther's petition. This phrase can be seen as a type of Christ's kingdom, where believers are co-heirs with Christ, as stated in <a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>, sharing in the riches of His grace and glory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who is hosting the banquet.

Scripture often shows meals as moments when pivotal decisions surface (<a href="/genesis/43-34.htm">Genesis 43:34</a>; <a href="/luke/22-14.htm">Luke 22:14-20</a>). Here, the Spirit has arranged perfect timing: Haman&#8217;s pride has peaked, the king&#8217;s curiosity has ripened, and Esther&#8217;s courage is fully formed (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The king asked once more</b><p>Xerxes had already offered Esther anything she desired at the first banquet (<a href="/esther/5-3.htm">Esther 5:3</a>).

When a matter is repeated in Scripture, the Lord is emphasizing its certainty (<a href="/genesis/41-32.htm">Genesis 41:32</a>).
