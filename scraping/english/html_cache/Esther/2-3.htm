The appointment of commissioners indicates a structured and organized administration. This reflects the Persian Empire's historical reputation for efficient governance. The use of commissioners also underscores the king's authority and the centralized power he wielded over his vast domain.<p><b>to assemble all the beautiful young women into the harem</b><br>The gathering of young women into the harem was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern monarchies, where kings often had multiple wives and concubines. This practice was not only for personal pleasure but also for political alliances and ensuring a royal lineage. The emphasis on beauty reflects the cultural values of the time, where physical appearance was highly prized. This event sets the stage for Esther's introduction, a pivotal moment in the narrative.<p><b>at the citadel of Susa</b><br>Susa was one of the Persian Empire's capitals and a significant city in ancient Mesopotamia. Archaeological excavations have uncovered the grandeur of the citadel, which served as a royal residence and administrative center. The choice of Susa as the location for the harem underscores its importance and strategic position within the empire. The citadel's mention situates the story within a real historical and geographical context.<p><b>Let them be placed under the care of Hegai, the king&#8217;s eunuch in charge of the women</b><br>Hegai, as a eunuch, was entrusted with the care of the women in the harem, a common practice to ensure loyalty and prevent any threat to the king's lineage. Eunuchs often held significant positions in royal courts due to their perceived trustworthiness. Hegai's role is crucial as he becomes a key figure in Esther's journey, showing favor to her, which is a divine orchestration in the narrative.<p><b>and let them be given beauty treatments</b><br>The beauty treatments reflect the cultural emphasis on physical appearance and preparation for presentation to the king. These treatments likely included cosmetics, perfumes, and other forms of grooming, which were common in ancient royal courts. This process symbolizes a period of transformation and preparation, paralleling spiritual themes of purification and readiness for a divine purpose. Esther's compliance with these treatments foreshadows her rise to favor and her pivotal role in God's plan for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who ruled over 127 provinces from India to Cush.

The centralized search underscores the reach of his authority and the absolute nature of royal decrees, similar to Darius&#8217; appointment of 120 satraps in <a href="/daniel/6-1.htm">Daniel 6:1</a>.<p>&#8226; Human power is real, yet ultimately governed by God, &#8220;for there is no authority except from God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). Even pagan structures can be instruments in His plan.<p>&#8226; The methodical sweep of the realm makes certain that the woman God has chosen&#8212;Esther&#8212;is included. His providence works through ordinary administrative decisions, echoing <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is in the hand of the LORD; He directs it like a watercourse wherever He pleases.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to assemble all the beautiful young women into the harem at the citadel of Susa</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;to assemble all the beautiful young women into the harem at the citadel of Susa.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The empire values outward beauty. From Pharaoh noticing Sarah&#8217;s beauty (<a href="/genesis/12-14.htm">Genesis 12:14</a>) to Nebuchadnezzar selecting &#8220;handsome&#8221; young men (<a href="/daniel/1-3.htm">Daniel 1:3-4</a>), royal courts consistently prize appearance.<p>&#8226; Susa, the winter capital, becomes the stage where God will reverse the fate of His people. Gathering the women there gathers the future queen where political decisions are made.<p>&#8226; Beauty alone is prized by the culture, yet Scripture reminds us, &#8220;Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/31-30.htm">Proverbs 31:30</a>). God is preparing to showcase that truth through Esther, whose inner character will eclipse her exterior.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>let them be placed under the care of Hegai, the king&#8217;s eunuch in charge of the women</b><p>&#8220;Let them be placed under the care of Hegai, the king&#8217;s eunuch in charge of the women.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Eunuchs routinely oversaw royal harems for security, paralleling Potiphar entrusting Joseph with his household (<a href="/genesis/39-4.htm">Genesis 39:4</a>).<p>&#8226; God grants Esther favor with this official (<a href="/esther/2-9.htm">Esther 2:9</a>), much like Daniel receiving favor from Ashpenaz (<a href="/daniel/1-9.htm">Daniel 1:9</a>). Human gatekeepers can become unexpected allies when God is at work.<p>&#8226; Hegai&#8217;s supervision anticipates Esther&#8217;s need for guidance in palace protocol. Divine providence provides not only opportunity but also the mentors required to navigate it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and let them be given beauty treatments</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and let them be given beauty treatments.&#8221;<p>&#8226; A twelve-month regimen (<a href="/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12</a>) reveals the empire&#8217;s obsession with adornment. <a href="/ezekiel/16-13.htm">Ezekiel 16:13</a> pictures royal adornment as a sign of elevation; here it is a tool of selection.<p>&#8226; Outward preparation contrasts with God&#8217;s emphasis on the heart: &#8220;Your beauty should not come from outward adornment&#8230;but from the inner disposition of the heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3-4</a>). Esther will demonstrate both, yet it is her courage and faith that will rescue Israel.<p>&#8226; The treatments showcase the opulence and decadence of Persian court life, setting the dramatic backdrop against which God&#8217;s quiet sovereignty shines.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/2-3.htm">Esther 2:3</a> describes a royal search marked by imperial power, cultural priorities, and meticulous organization. Every detail&#8212;the commissioners, the gathering at Susa, Hegai&#8217;s oversight, and the extensive beauty regimen&#8212;highlights man&#8217;s focus on appearance and control. Yet beneath the surface, God orchestrates events to position His chosen servant. Worldly systems unwittingly advance divine purposes, proving again that &#8220;the counsel of the LORD stands forever&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/esther/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">The house of the women.</span>--The harem, then as now, <span class= "bld">a</span> prominent feature in the establishment of an Eastern king.<p><span class= "bld">Hege.</span>--Called Hegai in <a href="/esther/2-8.htm" title="So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also to the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.">Esther 2:8</a>; a eunuch whose special charge seems to have been the virgins, while another, named Shaashgaz (<a href="/esther/2-14.htm" title="In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in to the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.">Esther 2:14</a>), had the custody of the concubines. The whole verse shows, as conclusively as anything could do, in how degrading an aspect Eastern women were, as a whole, viewed. It was reserved for Christianity to indicate the true position of woman, not man's plaything, but the help meet for him, able to aid him in his spiritual and intellectual progress, yielding him intelligent obedience, not slavery.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The house of the women</span>. In an Oriental palace the women's apartments are always distinct from those of the men, and are usually placed in a separate building, which the Greeks called the gynaeceum, and the Jews "the house of the women." At Susa this was a large edifice, and comprised several subdivisions (see ver. 14). <span class="cmt_word">Hege, the king's chamberlain</span>.
