The use of letters indicates the administrative sophistication of the Persian Empire, which relied on an efficient postal system. This system is also referenced in <a href="/esther/8-10.htm">Esther 8:10</a>, where Mordecai sends letters to counter Haman's decree. The act of sending letters underscores the king's authority and the centralized power of the Persian monarchy.<p><b>to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language</b><br>The diversity of languages and scripts within the empire reflects its multicultural nature. This inclusivity ensured that the king's decrees were understood by all subjects, emphasizing the importance of communication in governance. The use of multiple languages is also seen in the story of the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>), where language diversity is a result of divine intervention. The attention to linguistic detail in Esther foreshadows the New Testament's emphasis on the spread of the Gospel to all nations and tongues (<a href="/acts/2-6.htm">Acts 2:6-11</a>).<p><b>proclaiming that every man should be master of his own household</b><br>This decree reflects the patriarchal structure of ancient Near Eastern societies, where men held authority over their families. The cultural context of the time placed significant emphasis on male leadership within the home, as seen in other biblical passages like <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>, which discusses the roles of husbands and wives. The decree can be seen as a response to Queen Vashti's defiance, aiming to reinforce traditional gender roles. This theme of authority and submission is echoed in the broader biblical narrative, where Christ is depicted as the head of the Church, His bride (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who reigned over 127 provinces from India to Cush.

The English Version does distinct violence to the Hebrew, perhaps because the literal rendering yielded a somewhat peculiar sense. Taking the words exactly as they stand, they can only mean that in a house where two or more languages are used, from the presence of foreign wives, the husband is to take care that his own language is not supplanted by any of theirs. This is intelligible enough, but is perhaps rather irrelevant to what goes before.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he sent</span>.
