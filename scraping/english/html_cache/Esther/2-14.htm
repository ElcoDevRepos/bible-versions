This practice reflects the cultural norms of the time, where the king's interactions with women were often conducted under the cover of night, away from public scrutiny. The evening setting also symbolizes a transition from the public duties of the day to the private affairs of the king's household.<p><b>and in the morning she would return to a second harem</b><br>The mention of a "second harem" indicates a structured system within the royal palace. The first harem was for virgins, while the second was for those who had already been with the king. This separation underscores the hierarchical and organized nature of the Persian court. It also highlights the limited agency of women in this context, as their movements and status were strictly controlled.<p><b>under the care of Shaashgaz, the king&#8217;s eunuch in charge of the concubines</b><br>Eunuchs were often placed in positions of trust within royal courts due to their perceived loyalty and inability to produce heirs, which minimized threats to the king's lineage. Shaashgaz's role as the overseer of the concubines indicates his high status and the importance of maintaining order and security within the harem. This reflects the broader theme of control and authority within the Persian Empire.<p><b>She would not return to the king unless he delighted in her</b><br>This phrase highlights the precarious position of women in the harem, whose futures depended on the king's favor. It underscores the theme of favor and choice, which is prevalent throughout the Book of Esther. The king's delight was the determining factor for a woman's continued presence and influence in the royal court, illustrating the power dynamics at play.<p><b>and summoned her by name</b><br>Being summoned by name signifies personal recognition and favor, contrasting with the anonymity and obscurity faced by many in the harem. This detail emphasizes the importance of individual identity and the king's selective attention. It also foreshadows Esther's unique position and eventual rise to prominence, as she gains favor in the eyes of the king, aligning with the providential themes of the narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>A Jewish woman who becomes queen of Persia.

The darkness of evening underscores both secrecy and finality&#8212;once she left the first harem, her status changed forever.<p>&#8226; Evening often marks decisive moments in Scripture, from the Passover night (<a href="/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6&#8211;12</a>) to Jesus&#8217; institution of the Lord&#8217;s Supper (<a href="/luke/22-14.htm">Luke 22:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Just as those nights carried permanent consequences, this evening visit fixed each woman&#8217;s future.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And in the morning she would return to a second harem</b><p>The next morning she was escorted to a different residence, literally moving from &#8220;prospective bride&#8221; to &#8220;concubine.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The contrast between night and morning highlights the abrupt end of her one opportunity with the king (compare <a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19</a> shows that this second harem was separate from the royal household, emphasizing the isolation that followed a single night of favor&#8212;or of disappointment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Under the care of Shaashgaz, the king&#8217;s eunuch in charge of the concubines</b><p>Shaashgaz managed the women who had been with the king but were not chosen as queen.

For these women, no summons meant a lifetime in obscurity.<p>&#8226; The phrase stresses individual recognition: even in a vast empire, the king&#8217;s word singled out one woman from many.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the Lord likewise knows His own by name (<a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>), assuring believers of secure, personal fellowship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/2-14.htm">Esther 2:14</a> paints a vivid picture of absolute royal authority: one evening&#8217;s encounter decided a woman&#8217;s destiny, and only the king&#8217;s delight and personal summons could alter it. Historically, the verse explains Persian court protocol; spiritually, it reminds us that access to any throne&#8212;whether Xerxes&#8217; or God&#8217;s&#8212;depends entirely on the sovereign pleasure of the ruler. In Christ, who calls us by name and delights in those clothed with His righteousness (<a href="/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>), believers find the lasting favor that no earthly monarch could provide.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the morrow</span>.
