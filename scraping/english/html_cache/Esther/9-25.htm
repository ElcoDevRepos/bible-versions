The king's role is crucial, as he holds the authority to reverse the decree. This reflects the providential timing and intervention often seen in biblical narratives, where God orchestrates events for the deliverance of His people. The king's decision-making process is a reminder of <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, which states that the king's heart is in the hand of the Lord.<p><b>he commanded by letter</b><br>The use of a letter signifies the formal and authoritative nature of the king's decree. In the Persian Empire, written edicts were binding and irrevocable, as seen in <a href="/esther/1-19.htm">Esther 1:19</a>. This underscores the seriousness of the king's command and the official reversal of Haman's plot. The written word here parallels the enduring nature of God's Word, which stands firm and unchangeable.<p><b>that the wicked scheme which Haman had devised against the Jews</b><br>Haman's plot was not just a personal vendetta but a genocidal plan against God's chosen people. This reflects the recurring theme of anti-Semitism throughout history, where the Jewish people have faced numerous attempts at annihilation. The spiritual battle against God's people is evident here, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where the struggle is not against flesh and blood but against spiritual forces of evil.<p><b>should come back upon his own head</b><br>This phrase highlights the biblical principle of reaping what one sows, as found in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>. Haman's fate is a direct consequence of his own evil intentions, demonstrating God's justice and the reversal of fortunes often seen in Scripture. This is reminiscent of the story of Joseph, where what was meant for evil was turned for good (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p><b>and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows</b><br>The execution of Haman and his sons serves as a complete eradication of the threat against the Jews. The gallows, or more accurately, the stake or pole, was a common method of execution in the Persian Empire. This act of justice is a foreshadowing of the ultimate judgment against evil. It also serves as a type of Christ, who was hanged on a tree (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>) to bear the curse for humanity, providing deliverance and salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>The Jewish queen of Persia who bravely intervened to save her people from destruction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who was initially unaware of Haman's plot against the Jews but later authorized its reversal.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>The antagonist who plotted to annihilate the Jews but ultimately faced the consequences of his own schemes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>The people of God who were targeted for destruction but were delivered through divine intervention.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gallows.htm">The Gallows</a></b><br>The instrument of execution intended for Mordecai but used for Haman and his sons, symbolizing poetic justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's justice prevails, and evil schemes are ultimately overturned.
