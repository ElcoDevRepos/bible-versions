Esther, as queen, holds a unique position of influence, which she uses to advocate for her people. Mordecai, identified as a Jew, signifies the importance of Jewish identity and heritage in the narrative. The mention of both Esther and Mordecai underscores their partnership and shared mission. This reflects the providential role they play in the deliverance of the Jewish people, reminiscent of other biblical figures who work together for God's purposes, such as Moses and Aaron.<p><b>Behold, I have given Haman&#8217;s estate to Esther</b><br>The transfer of Haman's estate to Esther signifies a reversal of fortune, a common theme in biblical narratives where the righteous are vindicated, and the wicked are punished. This act of giving Haman's estate to Esther not only compensates for the wrongs done but also empowers Esther to continue her advocacy for the Jewish people. It reflects the biblical principle of divine justice, where God often turns the plans of the wicked against them, as seen in the story of Joseph in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>.<p><b>and he was hanged on the gallows because he attacked the Jews</b><br>Haman's execution on the gallows he intended for Mordecai is a vivid example of poetic justice. This outcome serves as a warning against pride and plotting against God's people, echoing <a href="/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a>, "Whoever digs a pit will fall into it." The gallows, likely a large wooden structure for impalement or hanging, symbolizes the ultimate downfall of those who oppose God's covenant people.

Xerxes openly identifies him with the covenant people&#8212;an honor that reverses the earlier decree aimed at annihilating them (<a href="/esther/3-13.htm">Esther 3:13</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s quiet providence is evident: &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is a watercourse in the hand of the LORD; He directs it where He pleases&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; What began as a hidden identity (<a href="/esther/2-10.htm">Esther 2:10</a>) is now celebrated, illustrating Jesus&#8217; words, &#8220;For nothing is hidden that will not be revealed&#8221; (<a href="/luke/8-17.htm">Luke 8:17</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment also anticipates Mordecai&#8217;s later promotion: &#8220;Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Xerxes&#8221;

Scripture often shows the wicked&#8217;s wealth handed to the righteous: &#8220;The sinner&#8217;s wealth is stored up for the righteous&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>).<p>&#8226;

It also fulfills the promise to Abraham&#8217;s lineage that those who curse them will be cursed, while those who bless will be blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>); here Xerxes blesses them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he was hanged on the gallows because he attacked the Jews</b><p>&#8226;

The gallows (literally a pole) became a visible deterrent, demonstrating that antisemitism&#8212;even under a pagan king&#8212;meets swift retribution.<p>&#8226; The outcome foreshadows final judgment, when every enemy of God&#8217;s people will be held to account (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:6&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/8-7.htm">Esther 8:7</a> marks the decisive reversal of fortunes orchestrated by God.
