Adar is the twelfth month in the Hebrew calendar, typically falling in February or March. This timing is crucial as it represents the culmination of the events set in motion by Haman's decree, which was issued earlier in the year. The choice of the thirteenth day, determined by casting lots (Purim), was intended by Haman to be a day of destruction for the Jews, but it became a day of victory instead.<p><b>the king&#8217;s command and edict were to be executed</b><br>The king's command refers to the decree initially issued by King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I) at the instigation of Haman, which allowed for the destruction of the Jews. However, after Esther's intervention, a second edict was issued permitting the Jews to defend themselves. This duality of decrees highlights the irrevocable nature of Persian law, where a king's edict could not be repealed but could be countered by another decree. This legal framework is seen elsewhere in the Book of Daniel, where the laws of the Medes and Persians are described as unchangeable.<p><b>On this day the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them</b><br>The enemies of the Jews, emboldened by the initial decree, anticipated an easy victory. This reflects the deep-seated animosity and anti-Semitism present in the Persian Empire, which Haman had exploited. The expectation of overpowering the Jews was based on the assumption that the Jews would be unprepared or unable to defend themselves effectively. This phrase underscores the tension and fear that must have been prevalent among the Jewish communities leading up to this day.<p><b>but their plan was overturned</b><br>The overturning of the plan is a central theme in the Book of Esther, showcasing divine providence and the reversal of fortunes. This reversal is a common motif in biblical narratives, where God intervenes to protect His people, often turning the schemes of the wicked against them. Theologically, it emphasizes God's sovereignty and faithfulness to His covenant people, even when His presence is not overtly mentioned, as is the case in Esther.<p><b>and the Jews overpowered those who hated them</b><br>The Jews' victory over their enemies is a testament to their unity and courage, as well as the effectiveness of the second decree that allowed them to defend themselves. This triumph is celebrated in the festival of Purim, which commemorates the survival and resilience of the Jewish people. The phrase also echoes the biblical theme of God empowering His people to overcome their adversaries, as seen in other Old Testament accounts such as the Exodus and the battles led by King David. This victory can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, where what was intended for harm is turned to good.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>A Jewish queen of Persia who played a crucial role in saving her people from annihilation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>Esther's cousin and guardian, who became a prominent figure in the Persian court and was instrumental in the Jews' deliverance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>The antagonist who plotted to destroy the Jews but was ultimately defeated.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who issued the edict allowing the Jews to defend themselves.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>The people of God living in exile in Persia, who were targeted for destruction but ultimately triumphed over their enemies.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_month_of_adar.htm">The month of Adar</a></b><br>The twelfth month in the Hebrew calendar, significant for the celebration of Purim, commemorating the Jews' victory.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_reversal.htm">Divine Reversal</a></b><br>God's sovereignty is evident in the reversal of the Jews' fate.

In the Medo-Persian system no royal decree could be revoked (<a href="/esther/8-8.htm">Esther 8:8</a>), so the solution was a new decree granting the Jews the legal right to defend themselves.<p>&#8226;
