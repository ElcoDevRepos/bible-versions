The narrative takes place during the reign of King Xerxes, also known as Ahasuerus, who ruled the Persian Empire from 486 to 465 BC. This period is significant in Jewish history as it occurs after the Babylonian exile, during the time when many Jews were living in the Persian Empire.<p><b>King Xerxes</b><br>Xerxes I was a prominent Persian king known for his vast empire and military campaigns, including the famous battles against Greece. His reign is well-documented in historical records, providing a backdrop for the events in Esther. Xerxes' character and decisions play a crucial role in the unfolding of the story, highlighting themes of power, providence, and divine intervention.<p><b>sat on his royal throne</b><br>The imagery of a king sitting on his throne symbolizes authority, governance, and the exercise of power. In the context of Esther, it underscores Xerxes' control over the vast Persian Empire. This setting also foreshadows the dramatic events that will unfold, where the king's decisions will have significant implications for the Jewish people.<p><b>in the citadel of Susa</b><br>Susa, also known as Shushan, was one of the major capitals of the Persian Empire. Archaeological excavations have revealed the grandeur of the city, including the royal palace where much of the story of Esther takes place. Susa's significance is further highlighted in other biblical texts, such as Nehemiah and Daniel, indicating its importance as a center of political and cultural activity. The citadel, or fortified palace, serves as the backdrop for the narrative, emphasizing the themes of protection and divine orchestration in the lives of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_xerxes.htm">King Xerxes (Ahasuerus)</a></b><br>The Persian king who reigned over a vast empire.
