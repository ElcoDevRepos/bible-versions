The court was a place of authority and power, and Esther's presence there signifies her courage and determination to intercede for her people. This moment is pivotal in the narrative, showcasing Esther's role as a mediator, a type of Christ who intercedes on behalf of others.<p><b>she found favor in his sight</b><br>Finding favor is a recurring theme in the Bible, often indicating divine intervention or blessing. Esther's favor with the king can be seen as a result of God's providence, aligning with the biblical principle that God grants favor to those who seek His will. This mirrors the favor found by Joseph in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/39-4.htm">Genesis 39:4</a>) and Daniel in Babylon (<a href="/daniel/1-9.htm">Daniel 1:9</a>), suggesting a pattern of God's people being placed in positions of influence for His purposes.<p><b>The king extended the gold scepter in his hand toward Esther</b><br>The gold scepter symbolizes royal authority and the king's willingness to grant Esther an audience, signifying acceptance and mercy. In ancient Persian culture, the scepter was a powerful emblem of the king's rule and his ability to grant life or death. This act of extending the scepter can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's role as the mediator who grants access to the Father, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>, where believers are encouraged to approach the throne of grace with confidence.<p><b>and she approached and touched the tip of the scepter</b><br>Touching the scepter was a formal act of submission and respect, acknowledging the king's authority while also signifying the acceptance of his favor. This act can be compared to the biblical theme of drawing near to God, as seen in <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>, where believers are encouraged to draw near to God with the promise that He will draw near to them. Esther's approach is a model of faith and obedience, reflecting the believer's approach to God through Christ, who is the ultimate mediator.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who reigned over 127 provinces from India to Cush.
