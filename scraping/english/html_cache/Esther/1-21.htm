In the context of the Persian Empire, the king's court was a place of significant political influence, and the approval of the princes suggests a consensus among the ruling elite. This reflects the hierarchical structure of the Persian government, where the king's decisions were often influenced by his advisors. The cultural context of the time placed a high value on maintaining order and authority, especially within the royal household. The approval of the counsel also highlights the importance of unity among the king's advisors, which was crucial for the stability of the empire.<p><b>so the king did as Memucan advised.</b><br>This part of the verse shows the king's decision to act on the advice given by Memucan, which involved deposing Queen Vashti. This action underscores the absolute authority of the king in the Persian Empire, where his word was law. It also reflects the cultural norms regarding the role and behavior of women in the royal court, emphasizing obedience and submission. The decision to follow Memucan's counsel can be seen as a means to reinforce the king's authority and prevent any perceived challenges to his rule. This event sets the stage for Esther's rise to queenship, which is a pivotal moment in the narrative, demonstrating God's providence and the unfolding of His plan for the Jewish people. The king's compliance with Memucan's advice also illustrates the theme of divine sovereignty, where God uses human decisions to fulfill His purposes, as seen throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who ruled over 127 provinces from India to Cush.

Scripture highlights the weight of rulers surrounding themselves with trustworthy advisers&#8212;see <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>; 29:12.<p>&#8226; The princes&#8217; involvement underscores accountability;

Scripture often portrays kings acting impulsively to preserve honor&#8212;consider Herod in <a href="/mark/6-26.htm">Mark 6:26&#8211;28</a>.<p>&#8226; The verse cautions readers about how quickly unchecked power can codify questionable counsel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As Memucan advised</b><p>Memucan&#8217;s influence becomes law.<p>&#8226;

This expression must not be pressed too closely. It does not imply more than that Memucan's advice was followed in a general way - Vashti disgraced, and the grounds of her disgrace published throughout the provinces. We cannot be sure that the decree was "written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes." Even if it was, it was always possible for a Persian king to give himself a dispensation from the law (see Herod., 3:58). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/1-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and his princes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ha&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8269.htm">Strong's 8269: </a> </span><span class="str2">Chieftain, chief, ruler, official, captain, prince</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were pleased</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1496;&#1463;&#1489;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#238;&#183;&#7789;a&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3190.htm">Strong's 3190: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be good, well, glad, or pleasing</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with this counsel;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1428;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(had&#183;d&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">so the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as Memucan</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1464;&#1469;&#1503;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#7733;&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4462.htm">Strong's 4462: </a> </span><span class="str2">Memucan -- a prince of Persia and Media</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had advised.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ki&#7695;&#183;&#7687;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/esther/1-21.htm">Esther 1:21 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/esther/1-21.htm">Esther 1:21 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/esther/1-21.htm">Esther 1:21 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/esther/1-21.htm">Esther 1:21 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/esther/1-21.htm">Esther 1:21 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/esther/1-21.htm">Esther 1:21  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/esther/1-21.htm">Esther 1:21 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/esther/1-21.htm">Esther 1:21 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/esther/1-21.htm">Esther 1:21 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/esther/1-21.htm">Esther 1:21 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/esther/1-21.htm">OT History: Esther 1:21 This advice pleased the king and (Est Esth.
