The Jews were granted the right to defend themselves against those who sought their destruction, leading to their triumph. This victory is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God delivered His people from their enemies, such as the Exodus from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>). The concept of "rest" is significant in the Bible, often symbolizing peace and divine intervention (<a href="/joshua/21-44.htm">Joshua 21:44</a>).<p><b>and the month in which their sorrow turned to joy</b><br>The transformation from sorrow to joy highlights the dramatic reversal of fortune experienced by the Jews. This change occurred in the month of Adar, which became a time of celebration. The theme of sorrow turning to joy is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/30-11.htm">Psalm 30:11</a>, where mourning is turned into dancing. This reversal is a testament to God's providence and faithfulness to His covenant people.<p><b>and their mourning into a holiday</b><br>The mourning of the Jews, due to the threat of annihilation, was transformed into a holiday, known as Purim. This celebration commemorates their deliverance and is marked by joy and festivity. The establishment of a holiday from a time of mourning is a recurring biblical theme, seen in the transformation of fasting into feasting (<a href="/zechariah/8-19.htm">Zechariah 8:19</a>). It underscores the idea that God can turn despair into celebration.<p><b>He wrote that these were to be days of feasting and joy</b><br>Mordecai, a central figure in the Book of Esther, instituted the observance of Purim as days of feasting and joy. This command reflects the biblical tradition of celebrating God's deliverance with communal feasting, as seen in the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>). Feasting is often associated with covenant renewal and divine blessing.<p><b>of sending gifts to one another and to the poor</b><br>The practice of sending gifts to one another and to the poor during Purim emphasizes community and charity. This mirrors the biblical principle of generosity and care for the needy, as instructed in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>. The act of giving gifts fosters unity and reflects the joy of shared deliverance, aligning with the teachings of Jesus on loving one's neighbor (<a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>A Jew in the Persian Empire who rose to prominence and played a crucial role in saving the Jewish people from destruction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>The Jewish queen of Persia who bravely intervened to prevent the annihilation of her people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>The antagonist who plotted to destroy the Jews but was ultimately defeated.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/susa.htm">Susa (Shushan)</a></b><br>The capital of the Persian Empire where much of the account unfolds.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/purim.htm">Purim</a></b><br>The Jewish festival established to commemorate the deliverance of the Jews from Haman's plot.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_providence.htm">God's Sovereignty and Providence</a></b><br>The account of Esther highlights God's unseen hand in orchestrating events for the deliverance of His people.
