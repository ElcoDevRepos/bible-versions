Such a lengthy celebration underscores the wealth and power of the Persian Empire, which could afford to host such an event. Historically, this period aligns with the time when Xerxes was consolidating his power and planning his campaign against Greece, which culminated in the famous battles of Thermopylae and Salamis. The number 180, being half of a year, may symbolize completeness in the context of a grand display of power.<p><b>he displayed the glorious riches of his kingdom</b><br>The display of wealth was a common practice among ancient Near Eastern monarchs to demonstrate their power and divine favor. The Persian Empire, at its height, was vast and wealthy, stretching from India to Ethiopia. This phrase suggests a deliberate effort by Xerxes to impress and perhaps intimidate his subjects and allies. The "glorious riches" could include gold, silver, precious stones, and luxurious textiles, reflecting the empire's prosperity. This opulence is reminiscent of the wealth of Solomon's kingdom, as described in <a href="/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14-29</a>, where the splendor of a king's wealth is also emphasized.<p><b>and the magnificent splendor of his greatness</b><br>This phrase emphasizes not just the material wealth but also the personal grandeur and authority of King Xerxes. In the ancient world, a king's greatness was often measured by his ability to command resources and loyalty. The term "magnificent splendor" suggests a display meant to evoke awe and respect, reinforcing the king's status as a ruler of one of the most powerful empires of the time. This can be seen as a type of the ultimate kingship of Jesus Christ, who, unlike earthly kings, displayed his greatness through humility and sacrifice, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-11</a>. The contrast between earthly and divine kingship is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting the transient nature of human power compared to the eternal reign of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who ruled over 127 provinces from India to Cush.

Vain parade is apparent at every step of his expedition (Herod., 7:31, 40, 41, 44, 59, etc.). He now exhibits "the riches of his kingdom" to his nobles and chief officers, showing them doubtless all the splendours of the palace, the walls draped with gold (AEschyl., 'Pers.,' 50:161), the marble pillars and rich hangings, the golden plane tree and the golden vine (Herod., 7:27), and perhaps the ingots of gold wherewith Darius had filled the treasury (ibid. 3:96). <span class="cmt_word">An hundred and fourscore days</span>.
