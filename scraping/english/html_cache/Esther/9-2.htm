This extensive reach highlights the widespread nature of the events in Esther. The empire's administrative structure allowed for rapid communication, as seen in the swift dissemination of the king's edicts. The historical context of Xerxes' reign, marked by his campaigns against Greece, provides a backdrop of a powerful yet often challenged empire.<p><b>the Jews assembled in their cities</b><br>The gathering of the Jews in their cities signifies a unified response to the threat against them. This assembly was not just a physical gathering but also a spiritual and communal act of solidarity. The Jewish people, often dispersed and vulnerable, found strength in unity. This mirrors other biblical instances where God's people gather for protection and deliverance, such as the Israelites encamped together during their wilderness journey.<p><b>to attack those who sought to harm them</b><br>This phrase underscores the defensive nature of the Jews' actions. The decree allowed them to protect themselves against their enemies, a reversal of the earlier edict that permitted their annihilation. This self-defense aligns with the biblical principle of justice and protection of the innocent. The historical context of Persian law, which could not be revoked, necessitated this counter-decree.<p><b>No man could withstand them</b><br>The inability of their enemies to withstand the Jews points to divine intervention and favor. Throughout the Bible, God empowers His people to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds, as seen in the stories of David and Goliath or Gideon's victory over the Midianites. This phrase emphasizes the theme of God's providence and protection over His chosen people.<p><b>because the fear of them had fallen upon all peoples</b><br>The fear that fell upon the peoples can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to make His people a formidable presence among the nations. This fear is reminiscent of the dread that fell upon the inhabitants of Canaan when the Israelites approached, as recorded in Joshua. It also reflects the awe and respect that God's power can instill, serving as a type of Christ, who inspires reverence and awe through His authority and victory over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_xerxes.htm">King Xerxes</a></b><br>The Persian king during the time of Esther, also known as Ahasuerus.

They had on their side all the executive of the empire (<a href="/esther/9-3.htm" title="And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell on them.">Esther 9:3</a>), and evidently to all intents and purposes the second edict was considered virtually to repeal the first. The Jews, therefore, being in favour at Court, and, as was not unnatural after their alarm, being now full of indignation and vengeance, were probably resolved to use their opportunities while they had the chance. If so, who could object so long as they did nothing against the authorities? and they, we have seen, were on their side. That they did make a bloody use of their opportunity is shown clearly by <a href="/esther/9-16.htm" title="But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,">Esther 9:16</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Jews gathered themselves together</span>.
