The king's command reflects the irreversible nature of Persian law, as seen in <a href="/esther/1-19.htm">Esther 1:19</a> and <a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8</a>. The king's decision aligns with the divine providence seen throughout the Book of Esther, where God&#8217;s unseen hand guides events to protect His people. The king's command also demonstrates the fulfillment of justice against those who sought to destroy the Jews, echoing the biblical principle of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p><b>An edict was issued in Susa,</b><br>Susa, the capital of the Persian Empire, was a significant city in ancient times, known for its grandeur and as a center of political power. The issuance of an edict in Susa underscores the formal and official nature of the decree, ensuring that it was communicated throughout the empire. This reflects the administrative efficiency of the Persian Empire, which had a sophisticated system for disseminating royal decrees, as seen in <a href="/esther/3-12.htm">Esther 3:12-15</a>. The edict's issuance in Susa also emphasizes the reversal of Haman's earlier decree against the Jews, showcasing God's deliverance and the theme of reversal found throughout the book.<p><b>and they hanged the ten sons of Haman.</b><br>The hanging of Haman's ten sons signifies the complete downfall of Haman's lineage and the eradication of his influence. In ancient Persia, hanging was a common form of execution, often involving impalement or display on a gallows, as a public demonstration of justice. This act fulfills the retributive justice seen in <a href="/esther/7-10.htm">Esther 7:10</a>, where Haman himself was hanged on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai. The destruction of Haman's sons also parallels the biblical theme of the defeat of the enemies of God's people, reminiscent of the Amalekites' fate, Haman's ancestral lineage (<a href="/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14-16</a>). This event foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and death, as seen in <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>, where Christ disarms the powers and authorities, triumphing over them by the cross.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who reigned during the events of the Book of Esther. He is known for his opulent lifestyle and for making significant decisions based on the counsel of others.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>The Jewish queen of Persia who bravely intervened to save her people from annihilation. Her courage and faith are central themes in the book.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>The antagonist of the account, an Agagite who plotted to destroy the Jews.
