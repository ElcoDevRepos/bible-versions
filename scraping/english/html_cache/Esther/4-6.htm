His role highlights the hierarchical structure of the Persian court, where eunuchs often held significant positions. Mordecai, a Jew living in exile, is Esther's cousin and guardian, emphasizing the familial bonds and responsibilities within Jewish culture. This interaction underscores the urgency and secrecy required in their communication, as Mordecai cannot directly approach Esther due to court protocols.<p><b>in the city square</b><br>The city square serves as a public gathering place, often used for commerce, legal matters, and social interaction. It is a strategic location for Mordecai to be visible and accessible, reflecting the openness of his mourning and protest against Haman's decree. The public nature of the square contrasts with the private and restricted access of the royal palace, highlighting the divide between the common people and the ruling elite.<p><b>in front of the king&#8217;s gate</b><br>The king's gate is a significant location, symbolizing authority and governance. It is where official business and legal matters are conducted, and Mordecai's presence there indicates his position as a minor official or someone with access to the palace. This setting is crucial for the unfolding of events, as it allows Mordecai to communicate with Esther through intermediaries like Hathach. The king's gate also represents the boundary between the secular power of the Persian Empire and the divine providence guiding the Jewish people, as seen throughout the Book of Esther.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hathach.htm">Hathach</a></b><br>A eunuch appointed by King Xerxes to attend Queen Esther.
