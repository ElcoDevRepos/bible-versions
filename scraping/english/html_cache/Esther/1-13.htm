These individuals were often well-versed in various fields, including governance, astrology, and history. This practice is seen throughout the Bible, such as in the story of Pharaoh consulting his magicians and wise men in <a href="/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a>. The reliance on advisors highlights the importance of wisdom and counsel in leadership, a theme echoed in <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, which states, "Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety."<p><b>who knew the times</b><br>The phrase "who knew the times" suggests that these wise men had an understanding of the cultural, political, and possibly astrological contexts of the era. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, knowledge of the times often included an understanding of celestial events, which were believed to influence earthly affairs. This is similar to the magi in <a href="/matthew/2.htm">Matthew 2:1-2</a>, who followed the star to find Jesus, indicating their knowledge of the times through astrology.<p><b>for it was customary for him to confer with the experts in law and justice</b><br>The Persian Empire was known for its complex legal system, and it was customary for the king to consult with legal experts to ensure that his decisions were just and in accordance with the law. This reflects the structured governance of the empire, as seen in the Book of Daniel, where laws of the Medes and Persians are described as unchangeable (<a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8</a>). The emphasis on law and justice can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate justice brought by Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>) and embodies divine justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who ruled over a vast empire.

The sons of Issachar &#8220;understood the times and knew what Israel should do&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-32.htm">1 Chronicles 12:32</a>).<p>- <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:5</a> notes, &#8220;A wise heart knows the right time and procedure.&#8221;<p>- Jesus rebuked His generation for failing to &#8220;discern the signs of the times&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/16-3.htm">Matthew 16:3</a>). True discernment remains anchored in God&#8217;s revelation, not shifting trends.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for it was customary for him</b><p>- Royal protocol required consultation; it was the standard operating procedure of the Persian court.<p>- <a href="/2_samuel/16-23.htm">2 Samuel 16:23</a> describes a similar custom: &#8220;The counsel of Ahithophel&#8230; was as if one consulted the word of God.&#8221; Such reliance on advisers could steady or sway a king&#8217;s decisions.<p>- Regular practices, even wise ones, can become empty rituals if detached from righteous motives (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to confer with the experts in law and justice</b><p>- Persian kings governed a vast, diverse empire; sound legal insight was critical (compare <a href="/ezra/7-25.htm">Ezra 7:25</a> regarding Persian authorization of Jewish law experts).<p>- <a href="/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8&#8211;10</a> outlines how Israel&#8217;s leaders were also to seek legal rulings from qualified judges and priests&#8212;principled, not arbitrary, justice.<p>- <a href="/romans/13-3.htm">Romans 13:3&#8211;4</a> later affirms that governmental authority is meant &#8220;to bring fear to those who do wrong,&#8221; underscoring the God-ordained value of just laws.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/1-13.htm">Esther 1:13</a> shows King Ahasuerus following established protocol: seeking counsel from seasoned, culturally astute advisers skilled in legal matters.

Angry as he was, Ahasuerus had still some power of self-restraint. He was in the presence of his whole court, and of a great assembly of the people. It would not be seemly that he should vent his passion in violent words, imprecations, or threats. His dignity required that he should at any rate seem calm, and, instead of issuing any hasty order, should proceed deliberately to consider what were the next steps to be taken. Xerxes appears to have been rather fond of asking advice (Herod., 7:8, 48, 234; 8:101); and he now, in a sufficiently dignified way, required the opinion of his "wise men" on the practical question, What was to be done to Vashti?

Each matter which concerned the king was submitted to learned persons for their opinion before any actual step was taken (compare Herod., 3:31, where Cambyses asks the opinion of the royal judges with respect to his proposed marriage with his sister). It is not a special practice of Ahasuerus, but a general usage of the Persian monarchy, which m noticed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/1-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1428;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
