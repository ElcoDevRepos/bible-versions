In the context of the Persian Empire, where honor and status were highly valued, being singled out by the queen would have been seen as a significant personal achievement. This phrase highlights Haman's arrogance, a character flaw that ultimately leads to his downfall, reminiscent of <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall."<p><b>&#8220;Queen Esther invited no one but me&#8221;</b><br>This exclusivity emphasizes Esther's strategic planning. By inviting only Haman and the king, Esther creates a sense of intimacy and importance, which plays into Haman's ego. It also sets the stage for her to reveal her true intentions. The cultural context of Persian banquets, which were often political in nature, underscores the significance of her invitation.<p><b>&#8220;to join the king at the banquet she prepared,&#8221;</b><br>Banquets in the ancient Near East were not merely social gatherings but were often used for political maneuvering and decision-making. Esther's preparation of the banquet indicates her active role in the unfolding events, contrasting with the passive role women were often expected to play. This reflects the providential theme of God using unexpected means and people to fulfill His purposes, as seen throughout the book of Esther.<p><b>&#8220;and I am invited back tomorrow along with the king.&#8221;</b><br>The repeated invitation suggests Esther's careful and deliberate approach. By inviting Haman again, she ensures that he remains confident and unsuspecting, which is crucial for her plan to succeed. This mirrors the biblical theme of patience and timing, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, "There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens." Esther's actions can also be seen as a type of Christ, who often used wisdom and timing in His ministry to reveal truth and fulfill His mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>A high-ranking official in the Persian Empire, known for his pride and hatred towards the Jews, particularly Mordecai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/q/queen_esther.htm">Queen Esther</a></b><br>A Jewish queen of Persia, known for her bravery and wisdom in saving her people from destruction.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes)</a></b><br>The Persian king, husband to Esther, who is unaware of Haman's plot against the Jews.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_banquet.htm">The Banquet</a></b><br>A private event organized by Queen Esther, strategically planned to reveal Haman's plot to the king.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_persian_empire.htm">The Persian Empire</a></b><br>The setting of the Book of Esther, a vast empire where the Jewish people lived in exile.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride.htm">The Danger of Pride</a></b><br>Haman's pride blinds him to the reality of his situation.

Pride loves a platform, and every added detail feeds the ego (cf. <a href="/proverbs/27-2.htm">Proverbs 27:2</a>, &#8220;Let another praise you, and not your own mouth&#8221;). By beginning with &#8220;What is more,&#8221; Haman piles honor upon honor, blind to how the Lord &#8220;brings low those whose eyes are haughty&#8221; (<a href="/job/40-12.htm">Job 40:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Haman added</b><p>The narrator highlights that these are Haman&#8217;s own words, exposing his heart (<a href="/luke/6-45.htm">Luke 6:45</a>). Just as Nebuchadnezzar once paraded his achievements (<a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>), Haman cannot resist recounting each perceived triumph. Scripture consistently warns that self-exaltation invites divine humbling (<a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Queen Esther invited no one but me</b><p>Haman&#8217;s boast centers on exclusivity. Being singled out by the queen seems to confirm his significance, yet it also intensifies his coming fall, echoing <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>: &#8220;Pride goes before destruction.&#8221; Esther&#8217;s secrecy is God&#8217;s strategy; Haman interprets it as flattery. The Lord is quietly overturning the wicked (<a href="/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to join the king at the banquet she prepared,</b><p>In Persian culture, a royal banquet signified high favor. Haman assumes he is indispensable, but <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a> reminds us, &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is a waterway in the hand of the LORD; He directs it wherever He pleases.&#8221; Esther, under God&#8217;s guidance, has staged a setting where Haman will condemn himself with his own words.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I am invited back tomorrow</b><p>Haman&#8217;s confidence stretches into the future: more honor is on the way. Yet <a href="/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13-16</a> warns against boasting about tomorrow, &#8220;For you are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.&#8221; Haman sees an unbroken chain of success; heaven sees the last link.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with the king.</b><p>Sharing the king&#8217;s company places Haman at the apex of Persian society&#8212;or so he thinks. The irony is thick: Haman plots the annihilation of God&#8217;s people while sitting beside the earthly king, but <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2-4</a> shows that earthly rulers who oppose the Lord&#8217;s purposes provoke His laughter. Haman&#8217;s intimacy with King Ahasuerus cannot shield him from the sovereignty of the King of kings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/5-12.htm">Esther 5:12</a> records a climactic moment of self-congratulation. Each phrase exposes Haman&#8217;s swelling pride and misplaced security, even as God invisibly orchestrates deliverance for His people. The verse is a vivid reminder that human honor, exclusivity, and tomorrow&#8217;s expectations crumble when they rest on arrogance. True safety lies not in feasting with kings but in humbling oneself before the One who &#8220;gives grace to the humble&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/5-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;What is more,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1443;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ap&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_637.htm">Strong's 637: </a> </span><span class="str2">Meaning accession, yea, adversatively though</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Haman</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1503;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;m&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2001.htm">Strong's 2001: </a> </span><span class="str2">Haman -- to rage, be turbulent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">added,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
