The "second time" suggests that this was a recurring event, possibly to replenish the harem or for another purpose related to the king's court. The gathering of virgins reflects the practices of Persian royalty, where the king had the authority to summon women from across the empire. This practice underscores the absolute power of the king and the vulnerability of the subjects, especially women, in the ancient Near Eastern context.<p><b>Mordecai was sitting at the king&#8217;s gate</b><br>Mordecai's presence at the king's gate signifies his role and status within the Persian empire. The king's gate was not merely an entrance but a place of official business and legal matters, akin to a modern-day courthouse or city hall. Mordecai's position here suggests he held a role of some importance, possibly as an official or a judge. This location is significant in the narrative, as it places Mordecai in a position to overhear the plot against the king (<a href="/esther/2-21.htm">Esther 2:21-23</a>), which later becomes crucial for the deliverance of the Jewish people. The king's gate also symbolizes a place of decision-making and authority, foreshadowing Mordecai's rise to power. This setting connects to other biblical instances where city gates are places of judgment and leadership, such as in <a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1-11</a> and <a href="/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/v/virgins.htm">Virgins</a></b><br>These were young women gathered for King Xerxes' selection of a new queen.

This detail is more than a historical footnote; it highlights several truths.<p>- God&#8217;s providence continues behind the scenes. Just as He used the first gathering (<a href="/esther/2-8.htm">Esther 2:8</a>) to bring Esther to the throne, the second gathering sets the stage for future events, including Haman&#8217;s rise and eventual downfall (<a href="/esther/3-1.htm">Esther 3:1&#8211;6</a>; 7:9&#8211;10).<p>- The king&#8217;s appetite for empire-wide beauty contests had not abated. Similar royal searches appear elsewhere&#8212;compare <a href="/1_kings/1-2.htm">1 Kings 1:2&#8211;4</a>, where young women were sought for King David.<p>- The scale of Persian bureaucracy is on display. The repeated process underscores the vast reach of Ahasuerus&#8217; edicts (<a href="/esther/1-22.htm">Esther 1:22</a>; 8:9).<p>- Esther&#8217;s position becomes even more strategic. With new rivals entering the harem, Esther&#8217;s need to rely on the Lord rather than royal favor alone intensifies&#8212;echoing <a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>, &#8220;Do not put your trust in princes.&#8221;<p>- The phrase &#8220;assembled a second time&#8221; links directly to God&#8217;s pattern of working through repetition. He had earlier called Jonah a second time (<a href="/jonah/3-1.htm">Jonah 3:1</a>) and spoke to Samuel repeatedly (<a href="/1_samuel/3-6.htm">1 Samuel 3:6&#8211;10</a>), reminding us that He patiently orchestrates events until His purpose is accomplished.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Mordecai was sitting at the king&#8217;s gate</b><p>The king&#8217;s gate was more than an entrance; it served as the administrative and judicial hub of the empire, much like the city gates in <a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1-2</a> or <a href="/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>. Mordecai&#8217;s presence there signals:<p>- An official position. <a href="/esther/2-21.htm">Esther 2:21</a> refers to &#8220;Mordecai sitting at the king&#8217;s gate&#8221; when he uncovers the assassination plot, showing he held a recognized post. That post later becomes the platform for saving the king and, ultimately, the Jews (<a href="/esther/6-1.htm">Esther 6:1-10</a>).<p>- Vigilance and integrity. Mordecai&#8217;s consistent presence mirrors <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>, avoiding wicked counsel while standing ready to act righteously.<p>- Accessibility to royal information. From this vantage point he overhears the conspiracy (<a href="/esther/2-22.htm">Esther 2:22</a>) and later refuses to bow to Haman (<a href="/esther/3-2.htm">Esther 3:2-4</a>), illustrating <a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a>: &#8220;Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will stand before kings.&#8221;<p>- A foreshadowing of Christ&#8217;s redemptive posture. Just as Mordecai sat in a place of judgment and intercession, Jesus sits at the right hand of the Father (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>), ever living to intercede for His people.<p>- The intertwining of ordinary faithfulness and divine timing. Mordecai is not seeking a spotlight; he is simply doing his job, yet God uses that faithfulness to preserve an entire nation&#8212;paralleling Joseph&#8217;s administrative role in <a href="/genesis/41-39.htm">Genesis 41:39-44</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19</a> highlights two simultaneous realities: a second gathering of virgins reveals the king&#8217;s ongoing self-indulgence and sets the chessboard for God&#8217;s unseen strategy, while Mordecai&#8217;s steady presence at the king&#8217;s gate positions him to act decisively when crisis strikes. The verse reminds believers that the Lord directs both grand imperial decrees and the quiet faithfulness of His servants, weaving them together for His flawless redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/esther/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">And when the virgins</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--Here begins a fresh incident in the history, whose date we cannot fix precisely, save that it falls between the marriage of Esther and the twelfth year of Ahasuerus (<a href="/esther/3-7.htm" title="In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.">Esther 3:7</a>). The king "loved Esther above all the women," but how the word "love "is degraded in this connection is seen by the fact that after she had been his wife certainly less (possibly much less) than five years, there takes place a second gathering of virgins (there is no article in the Hebrew), like the one previously mentioned (<a href="/esther/2-2.htm" title="Then said the king's servants that ministered to him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:">Esther 2:2</a>).

Rather, "When virgins." There is no article. The fact seems to be mentioned simply as furnishing a date, and we must suppose both that there was a second gathering, and that the time when it happened was generally known to the Jews and Persians. Then Mordecai sat, etc. The three verses, 19, 20, 21, hang together, and form a single sentence: "When virgins were gathered together a second time, and Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate - now Esther had not showed her kindred or her people, as Mordecai had charged her; for Esther did the command of Mordecai like as when she was brought up with him - in those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, being of the number of them which kept the threshold, were wroth," etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/2-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the virgins</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#363;&#183;l&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1330.htm">Strong's 1330: </a> </span><span class="str2">A virgin, sometimes, a bride</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were assembled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1445;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;hiq&#183;q&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#234;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124; Verb - Nifal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6908.htm">Strong's 6908: </a> </span><span class="str2">To gather, collect</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a second [time],</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1504;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#234;&#183;n&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - ordinal feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8145.htm">Strong's 8145: </a> </span><span class="str2">Second (an ordinal number)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Mordecai</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1459;&#1499;&#1463;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;do&#183;&#7733;ay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4782.htm">Strong's 4782: </a> </span><span class="str2">Mordecai -- a companion of Zerubbabel, also a cousin of Esther</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was sitting</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1445;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3427.htm">Strong's 3427: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sit down, to dwell, to remain, to settle, to marry</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at the King&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1469;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Gate.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1469;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#353;a&#183;&#8216;ar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8179.htm">Strong's 8179: </a> </span><span class="str2">An opening, door, gate</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/esther/2-19.htm">OT History: Esther 2:19 When the virgins were gathered together (Est Esth.
