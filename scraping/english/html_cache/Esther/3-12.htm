The timing underscores the irony and gravity of the impending decree against the Jews, highlighting a spiritual battle between deliverance and destruction.<p><b>the royal scribes were summoned</b><br>The summoning of scribes indicates the formal and official nature of the decree. Scribes were essential in the Persian Empire for documenting and disseminating royal edicts, ensuring that the king's commands were accurately recorded and communicated.<p><b>and the order was written exactly as Haman commanded</b><br>Haman's influence is evident as the decree is written precisely according to his instructions. This reflects the absolute power he wielded under King Xerxes, and his deep-seated animosity towards the Jewish people, which is rooted in historical enmity between the Amalekites and Israelites.<p><b>the royal satraps, the governors of each province, and the officials of each people</b><br>The extensive list of recipients underscores the vastness of the Persian Empire, which spanned 127 provinces. This hierarchical structure ensured that the decree would reach every corner of the empire, emphasizing the widespread threat to the Jewish population.<p><b>in the script of each province and the language of every people</b><br>The use of multiple scripts and languages highlights the diversity within the Persian Empire and the administrative efficiency required to govern such a vast territory. It also ensured that the decree was understood by all, leaving no room for misinterpretation.<p><b>It was written in the name of King Xerxes</b><br>The decree carried the authority of King Xerxes, making it irrevocable and binding. This reflects the legal system of the Medes and Persians, where a king's edict could not be altered once issued, as seen in the story of Daniel in the lions' den.<p><b>and sealed with the royal signet ring</b><br>The sealing with the king's signet ring authenticated the document, signifying the king's approval and making it official. This act is symbolic of the irreversible nature of the decree, paralleling the sealing of believers with the Holy Spirit as a mark of divine authority and protection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>The antagonist in the Book of Esther, Haman is an Agagite who rises to power in the Persian Empire and plots to destroy the Jewish people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_xerxes.htm">King Xerxes (Ahasuerus)</a></b><br>The Persian king during the events of Esther.

Bishop Wordsworth reminds us that this day was the eve of the Passover, so that Haman's plot against the Jews strangely coincides in time with one five hundred years later, when the Jews themselves, aided by heathen hands and the powers of darkness, sought to vanquish the Saviour; and as the trembling Jews of Persia were delivered by God's goodness, so too by His goodness Satan himself was overthrown and the Lamb that was slain did triumph.<p><span class= "bld">Lieutenants.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">satraps.</span> The Hebrew word here (<span class= "ital">akhashdarpan</span>) is simply an attempt to transliterate the Persian <span class= "ital">khahatrapa,</span> Whence the Greek <span class= "ital">satrapes,</span> and so the English word.

"Scribes"</span> (in the plural) are spoken of as attending on Xerxes throughout the Grecian expedition (Herod., 7:100; 8:90). Such persons were always near at hand in the palace, ready to draw up edicts. <span class="cmt_word">On the thirteenth day of the first month</span>. It is conjectured that Haman cast his lots on the first day of the year (Berthcau), as an auspicious time for taking anything in hand, and having obtained a <span class="accented">thirteenth</span> day for the massacre, adopted the same number as probably auspicious for the necessary appeal to the king. Having gained the king s consent, he sent at once for the scribes. <span class="cmt_word">The king's lieutenants</span>. Literally, "the king's <span class="accented">satraps."</span> The actual Persian word is used, slightly Hebraised. <span class="cmt_word">And to the governors</span>. The word used has been compared with <span class="accented">pasha</span> (Stanley), and again with beg or bey, but is probably distinct from either.
