In Esther's context, it follows her three days of fasting, which aligns with other biblical instances where the third day marks a turning point, such as Jonah's emergence from the fish (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>) and Jesus' resurrection (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>). This timing underscores the gravity and hope of Esther's mission.<p><b>Esther put on her royal robes</b><br>Esther's decision to wear her royal robes signifies her acceptance of her role and authority as queen. It contrasts with her previous humility during fasting and prayer, now presenting herself with dignity and purpose. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who, though humble, is also the King of Kings. Esther's attire symbolizes her readiness to intercede for her people, much like Christ's intercession for humanity.<p><b>and stood in the inner court of the palace</b><br>The inner court of the palace was a place of significant authority and power, accessible only to those with permission. Esther's boldness in standing there without being summoned highlights her courage and the risk she was taking, as approaching the king unsummoned could result in death (<a href="/esther/4-11.htm">Esther 4:11</a>). This act of bravery is reminiscent of the boldness required to approach God, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>.<p><b>across from the king&#8217;s quarters</b><br>Positioning herself across from the king's quarters indicates Esther's strategic approach. She places herself where she can be seen by the king, demonstrating both respect and determination. This positioning is crucial for her plan to succeed, reflecting the importance of wisdom and timing in executing God's will, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, which speaks of the king's heart being in the hand of the Lord.<p><b>The king was sitting on his royal throne</b><br>The king sitting on his royal throne emphasizes his authority and the gravity of Esther's approach. The throne is a symbol of power and judgment, and the king's presence there underscores the potential danger Esther faces. This imagery parallels the divine throne of God, where ultimate authority resides, as depicted in <a href="/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2</a>.<p><b>in the royal courtroom, facing the entrance</b><br>The royal courtroom was a place of judgment and decision-making. The king facing the entrance signifies his readiness to address matters brought before him. Esther's approach to the king in this setting highlights the theme of divine providence and justice, as God orchestrates events for the deliverance of His people, similar to how He works through the courts of heaven for the ultimate good of His followers (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>A Jewish queen of Persia, known for her bravery and wisdom.
