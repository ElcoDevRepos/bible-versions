In ancient Persian society, family and friends were often involved in decision-making processes. This mirrors the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, which emphasizes the importance of seeking counsel. However, the advice given here is morally corrupt, highlighting the danger of ungodly counsel.<p><b>&#8220;Have them build a gallows fifty cubits high</b><br>The gallows, likely a large wooden structure for impalement or hanging, was to be fifty cubits high, approximately 75 feet. This height signifies Haman's extreme pride and desire for public humiliation of Mordecai. The number fifty may also symbolize completeness or fullness in biblical numerology, indicating Haman's complete intent to destroy Mordecai. This act of building a gallows is reminiscent of the prideful actions of other biblical figures who sought to exalt themselves, such as Nebuchadnezzar in <a href="/daniel/3.htm">Daniel 3</a>.<p><b>and ask the king in the morning to have Mordecai hanged on it</b><br>Haman's plan to approach the king in the morning shows his eagerness and confidence in his influence over the king. This reflects the political dynamics of the Persian court, where access to the king was a sign of power. The plot against Mordecai is a direct attack on God's people, echoing the spiritual warfare seen throughout Scripture, such as in the story of Joseph and his brothers in <a href="/genesis/37.htm">Genesis 37</a>.<p><b>Then go to the banquet with the king and enjoy yourself</b><br>Haman's intention to celebrate after Mordecai's execution reveals his callousness and self-centeredness. The banquet, a recurring theme in the Book of Esther, symbolizes the unfolding of God's providential plan. While Haman seeks to enjoy himself, the narrative foreshadows his downfall, aligning with the biblical principle that pride precedes destruction (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p><b>The advice pleased Haman, and he had the gallows constructed</b><br>Haman's satisfaction with the advice and his immediate action to construct the gallows demonstrate his hardened heart and determination to eliminate Mordecai. This reflects the biblical theme of the wicked plotting against the righteous, as seen in <a href="/psalms/37-12.htm">Psalm 37:12-13</a>. The construction of the gallows sets the stage for the dramatic reversal of fortunes that is central to the story of Esther, illustrating God's sovereignty and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>A high-ranking official in the Persian Empire, known for his pride and hatred towards the Jews, particularly Mordecai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zeresh.htm">Zeresh</a></b><br>Haman's wife, who advises him to build a gallows for Mordecai, showing her complicity in Haman's schemes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>A Jew living in Susa, who refuses to bow to Haman, inciting Haman's wrath.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gallows.htm">The Gallows</a></b><br>A structure intended for Mordecai's execution, symbolizing Haman's malice and pride.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_banquet.htm">The Banquet</a></b><br>A feast prepared by Queen Esther, which plays a crucial role in the unfolding of events leading to Haman's downfall.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_pride.htm">The Dangers of Pride</a></b><br>Haman's pride leads him to make irrational decisions.
