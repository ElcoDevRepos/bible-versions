The context is the edict issued by King Ahasuerus, allowing the Jews to defend themselves against those who sought to harm them. This was a reversal of Haman's earlier decree, which had authorized the destruction of the Jewish people. The phrase "put to the sword" indicates a decisive and complete victory, reminiscent of other Old Testament battles where God's people were delivered from their enemies, such as in the battles led by Joshua. This act of self-defense was not just a physical battle but also a spiritual victory, as it demonstrated God's providence and protection over His chosen people.<p><b>killing and destroying them</b><br>The terms "killing and destroying" emphasize the thoroughness of the Jews' actions against their enemies. This reflects the seriousness of the threat they faced and the necessity of their response. Historically, this event took place in the Persian Empire, where the Jews were a minority group. The language used here is similar to that found in other biblical accounts of warfare, such as in the conquest narratives of Canaan, where complete destruction was often commanded to prevent future threats. This also serves as a reminder of the justice of God, who allows His people to defend themselves against those who seek their harm.<p><b>and they did as they pleased to those who hated them</b><br>This phrase indicates the freedom and authority granted to the Jews in dealing with their enemies. It suggests that the Jews were not only victorious but also had the autonomy to decide the fate of those who opposed them. This can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to protect His people and give them victory over their foes. The phrase "those who hated them" underscores the deep-seated animosity that existed against the Jews, which is a recurring theme throughout biblical history. This animosity is often seen as a manifestation of the spiritual battle between God's people and the forces of evil. The victory of the Jews in this instance can be viewed as a type of the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and death, where He will do as He pleases to those who oppose His kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jews.htm">Jews</a></b><br>The Jewish people living in the Persian Empire who were under threat of annihilation due to Haman's decree.
