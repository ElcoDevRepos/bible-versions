As a Jew living in exile in Persia, Mordecai's role is significant in the narrative of Esther. His willingness to act upon Esther's instructions highlights his trust in God's providence and the importance of communal responsibility. Mordecai's journey can be seen as a parallel to the journeys of faith undertaken by other biblical figures, such as Abraham and Moses, who also acted in obedience to God's call.<p><b>and did all</b><br>This phrase underscores the completeness of Mordecai's obedience. In the context of the Jewish faith, obedience to God's will is paramount, and Mordecai's actions reflect a wholehearted commitment to the task at hand. This mirrors the biblical principle found in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which calls for loving God with all one's heart, soul, and strength, indicating that true obedience involves total dedication.<p><b>that Esther had instructed him.</b><br>Esther's role as a leader is emphasized here. Despite the patriarchal society of ancient Persia, Esther's influence and wisdom are acknowledged and respected by Mordecai. This reflects the biblical theme of God using unexpected individuals, including women, to fulfill His purposes, as seen with figures like Deborah in <a href="/judges/4.htm">Judges 4-5</a>. Esther's instructions to Mordecai also foreshadow the intercessory role of Christ, who instructs and guides His followers in the New Testament. Esther's courage and strategic thinking are pivotal in the deliverance of the Jewish people, illustrating the power of faith and action combined.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>A Jew living in Susa, the capital of the Persian Empire, and the cousin and guardian of Esther.

Like Abraham who &#8220;rose early&#8221; to obey God (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>) and the disciples who &#8220;immediately left their nets&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/4-20.htm">Matthew 4:20</a>), Mordecai responds promptly.<p>&#8226; His going signals trust that God can work through the unlikely setting of a pagan palace just as He once acted through Joseph in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-38.htm">Genesis 41:38-41</a>).<p>&#8226; The simple verb highlights courage. Mordecai had been mourning in sackcloth (<a href="/esther/4-1.htm">Esther 4:1</a>), yet he now shifts from lament to action, mirroring Nehemiah&#8217;s pattern of praying and then building (<a href="/nehemiah/4-9.htm">Nehemiah 4:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and did</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; and did &#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Obedience is not complete until intentions become deeds.

Now Mordecai submits to Esther&#8217;s God-given role, reflecting the mutual humility urged in <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>.<p>&#8226; He trusts the wisdom God placed in Esther, echoing <a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>: &#8220;Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This cooperation knits the covenant people together, preparing the ground for their rescue (<a href="/esther/8-11.htm">Esther 8:11-17</a>) and displaying the harmony found where each member serves the other (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-21.htm">1 Corinthians 12:21-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/4-17.htm">Esther 4:17</a> captures decisive obedience.
