This reflects her position of influence within the Persian court. Hathach, a eunuch, was a trusted servant, indicating the level of confidentiality and trust Esther required. Eunuchs often held significant roles in royal courts due to their perceived loyalty and inability to establish competing dynasties.<p><b>one of the king&#8217;s eunuchs appointed to her</b><br>Eunuchs were commonly employed in ancient Near Eastern courts, often serving in roles that required discretion and loyalty. Hathach being appointed to Esther suggests that she had her own retinue, highlighting her status and the trust the king placed in her. This also underscores the Persian practice of assigning eunuchs to serve royal women, ensuring their security and privacy.<p><b>and she dispatched him to Mordecai</b><br>Esther's decision to send Hathach to Mordecai shows her concern and proactive nature.
