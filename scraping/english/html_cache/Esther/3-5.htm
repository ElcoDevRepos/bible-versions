The Agagites were descendants of Agag, king of the Amalekites, traditional enemies of Israel (1 Samuel 15). Mordecai, a Jew, refused to bow to Haman, which can be seen as an act of defiance rooted in Jewish law and tradition that forbids idolatry and the worship of anyone other than God (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). This refusal highlights the tension between the Jewish people and their oppressors, a recurring theme in the Old Testament. Mordecai's actions can be compared to those of Daniel, who also refused to bow to foreign powers (<a href="/daniel/3-12.htm">Daniel 3:12</a>).<p><b>he was filled with rage</b><br>Haman's reaction is one of intense anger, which is significant in the context of the Persian court, where honor and respect were paramount. His rage can be seen as a reflection of his pride and desire for power, traits that are often condemned in Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). This anger sets the stage for Haman's plot against the Jews, echoing the enmity between the descendants of Esau (Amalekites) and Jacob (Israelites). Haman's wrath is reminiscent of other biblical figures who sought to destroy God's people, such as Pharaoh in Exodus. This narrative foreshadows the ultimate deliverance of the Jews, pointing to God's sovereignty and protection over His chosen people, a theme that culminates in the New Testament with the salvation offered through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>A high-ranking official in the Persian Empire, appointed by King Xerxes.

Earlier, Mordecai had already refused, explaining that he was a Jew (<a href="/esther/3-3.htm">Esther 3:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Refusal to bow echoes the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>) and anticipates Daniel&#8217;s friends before Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s image (<a href="/daniel/3-14.htm">Daniel 3:14-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Personal courage can be lonely: &#8220;Even if everyone turns away, I will not&#8221; (cf. <a href="/matthew/26-33.htm">Matthew 26:33</a>), yet God honors the lone voice that remains faithful (2 Chron 16:9).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or pay him homage</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;or pay him homage&#8230;&#8221; clarifies the kind of bowing involved&#8212;reverence bordering on worship.<p>&#8226; Respecting authority is biblical (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a>), but giving glory reserved for God alone is idolatry (<a href="/luke/4-8.htm">Luke 4:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-8.htm">Revelation 22:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Mordecai models the balance: honor the king (<a href="/esther/2-21.htm">Esther 2:21-23</a>) yet worship only God. That tension still guides believers who navigate governmental demands (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he was filled with rage</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;he was filled with rage.&#8221; Anger saturates Haman like poison flooding a vessel.<p>&#8226; Unchecked wrath breeds murder (<a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5-8</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12</a>). Haman&#8217;s fury will soon aim at annihilating an entire people (<a href="/esther/3-6.htm">Esther 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Proverbs warns, &#8220;A quick-tempered man acts foolishly&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/14-17.htm">Proverbs 14:17</a>), and James adds, &#8220;Man&#8217;s anger does not bring about the righteousness of God&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-20.htm">James 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Contrast Christ, who &#8220;when He suffered, He did not threaten&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>). Haman illustrates the opposite: perceived disrespect ignites destructive vengeance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/3-5.htm">Esther 3:5</a> captures a collision between pride and principled conviction. Haman&#8217;s ego requires universal applause; Mordecai&#8217;s conscience bows only to God. The verse exposes how fragile human glory is&#8212;one dissenting spectator shatters it and unleashes murderous rage. For believers today, Mordecai&#8217;s steadfastness invites loyalty to God above cultural pressure, while Haman&#8217;s fury warns that pride tolerated in the heart can rapidly become hatred acted in the world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Haman saw</span>. Apparently Mordecai's disrespect had not been observed by Haman until the "king's servants" called his attention to it. Then, naturally enough, he was greatly offended, and felt exceedingly angry at what seemed to him a gross impertinence. Mordecai's excuse did not pacify him - perhaps seemed to him to make the matter worse, since, if allowed, it would justify all the Jews in the empire in withholding from him the respect that he considered his due. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/3-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Haman</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1428;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;m&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2001.htm">Strong's 2001: </a> </span><span class="str2">Haman -- to rage, be turbulent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
