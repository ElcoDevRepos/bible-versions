Her decree, issued with the authority of the king, highlights her influence and the divine providence at work. This decree is a testament to her courage and wisdom, as she navigated the complexities of Persian law and politics. Esther's actions can be seen as a type of Christ, as she interceded for her people, risking her own life for their salvation.<p><b>confirmed these regulations about Purim</b><br>The regulations refer to the observance of Purim, a festival commemorating the deliverance of the Jewish people from Haman's plot to annihilate them. The confirmation of these regulations ensured that the celebration of Purim would be an enduring tradition. This festival is marked by joy, feasting, and the giving of gifts, reflecting the themes of reversal and divine intervention. The establishment of Purim is a reminder of God's faithfulness and protection over His people, similar to the Passover in its commemoration of deliverance.<p><b>which were written into the record</b><br>The recording of these events signifies their importance and permanence. In ancient times, written records were crucial for preserving history and legal decrees. This documentation ensured that future generations would remember the miraculous deliverance and the establishment of Purim.

The word &#8220;So&#8221; ties this verse to the flow of the narrative that began when Mordecai &#8220;recorded these events&#8221; and sent letters to all the Jews (<a href="/esther/9-20.htm">Esther 9:20&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; It signals that everything that follows is the natural culmination of the deliverance God provided in the previous chapters (<a href="/esther/3-1.htm">Esther 3:1&#8211;6</a>; 8:11).<p>&#8226; Like the &#8220;Therefore&#8221; in <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, it urges us to see doctrine leading to decisive action by God&#8217;s people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Esther&#8217;s decree</b><p>&#8226; Though Mordecai had already written, the queen herself now issues a decree, underscoring her God-given influence (<a href="/esther/8-8.htm">Esther 8:8</a>; 8:15&#8211;17).<p>&#8226; God raised Esther &#8220;for such a time as this&#8221; (<a href="/esther/4-14.htm">Esther 4:14</a>); her decree is the faith-filled response to that calling.<p>&#8226; Compare Deborah&#8217;s leadership in <a href="/judges/4-4.htm">Judges 4:4&#8211;7</a>, showing that God can work through those He places in authority, regardless of cultural expectations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Confirmed</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Confirmed&#8221; shows the decree was ratified, settled, unchangeable&#8212;just as the irrevocable laws of the Medes and Persians (<a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8</a>).<p>&#8226; This final affirmation mirrors God&#8217;s own unchanging word: &#8220;The word of our God stands forever&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>).<p>&#8226; It reassures every generation that the celebration of God&#8217;s deliverance is not optional or temporary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>These regulations about Purim</b><p>&#8226; The regulations had already been outlined: two days of feasting, joy, sending portions and gifts to the poor (<a href="/esther/9-21.htm">Esther 9:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Purim commemorates reversal&#8212;sorrow turned to joy&#8212;foreshadowing the greater salvation in Christ (<a href="/john/16-20.htm">John 16:20-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Like the Passover memorial (<a href="/exodus/12-24.htm">Exodus 12:24-27</a>), Purim instructs future generations to remember God&#8217;s mighty acts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Which were written into the record</b><p>&#8226; Writing preserves memory; God commanded similar recordings of His works in <a href="/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/30-2.htm">Jeremiah 30:2</a>.<p>&#8226; A written record provides accountability&#8212;no one could later dispute what was decreed (<a href="/esther/3-12.htm">Esther 3:12</a> vs. 8:5).<p>&#8226; It anticipates the &#8220;books&#8221; opened before God (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>), reminding us that God&#8217;s works and our responses are eternally noted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/esther/9-32.htm">Esther 9:32</a> seals the institution of Purim. The little word &#8220;So&#8221; links the verse to God&#8217;s prior deliverance. Esther&#8217;s personal decree, now confirmed, makes the celebration binding. The detailed regulations emphasize joyful remembrance and generosity, and the written record guarantees permanence. The verse calls believers to honor God&#8217;s acts of salvation with enduring, wholehearted celebration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/esther/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">In</span> <span class= "bld">the book.</span>--It is doubtful what "the book" here means. The Vulgate explains it of the Book of Esther itself, and so many modern scholars. Still "the book" hardly seems a natural Hebrew way of referring to a work on the part of its author as he writes it, and no similar case is adducible. Others think it must have been a book written at the time on the subject of the festival, which is, perhaps, possible. Canon Rawlinson identifies it with "the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia."
