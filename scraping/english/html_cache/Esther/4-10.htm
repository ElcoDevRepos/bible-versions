This highlights the hierarchical and structured nature of the Persian court, where direct communication was often mediated by trusted servants. The use of intermediaries was common in ancient royal settings, reflecting the protocols and security measures of the time. Esther's reliance on Hathach underscores her position within the palace, where she is somewhat isolated from the outside world, including her cousin Mordecai.<p><b>and instructed him to tell Mordecai</b><br>Mordecai, Esther's cousin and guardian, plays a crucial role in the narrative as a leader among the Jewish exiles in Persia. Esther's instructions to Hathach to communicate with Mordecai demonstrate the urgency and gravity of the situation, as Mordecai had informed her of Haman's plot to annihilate the Jews. This phrase indicates the trust and respect between Esther and Mordecai, as well as the importance of their collaboration in the unfolding events. The communication between Esther and Mordecai through Hathach also reflects the limitations placed on Esther as a woman in the Persian court, where her movements and interactions were restricted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>A Jewish queen of Persia, originally named Hadassah, who was chosen by King Xerxes (Ahasuerus) to be his queen.
