Esther's role as queen is pivotal in the narrative, showcasing God's providence in placing her in a position to save her people. Her relationship with the king is central to the unfolding events, reflecting the importance of divine timing and placement.<p><b>In the citadel of Susa</b><br>Susa, the capital of the Persian Empire, serves as the setting for much of the Book of Esther. Archaeological findings confirm its grandeur and significance. The citadel was a fortified area, indicating the strategic importance of the events taking place there. Susa's prominence underscores the widespread impact of the Jews' deliverance.<p><b>the Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men</b><br>This phrase indicates the Jews' successful defense against their enemies. The number signifies a significant victory, reflecting the reversal of fortune from potential annihilation to triumph. It also demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promise to protect His people, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>including Haman&#8217;s ten sons</b><br>The mention of Haman's sons highlights the complete downfall of Haman's lineage, fulfilling the retributive justice theme. Haman's plot against the Jews backfires, leading to the destruction of his family. This echoes the biblical principle of divine justice, where the wicked face consequences for their actions.<p><b>What have they done in the rest of the royal provinces?</b><br>The king's inquiry suggests the widespread nature of the conflict and the Jews' actions beyond Susa. It emphasizes the vastness of the Persian Empire and the extensive reach of the decree allowing the Jews to defend themselves. This question also sets the stage for understanding the full scope of the Jews' deliverance.<p><b>Now what is your petition?</b><br>The king's willingness to grant Esther's request highlights her favor and influence. It reflects the biblical theme of intercession, where Esther acts as a mediator for her people. This mirrors the role of Christ as an intercessor, advocating on behalf of humanity before God.<p><b>It will be given to you.</b><br>The assurance of the king's support underscores the certainty of Esther's influence and the divine orchestration behind the events. It reflects the biblical promise that God hears and answers the prayers of His people, as seen in various scriptures.<p><b>And what further do you request?</b><br>The king's openness to additional requests indicates his trust and favor towards Esther. It highlights the theme of abundant provision, where God not only meets needs but exceeds expectations. This mirrors the New Testament teaching of God's generosity and willingness to bless His people.<p><b>It will be fulfilled.</b><br>The king's promise of fulfillment underscores the certainty and authority of his word. It reflects the biblical assurance that God's promises are sure and will come to pass. This phrase encapsulates the theme of divine faithfulness and the ultimate triumph of God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahasuerus.htm">King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I)</a></b><br>The Persian king who reigned over 127 provinces from India to Cush.
