Adar is the twelfth month in the Hebrew calendar, typically falling in February or March. This timing is crucial as it precedes the celebration of Purim, a festival commemorating the deliverance of the Jewish people from Haman's plot. The events of this day highlight the reversal of fortune for the Jews, a common theme in biblical narratives, where God intervenes to protect His chosen people.<p><b>and on the fourteenth day they rested</b><br>The rest on the fourteenth day signifies the completion of their victory and the cessation of conflict. In biblical terms, rest often symbolizes peace and divine blessing, reminiscent of God's rest on the seventh day of creation. This rest is not merely physical but also spiritual, as it marks a time of reflection and gratitude for divine deliverance. The concept of rest is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>, which speaks of a Sabbath rest for the people of God.<p><b>making it a day of feasting and joy</b><br>Feasting and joy are central to the celebration of Purim, which is established in the following verses. This day of celebration is a response to God's providence and protection, turning a day of potential destruction into one of triumph and thanksgiving. Feasting in the Bible often accompanies significant religious events, such as the Passover (Exodus 12) and the Wedding at Cana (John 2), symbolizing fellowship and divine blessing. The joy experienced by the Jews is a fulfillment of the promise found in <a href="/psalms/30-11.htm">Psalm 30:11</a>, where mourning is turned into dancing.
