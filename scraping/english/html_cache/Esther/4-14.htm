The historical context is the Persian Empire during the reign of King Xerxes (Ahasuerus), where a decree has been issued to annihilate the Jewish people. Esther, a Jew herself, is in a unique position as queen. The cultural context emphasizes the risk Esther faces in approaching the king uninvited, which could result in her death. Theologically, this phrase suggests the importance of speaking out against injustice and the responsibility of those in positions of influence to act.<p><b>relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place</b><br>This statement reflects a strong belief in God's providence and faithfulness to His covenant with Israel. It implies that God's plans are not thwarted by human inaction. Theologically, it underscores the idea that God is sovereign and will fulfill His promises, as seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the stories of Joseph and Moses. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's deliverance, as seen in the Exodus narrative.<p><b>but you and your father&#8217;s house will perish</b><br>This warning to Esther indicates the potential consequences of inaction, not just for her but for her family line. Historically, this reflects the precarious nature of life in the Persian court, where political fortunes could change rapidly. Theologically, it suggests the principle of accountability and the idea that failing to act in accordance with God's will can lead to personal and familial consequences, as seen in the stories of Saul and Eli.<p><b>And who knows if perhaps you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?</b><br>This phrase suggests divine providence and purpose in Esther's rise to queenship. It implies that her position is not coincidental but part of a larger divine plan. This echoes the biblical theme of God using individuals for His purposes, as seen in the lives of Joseph, David, and Daniel. Theologically, it points to the idea that God places people in specific situations to fulfill His purposes, a concept that resonates with the New Testament teaching on the body of Christ and spiritual gifts. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who came at the appointed time for the salvation of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esther.htm">Esther</a></b><br>A Jewish queen of Persia, originally named Hadassah, who is faced with the challenge of saving her people from a decree of destruction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>Esther's cousin and guardian, who urges her to use her position to intervene with King Xerxes on behalf of the Jewish people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_xerxes.htm">King Xerxes (Ahasuerus)</a></b><br>The Persian king who unknowingly signed a decree that endangered the Jewish population.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>The antagonist who plotted the destruction of the Jews, motivated by his hatred for Mordecai.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/susa.htm">Susa (Shushan)</a></b><br>The capital of the Persian Empire where these events unfold.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_providence.htm">Divine Providence</a></b><br>Recognize that God orchestrates events and positions individuals for His purposes, even when His presence is not overtly mentioned.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_faith.htm">Courage in Faith</a></b><br>Esther's account encourages believers to act courageously in faith, trusting God's plan even in the face of danger.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_and_opportunity.htm">Responsibility and Opportunity</a></b><br>Believers are called to recognize and seize opportunities to serve God's purposes, understanding that their unique positions are not by chance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intercession_and_advocacy.htm">Intercession and Advocacy</a></b><br>Like Esther, Christians are called to intercede and advocate for others, using their influence to bring about justice and mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Trust that God will accomplish His purposes, whether through us or through others, but be willing to be used by Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Esther_4_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Esther 4:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Esther_4_14_God_s_timing_in_life.htm">How does Esther 4:14 encourage us to recognize God's timing in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Divine_purpose_in_for_such_a_time.htm">What does "for such a time as this" reveal about divine purpose?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Esther_4_14_Courage_in_tough_times.htm">How can Esther 4:14 inspire us to act courageously in difficult situations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_do_Esther_4_14_and_Romans_8_28_relate.htm">In what ways does Esther 4:14 connect with Romans 8:28 about God's plans?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_discern_God_s_call_in_Esther_4_14.htm">How can we discern God's calling in our lives, as seen in Esther 4:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Esther_4_14_Divine_purpose_duty.htm">What does Esther 4:14 suggest about divine purpose and individual responsibility?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Esther_4_14_God_s_role_in_human_events.htm">How does Esther 4:14 reflect God's sovereignty in human affairs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Key_context_for_Esther_4_14.htm">What historical context is essential to understanding Esther 4:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_esther_4.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Esther 4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_reconcile_esther_4_14_with_no_god.htm">How do we reconcile Esther 4:14&#8217;s mention of deliverance with the absence of God&#8217;s name throughout the book?

Like Esther, we are positioned on purpose; when critical moments arise, obedience lets us experience the very reason we are alive &#8220;for such a time as this.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/esther/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Enlargement.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">a breathing-space.</span><p><span class= "bld">From another place.</span>--Although he does not explain his meaning, and, indeed, seems to be speaking with studied reserve, still we may suppose that Mordecai here refers to Divine help, which he asserts will be vouchsafed in this extremity. It does not necessarily follow that we are to see in this declaration a proof of the earnestness of Mordecai's faith; probably had his faith been like that of many of his countrymen he would not have been in Persia at all, but with the struggling band in Judaea.<p><span class= "bld">Thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed.</span>--That is, by the hand of God, who having raised thee to this pitch of glory and power will require it from thee, if thou fail in that which it plainly devolves upon thee to do. It is clear there is a good deal of force in these last words of Mordecai. Esther's rise had been so marvellous that one might well see in it the hand of God, and if so there was clearly a very special object in view, which it must be her anxious care to work for. In the whole tone of the conversation, however, there seems a lack of higher and more noble feelings, an absence of any suggestion of turning for aid to God; and thus in return, when God carries out His purpose, and grants deliverance, it seems done indirectly, without the conferring of any special blessing on the human instruments.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then shall there enlargemt, or respiration</span> (<span class="accented">marg</span>. literally, "breath"), <span class="cmt_word">and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place</span>. Mordecai is confident that God will not allow the destruction of his people. Without naming his name, he implies a trust in his gracious promises, and a conviction that Haman's purpose will be frustrated; how, he knows not, but certainly in some way or other. If deliverance does not come through Esther, then it will arise from some other quarter<span class="cmt_word">. But thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed</span>. A denunciation of Divine vengeance. Though the nation will be saved, it will not benefit you. On you will fall a just judgment - having endeavoured to save your life, you will lose it - and your "father's house will be involved in your ruin. We may gather from this that Esther was not Abihail's only child. <span class="cmt_word">Who knoweth</span>, etc. Consider this also. Perhaps (who knows?) God has raised you up to your royal dignity for this very purpose, and none other, that you should be in a position to save your nation in this crisis. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/4-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you remain</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#234;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2790.htm">Strong's 2790: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cut in, engrave, plow, devise</span><br /><br /><span class="word">silent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#238;&#183;&#353;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2790.htm">Strong's 2790: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cut in, engrave, plow, devise</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1514;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
