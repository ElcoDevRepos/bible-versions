The Jewish people, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, were often seen as distinct due to their monotheistic beliefs and cultural practices. Historically, Jews in Persia were a minority group, having been exiled from their homeland. This identity often led to tension with surrounding nations, as seen in various biblical accounts.<p><b>he scorned the notion of laying hands on Mordecai alone</b><br>Haman's disdain for Mordecai is not just personal but extends to a broader prejudice against the Jewish people. This reflects a pattern of anti-Semitism that has recurred throughout history. The idea of "laying hands" suggests a violent intent, which in biblical terms often implies a desire for execution or punishment. Haman's scorn indicates a deep-seated hatred that goes beyond a personal vendetta.<p><b>Instead, he sought to destroy all of Mordecai&#8217;s people, the Jews</b><br>Haman's plan to annihilate the Jews is reminiscent of other biblical accounts where God's people faced existential threats, such as Pharaoh's decree in Exodus to kill Hebrew male infants. This genocidal intent foreshadows later historical events where Jews faced persecution. Theologically, this reflects the spiritual battle against God's chosen people, who are often targeted by evil forces.<p><b>throughout the kingdom of Xerxes</b><br>The kingdom of Xerxes, also known as Ahasuerus, was vast, stretching from India to Ethiopia. This geographical expanse underscores the magnitude of the threat against the Jews, as it encompassed a significant portion of the known world at the time. The Persian Empire's administrative efficiency meant that such a decree could be swiftly enacted across diverse regions, increasing the peril for the Jewish people. This context highlights the miraculous nature of their eventual deliverance, as orchestrated by God through Esther and Mordecai.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/haman.htm">Haman</a></b><br>A high-ranking official in the Persian Empire, known for his pride and hatred towards the Jews, particularly Mordecai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mordecai.htm">Mordecai</a></b><br>A Jew living in Susa, the capital of the Persian Empire, who refused to bow to Haman, inciting Haman's wrath.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jews.htm">Jews</a></b><br>The people of Mordecai, living throughout the Persian Empire, who became the target of Haman's genocidal plot.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/x/xerxes.htm">Xerxes (Ahasuerus)</a></b><br>The king of Persia during this time, under whose reign the events of the Book of Esther occur.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/susa.htm">Susa</a></b><br>The capital city of the Persian Empire, where the royal palace was located and where much of the account of Esther unfolds.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride_and_hatred.htm">The Danger of Pride and Hatred</a></b><br>Haman's pride and hatred led him to plot the destruction of an entire people.

If Haman had simply said to Ahasuerus, "There is one of your menials who persistently disobeys a royal edict, and at the same time insults me," Ahasuerus would, as a matter of course, have told him to put the menial to death. But the revengeful temper of the man was such that this seemed to him insufficient. Mordecai had insulted him as a Jew, and the Jews should pay the penalty. Mordecai should be punished not only in person, but in his kindred, if he had any, and in his nation. The nation itself was contumacious and troublesome (ver. 8); it would be well to get rid of it. And it would be a grand thing to wipe out an insult offered by an individual in the blood of a whole people. Haman therefore <span class="cmt_word">sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus</span>. Massacres on a large scale - not unknown in the West, witness St. Bartholomew's - are of frequent occurrence in the East, where human life is not held in much regard, and the caprices of absolute monarchs determine the course of history. There had been a general massacre of the Magi upon the accession of Darius Hystaspis, the father of Xerxes (Herod., 3:79), and one of Scythians about a century before (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 1.106). These were examples which might occur to Haman. A later one is the Roman massacre of Mithridates in <span class="date">B.C. 88</span>. <p> CHAPTER 3:7-15 HAMAN CASTS LOTS TO OBTAIN A LUCKY DAY FOR HIS ENTERPRISE, AND OBTAINS A DAY IN THE MONTH ADAR, THE LAST MONTH OF THE YEAR (<a href="/esther/3-7.htm">Esther 3:7</a>). Having determined on a general massacre of the Jews on a given day, as the best mode of ridding the empire of them, Haman thought it of supreme importance, to select for the massacre a propitious and fortunate day. Lucky and unlucky days are recognised generally throughout the East; and it is a wide-spread practice, when any affair of consequence is taken in hand, to obtain a determination of the time for commencing it, or carrying it into effect, by calling in the arbitrement of Chance. Haman had recourse to "the lot," and by means of it obtained, as the fight day for his purpose, the 13th of Adar, which was more than ten months distant.
