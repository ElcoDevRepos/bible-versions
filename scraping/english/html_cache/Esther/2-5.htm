It served as a winter residence for Persian kings. The citadel was a fortified area within the city, indicating its importance and strategic significance. The setting in Susa highlights the Jewish diaspora living under Persian rule after the Babylonian exile, as described in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.<p><b>a Jewish man</b><br>This phrase identifies Mordecai as part of the Jewish community living in exile. The Jewish people were dispersed throughout the Persian Empire following the Babylonian captivity, which began in 586 BC. Despite being in a foreign land, Mordecai maintained his Jewish identity, which is central to the narrative of Esther and the preservation of the Jewish people.<p><b>from the tribe of Benjamin</b><br>The tribe of Benjamin was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, known for its warriors and its close association with the tribe of Judah. King Saul, Israel's first king, was also from the tribe of Benjamin, establishing a historical connection. This tribal affiliation emphasizes Mordecai's heritage and links him to the broader history of Israel.<p><b>named Mordecai</b><br>Mordecai's name is of Babylonian origin, possibly derived from the god Marduk, reflecting the cultural assimilation that occurred during the exile. Despite this, Mordecai's actions throughout the Book of Esther demonstrate his faithfulness to God and his people. His role as a protector and advisor to Esther is pivotal in the deliverance of the Jewish people.<p><b>son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish</b><br>This genealogy connects Mordecai to Kish, the father of King Saul, reinforcing his Benjaminite lineage. The mention of Shimei may recall the Shimei who cursed David (<a href="/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5-13</a>), though the connection is not explicit.

The character of Mordecai strikes us at the outset as that of an ambitious, worldly man; who, though numbers of his tribe had returned to the land of their fathers, preferred to remain behind on the alien soil. The heroic lament of the exiles by Babel's streams, who would not sing the Lord's song in a strange land, who looked with horror at the thought that Jerusalem should be forgotten--such were not Mordecai's thoughts, far from it: why endure hardships, when there is a chance of his adopted daughter's beauty catching the eye of the sensual king, when through her he may vanquish his rival, and become that king's chief minister?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/esther/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now in Shushan... there was a certain Jew</span>.
