This banquet, like others in the Book of Esther, underscores the opulence of King Xerxes' reign.

This public recognition would have solidified her position and influence within the royal court. It also foreshadows her future role in saving her people, as her elevated status becomes crucial in the narrative.<p><b>for all his officials and servants</b><br>The inclusion of both officials and servants indicates the hierarchical structure of the Persian court, where the king's favor and decisions impacted all levels of society. This gathering would have been an opportunity for the king to reinforce loyalty among his subjects, a common practice in ancient monarchies.<p><b>He proclaimed a tax holiday in the provinces</b><br>A tax holiday would have been a significant gesture of goodwill, likely intended to celebrate Esther's coronation and to gain favor among the populace. This act reflects the king's authority over the vast Persian Empire, which extended from India to Cush, as described in <a href="/esther/1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>. It also demonstrates the king's ability to impact the daily lives of his subjects.<p><b>and gave gifts worthy of the king&#8217;s bounty</b><br>The giving of gifts was a customary practice in ancient royal courts, symbolizing the king's generosity and wealth. These gifts would have been lavish, reflecting the king's status and the prosperity of his reign.

As Persian kings were in the habit of doing on every joyful occasion. <span class="cmt_word">Even Esther's feast</span>. It seems to be meant that the feast was one which continued to be spoken about, and which was commonly known under this title. <span class="cmt_word">And he made a release to the provinces</span>. As the Pseudo-Smerdis had done when he usurped the throne (Herod., 3:67). A "release" was an exemption from taxation, or from military service, or from both, for a specified period. <span class="cmt_word">And gave gifts, according to the state of the king</span>. Literally, that is, "in right royal fashion" (see <a href="/esther/1-7.htm">Esther 1:7</a>). The practice of making presents, so common in the East at all times, was much in vogue among the Persians, and was practised especially by the monarchs (Herod., 1:136; 3:135; 7:26; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 8:2, &sect; 7, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>; 'Anab.,' 1:9, &sect; 22, etc.). <p> CHAPTER 2:19-23 MORDECAI'S DISCOVERY OF A PLOT AGAINST AHASUERUS' LIFE (<a href="/esther/2-19.htm">Esther 2:19-23</a>). Some time after Esther had been made queen, there was a second collection of virgins at Susa (ver. 19), under circumstances which are not related, and which were probably of small importance. <span class="accented">At this time</span> (ver. 21) Mordecai, still serving in his humble office at the palace gate, from which he had not been advanced, since Esther had told no one that he was her relation (ver. 20), happened to detect a conspiracy against the king's life, which had been formed by two of the palace eunuchs, Bigthan and Tercsh, whom Ahasuerus had somehow offended (ver. 21). Being still in the habit of holding communication with Esther, Mordecai was able to make her acquainted with the facts, of which she then informed the king, telling him how she had obtained her knowledge (ver. 22). There was nothing surprising or suspicious in a eunuch of the palace having had speech with the queen, especially when he had intelligence of such importance to impart to her. On inquiry, the king found that Mordecai's information was correct; the conspiracy was laid bare, and the conspirators put to death (ver. 23) - the facts being, as was sure to be the case, entered in the court chronicle, a daily record of the life of the court, and of the circumstances that befell the king. It was to have been expected that Mordecai would have been rewarded for his zeal; but somehow or other it happened that his services were overlooked he was neither promoted from his humble office, nor did he receive any gift (<a href="/esther/6-3.htm">Esther 6:3</a>). This was quite contrary to ordinary Persian practice; but the court generally may have disliked Mordecai because he was a Jew. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/2-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1436;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
