The twelfth year of his reign would be around 474 BC. This timing is significant as it places the events of Esther within the broader context of Persian history, during a period of relative stability and expansion for the empire. Xerxes is known for his failed invasion of Greece, which occurred earlier in his reign, and this historical backdrop provides insight into the political climate of the time.<p><b>in the first month, the month of Nisan</b><br>Nisan is the first month of the Jewish religious calendar, corresponding to March-April in the Gregorian calendar. It is a significant month for the Jewish people, as it includes the celebration of Passover, commemorating their deliverance from Egypt. The mention of Nisan highlights the providential timing of the events in Esther, as the Jewish people are once again facing a threat to their existence, echoing the themes of deliverance and divine intervention.<p><b>the Pur (that is, the lot) was cast before Haman</b><br>Casting lots was a common practice in ancient cultures to make decisions or determine fate, believed to reveal divine will. The term "Pur" is of Persian origin, indicating the influence of Persian culture on the narrative. Haman, the antagonist in the story, uses this method to decide the date for the planned destruction of the Jews, showing his reliance on chance rather than divine guidance. This act of casting lots contrasts with the Jewish understanding of God's sovereignty over events.<p><b>to determine a day and month</b><br>Haman's intention was to find an auspicious date for his plot against the Jews. The use of lots to determine the timing underscores the randomness and impersonal nature of his plan, in contrast to the personal and covenantal relationship the Jews have with God. This phrase also foreshadows the eventual reversal of Haman's plans, as the date chosen by lot becomes a day of deliverance rather than destruction.<p><b>And the lot fell on the twelfth month, the month of Adar</b><br>Adar is the twelfth month of the Jewish calendar, corresponding to February-March. The selection of this month gives the Jewish people nearly a year to prepare for the impending threat, allowing for the unfolding of God's providential plan through Esther and Mordecai. The eventual deliverance of the Jews during the month of Adar is celebrated in the festival of Purim, named after the "Pur" or lot, highlighting the theme of divine reversal and protection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_xerxes.htm">King Xerxes</a></b><br>Also known as Ahasuerus, he was the Persian king during the events of the Book of Esther.

It is doubtless connected with the Latin <span class= "ital">pars, portio.</span> and the English <span class= "ital">part.</span> The people who cast Pur were seeking for a lucky day, as indicated by the lots, for the purpose in hand. A lot was cast for each day of the month, and for each month in the year, and in some way or other one day and one mouth were indicated as the most favourable. The notion of lucky and unlucky days seems to have been prevalent in the East in early times. and iudeed has, to a certain extent. found credence in the West.<p><span class= "bld">The twelfth month.</span>--The lucky month is thus indicated, but not the day.

The superstitious use of lots has always been prevalent in the East, and continues to the present day. Lots were drawn, or thrown, m various ways: sometimes by means of dice, sometimes by slips of wood, or strips of parchment or paper, and also in other manners. Even the Jews supposed a special Providence to preside over the casting of lots (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>), and thought that matters decided in this way were decided by God. Haman appears to have cast lots, first, as to the day of the month which he should fix for the massacre, and secondly as to the month in which it should take place. Apparently the lot fell out for the thirteenth day (ver. 13), and for the twelfth month, the last month in the year. The word "Pur" is not Hebrew it is supposed to be Old Persian, and to be connected with Mod. Pers. <span class="accented">pareh</span>, Lat<span class="accented">. pars</span>, Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>.

The month so named corresponded nearly with March, when the sun begins to have great power in Western Asia. HAMAN PERSUADES AHASUERUS TO PUBLISH A DECREE COMMANDING THE DESTRUCTION OF ALL THE JEWS IN HIS KINGDOM ON THE ENSUING THIRTEENTH DAY OF ADAR (<a href="/esther/3-8.htm">Esther 3:8-15</a>). Having formed his own resolve, it remained for Haman to bring his proposal before Ahasuerus in such a shape as should secure his acquiescence in it. For this purpose he thought it best, first, to raise a prejudice against the Jews by representing them as bad subjects, causing trouble through the peculiarity of their own laws, and still more through their unwillingness to render obedience to the Persian laws (ver. 8). In support of this last statement he would no doubt, if questioned, have adduced the conduct of Mordecai, who persisted in "transgressing the king's commandment," and gave as his only reason that he was a Jew, and therefore could not obey it (ver. 4). As, however, he doubted the effect of this reasoning on his royal master, he held in reserve an argument of another kind, an appeal to the king's cupidity, which constituted his main reliance. If the king gave his consent to the destruction of the Jewish nation, Haman undertook to pay into the royal treasuries, out of his private means, a sum which cannot be estimated at much less than two millions and a quarter of pounds sterling, and which may have amounted to a much higher figure (ver. 9). The effect of this argument upon Ahasuerus was decisive; he at once took his signet-ring from his finger, and made it over to his minister (ver. 10), thus enabling him to promulgate any decree that he pleased, and he openly declared that he gave over the Jewish nation, their lives and properties, into Haman's hands (ver. 11). Haman "struck while the iron was hot." The king's scribes were put in requisition - a decree was composed, numerous copies of it made, the royal seal am,ca to each (ver. 12), and a copy despatched forthwith to each governor of a province by the royal post, ordering the complete destruction of the Jews within his province, young and old, men, women, and children, on the thirteenth day of the month Adar, and the confiscation of their property (ver. 13). The posts started off with all speed, "being hastened by the king's commandment" (ver. 15); and the two men who had plotted a nation's extermination, as if they had done a good day's work, and deserved refreshment, "sat down to drink." But the Persians generally were less satisfied with the decree than their monarch and his minister; it surprised and startled them; "the city Shushan was perplexed." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/esther/3-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the twelfth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;t&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - fd<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8147.htm">Strong's 8147: </a> </span><span class="str2">Two (a cardinal number)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">year</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#353;&#183;na&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
