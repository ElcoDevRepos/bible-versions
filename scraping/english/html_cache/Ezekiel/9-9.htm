Historically, this period was marked by idolatry, social injustice, and a departure from the covenant with God. The division between Israel (the northern kingdom) and Judah (the southern kingdom) had led to separate paths of disobedience, yet both were guilty of significant transgressions. This echoes the warnings of earlier prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah, who also condemned the nations for their sins. The term "exceedingly great" underscores the depth and breadth of their rebellion against God.<p><b>The land is full of bloodshed,</b><br>This indicates rampant violence and injustice throughout the land. Bloodshed often refers to murder and the shedding of innocent blood, which was strictly condemned in the Mosaic Law. This reflects a society that has abandoned God's commandments, leading to chaos and moral decay. The historical context includes the political instability and frequent conflicts that plagued the region, contributing to a culture of violence. This situation is reminiscent of the pre-flood world described in <a href="/genesis/6-11.htm">Genesis 6:11</a>, where the earth was filled with violence.<p><b>and the city is full of perversity.</b><br>The city, likely referring to Jerusalem, is described as being filled with moral corruption and depravity. Perversity here can include sexual immorality, idolatry, and other forms of ethical corruption. Jerusalem, the city meant to be a beacon of God's presence and holiness, had become a center of sin. This mirrors the situation in Sodom and Gomorrah, where pervasive wickedness led to divine judgment. The prophets often used the imagery of a corrupt city to symbolize the spiritual state of the people.<p><b>For they say, &#8216;The LORD has forsaken the land;</b><br>This reflects a common belief among the people that God had abandoned them, possibly due to the prolonged period of suffering and foreign oppression. This sentiment reveals a lack of faith and understanding of God's covenant promises. It also shows a misunderstanding of the nature of God's discipline, which is meant to lead to repentance rather than indicate abandonment. This echoes the lament in <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>, where the psalmist feels forsaken but ultimately trusts in God's deliverance.<p><b>the LORD does not see.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates a belief that God is either unaware of or indifferent to their actions. It suggests a theological misunderstanding of God's omniscience and justice. This attitude is reminiscent of the scoffers in <a href="/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11</a>, who say, "He will never see it." Such a belief leads to moral recklessness, as people act without fear of divine retribution. Theologically, this challenges the understanding of God's nature as all-seeing and all-knowing, as affirmed in <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>, which states that the eyes of the LORD are everywhere, observing the wicked and the good.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_israel_and_judah.htm">The House of Israel and Judah</a></b><br>Refers to the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah, representing the entire nation of God's chosen people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Symbolizes the Promised Land, which is now defiled by the sins of its inhabitants.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bloodshed_and_perversity.htm">Bloodshed and Perversity</a></b><br>Represents the rampant violence and moral corruption present in the society.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is perceived by the people as having abandoned them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin has tangible consequences, both spiritually and physically, as seen in the bloodshed and perversity filling the land.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience.htm">God's Omniscience</a></b><br>Despite the people's belief that God does not see, He is fully aware of all actions and intentions.

And these evils had their root in the practical atheism of the denials which had been already uttered in <a href="/ezekiel/8-12.htm">Ezekiel 8:12</a>. and which are here reproduced. The unpitying aspect of God's judgments is, for the present, dominant, and the work must be thorough. One notes how the despair of the prophet leads him to forget those who were to have the mark upon their foreheads, who were indeed the true "remnant."
