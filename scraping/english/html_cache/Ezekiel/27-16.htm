The reference to "many products" suggests the diverse and abundant goods that Tyre offered, making it a hub of international trade.<p><b>they exchanged turquoise, purple, embroidered work, fine linen, coral, and rubies for your wares.</b><br>The items listed here are luxury goods, indicating the high value and quality of the trade between Tyre and Aram. Turquoise and rubies were precious stones highly prized in the ancient world, often used in jewelry and decoration. Purple dye, extracted from the murex shellfish, was a symbol of royalty and wealth due to its labor-intensive production process. Embroidered work and fine linen were also luxury textiles, suggesting skilled craftsmanship and artistry. Coral, used for decoration and jewelry, further emphasizes the opulence of the trade. This exchange of luxury items reflects the wealth and sophistication of Tyre's economy and its ability to attract and engage in high-value trade with other nations.
