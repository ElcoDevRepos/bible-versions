The chambers facing south likely served specific functions related to temple activities, possibly for the priests or storage. The south-facing orientation may symbolize openness to the light, as south is associated with warmth and light in biblical symbolism. This architectural detail emphasizes the order and precision in God's design for worship spaces, reflecting His holiness and the importance of proper worship.<p><b>there was a door in front of the walkway</b><br>The presence of a door indicates controlled access, suggesting that only those who were authorized could enter. This mirrors the concept of holiness and separation found throughout the Old Testament, where access to sacred spaces was restricted to maintain purity. The door's placement in front of the walkway highlights the importance of intentional entry into God's presence, reminiscent of Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>, where He describes Himself as the door through which believers must enter to find salvation.<p><b>that was parallel to the wall extending eastward</b><br>The eastward extension of the wall is significant, as east often symbolizes new beginnings and divine intervention in biblical literature. The Garden of Eden was placed in the east (<a href="/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>), and the return of God's glory to the temple in <a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a> comes from the east. This orientation may also foreshadow the coming of Christ, who is associated with the east in <a href="/matthew/24-27.htm">Matthew 24:27</a>, where His return is likened to lightning coming from the east.

The word here translated <span class= "ital">corresponding</span> occurs only in this place, and is of doubtful signification; but the word for wall is the same as in <a href="/ezekiel/42-7.htm" title="And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.">Ezekiel 42:7</a>, and there can be no doubt that it refers to the screen-wall to the east of the chambers. The way from the porch of the gate to the inner court was directly "over against" the passage between this wall and the chambers, and in fact joined it at right angles.<p>This closes the somewhat obscure and difficult description of these chambers, where we do not have, as in the other cases, any similar construction in the ancient Temple to guide the interpreter. It would seem altogether probable that there must have been an additional entrance to these chambers from the space at the side of or behind the Temple, for the convenience of the priests in changing their garments. Perhaps there was such an entrance to the second storey, which must have been about on the same level with the Temple court, but is not mentioned because only the plan of the lower storey is described.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/42-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And corresponding to the doors</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1456;&#1508;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1495;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;p&#772;i&#7791;&#183;&#7717;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-k &#124;
