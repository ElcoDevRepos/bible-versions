The concept of bearing disgrace is tied to the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where disobedience leads to shame and punishment. This echoes the curses for disobedience outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The disgrace is a result of Israel's idolatry and unfaithfulness, which is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature.<p><b>and be ashamed</b><br>Shame in the biblical context often involves a deep realization of wrongdoing and a turning point towards repentance. In Ezekiel, shame is not just an emotional response but a necessary step towards restoration. This aligns with the prophetic call to repentance found in other prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah. The shame here is both personal and communal, reflecting the collective guilt of the nation.<p><b>of all you did</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the comprehensive nature of Israel's sin. The actions that led to disgrace are numerous and varied, including idolatry, social injustice, and breaking the covenant with God. The historical context of Ezekiel's ministry during the Babylonian exile highlights these sins as reasons for the nation's downfall. The phrase calls to mind the detailed accounts of Israel's unfaithfulness found in earlier chapters of Ezekiel.<p><b>to comfort them</b><br>The "them" refers to the surrounding nations, particularly Sodom and Samaria, mentioned earlier in the chapter. Israel's actions were meant to provide comfort or justification to these nations, suggesting a failure to uphold their distinct identity as God's chosen people. This reflects a broader biblical theme where Israel was meant to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>) but instead became like them. The irony is that Israel, instead of being a source of divine truth, became a source of false comfort through its own sinfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.
