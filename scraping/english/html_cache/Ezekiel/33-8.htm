The certainty of death for the wicked is a consistent theme throughout Scripture, emphasizing the consequences of sin (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). The prophetic role of Ezekiel is underscored here, as he is tasked with delivering God's message. The phrase also reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where God warns His people through prophets (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p><b>but you do not speak out to dissuade him from his way,</b><br>Ezekiel's responsibility as a watchman is emphasized. The role of a watchman was crucial in ancient cities, tasked with warning of impending danger. Spiritually, this represents the duty of leaders to guide and correct. The failure to warn the wicked reflects a neglect of duty, akin to the negligence of a shepherd (<a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-6</a>). This also connects to the New Testament call for believers to admonish one another (<a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>).<p><b>then that wicked man will die in his iniquity,</b><br>The inevitability of judgment for unrepentant sin is reiterated. The phrase "die in his iniquity" suggests a death that is both physical and spiritual, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of sin leading to separation from God (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>). This underscores the justice of God, who holds individuals accountable for their actions (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>).<p><b>yet I will hold you accountable for his blood.</b><br>The accountability of the prophet is a sobering reminder of the responsibility of spiritual leaders. This echoes the principle found in <a href="/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5-6</a> regarding the sanctity of life and the seriousness of bloodguilt. It also prefigures the New Testament teaching on the responsibility of believers to share the gospel (<a href="/acts/20-26.htm">Acts 20:26-27</a>).
