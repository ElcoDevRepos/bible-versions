Historically, this is a reference to the Babylonian exile, where the people of Judah were taken from Jerusalem by force. The city, often seen as a place of divine protection, would no longer serve as a refuge due to the people's disobedience. This act of removal is a fulfillment of earlier warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-8.htm">Jeremiah 25:8-11</a>) and is a demonstration of God's sovereignty over nations and cities.<p><b>and deliver you into the hands of foreigners</b><br>The "foreigners" here are the Babylonians, who were used by God as instruments of judgment against Judah. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using foreign nations to discipline His people, as seen in the Assyrian conquest of Israel (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). Theologically, it underscores the idea that God is not limited to working within the boundaries of Israel but can use any nation to accomplish His purposes. This also serves as a warning against relying on political alliances or military strength instead of trusting in God.<p><b>and I will execute judgments against you</b><br>This phrase indicates the divine retribution that would befall the people due to their persistent idolatry and rebellion against God. The judgments are not arbitrary but are a response to the covenant violations by the people of Judah. This is consistent with the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>, where disobedience leads to severe consequences. Theologically, it highlights God's justice and holiness, as well as His commitment to uphold His covenant. This also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and redemption found in Christ, who bears the judgment for sin on behalf of humanity (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is tasked with delivering God's messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city from which God promises to bring out the rebellious leaders and people, symbolizing the center of Israel's spiritual and political life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners.htm">Foreigners</a></b><br>Refers to the Babylonians, who are used by God as instruments of judgment against Israel for their disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The divine retribution that God promises to execute against the Israelites for their idolatry and rebellion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/exile.htm">Exile</a></b><br>The event of being taken from one's homeland, which serves as both punishment and a call to repentance for the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sovereignty.htm">Divine Sovereignty</a></b><br>God is in control of nations and uses them to fulfill His purposes, even when it involves judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_disobedience.htm">Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Persistent rebellion against God leads to severe consequences, including loss of security and freedom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_repentance.htm">Call to Repentance</a></b><br>Judgment serves as a wake-up call for repentance and return to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_beyond_judgment.htm">Hope Beyond Judgment</a></b><br>While judgment is severe, it is not the end;
