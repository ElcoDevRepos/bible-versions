Bribery was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern societies, often leading to the perversion of justice. The shedding of blood indicates that these bribes were not just for minor offenses but involved life-and-death matters, possibly even murder. This reflects a society where the judicial system is compromised, echoing the warnings found in <a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a> against taking bribes. The prophets frequently condemned such practices, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a> and <a href="/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>, where leaders are criticized for their greed and corruption.<p><b>You engage in usury, take excess interest, and extort your neighbors.</b><br>The practice of usury, or charging excessive interest on loans, was explicitly forbidden in the Mosaic Law, particularly among fellow Israelites (<a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a>, <a href="/leviticus/25-36.htm">Leviticus 25:36-37</a>). This phrase indicates a violation of these laws, showing a lack of compassion and exploitation of the vulnerable. The term "extort" suggests aggressive and unjust means of acquiring wealth, further emphasizing the moral decay of the society. This behavior contrasts with the biblical ideal of community and mutual support, as seen in <a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32-35</a>, where early Christians shared their possessions to ensure no one was in need.<p><b>But Me you have forgotten, declares the Lord GOD.</b><br>Forgetting God implies a deliberate neglect of His commandments and a turning away from His covenant. This forgetfulness is not merely intellectual but involves a willful rejection of God's authority and presence. Throughout the Old Testament, Israel is repeatedly warned against forgetting God (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11-14</a>), as it leads to idolatry and moral decline. This phrase underscores the root cause of the societal sins mentioned earlier: a broken relationship with God. It serves as a reminder of the first commandment to have no other gods (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and points to the need for repentance and restoration, themes central to the prophetic message and fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who calls for a return to God (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites, often focusing on their sins and the need for repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation addressed in this passage, specifically the people of Jerusalem, who are being rebuked for their moral and spiritual corruption.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who is declaring judgment against the people for their sins and forgetfulness of Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sin_of_corruption.htm">The Sin of Corruption</a></b><br>The passage highlights the moral decay in society, where justice is perverted through bribery and exploitation.
