Historically, this reflects Israel's condition in Egypt, where they were oppressed and without hope. The imagery of blood signifies both life and death, highlighting the dire situation. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, unwanted infants were sometimes left to die, emphasizing the severity of Israel's plight. This also parallels the spiritual state of humanity before divine intervention, as seen in <a href="/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6-8</a>, where Christ died for the ungodly.<p><b>and as you lay there in your blood I said to you, &#8216;Live!&#8217;</b><br>God&#8217;s command for Israel to "Live!" signifies divine intervention and grace. This act of mercy is reminiscent of God&#8217;s covenant promises, where He chooses to give life and blessing despite Israel&#8217;s unworthiness. Theologically, this reflects the theme of regeneration and new birth found in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-7</a>, where Jesus speaks of being born again. The repetition of "Live!" underscores the certainty and power of God&#8217;s word, which brings life from death, echoing the resurrection power seen in Christ&#8217;s victory over the grave.<p><b>There I said to you, &#8216;Live!&#8217;</b><br>The repetition of the command "Live!" emphasizes God&#8217;s determination and the effectiveness of His word. It signifies a turning point, where God&#8217;s intervention transforms Israel&#8217;s fate. This mirrors the prophetic nature of God&#8217;s promises, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/37.htm">Ezekiel 37:1-14</a>, where the dry bones are brought to life. Theologically, it points to the transformative power of God&#8217;s grace, which is central to the Christian message of salvation through Jesus Christ, who offers eternal life to all who believe, as stated in <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

He delivered them from their oppressors; He raised up a leader for them , He gave them a law and a Church, with its priesthood and its sacraments; He led them into the land of promise, delivered them from their enemies, and constituted them a nation under the most favourable circumstances for their growth and development in all righteousness. The sense is well expressed in our version; but the original does not contain the word <span class= "ital">when, </span>nor words corresponding to the words in italics. The connection shows that "in thy blood" is to be taken with "I said," and not with "live;" it was while Israel was in its unclean and neglected condition that the gracious word "live" was spoken. The Chaldee paraphrast has adopted the other connection, and ingeniously explained, "I revealed myself that I might redeem you, because I saw that you were afflicted in your bondage; and I said unto you, In the blood of circumcision I will pity you. and I said unto you, In the blood of the passover I will redeem you." The word <span class= "ital">polluted </span>is better rendered by the margin, <span class= "ital">trodden under foot, </span>referring to their oppressed condition in Egypt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - For <span class="cmt_word">polluted</span>, read, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">weltering</span>, the primary meaning of the verb being that of stamping or treading, and omit "when thou wast," as weakening the condensed force of the original. The marvel of that unlooked for pity is emphasized by the iteration of the word of mercy, <span class="cmt_word">Live</span>. The commentary of the Chaldee Targum is sufficiently curious to be quoted: "And the memory of my covenant with your fathers came into my mind, and I was revealed that I might redeem you, because it was manifest to me that ye were afflicted in your bondage, and I said unto you, 'I will have compassion on you in the blood of circumcision,' and I said unto you, 'I will redeem you by the blood of the Passover'" (Rosenmuller). The thought underlying this strange interpretation is that blood might be the means of life as well as of pollution, and in that thought there is a significance at once poetical and profound, almost, as it were, anticipating the later thoughts that the blood of Jesus cleanseth from all sin (<a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>), that we make our robes white in the blood of the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>). There is no reason, however, for believing that such thoughts were present to the prophet's mind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/16-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then I passed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1506;&#1457;&#1489;&#1465;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;&#8216;&#277;&#183;&#7687;&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
