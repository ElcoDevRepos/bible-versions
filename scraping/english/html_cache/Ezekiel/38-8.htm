It suggests a divine orchestration, where God calls upon certain nations or leaders to fulfill His purposes. The summoning implies a predetermined plan, aligning with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over history. This can be connected to other prophetic scriptures where God summons nations for His purposes, such as in <a href="/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4-5</a>.<p><b>In the latter years you will enter a land that has recovered from war,</b><br>The "latter years" often refers to the end times or a future period in biblical prophecy. The land recovering from war suggests a period of peace and restoration, possibly after significant conflict. This aligns with the prophetic vision of Israel's restoration found in passages like <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11-12</a> and <a href="/amos/9-14.htm">Amos 9:14-15</a>, where God promises to bring His people back to their land and restore it.<p><b>whose people were gathered from many nations to the mountains of Israel,</b><br>This phrase highlights the regathering of the Jewish people from the diaspora, a theme prevalent in prophetic literature. The mountains of Israel are significant as they represent the heartland of the ancient kingdom. This regathering is seen as a fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24</a> and <a href="/isaiah/43-5.htm">Isaiah 43:5-6</a>, where God promises to bring His people back from all corners of the earth.<p><b>which had long been desolate.</b><br>The desolation of the land refers to the period of exile and abandonment, a consequence of Israel's disobedience. This desolation is mentioned in <a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33-35</a> as a result of the covenant curses. The transformation from desolation to restoration is a powerful testament to God's faithfulness and redemptive plan.<p><b>They had been brought out from the nations,</b><br>This emphasizes the divine act of gathering the exiles, a recurring theme in the prophetic books. It underscores God's covenant faithfulness and His promise to restore Israel. This act of gathering is seen as a miraculous event, fulfilling prophecies like <a href="/jeremiah/31-10.htm">Jeremiah 31:10</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/11-17.htm">Ezekiel 11:17</a>.<p><b>and all now dwell securely.</b><br>The security mentioned here is indicative of a divinely ordained peace, contrasting with Israel's historical experiences of conflict and invasion. This security is often associated with the Messianic age, where peace and safety are promised under the reign of the Messiah, as seen in <a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a> and <a href="/zechariah/14-11.htm">Zechariah 14:11</a>.

The verse reassures believers that every detail of God&#8217;s plan unfolds on schedule, proving His Word both accurate and literal.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/38.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">After many days thou shalt be visited.--</span>This clause has been variously interpreted. The expression "after many days" is the common one to indicate that what is predicted is yet far in the future, and corresponds to the "latter years" of the next clause. The words "thou shalt be visited" are the usual form of expressing a coming judgment. Various ingenious attempts have been made, with no great success, to give the words a different sense here. The supposed difficulty arises from not observing that the whole course of Gog is here viewed together as a single transaction. It is not merely his ultimate destruction, but the steps which led to it, his hostile attacks upon the Church, which are represented as brought about under God's providence and forming a part of the visitation upon him. It is as if one spoke now of a man's whole career of sin as a Divine visitation upon the sinner in consequence of his neglect of proffered grace, instead of speaking only of his ultimate punishment.<p><span class= "bld">The land.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">a land.</span> Judaea had been long desolated, but was now restored. The word <span class= "ital">people</span> here, as in <a href="/ezekiel/38-6.htm" title="Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands: and many people with you.">Ezekiel 38:6</a>, is in the plural and marks the gathering back, not from one, but from many quarters.<p><span class= "bld">Always waste.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">continually waste.</span> The mountains of Israel had been by no means <span class= "ital">always</span> waste, but during the period of the captivity had been so constantly. Yet the word is commonly used for a relatively long period, for which the time of the captivity seems too short. It may therefore, with the dispersion among "many peoples" of the previous clause, indicate the time of the later and longer continued dispersion of the Jews. In the last clause "shall dwell" is not to be taken as a future, but as <span class= "bld">a</span> description of the existing condition of the people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After many days thou halt be visited</span>. The principal controversy raised by these words is as to whether they signify, as Hitzig, Fairbairn, and Kliefoth suppose, that after many days Gog should be entrusted with the command of the aforementioned nations, or, as Ewald, Hengstenberg, Keil, Schroder, Plumptre, and Currey translate, that Gog, who intended to visit Israel, should himself be visited, in the sense of being punished. In support of the former rendering appeal is taken to <a href="/nehemiah/7-1.htm">Nehemiah 7:1</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44</a>; and <a href="/jeremiah/15-3.htm">Jeremiah 15:3</a>; but the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;&#x5e7;&#x5d3;</span> when used in this sense is commonly followed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> with the accusative of that or those with reference to which or whom the appointment is made or commission issued, and in addition no such commission with reference to these other nations was ever given by God to Gog. In vindication of the second meaning of the words, <a href="/isaiah/24-22.htm">Isaiah 24:22</a> and Isaiah 29:6 are ordinarily quoted: while in answer to the objection that it is too soon to talk of punishment for an offense not yet committed, it is customary to reply that, as Jehovah's stirring up of Gog was the first step towards his ultimate overthrow, that stirring up might fairly be described as at least the beginning of his judicial visitation. Havernick's translation, "For a long time thou wilt be missed," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> considered as a people that has utterly vanished," is forced; Smend's is better, "After many days thou shalt be mustered," or numbered. In any case Gog's first movement should take place <span class="cmt_word">in the latter years</span>; literally, <span class="accented">at the end of the years</span> - a frequent prophetic phrase (see <a href="/genesis/49-1.htm">Genesis 49:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/24-14.htm">Numbers 24:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-14.htm">Daniel 10:14</a>; <a href="/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1</a>), here denoting the Messianic era, and should assume the form of an invasion of the land of Israel, which is next described by a threefold characterization. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="cmt_word">As a land brought back from the sword</span>, not in the sense of its people having been made to desist from war, through being henceforth peacefully inclined (comp. <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>; <a href="/micah/2-8.htm">Micah 2:8</a>), or of their having ceased to expect war, because of living ever after securely (ver. 11), but in that of having been recovered from its devastations (<a href="/ezekiel/6-3.htm">Ezekiel 6:3-5</a>); <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as a land whose inhabitants had been <span class="cmt_word">gathered out of many nations</span> - a phrase, which while starting from and including the return from Babylon, manifestly looked beyond that event to the wider dispersion of Israel that should precede the final ingathering; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as a land whose <span class="cmt_word">mountains had been always waste</span>; literally, <span class="accented">for a waste continually</span>. If such was their condition prior to the return from captivity, it is undeniable that such has practically been their condition ever since, and such it is likely to continue to be, until the final ingathering of the dispersed of Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/38-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After a long</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(rab&#183;b&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7227.htm">Strong's 7227: </a> </span><span class="str2">Much, many, great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">time</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
