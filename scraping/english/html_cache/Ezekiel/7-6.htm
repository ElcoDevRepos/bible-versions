The repetition emphasizes the certainty and urgency of the message. In the context of Ezekiel's prophetic ministry, this declaration is a culmination of warnings given to a rebellious people. Historically, this refers to the Babylonian siege and eventual destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. Theologically, it serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and justice, as He fulfills His promises of judgment for disobedience. This echoes the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> about the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>The end has come!</b><br>The repetition of this phrase underscores the inevitability and finality of the prophesied events. It reflects the Hebrew literary style of using repetition for emphasis. This mirrors the prophetic declarations found in other parts of the Old Testament, such as <a href="/amos/8-2.htm">Amos 8:2</a>, where God declares the end for Israel due to their sins. It also foreshadows the eschatological themes found in the New Testament, particularly in Revelation, where the end times are described with similar urgency and certainty.<p><b>It has roused itself against you.</b><br>This phrase personifies the end as an active force, suggesting that the judgment is not passive but is actively coming upon the people. The imagery of something rousing itself implies a sudden awakening or activation, indicating that the time for repentance has passed, and the consequences are now unavoidable. This can be connected to the concept of divine retribution, where God's patience has reached its limit, and His righteous anger is stirred. Theologically, it serves as a warning of the consequences of persistent sin and rebellion against God.<p><b>Behold, it has come!</b><br>The use of "behold" serves as a call to attention, urging the audience to recognize the reality of the situation. This final declaration confirms that the prophesied events are no longer future possibilities but present realities. It is a call to witness the fulfillment of God's word, reinforcing the truth that God's warnings are not empty threats. This can be paralleled with the New Testament call to be watchful and ready for the return of Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42-44</a>, where believers are urged to be vigilant because the end will come unexpectedly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the mouthpiece of God, delivering messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The primary audience of Ezekiel's prophecies, the nation of Israel is facing impending judgment due to their persistent idolatry and rebellion against God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context of Ezekiel's prophecies, where the Israelites are in captivity due to their disobedience to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The central theme of this passage, where God declares the imminent end of His patience with Israel's sinfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_end.htm">The End</a></b><br>Symbolic of the culmination of God's warnings and the onset of His righteous judgment against sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_god's_judgment.htm">The Certainty of God's Judgment</a></b><br>God's declarations are sure and inevitable.

(repeated)</b><p>&#8226; The repetition underscores certainty, much like Joseph&#8217;s dream in <a href="/genesis/41-32.htm">Genesis 41:32</a> where the matter was doubled &#8220;because the thing is established by God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By saying it twice, God silences any argument that His warning could be delayed or overturned (compare <a href="/lamentations/1-9.htm">Lamentations 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_peter/4-7.htm">1 Peter 4:7</a> echoes the same urgency: &#8220;The end of all things is near; therefore, be clear-minded and sober.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This divine echo invites immediate repentance, not complacency (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It has roused itself against you</b><p>&#8226; Judgment is pictured as a force awakened&#8212;no longer dormant but actively moving toward the guilty (<a href="/nahum/2-13.htm">Nahum 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording highlights personal accountability: &#8220;against you,&#8221; just as <a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a> speaks of people &#8220;storing up wrath for yourself.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/63-5.htm">Isaiah 63:5&#8211;6</a> shows God Himself &#8220;trampling&#8221; His enemies when no one else intervenes&#8212;a sober reminder that divine wrath is never arbitrary.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a> sums up the gravity: &#8220;It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Behold, it has come!</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Behold&#8221; pulls the hearer into the present moment, much like <a href="/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>: &#8220;Behold, He is coming with the clouds.&#8221;<p>&#8226; There is no space left for denial; the prophesied day has arrived, just as <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a> says, &#8220;The day of the Lord will come like a thief.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This arrival signals both the end of mercy&#8217;s window (<a href="/jeremiah/15-6.htm">Jeremiah 15:6</a>) and the vindication of God&#8217;s prophetic word (<a href="/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement assures believers that God keeps every promise&#8212;whether of blessing or of judgment (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/7-6.htm">Ezekiel 7:6</a> layers urgency upon urgency: God announces, re-announces, personifies, and presents the arrival of His judgment. Each phrase drives home the same truth&#8212;when God says the end has come, it truly has. For the rebellious, that spells unavoidable accountability; for the faithful, it reminds us that God&#8217;s timetable is precise, His character is just, and His word is infallible.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It watcheth for thee;</span> better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">it awaketh against thee.</span> So the LXX., Vulgate, Luther.
