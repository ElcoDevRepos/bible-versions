The temple is central to Ezekiel's vision, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The entrance signifies a point of access to divine revelation and worship. Historically, the temple in Jerusalem was the focal point of Jewish religious life, representing God's covenant with Israel.<p><b>and I saw water flowing from under the threshold of the temple</b><br>The water flowing from the temple symbolizes life, purification, and the outpouring of God's blessings. In biblical symbolism, water often represents the Holy Spirit (<a href="/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38-39</a>). The threshold indicates the beginning of this divine flow, suggesting that true life and spiritual renewal originate from God's presence.<p><b>toward the east (for the temple faced east)</b><br>The eastward direction is significant in biblical texts, often associated with the coming of God's glory (<a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>). The temple facing east aligns with the orientation of Solomon's Temple, emphasizing the anticipation of divine intervention and the return of God's presence.<p><b>The water was coming down from under the south side of the temple</b><br>The south side of the temple may indicate the direction of blessing and favor, as the south wind in biblical literature is often associated with warmth and growth (<a href="/job/37-17.htm">Job 37:17</a>). This detail underscores the abundance and life-giving nature of the water.<p><b>south of the altar</b><br>The altar represents sacrifice and atonement, central to the worship practices in the temple. The water flowing south of the altar suggests that the blessings and life symbolized by the water are made possible through sacrifice, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who provides living water (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>). This connection highlights the fulfillment of Old Testament sacrificial systems in Christ's atoning work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of this vision.

The verse previews the physical restoration of Israel and the spiritual refreshment of the nations, all rooted in God&#8217;s sovereign, life-giving presence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/47.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">XLVII.</span><p>The first twelve verses of this chapter constitute what is generally known as "the vision of the living waters;" the latter part of the chapter, <a href="/context/ezekiel/47-13.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby you shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.">Ezekiel 47:13-23</a>, more properly belongs with Ezekiel 48, and, with that, gives an account of the boundaries of the land, of its distribution among the tribes, and of the building of the holy city.<p>The ideal character of this vision of the waters is so plain upon its face that little need be said on this point. The stream is represented as issuing from the summit of "a very high mountain" (<a href="/ezekiel/40-2.htm" title="In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me on a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.">Ezekiel 40:2</a>), and as constantly and rapidly increasing its volume, without the accession of tributaries, so that in a little more than a mile it becomes a river no longer fordable. The trees upon its banks, too, are evidently symbolical, and its effect upon the Dead Sea (as already said in the introductory note to Ezekiel 40-48) is such as could not naturally occur. Such imagery is common in prophecy. Joel (<a href="/joel/3-18.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.">Joel 3:18</a>) says, "All the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim." Zechariah (<a href="/zechariah/14-8.htm" title="And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.">Zechariah 14:8</a>), "Living waters shall go out from Jerusalem, half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea;" and finally, the description of the "pure river of water of life" in <a href="/context/revelation/22-1.htm" title="And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.">Revelation 22:1-3</a>, is evidently founded upon this passage of Ezekiel. Passages in which water is used as the symbol of the influence of the Spirit are too numerous and familiar to need quotation. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm" title="For I will pour water on him that is thirsty, and floods on the dry ground: I will pour my spirit on your seed, and my blessing on your offspring:">Isaiah 44:3</a>;
