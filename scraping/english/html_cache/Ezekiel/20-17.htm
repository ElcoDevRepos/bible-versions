In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/20.htm">Ezekiel 20</a>, God recounts Israel's history of disobedience, yet He consistently shows mercy. This reflects God's character as described in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, where He is "compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness." The Hebrew word for "pity" can also be translated as "spared" or "had compassion," indicating a deep emotional response from God. This mercy is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament, as seen in the stories of the Judges and the repeated cycles of sin and redemption.<p><b>and did not destroy them</b><br>Despite their idolatry and rebellion, God chose not to annihilate the Israelites. This decision is significant in light of the covenant He made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, promising to make their descendants a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>). God's restraint from destruction underscores His faithfulness to His promises, even when His people are unfaithful. This act of mercy is also a foreshadowing of the ultimate mercy shown through Jesus Christ, who came to save rather than condemn (<a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>).<p><b>or bring them to an end in the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness journey of the Israelites is a critical period in their history, marked by both divine provision and human failure. Despite their repeated complaints and lack of faith, God provided manna, quail, and water, demonstrating His sustaining power. The wilderness is often seen as a place of testing and purification, preparing the Israelites for entry into the Promised Land. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's people being preserved through trials, as seen in the New Testament with the early church facing persecution yet growing in faith and numbers (<a href="/acts/8.htm">Acts 8:1-4</a>). The wilderness experience can be seen as a type of the Christian journey, where believers are refined and prepared for their ultimate home with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the mouthpiece of God, delivering messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are often rebellious and disobedient, leading to their exile and suffering.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>Represents the period of Israel's wandering after the Exodus from Egypt, a time of testing and divine provision.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_mercy.htm">God's Mercy</a></b><br>Despite Israel's rebellion, God shows compassion and refrains from complete destruction.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context of Ezekiel's prophecies, where the Israelites are in captivity due to their disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_unfailing_mercy.htm">God's Unfailing Mercy</a></b><br>Despite repeated rebellion, God&#8217;s mercy prevails.
