It is a common formula used throughout the book of Ezekiel to indicate divine revelation. Ezekiel, a prophet during the Babylonian exile, often received direct communication from God, which he then conveyed to the people of Israel.<br><br>*Historical and Cultural Context:* Ezekiel was among the Jewish exiles in Babylon after the first deportation in 597 BC. The phrase underscores the belief that even in exile, God continued to communicate with His people through prophets. This was a time of great turmoil and uncertainty for the Israelites, and prophetic messages were crucial for guidance and hope.<br><br>*Connections to Other Scripture:* Similar phrases are found throughout the prophetic books, such as in Jeremiah and Isaiah, indicating a consistent method of divine communication. In <a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4</a>, a similar introduction is used, emphasizing the personal nature of God's messages to His prophets.<br><br>*Prophecy:* The phrase sets the stage for the prophetic content that follows. In <a href="/ezekiel/13.htm">Ezekiel 13</a>, the message is directed against false prophets who were misleading the people. This highlights the importance of discerning true prophecy from falsehood, a theme that resonates throughout the Bible.<br><br>*Types of Jesus Christ:* While this specific phrase does not directly typify Christ, the concept of the "word of the LORD" can be connected to the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). Just as God communicated His will through the prophets, He ultimately revealed Himself through Jesus Christ.<br><br>*Relevance for Today:* This phrase reminds believers of the importance of seeking and heeding God's word. It encourages discernment and faithfulness in understanding and applying divine revelation, both in the context of Scripture and in personal spiritual experiences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of God's word.
