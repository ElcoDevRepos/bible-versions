The prophet is to make his preparations during the day, and to carry forth his stuff (<a href="/ezekiel/12-7.htm" title="And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I dig through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bore it on my shoulder in their sight.">Ezekiel 12:7</a>), but not himself to go forth until even (<a href="/ezekiel/12-4.htm" title="Then shall you bring forth your stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and you shall go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.">Ezekiel 12:4</a>). The action seems to be that of one who must abandon his home, using the whole day to carry out all he can with the purpose of saving it, and then himself leaving the house when the day is done.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prepare thee stuff for removing</span>, etc.; better, <span class="accented">equipment for a journey</span>, with the implied thought that it is the journey of one going into exile. "Bag and baggage," all the household goods which an exile could take with him (<a href="/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11, 34</a> may supply an illustration), were to be brought out in broad daylight and piled up opposite his door. Then in the <span class="cmt_word">twilight</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">in the dark</span>, and so in vers. 7, 12) he was to go forth, not by the door of his house, but by breaking through the wall (with such walls as those of <a href="/ezekiel/13-11.htm">Ezekiel 13:11</a> the process would not be difficult), as a man might do who was escaping secretly from a city through the gates of which he dared not pass (ver. 5), and was to start with his travelling chattels upon his shoulder. Lastly (ver. 6), as the strangest feature of all, he was to go forth <span class="cmt_word">with his face covered</span>, as one who wished to avoid recognition, as one also who could not see one step of the way before him. This, it is intimated, would startle even the most careless, and in this way he would become, as he had been before in like symbolic acts (<a href="/ezekiel/4.htm">Ezekiel 4, 5</a>.), as Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/27-2.htm">Jeremiah 27:2</a>) had been before him, <span class="cmt_word">a sign unto the house of Israel.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/12-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
