Biblically, light often symbolizes God's presence and holiness (<a href="/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-35</a>, <a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>). The brilliance signifies divine majesty and purity, echoing the Shekinah glory that filled the tabernacle and temple (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>, <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). This light is not just physical but represents spiritual illumination and revelation.<p><b>was like that of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day</b><br>The rainbow is a symbol of God's covenant with Noah, representing His mercy and promise not to destroy the earth with a flood again (<a href="/genesis/9-12.htm">Genesis 9:12-17</a>). In Ezekiel's vision, the rainbow signifies hope and the faithfulness of God amidst judgment. The imagery of a rainbow in a cloud suggests a divine promise and the presence of God even in times of turmoil and uncertainty.<p><b>This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD</b><br>The "likeness of the glory of the LORD" indicates that Ezekiel is witnessing a vision of God's majesty, not God Himself, as no one can see God and live (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). The term "glory" (Hebrew: "kavod") refers to the weightiness and splendor of God's presence. This vision parallels other biblical theophanies, such as Isaiah's vision in <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a> and John's vision in <a href="/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4</a>, where God's glory is revealed in a majestic and awe-inspiring manner.<p><b>And when I saw it, I fell facedown</b><br>Ezekiel's response of falling facedown is a common reaction to divine encounters, signifying reverence, worship, and humility (<a href="/genesis/17-3.htm">Genesis 17:3</a>, <a href="/daniel/10-9.htm">Daniel 10:9</a>, <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>). This posture acknowledges God's supreme authority and the prophet's own unworthiness. It reflects the appropriate human response to the overwhelming presence of God's holiness and glory.<p><b>and heard a voice speaking</b><br>Hearing a voice signifies divine communication and revelation. Throughout Scripture, God speaks to His prophets to convey His will and guidance (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>, <a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a>). This voice is authoritative and commands attention, often delivering messages of judgment, instruction, or comfort.

Scripture repeatedly links God&#8217;s presence with overwhelming brightness: &#8220;He alone is immortal and dwells in unapproachable light&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul of Tarsus met that same brilliance on the Damascus Road, &#8220;a light from heaven flashed around him&#8221; (<a href="/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The prophet is being shown, literally, the perimeter of God&#8217;s throne room (compare <a href="/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2&#8211;3</a>). Light signals holiness, purity, and the absolute otherness of the LORD.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;was like that of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day</b><p>&#8226; God chooses a familiar natural wonder&#8212;the rainbow&#8212;to help Ezekiel grasp the scene. The first rainbow sealed God&#8217;s covenant with Noah (<a href="/genesis/9-13.htm">Genesis 9:13&#8211;16</a>). By echoing that sign, the vision reassures Ezekiel that the God of judgment is also the God of promise.<p>&#8226; John later sees &#8220;a rainbow encircling the throne&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/4-3.htm">Revelation 4:3</a>). Both visions tie God&#8217;s glory to His covenant faithfulness.<p>&#8226; The storm imagery (clouds, rain) mirrors Israel&#8217;s turbulent exile; the rainbow declares that mercy still shines through.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Ezekiel piles up qualifiers&#8212;&#8220;appearance&#8230;likeness&#8230;glory&#8221;&#8212;because even this literal vision can only hint at the full reality (see <a href="/exodus/24-17.htm">Exodus 24:17</a>, &#8220;the appearance of the glory of the LORD was like a consuming fire,&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Yet it is genuinely God&#8217;s glory. The same glory became flesh: &#8220;We have seen His glory, the glory of the One and Only Son&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a> calls Jesus &#8220;the radiance of His glory,&#8221; confirming that the brilliance Ezekiel saw points ahead to Christ, who perfectly reveals God while maintaining His unapproachable majesty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And when I saw it, I fell facedown</b><p>&#8226; The only proper response to unveiled holiness is humble prostration. Abram did it (<a href="/genesis/17-3.htm">Genesis 17:3</a>). Isaiah cried, &#8220;Woe to me!&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>). John &#8220;fell at His feet as though dead&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Worship begins with surrender. Ezekiel&#8217;s posture acknowledges God&#8217;s supremacy and prepares him to receive marching orders for a hard prophetic ministry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;and heard a voice speaking</b><p>&#8226; Once the prophet is humbled, the LORD speaks. Divine revelation follows reverent submission (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/4-12.htm">Deuteronomy 4:12</a>, &#8220;You heard the sound of words,&#8221; and <a href="/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>, &#8220;a voice from the cloud&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Jesus later affirms, &#8220;My sheep hear My voice&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>). The pattern is consistent: God reveals Himself, humankind bows, and then God commissions. Ezekiel&#8217;s upcoming message of judgment and hope flows directly from this encounter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a> presents a literal encounter with God&#8217;s glory: blazing light encircled by a covenant rainbow, unmistakably the LORD yet mercifully veiled in &#8220;appearance&#8221; and &#8220;likeness.&#8221; The vision underscores God&#8217;s holiness, faithfulness, and transcendence. Facedown worship is Ezekiel&#8217;s instinctive response, opening his ears to the divine voice that will guide his prophetic calling.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud.--</span>Comp. <a href="/revelation/4-3.htm" title="And he that sat was to look on like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like to an emerald.">Revelation 4:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/10-1.htm" title="And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was on his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:">Revelation 10:1</a>.

The symbol of God's faithfulness, and of the hope that rested on it (<a href="/genesis/9-13.htm">Genesis 9:13</a>). was seen in the glory of the Divine perfection, even in the midst of the fire of the Divine wrath. Mercy and love are thought of as over arching all the phenomena of the world and its history, attempering the chastisements which are needed for those with whom that love is dealing. The whole complex appearances of Ezekiel's descriptions, including the arch of prismatic colours, finds its nearest natural analogue, as has been before suggested (note on ver. 4), in the phenomena of the Northern Lights. <span class="cmt_word">I fell upon my face.</span> As in <a href="/ezekiel/3-23.htm">Ezekiel 3:23</a>; <a href="/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>, the prostrate attitude of lowliest adoration, the dread and awe of one who has seen the King, the Lord of hosts, and vet survives, was a preparation for the more direct revelation to his consciousness of the Word and will of Jehovah (comp.
