The drying up of streams symbolizes a catastrophic disruption of life and prosperity. In biblical context, water is often a symbol of life and blessing (<a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>), and its removal indicates severe judgment. Historically, the Nile was central to Egypt's economy and culture, and any threat to its flow would have been devastating. This prophecy echoes the plagues of Egypt in Exodus, where God demonstrated His power over natural elements.<p><b>and sell the land to the wicked.</b><br>This indicates a transfer of control over Egypt to those who are unrighteous or hostile. The term "sell" suggests a transaction where God allows foreign powers to dominate Egypt as a form of judgment. In biblical history, God often used foreign nations as instruments of His judgment (<a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>). The "wicked" could refer to the Babylonians or other invading forces known for their cruelty and idolatry, emphasizing the severity of Egypt's punishment.<p><b>By the hands of foreigners I will bring desolation upon the land and everything in it.</b><br>This phrase highlights the method of judgment&#8212;through foreign invaders. Historically, Egypt faced invasions from various empires, including the Babylonians and Persians. The use of "foreigners" underscores the humiliation and helplessness of Egypt, as they are unable to defend themselves against external forces. This aligns with other prophecies where God uses foreign nations to execute His will (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>). The desolation signifies complete devastation, affecting not just the land but all its inhabitants and resources.<p><b>I, the LORD, have spoken.</b><br>This declaration affirms the certainty and authority of the prophecy. It emphasizes that the judgment is not a random occurrence but a deliberate act of God. The phrase "I, the LORD" is a reminder of God's sovereignty and faithfulness to His word. In biblical theology, when God speaks, His words are powerful and unchangeable (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). This assurance serves as a warning to Egypt and a reminder to all nations of God's ultimate control over history and nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God who declares judgment and has the power to execute it.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nile.htm">The Nile</a></b><br>A significant river in Egypt, symbolizing life and prosperity for the nation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A powerful ancient nation, often seen as a symbol of worldly power and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/evil_men.htm">Evil Men</a></b><br>Those who are morally corrupt and used as instruments of God's judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners.htm">Foreigners</a></b><br>Non-Egyptians who are used by God to bring about His judgment on Egypt.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is in control of all nations and uses them to accomplish His purposes, whether for blessing or judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_idolatry.htm">The Futility of Idolatry</a></b><br>Egypt's reliance on the Nile and its gods is shown to be futile when God dries up the river, reminding us to place our trust in God alone.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_as_a_call_to_repentance.htm">Judgment as a Call to Repentance</a></b><br>God's judgments are not arbitrary but serve as a call to repentance and recognition of His sovereignty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_foreigners_in_god's_plan.htm">The Role of Foreigners in God's Plan</a></b><br>God can use anyone, even those outside His covenant people, to fulfill His divine purposes, challenging us to see His hand in unexpected places.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_god's_word.htm">The Certainty of God's Word</a></b><br>When God declares something, it will come to pass.

When God withholds water, life collapses. Think of how He dried up the Nile during the Exodus plague (<a href="/exodus/7-17.htm">Exodus 7:17-18</a>) and how Isaiah foretold, &#8220;The waters of the Nile will dry up&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/19-5.htm">Isaiah 19:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Egypt&#8217;s strength rested on its rivers and irrigation canals. Dry streams meant ruined crops, famine, and economic collapse&#8212;an unmistakable sign that the Lord, not the Nile, rules creation (<a href="/psalms/95-5.htm">Psalm 95:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The picture foreshadows the ultimate drying of the Euphrates before the final battle (<a href="/revelation/16-12.htm">Revelation 16:12</a>), reminding us that every empire stands or falls at His word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and sell the land to the wicked</b><p>&#8220; &#8230;and sell the land to the wicked &#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Sell&#8221; pictures God handing Egypt over as easily as a landowner transfers property (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;wicked&#8221; refers to Babylon, described as &#8220;a ruthless nation&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>). Though Babylon was itself under judgment, God still used it as His auction bidder, proving He can even employ unrighteous tools to achieve righteous ends (<a href="/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6</a>).<p>&#8226; This sale strips Egypt of its vaunted independence. Just as a debtor loses his house, Egypt would forfeit its land, wealth, and pride to a power it despised (<a href="/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>By the hands of foreigners I will bring desolation upon the land and everything in it</b><p>&#8220; By the hands of foreigners I will bring desolation upon the land and everything in it &#8221;<p>&#8226; The prophecy zooms in on the instrument: foreign armies. Ezekiel has just named them&#8212;&#8220;Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his ruthless nation&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/30-10.htm">Ezekiel 30:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s pattern is consistent: He stirred the Assyrians against Israel (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>) and the Babylonians against Judah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>). Now He turns the same rod toward Egypt.<p>&#8226; Desolation covers &#8220;everything in it,&#8221; implying toppled cities, emptied temples, and shattered economy. The devastation fulfills what Moses warned would happen when nations proud of their idols defy the living God (<a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-25.htm">Jeremiah 46:25-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I, the LORD, have spoken</b><p>&#8220; I, the LORD, have spoken &#8221;<p>&#8226; The closing declaration seals the oracle. When God signs His name, the matter is settled (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Throughout Ezekiel, this refrain underscores His sovereignty: &#8220;I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/17-24.htm">Ezekiel 17:24</a>).<p>&#8226; His word never returns void (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).
