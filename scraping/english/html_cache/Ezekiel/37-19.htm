The prophet Ezekiel is acting as a mouthpiece for God, underscoring the importance of the message. In the biblical context, prophets often began their declarations with such phrases to affirm that their words were not their own but were divinely inspired. This is consistent with the role of prophets throughout the Old Testament, who served as intermediaries between God and His people.<p><b>&#8216;I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim,</b><br>The "stick of Joseph" refers to the northern kingdom of Israel, often associated with the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, Joseph's sons. Ephraim, being the dominant tribe, often represented the entire northern kingdom. Historically, after the division of the united monarchy following Solomon's reign, the northern kingdom was frequently referred to as Ephraim. This division is a key aspect of Israel's history, leading to separate identities and eventual exile.<p><b>and the tribes of Israel associated with him,</b><br>This phrase includes the other tribes that were part of the northern kingdom. The northern tribes were distinct from Judah and Benjamin, which formed the southern kingdom. The historical context here is the Assyrian conquest and exile of the northern kingdom in 722 BC, which led to the dispersion of these tribes. The prophecy speaks to a future reunification, a theme of hope and restoration.<p><b>and I will put them together with the stick of Judah.</b><br>The "stick of Judah" represents the southern kingdom, which included the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. This reunification is significant, as it addresses the long-standing division between the northern and southern kingdoms. Theologically, it points to God's plan for unity among His people, overcoming historical and political divisions. This reunification is also seen as a precursor to the coming of the Messiah, who would unite all of Israel.<p><b>I will make them into a single stick,</b><br>This symbolizes the reunification and restoration of the entire nation of Israel. The imagery of a single stick signifies unity and strength, contrasting with the previous division. This prophecy is often seen as a foreshadowing of the New Covenant, where all believers, Jew and Gentile, are united in Christ. The concept of unity is a recurring theme in the New Testament, particularly in the teachings of Paul.<p><b>and they will become one in My hand.&#8217;</b><br>The phrase "in My hand" indicates divine sovereignty and control over the process of reunification. It emphasizes that this restoration is an act of God, not of human effort. This reflects the biblical theme of God's redemptive plan, where He brings about His purposes despite human failure. The unity of the tribes under God's hand can also be seen as a type of the church, where believers are united in Christ, transcending ethnic and cultural boundaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
