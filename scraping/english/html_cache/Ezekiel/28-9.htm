In the ancient Near East, it was common for kings to be deified or considered semi-divine. This reflects the broader biblical theme of human pride leading to downfall, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a> with the temptation of becoming like God. The ruler's claim echoes the sin of Lucifer, who sought to elevate himself above God (<a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-15</a>).<p><b>in the presence of those who slay you?</b><br>This highlights the futility of the ruler's claim to divinity when faced with mortal danger. Historically, Tyre was a powerful city-state, but it faced numerous threats from empires like Babylon and later Alexander the Great. The rhetorical question underscores the reality that human power is limited and subject to God's sovereignty, as seen in the downfall of other proud leaders like Pharaoh in Exodus.<p><b>You will be only a man, not a god,</b><br>This statement emphasizes the mortality and limitations of the ruler. It serves as a reminder of the biblical truth that all humans are created beings, subject to God's authority (<a href="/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4-5</a>). The contrast between human frailty and divine omnipotence is a recurring theme in Scripture, reinforcing the need for humility before God.<p><b>in the hands of those who wound you.</b><br>This phrase indicates the inevitability of judgment and defeat. The historical context of Tyre's eventual conquest by foreign powers illustrates the fulfillment of prophetic warnings. It also serves as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over all earthly powers, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>, where Christ defeats the nations with divine authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
