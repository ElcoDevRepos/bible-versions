Ezekiel is instructed to take a few strands of hair, representing a remnant of the people of Israel. This act is part of a larger prophetic sign that illustrates the fate of Jerusalem. The remnant concept is significant throughout Scripture, often symbolizing those who remain faithful to God amidst widespread apostasy (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>, <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>).<p><b>throw them into the fire</b><br>The act of throwing the hair into the fire symbolizes judgment and purification. Fire is a common biblical symbol for God's judgment (e.g., <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>). In the context of Ezekiel, it represents the severe judgment that God is about to bring upon Jerusalem due to their idolatry and rebellion. This imagery is consistent with the broader biblical theme of God using fire to purify and refine His people.<p><b>and burn them</b><br>The burning of the hair signifies the complete destruction and consumption by God's wrath. This act foreshadows the coming destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians, which is a historical event that took place in 586 BC. The burning also serves as a warning to the people of Israel about the consequences of their continued disobedience and idolatry.<p><b>From there a fire will spread to the whole house of Israel</b><br>This phrase indicates that the judgment is not limited to Jerusalem but will extend to the entire nation of Israel. The "fire" spreading symbolizes the widespread impact of God's judgment, affecting all the tribes of Israel. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for disobedience. The imagery of fire spreading also connects to the prophetic warnings found in other parts of the Old Testament, such as <a href="/amos/2-4.htm">Amos 2:4-5</a>, where judgment is pronounced on Judah and Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city that is the focal point of God's judgment in this passage, representing the center of Israel's spiritual and political life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context in which Ezekiel prophesies, where the Israelites are in captivity due to their disobedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_in_prophecy.htm">Symbolism in Prophecy</a></b><br><a href="/ezekiel/5-4.htm">Ezekiel 5:4</a> uses symbolic acts to convey God's message.
