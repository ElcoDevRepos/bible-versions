The exile was not merely a political or military defeat but a divine judgment for Israel's sins. The concept of exile as a consequence for iniquity is consistent with the covenantal warnings found in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where God outlines the blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience. The exile served as a testimony to the nations of God's righteousness and His commitment to His covenant, even in judgment.<p><b>because they were unfaithful to Me</b><br>Israel's unfaithfulness is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament, often depicted as spiritual adultery. This unfaithfulness included idolatry, social injustice, and neglect of the covenantal laws. The prophets, including Hosea and Jeremiah, frequently used the metaphor of marriage to describe Israel's relationship with God, emphasizing the betrayal involved in their idolatry. This phrase underscores the personal nature of Israel's sin against God, not just a violation of laws but a breach of relationship.<p><b>So I hid My face from them</b><br>The hiding of God's face is a metaphor for the withdrawal of His favor and presence. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the presence of a deity was associated with protection and blessing. God's hidden face signifies a break in the relationship and the removal of His protective hand, leaving Israel vulnerable to their enemies. This concept is echoed in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17-18</a>, where God warns of hiding His face as a consequence of Israel's idolatry.<p><b>and delivered them into the hands of their enemies</b><br>This phrase indicates God's active role in the judgment process. It was not merely that Israel's enemies overpowered them, but that God Himself delivered Israel into their hands as a form of divine discipline. This aligns with the biblical theme of God using foreign nations as instruments of His judgment, as seen with Assyria and Babylon. The historical context of the Babylonian exile, where Nebuchadnezzar conquered Jerusalem, serves as a fulfillment of this divine action.<p><b>so that they all fell by the sword</b><br>The phrase "fell by the sword" is a common biblical expression for death in battle or violent conflict. It reflects the severity of the judgment and the completeness of the defeat. This outcome was a direct result of Israel's disobedience and God's subsequent judgment. The imagery of the sword is often used in prophetic literature to symbolize divine judgment, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-6</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/25-31.htm">Jeremiah 25:31-33</a>.

Exile, enemy domination, and the sword were not accidental tragedies but precise fulfillments of God&#8217;s Word. Because Scripture is accurate and literal, every promised consequence&#8212;and every promised restoration&#8212;stands firm. Recognizing both God&#8217;s severity toward sin and His faithfulness to His covenant encourages believers today to walk in wholehearted obedience and trust His sovereign, redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/39.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">For their iniquity.--</span>In the times foretold God's dealings shall no longer be misunderstood, nor the sufferings of Israel considered as the result of His want of power to protect them.

They should learn that if Israel had for a season been abandoned to the sword and driven into exile, it was not because of Jehovah's inability to protect them, but because of their wickedness which had caused him to hide his face from them - an expression which in Ezekiel occurs only here and in ver. 29, though it is found in the Pentateuch (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17, 18</a>) and in the older prophets (<a href="/isaiah/8-17.htm">Isaiah 8:17</a>;
