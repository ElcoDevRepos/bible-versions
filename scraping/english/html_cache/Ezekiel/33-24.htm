It is to these that the present part of this prophecy (<a href="/context/ezekiel/33-23.htm" title="Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 33:23-29</a>) is addressed, and it is plain that the murder of Gedaliah, and consequent flight into Egypt, had not yet taken place.<p><span class= "bld">Abraham was one . . . we are many</span>.--The argument used by these people was a simple one: the land was promised to Abraham and his seed in perpetuity. He was but one, and the promise was fulfilled; we, his seed, are many, and it cannot fail us. This disposition to rely upon their descent from Abraham was characteristic of the Jews in all ages (see <a href="/matthew/3-9.htm" title="And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.">Matthew 3:9</a>; <a href="/context/john/8-33.htm" title="They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how say you, You shall be made free?">John 8:33-39</a>). The same tendency to trust in the external privileges given them is apt to be found in all ages among those whose hearts are alienated from God. These Jews, to avoid the force of the prophet's reproofs, passed from one subterfuge to another. First it was that God would not abandon His holy city and Temple; then that the judgments were so far in the future that they need cause no present alarm; now, when these warnings had all been fulfilled, they clung to the fact that the land was theirs by promise, forgetting the conditions which had been attached from the first to its enjoyment. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They that inhabit thou wastes of the land</span>. The utterance that follows was probably the direct result of what Ezekiel heard from the messenger.
