Here, "all the trees of the field" signifies all nations and peoples. The phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty and His ability to reveal Himself to all creation. This echoes themes found in <a href="/isaiah/55-12.htm">Isaiah 55:12</a>, where trees clap their hands in recognition of God's work, and in <a href="/daniel/4-10.htm">Daniel 4:10-12</a>, where a tree represents a kingdom. The acknowledgment of God as LORD underscores His ultimate authority over all earthly powers.<p><b>I bring the tall tree down and make the low tree tall.</b><br>This phrase illustrates God's power to humble the proud and exalt the humble, a recurring biblical theme. The "tall tree" symbolizes powerful nations or leaders, while the "low tree" represents the humble or oppressed. This is reminiscent of the reversal of fortunes seen in the Magnificat (<a href="/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>) and in the parable of the mustard seed (<a href="/matthew/13-31.htm">Matthew 13:31-32</a>). It reflects God's justice and His ability to alter the status quo according to His will.<p><b>I dry up the green tree and make the withered tree flourish.</b><br>The "green tree" represents those who appear prosperous and strong, while the "withered tree" symbolizes those who are weak or in decline. This imagery conveys God's ability to change circumstances, bringing judgment or blessing as He sees fit. It parallels the message in <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3-4</a>, where the righteous are like a tree planted by streams of water, and in <a href="/ezekiel/21-26.htm">Ezekiel 21:26-27</a>, where God overturns the current order. It also foreshadows the restoration and renewal found in Christ, who brings life to the spiritually dead.<p><b>I, the LORD, have spoken, and I have done it.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This declaration affirms God's faithfulness and the certainty of His word. When God speaks, His purposes are accomplished, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where His word does not return void. This assurance is foundational to the prophetic literature, emphasizing that God's plans are unchangeable and His promises are fulfilled. It reassures believers of God's control over history and His commitment to His covenant people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who declares His power and authority over creation and nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/trees_of_the_field.htm">Trees of the Field</a></b><br>Symbolic representation of nations or people, illustrating God's ability to exalt or humble according to His will.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tall_tree.htm">Tall Tree</a></b><br>Represents those who are proud or exalted, possibly referring to powerful nations or leaders.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/low_tree.htm">Low Tree</a></b><br>Symbolizes the humble or oppressed, whom God can elevate.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/green_tree_and_dry_tree.htm">Green Tree and Dry Tree</a></b><br>Metaphors for prosperity and desolation, respectively, showing God's control over blessing and judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God is in control of all nations and individuals.

He humbles the proud, exalts the humble, withers false strength, and revives the hopeless, all to reveal Himself as the one true, faithful, covenant-keeping God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">All the trees of the field shall know.</span>--As the cedar represents the kingdom of Israel, so the other trees represent all other earthly powers who shall ultimately acknowledge the work of the Lord in the redemption of mankind through His Son.<p><span class= "bld">Have brought down the high tree.</span>--Comp, the song of Hannah (<a href="/context/1_samuel/2-1.htm" title="And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoices in the LORD, my horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over my enemies; because I rejoice in your salvation.">1Samuel 2:1-10</a>) and that of the Virgin Mary (<a href="/context/luke/1-52.htm" title="He has put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.">Luke 1:52-55</a>). In all alike there is the acknowledgment that all power is from God, and that He, in the working out of His purposes, gives and takes away as to Him seems good. Very precious to His Church of old in its desolation and distress must have been the announcement of this truth, and very precious it is still to all who pray "Thy kingdom come."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All</span> <span class="cmt_word">the trees of the field</span>, etc. As the cedar of Lebanon stands here for the royal house of David, so the other "trees" represent the surrounding nations, who are thought of as witnessing, first the strange prostration, and then the yet stranger resurrection of the house and the might of Judah and Israel. The thought, which reproduces that of <a href="/1_samuel/2-7.htm">1 Samuel 2:7</a>, finds an echo in <a href="/luke/1-51.htm">Luke 1:51, 52</a>. Another echo of the words may, perhaps, be traced in the "green tree" and the "dry" of <a href="/luke/23-31.htm">Luke 23:31</a>. Here then, also, as in ch. 16, the utterance which begins with judgment, ends in mercy. Behind the picture of the blind, discrowned king the prophet sees that of the Divine ideal King in the fulness of his majesty and power. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/17-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the trees</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1510;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7779;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6086.htm">Strong's 6086: </a> </span><span class="str2">Tree, trees, wood</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the field</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1462;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;&#7695;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
