In biblical times, prostitution was often used as a symbol for idolatry and unfaithfulness to God. The act of "sleeping with" someone in this context signifies engaging in idolatrous practices and forming alliances with pagan nations, which was considered spiritual adultery. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic writings, such as Hosea, where Israel is depicted as an unfaithful wife. The use of prostitution as a metaphor underscores the gravity of Israel's betrayal of their covenant relationship with God.<p><b>they slept with Oholah and Oholibah,</b><br>Oholah and Oholibah are symbolic names given to Samaria and Jerusalem, respectively. Oholah means "her own tent," referring to Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, which set up its own places of worship apart from Jerusalem. Oholibah means "my tent is in her," referring to Jerusalem, the capital of the Southern Kingdom of Judah, where the temple of God was located. The use of these names highlights the separate identities and spiritual failings of the two kingdoms. Historically, both kingdoms engaged in political and religious alliances with surrounding nations, leading to their downfall. This phrase emphasizes their shared guilt in abandoning their exclusive devotion to God.<p><b>those lewd women.</b><br>The term "lewd" indicates moral corruption and shamelessness. In the context of Ezekiel, it refers to the extreme idolatry and moral decay of both Samaria and Jerusalem. The prophets often used strong language to convey the seriousness of Israel's sin and the resulting judgment. This description serves as a warning to the people of God about the consequences of turning away from Him. The imagery of lewdness also connects to the broader biblical theme of purity and holiness, which God desires for His people. The prophetic message calls for repentance and a return to faithfulness, foreshadowing the ultimate redemption and restoration through Jesus Christ, who embodies perfect faithfulness and purity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
