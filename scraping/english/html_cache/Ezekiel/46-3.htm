The Sabbath, instituted at creation (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>) and codified in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>), was a day of rest and worship. New Moons marked the beginning of each month in the Hebrew calendar and were celebrated with special sacrifices (<a href="/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a>). These observances were times for the community to pause and refocus on their covenant relationship with God. The emphasis on these specific times highlights the importance of regular, communal worship and the rhythm of life centered around God's ordained times.<p><b>the people of the land</b><br>This phrase refers to the general populace of Israel, distinguishing them from the priests and Levites who had specific roles in temple service. It underscores the inclusive nature of worship, where all members of the community, regardless of status, were invited to participate in the worship of Yahweh. This communal aspect of worship is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called a "royal priesthood" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), emphasizing the collective responsibility and privilege of worship.<p><b>are also to bow in worship</b><br>Bowing is a physical act of reverence and submission, symbolizing the worshiper's humility before God. This act of worship is not merely external but reflects an internal posture of the heart. Throughout Scripture, bowing is associated with worship and prayer (<a href="/psalms/95-6.htm">Psalm 95:6</a>, <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>), indicating a recognition of God's sovereignty and majesty. The call to bow in worship is a reminder of the proper attitude one should have when approaching the divine presence.<p><b>before the LORD</b><br>The use of "LORD" in all capitals signifies the covenant name of God, Yahweh, emphasizing His personal relationship with His people. Worship before the LORD is a central theme in the Old Testament, where God is depicted as dwelling among His people, first in the tabernacle and later in the temple. This phrase underscores the direct relationship between God and His worshipers, a theme that finds fulfillment in the New Testament with the indwelling of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>).<p><b>at the entrance to that gateway</b><br>The gateway mentioned here refers to the temple's outer gate, a place of transition from the secular to the sacred. In Ezekiel's vision of the temple, the gateway serves as a symbolic threshold where worshipers prepare to enter the presence of God. This location highlights the importance of preparation and reverence in worship. The concept of a gateway or door is also significant in the New Testament, where Jesus refers to Himself as the "door" (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>), through whom believers enter into a relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel's visions and prophecies often focus on the restoration of Israel and the proper worship of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_the_land.htm">The People of the Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites, God's chosen people, who are called to worship and honor God according to His commandments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who is the central focus of worship and reverence in this passage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gate.htm">The Gate</a></b><br>Symbolizes the place of access to God's presence, specifically the eastern gate of the temple, which holds significant spiritual symbolism.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbaths_and_new_moons.htm">Sabbaths and New Moons</a></b><br>These are appointed times of worship and rest, signifying regular and special occasions for the community to gather and honor God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/w/worship_as_a_community_obligation.htm">Worship as a Community Obligation</a></b><br>The passage emphasizes the collective responsibility of the people to worship God, highlighting the importance of communal worship in the life of believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/regular_and_special_times_of_worship.htm">Regular and Special Times of Worship</a></b><br>The mention of Sabbaths and New Moons underscores the rhythm of regular and special times set apart for God, encouraging believers to prioritize consistent worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_gate.htm">Symbolism of the Gate</a></b><br>The gate represents access to God's presence, reminding believers of the importance of approaching God with reverence and humility.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_faithfulness.htm">Covenant Faithfulness</a></b><br>Observing these appointed times is an expression of faithfulness to God's covenant, encouraging believers to live in obedience to God's commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/anticipation_of_future_worship.htm">Anticipation of Future Worship</a></b><br>The prophetic nature of the passage points to a future where all will worship God, inspiring hope and anticipation for the fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_46_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 46:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_46_3_on_communal_worship.htm">How does Ezekiel 46:3 emphasize the importance of communal worship for believers?

Kliefoth, who takes "this gate" to signify the outer gate, through which, according to his interpretation of ver. 2 (see above), the prince should pass so as to reach the inner east gate, conceives the import of the present verse to be that, while the prince should be permitted on the sabbaths and new moons to pass through the eastern gate, the people "should remain standing in front of the outer east gate, and, looking through it and the opened inner east gate, should pray before Jehovah." This, however, is unnatural, even on the hypothesis that the prince should pass through the outer east gate, and the view of Keil is greatly preferable, that "this gate" was <span class="accented">the inner east gate</span>, and that the people should reach it (even if the prince did not) by entering the outer court through the north gate or the south. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/46-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On the Sabbaths</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#353;&#183;&#353;ab&#183;b&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
