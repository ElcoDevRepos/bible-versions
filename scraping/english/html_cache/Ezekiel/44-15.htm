Zadok was a priest during the time of King David and Solomon, known for his faithfulness. His descendants were chosen for their loyalty, especially during times of national apostasy. This highlights the importance of faithfulness in service to God, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/2-35.htm">1 Kings 2:35</a>, where Zadok's line is established in the priesthood.<p><b>and who kept charge of My sanctuary</b><br>The sanctuary refers to the holy place where God's presence dwelt among the Israelites. Keeping charge implies maintaining the sanctity and order of worship, a task requiring diligence and reverence. This responsibility is echoed in <a href="/numbers/18-5.htm">Numbers 18:5</a>, where the Levites are charged with the care of the sanctuary to prevent wrath upon the Israelites.<p><b>when the Israelites went astray from Me</b><br>This phrase indicates a period of spiritual decline and idolatry among the Israelites.

The faithfulness of Zadok's line during these times is a testament to their commitment to God, contrasting with the unfaithfulness of others.<p><b>are to approach Me to minister before Me</b><br>Approaching God to minister signifies a special privilege and responsibility. The priests acted as mediators between God and the people, a role that required purity and dedication. This is reminiscent of <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>, where believers are encouraged to approach God's throne with confidence, highlighting the priestly role of intercession.<p><b>They will stand before Me to offer Me fat and blood</b><br>Offering fat and blood was a central part of the sacrificial system, symbolizing atonement and dedication. <a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16-17</a> outlines the significance of these offerings, emphasizing their role in maintaining a covenant relationship with God. This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself as the perfect atonement for sin.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD</b><br>This declaration underscores the authority and sovereignty of God in establishing the priesthood and its functions. It serves as a reminder of God's unchanging nature and His desire for a holy and obedient people, as seen throughout the prophetic writings, such as in <a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>, where God's purposes are affirmed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levitical_priests.htm">Levitical Priests</a></b><br>Descendants of Levi, set apart for religious duties and temple service in Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_zadok.htm">Sons of Zadok</a></b><br>A specific lineage within the Levitical priesthood, noted for their faithfulness during times of national apostasy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanctuary.htm">Sanctuary</a></b><br>The holy place where God's presence dwelt, and where the priests performed their sacred duties.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who often strayed from His commandments, leading to periods of judgment and restoration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/lord_god.htm">Lord GOD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His sovereignty and relationship with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_service.htm">Faithfulness in Service</a></b><br>The sons of Zadok are commended for their steadfastness.

That Ezekiel derived the phrase, <span class="cmt_word">the priests</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Levites</span>, from Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 17:9; 18:1; 24:8; 27:9) may be granted without admitting that the Levites were all priests, or that the phrase had other import than that the priests were, as the Deuteronomist says, "sons of Levi" (Deuteronomy 21:5; 31:9). The priesthood, at its institution, having been entrusted to Aaron and his sons (<a href="/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20, 21</a>; <a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1-4</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9, 44</a>; <a href="/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10</a>; <a href="/numbers/16-40.htm">Numbers 16:40</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>; <a href="/numbers/25-13.htm">Numbers 25:13</a>), on Aaron's death the high priesthood passed into the hands of Eleazar, his eldest (living) son (<a href="/numbers/20-26.htm">Numbers 20:26-28</a>), and after Eleazar's death into those of Phinehas, his eldest son (<a href="/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11-13</a>). In the last days of the judges, when the ark and tabernacle stood at Shiloh, the high priesthood belonged to Eli, of the line of Ithamar (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a> and 1 Sam 22:20 with <a href="/1_chronicles/24-3.htm">1 Chronicles 24:3</a>), in which line it continued till the reign of David, when it was held conjointly by Abiathar (called also Ahimelech) of the line of Ithamar, and Zadok of the line of Eleazar (<a href="/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-4.htm">1 Kings 4:4</a>). This arrangement, however, Solomon eventually overturned, by deposing the former for espousing Adonijah's pretensions to the throne (<a href="/1_kings/1-7.htm">1 Kings 1:7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26</a>), and from that time forward till the exile the high priesthood remained with Zadok and his sons (<a href="/1_kings/2-35.htm">1 Kings 2:35</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-22.htm">1 Chronicles 29:22</a>). When, therefore, it is announced to Ezekiel that his vision-sanctuary should have as <span class="cmt_word">priests the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of Jehovah's sanctuary, when the children of Israel went astray from him</span>; the first question that arises is - To <span class="accented">what does this allude?</span> Kliefoth holds it cannot mean that, while Israel as a whole declined into idolatry, the Zadokite priests remained faithful to the worship of Jehovah, because the vision of Judah's idolatries granted to the prophet, in <a href="/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>, revealed quite clearly that the priesthood was as much caught in the national apostasy as were the princes or the people. Nor is the language of the text perfectly satisfied by the view of Havernick, Keil, Delitzsch, and others, that it goes beck to Zadok's fidelity to the throne of David at the time of Absalom's rebellion (<a href="/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24-29</a>), a fidelity exhibited also by Abiathar, or to his adherence to Solomon in preference to Adonijah (<a href="/1_kings/1-8.htm">1 Kings 1:8, 39</a>), this time without Abiathar's concurrence, rather in the face of his opposition. In neither of these instances was Zadok's fidelity specially directed towards Jehovah's sanctuary, but concerned expressly and exclusively David's throne. Hence the commendation of the Zadokites' fidelity can only signify that, while the priesthood as a body were corrupt like the people, there were among them, as among the people, some who, like Ezekiel, continued steadfast to Jehovah's sanctuary; that these faithful few were Zadokites (see <a href="/ezekiel/48-11.htm">Ezekiel 48:11</a>), and that to these should be entrusted the priesthood in the new sanctuary. But, at this point, a second question <span class="accented">starts - Was it intended to declare that the new priesthood should be Zadokites in body</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in respect of lineal descent, or <span class="accented">only in soul</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in respect of moral and religious excellence? The former is contended by Kuenen, Wellhausen, Smend, and others, who see in the vision-sanctuary a plan of the second, or post-exilic, temple, and in its ordinances a program for the establishment of the Levitical hierarchy; but this contention shatters itself on the fact that no proof exists either that the second temple was constructed after Ezekiel's as a model, or that those who served in it were exclusively flesh and blood Zadokites. The latter opinion, favored by Kliefoth, appears the more correct, that moral and spiritual resemblance to the sons of Zadok should form the first qualification for the priesthood in this ideal sanctuary of the future (see note at the end of <a href="/ezekiel/48.htm">Ezekiel 48</a>.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But the Levitical</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1436;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hal&#183;w&#238;&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
