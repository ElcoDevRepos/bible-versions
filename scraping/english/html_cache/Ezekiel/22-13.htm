It is a divine summons for the audience to focus on what God is about to declare. In biblical literature, such calls often precede a pronouncement of judgment or a significant revelation.<p><b>I strike My hands together</b><br>The imagery of God striking His hands together is symbolic of anger and impending judgment. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, this gesture could signify frustration or the initiation of action. It underscores the intensity of God's displeasure with the actions of the people. This expression of divine wrath is consistent with other prophetic literature where God expresses His anger towards sin and injustice.<p><b>against your unjust gain</b><br>This phrase highlights the specific sin of acquiring wealth or advantage through dishonest or unethical means. In the context of Ezekiel, the leaders and people of Jerusalem were guilty of exploiting others for personal gain. This echoes the broader biblical theme of God's concern for justice and righteousness, as seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/11.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>, which condemns dishonest scales, and <a href="/amos/8-4.htm">Amos 8:4-6</a>, which criticizes those who exploit the needy.<p><b>and against the blood you have shed in your midst.</b><br>The shedding of blood refers to acts of violence and murder, which were prevalent in Jerusalem at the time. This phrase indicates a society marked by lawlessness and disregard for human life. The shedding of innocent blood is a grave sin in biblical teaching, as seen in <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a> with the story of Cain and Abel. It also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God as the defender of the innocent and the avenger of wrongful death, as seen in <a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>, which states that bloodshed defiles the land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites, often concerning their sin and the need for repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation addressed in this passage, specifically the people of Jerusalem, who are being rebuked for their sinful practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His anger and judgment against the injustices and violence committed by the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these injustices and bloodshed are taking place, serving as a focal point for God's judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context in which Ezekiel prophesied, a period of punishment and reflection for the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_displeasure_with_injustice.htm">God's Displeasure with Injustice</a></b><br>God is deeply displeased with unjust gain and violence.
