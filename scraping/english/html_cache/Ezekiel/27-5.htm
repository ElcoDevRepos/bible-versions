Cypress is known for its resistance to decay, making it ideal for maritime construction. Senir is another name for Mount Hermon, a significant mountain in the region, indicating the geographical source of the wood. This choice of material and location underscores the wealth and resources available to Tyre, the subject of Ezekiel's lament. The imagery of a well-crafted ship symbolizes Tyre's economic power and influence. In biblical context, the use of fine materials often signifies prosperity and divine blessing, but here it also foreshadows the impending judgment due to pride and reliance on wealth.<p><b>They took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.</b><br>Cedar from Lebanon was highly prized in the ancient world for its strength and aromatic qualities. It was used in the construction of significant structures, including Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>). The mention of Lebanon's cedar emphasizes the grandeur and prestige of Tyre's maritime endeavors. Historically, Lebanon's cedars were a symbol of majesty and were often associated with royal and sacred buildings. The mast, a central component of a ship, represents leadership and direction. In a prophetic sense, the reliance on such esteemed materials could be seen as a metaphor for human pride and self-reliance, contrasting with the biblical call to trust in God. The imagery of the mast also connects to the broader biblical theme of nations and leaders being likened to trees, as seen in passages like <a href="/daniel/4-10.htm">Daniel 4:10-12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Every plank of her &#8220;hull&#8221; is said to be crafted from hardy cypress cut on Mount Senir (another name for Mount Hermon; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-9.htm">Deuteronomy 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail highlights painstaking craftsmanship and lavish resources, underlining Tyre&#8217;s unmatched commercial power (<a href="/ezekiel/27-3.htm">Ezekiel 27:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; God includes geographic precision to show that everything Tyre possessed came from the lands He governs (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p>&#8226; By invoking Senir&#8217;s forests, Scripture recalls earlier alliances Israel once enjoyed with Phoenicia for temple timber (<a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6&#8211;10</a>). Now that same region is condemned, reminding readers that earthly glory without loyalty to the Lord crumbles (<a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; The imagery also contrasts with the righteous &#8220;cedars of Lebanon&#8221; planted by God Himself (<a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12&#8211;15</a>), underscoring that Tyre&#8217;s self-made splendor lacks true spiritual root.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you</b><p>&#8211; A single, towering cedar becomes the mast, symbolizing Tyre&#8217;s pride in steering her own destiny.<p>&#8226; Cedars of Lebanon were renowned for height, strength, and fragrance (<a href="/1_kings/4-33.htm">1 Kings 4:33</a>), fitting for the central pole that holds the sails of empire.<p>&#8226; The mast&#8217;s greatness mirrors Tyre&#8217;s global reach (<a href="/ezekiel/27-33.htm">Ezekiel 27:33</a>).

Tyre instead erects them for profit, illustrating misplaced devotion (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse subtly teaches stewardship: every resource&#8212;trees, trade routes, talents&#8212;belongs to God and must honor Him (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/27-5.htm">Ezekiel 27:5</a> portrays Tyre&#8217;s ship with planks of Senir cypress and a Lebanese cedar mast to expose the city&#8217;s opulent, yet ultimately fragile, self-reliance.

The fir tree was more commonly used for ships, the cedar for houses (Virgil, 'Georg.,' 2:444).
