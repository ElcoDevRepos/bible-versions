The north gateway is significant as it was one of the main entrances to the temple complex. In ancient Israel, the north side was often associated with judgment and sacrifice, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/1-11.htm">Leviticus 1:11</a>, where the north side of the altar is specified for the slaughter of offerings. The temple's orientation and gateways reflect the order and holiness required in approaching God.<p><b>there were two tables on one side</b><br>The presence of tables indicates preparation for sacrificial rituals. These tables were likely used for slaughtering animals, a critical part of the sacrificial system in the Old Testament. The number two may symbolize witness or testimony, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, where two witnesses are required to establish a matter. This could imply the importance of proper preparation and testimony in worship.<p><b>and two more tables on the other side of the gate&#8217;s portico</b><br>The symmetry of the tables on both sides of the portico suggests order and balance in the temple's design, reflecting God's nature of orderliness. The portico, or porch, served as a transitional space between the outer court and the inner sanctum, symbolizing the movement from the common to the holy.
