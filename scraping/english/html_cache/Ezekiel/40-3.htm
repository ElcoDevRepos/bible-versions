This reflects the prophetic tradition where God often directs His prophets to particular places to reveal His plans (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/18.htm">Jeremiah 18:1-2</a>). The "He" refers to the divine messenger or the Spirit of God, emphasizing the importance of the vision and the authority behind it.<p><b>and I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze</b><br>The "man" is often interpreted as an angelic figure or a theophany, a manifestation of God. The description "like bronze" suggests strength, purity, and divine glory, similar to the description of heavenly beings in other scriptures (e.g., <a href="/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>, <a href="/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>). Bronze, being a durable metal, symbolizes judgment and righteousness.<p><b>He was standing in the gateway</b><br>The gateway is significant as it represents access and transition, often symbolizing the entrance to sacred spaces. In the context of Ezekiel's vision, it is part of the temple complex, indicating the importance of the temple as a place of divine presence and worship. Gateways in ancient cities were also places of judgment and decision-making, adding layers of meaning to the vision.<p><b>with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand</b><br>The linen cord and measuring rod are tools for measurement, symbolizing precision, order, and divine standards. Linen is associated with purity and priestly garments (<a href="/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39-42</a>), suggesting holiness. The act of measuring indicates God's intention to restore and establish His order, as seen in other prophetic visions (e.g., <a href="/zechariah/2.htm">Zechariah 2:1-2</a>, <a href="/revelation/11.htm">Revelation 11:1</a>).

In his hand he carried a line <span class="cmt_word">of flax and a measuring-reed</span> (<span class="accented">kaneh hammidah</span>, or "reed of measuring," reed having been the customary material out of which such rods were made; compare the Assyrian for a measuring-reed <span class="accented">qanu</span>, the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, and the Latin canna). Possibly he carried these as "emblems of building activity" (Hengstenberg), and because "he had many and different things to measure" (Kliefoth); but most likely the line was meant to measure large dimensions (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/47-3.htm">Ezekiel 47:3</a>) and such as could not be taken by a straight stick, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the girth of pillars, and the rod to measure smaller dimensions, like those of the gates and walls of the temple. Hitzig's conjecture, that the line was linen because the place to be measured was the sanctuary, whose priests were obliged to clothe themselves in linen, Kliefoth rightly pronounces artificial and inaccurate, since the line was made, not of manufactured flax, or linen, but of the raw material. That the "man" was Jehovah or the Angel of the Presence (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a>) the analogy of <a href="/amos/8-7.htm">Amos 8:7, 8</a> and the statement of Ezekiel in <a href="/ezekiel/44-2.htm">Ezekiel 44:2, 5</a> would seem to suggest; only it is not certain in the last of these passages that the speaker was "the man" and not rather "the God of Israel," who had already taken possession of the house (see <a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>), and whose voice is once at least distinguished from that of the man (see <a href="/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Ezekiel 43:6</a>). Accordingly, Kliefoth, Smend, and others identify the "man" with the ordinary <span class="accented">angelus interpres</span> (cf. <a href="/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>). The <span class="cmt_word">gate</span> in which he stood "waiting for the new comer" was manifestly the north gate, since Ezekiel came from the north, though Havernick and Smend put in a plea for the east gate, on the grounds that it was the principal entrance to the sanctuary, and the distance between it and the north gate, five hundred cubits, was too great to be passed over so slightly as in ver. 6. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/40-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So He took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1448;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
