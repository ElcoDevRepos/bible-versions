His entrance signifies the beginning of a significant divine action or revelation. The context of Ezekiel's vision is a series of divine judgments and the departure of God's glory from the temple, emphasizing the seriousness of Israel's sin and the impending consequences.<p><b>the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple</b><br>Cherubim are angelic beings associated with the presence and glory of God, often depicted as guardians of sacred spaces. Their position on the south side of the temple may symbolize a specific aspect of divine judgment or protection. In the broader biblical narrative, cherubim are first mentioned in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a> as guardians of the Garden of Eden, and they are also prominently featured in the design of the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>), symbolizing God's throne and presence among His people.<p><b>and a cloud filled the inner court</b><br>The cloud is a recurring biblical symbol of God's presence and glory, often associated with divine revelation and guidance. In <a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>, a cloud covers the Tent of Meeting, signifying God's dwelling among the Israelites. Similarly, in <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>, a cloud fills Solomon's temple during its dedication, indicating God's acceptance and presence. In Ezekiel's vision, the cloud filling the inner court signifies the imminent departure of God's glory from the temple due to the people's unfaithfulness, foreshadowing the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple. This event underscores the seriousness of Israel's covenant breach and the necessity of divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>These are angelic beings often associated with the presence and glory of God.
