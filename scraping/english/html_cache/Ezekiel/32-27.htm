In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/32.htm">Ezekiel 32</a>, the prophet is speaking about the judgment and downfall of Egypt and its allies. The "fallen warriors of old" could be seen as a reference to the mighty men of renown mentioned in <a href="/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>, or other ancient warriors known for their strength and valor. This distinction highlights the shame and dishonor of not being counted among these notable figures, suggesting a lack of honor in death for those being addressed.<p><b>who went down to Sheol with their weapons of war</b><br>Sheol is the Hebrew term for the realm of the dead, often depicted as a shadowy place where the deceased reside. The imagery of warriors going down to Sheol with their weapons suggests a burial with honor, as it was customary in ancient Near Eastern cultures to bury warriors with their weapons as a sign of their valor and status. This practice is evidenced in archaeological findings, such as burial sites where weapons and other personal items were interred with the deceased.<p><b>whose swords were placed under their heads</b><br>This phrase indicates a burial custom where swords were placed under the heads of the deceased warriors, symbolizing their readiness and valor even in death. This practice reflects the honor given to warriors, ensuring they are remembered for their strength and bravery. It also signifies a form of eternal vigilance, as if they are prepared for battle even in the afterlife.<p><b>whose shields rested on their bones</b><br>The placement of shields on the bones of the deceased further emphasizes the honor and respect given to these warriors. Shields, as symbols of protection and strength, resting on their bones, suggest a continued legacy of their might and the protection they offered in life. This imagery reinforces the idea of a dignified burial, contrasting with the dishonor of those who do not receive such treatment.<p><b>although the terror of the mighty was once in the land of the living</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the fear and respect these warriors commanded during their lifetimes. The "terror of the mighty" suggests that these individuals were formidable and influential, instilling fear in their enemies and commanding respect from their allies. This reputation in life contrasts with their current state in Sheol, highlighting the transient nature of earthly power and the ultimate leveling effect of death. This serves as a reminder of the fleeting nature of human strength and the inevitability of divine judgment, a common theme throughout the book of Ezekiel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

The others have been honourably buried "with their weapons of war," while these come to a more disgraceful end. It is better, however, to take it as a question (which the Hebrew fully admits): "Shall they not?" &c.<p><span class= "bld">Their iniquities shall be upon their bones--</span><span class= "ital">i.e., they shall die in their iniquity.</span> As we say in English, their sins shall be upon their heads.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they shall not lie with the mighty</span>. The words seem at first to contradict Ver. 26. The LXX. meets the difficulty by omitting the negative; Ewald and Havernick, by taking it as an interrogative, "Shall they not lie," etc.? Probably the explanation is laying stress on the word "mighty." Meshech and Tubal have a lower place in Hades; they are buried without the honors of war. Their swords are not placed beneath their heads (for the practice thus referred to, see Died. Sic., 18:26; Arrian, 1:5; Virg., 'AEn.,' 6:233). For the Scythians, who worshipped the sword (Herod., L 62), this would be the extremest ignominy. In this way their iniquities should be <span class="cmt_word">upon their bones</span> as they lay dishonored. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/32-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
