It suggests a sequence of revelations, emphasizing the progressive nature of the visions Ezekiel is receiving. In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/8.htm">Ezekiel 8</a>, God is revealing the idolatrous practices occurring in the temple in Jerusalem. This ongoing communication underscores the intimate relationship between God and His prophets, as seen throughout the Old Testament, where God frequently speaks directly to His chosen messengers (e.g., Moses in <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a>, Isaiah in <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>).<p><b>&#8220;You will see them</b><br>Here, "them" refers to the leaders and people of Israel, particularly those involved in temple worship. The use of "see" implies that Ezekiel is being shown a vision, a common method through which God communicates divine truths and judgments to His prophets. This visual revelation is meant to convey the seriousness of the situation and the depth of Israel's unfaithfulness. The act of seeing in prophetic visions is significant, as it often involves spiritual insight beyond physical sight, as seen in other prophetic books like Daniel and Revelation.<p><b>committing even greater abominations.&#8221;</b><br>The term "abominations" refers to practices that are detestable and offensive to God, often associated with idolatry and pagan worship. In the historical and cultural context of ancient Israel, abominations included the worship of foreign gods, which was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). The phrase "even greater" suggests a progression or escalation in the severity of these sins, indicating that the people of Israel were not only continuing in their idolatry but were deepening their rebellion against God. This is consistent with the pattern of Israel's history, where periods of idolatry often led to greater moral and spiritual decline, as seen in the books of Kings and Chronicles. The prophetic warning here serves as a call to repentance and a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God, a theme echoed in the New Testament, where believers are warned against idolatry and called to faithfulness in Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-14.htm">1 Corinthians 10:14, 1</a> <a href="/john/5-21.htm">John 5:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of God's visions and messages, tasked with delivering them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, revealing to Ezekiel the abominations being committed by the Israelites, highlighting their idolatry and unfaithfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these abominations are taking place, specifically within the temple, which was meant to be a holy place dedicated to the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, which has been defiled by idolatrous practices, as shown in the visions given to Ezekiel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/abominations.htm">Abominations</a></b><br>Refers to the idolatrous and sinful practices being committed by the Israelites, which are detestable in the sight of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_idolatry.htm">The Seriousness of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but can also be anything that takes the place of God in our hearts.
