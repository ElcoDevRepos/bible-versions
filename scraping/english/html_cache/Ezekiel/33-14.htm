The concept of death here is both physical and spiritual, aligning with the broader biblical theme that sin leads to death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). The warning is a call to repentance, highlighting God's justice and mercy. In the historical context, Ezekiel was addressing the exiled Israelites in Babylon, urging them to turn from their ways. This reflects the covenantal relationship where God holds His people accountable but also offers a path to redemption.<p><b>and he turns from his sin</b><br>Repentance is a central theme in the Bible, and this phrase underscores the possibility of change and redemption. The Hebrew concept of repentance involves a complete turning away from sin and a return to God. This is not merely a change in behavior but a transformation of heart and mind. The call to repentance is echoed throughout Scripture, notably in the ministries of John the Baptist (<a href="/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>) and Jesus (<a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>). It signifies hope and the opportunity for restoration, even for the wicked.<p><b>and does what is just and right&#8212;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the evidence of genuine repentance, which is demonstrated through righteous actions. Biblical justice and righteousness involve living in accordance with God's laws and treating others with fairness and compassion. This reflects the teachings of the prophets, who often called for social justice and ethical living (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). In the New Testament, this is seen in the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized love and mercy as the fulfillment of the law (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>). The transformation from wickedness to righteousness is a type of Christ's redemptive work, where believers are called to live out their faith through actions that reflect God's character.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

His word is not a suggestion but an authoritative declaration that demands attention (<a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17-19</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>). When the Lord addresses &#8220;the wicked,&#8221; He identifies real moral rebellion, echoing earlier warnings such as &#8220;The soul who sins is the one who will die&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/18-4.htm">Ezekiel 18:4</a>). Like the prophet Jonah&#8217;s call to Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4</a>), the announcement comes from a God who is both just and merciful, giving fair notice before judgment falls.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;You will surely die,&#8217;</b><p>The sentence is certain&#8212;&#8220;surely&#8221; leaves no ambiguity. This mirrors <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>, where God told Adam, &#8220;you will surely die,&#8221; underscoring that death&#8212;both physical and spiritual&#8212;is the inevitable consequence of sin (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). The gravity of the warning presses the hearer to recognize the peril of remaining in rebellion (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>). God&#8217;s holiness cannot overlook sin, so He states the penalty plainly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he turns from his sin</b><p>Here the door of hope swings open. &#8220;Turn&#8221; implies a decisive change of direction&#8212;repentance. Scripture consistently links life to turning away from wrongdoing: &#8220;Repent, and turn from all your transgressions, so they will not be your downfall&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30-32</a>; <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>). This is not a superficial regret but a heartfelt abandonment of the old path, as illustrated in the prodigal son&#8217;s return (<a href="/luke/15-17.htm">Luke 15:17-20</a>). God is eager to forgive, but He requires real turning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and does what is just and right&#8212;</b><p>True repentance produces visible fruit. The wicked man now practices righteousness, fulfilling <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>&#8217;s call &#8220;to act justly and to love mercy.&#8221; <a href="/ezekiel/18-5.htm">Ezekiel 18:5-9</a> details what &#8220;just and right&#8221; looks like: honesty, compassion, integrity, and reverence for God. New deeds prove the change (<a href="/matthew/3-8.htm">Matthew 3:8</a>; <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>). Salvation is by grace, yet grace trains us &#8220;to live sensibly, righteously, and godly&#8221; (<a href="/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11-12</a>). Obedience is the evidence that repentance is genuine.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/33-14.htm">Ezekiel 33:14</a> declares that God warns the wicked of certain death, yet lovingly offers life if they repent and live righteously. The verse underscores His justice in judging sin and His mercy in providing a path to forgiveness. Genuine repentance&#8212;turning from sin and practicing what is just and right&#8212;moves a person from looming judgment to restored relationship with the living God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/33-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So when I tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124;
