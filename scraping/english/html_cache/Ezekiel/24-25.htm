This title emphasizes his humanity and role as a prophet among the people. It is a reminder of his position as a mediator between God and Israel, highlighting his task to deliver God's messages.<p><b>know that on the day I take away their stronghold,</b><br>The "stronghold" refers to Jerusalem, the city that the Israelites believed to be invincible due to God's presence in the temple. Historically, Jerusalem was a fortified city, and its fall to the Babylonians in 586 BC was a significant event. This phrase indicates God's judgment and the removal of what the people falsely relied upon for security.<p><b>their pride and joy&#8212;</b><br>Jerusalem and the temple were sources of national pride for the Israelites. The temple was not only a religious center but also a symbol of their identity and God's favor. The loss of these would be a devastating blow to their national and spiritual pride.<p><b>the desire of their eyes which uplifted their souls&#8212;</b><br>This phrase poetically describes the deep emotional and spiritual attachment the Israelites had to the temple and Jerusalem. It was the center of their worship and cultural life, and its beauty and significance were deeply cherished. The removal of this "desire" signifies a profound loss and a call to refocus their devotion on God rather than physical structures.<p><b>and their sons and daughters as well,</b><br>The inclusion of "sons and daughters" underscores the totality of the impending judgment. It highlights the personal and familial impact of the Babylonian conquest, as many would be killed or taken into exile. This reflects the broader biblical theme of generational consequences of sin and disobedience, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.
