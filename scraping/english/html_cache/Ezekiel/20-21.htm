The "children" refer to the generation that followed those who initially left Egypt.

The wilderness period was marked by God's discipline, as seen in <a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-35</a>, where the rebellious generation was condemned to die in the wilderness.

Ignoring details showed contempt for the Lawgiver (<a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; The warning presses us to heed Jesus&#8217; call to obey &#8220;all that I commanded you&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Though the man who does these things will live by them</b><p>&#8226; This clause echoes <a href="/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a>: &#8220;The one who does them will live by them.&#8221; Obedience brings blessing and life (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-15.htm">Deuteronomy 30:15-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul cites the same truth in <a href="/romans/10-5.htm">Romans 10:5</a> and <a href="/galatians/3-12.htm">Galatians 3:12</a> to prove that, while the Law promises life, our inability to keep it drives us to Christ for righteousness by faith (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Ezekiel is not teaching salvation by works but reaffirming the principle that God&#8217;s commands are life-giving when embraced in faith (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They profaned My Sabbaths</b><p>&#8226; The Sabbath was the covenant sign between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13-17</a>).

For Israel, it materialized as forty years of wandering until the rebellious generation died (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-35</a>).<p>&#8226; The wilderness discipline illustrates both justice and mercy: justice, because sin bears consequences; mercy, because God did not wipe them out entirely and still brought their children into the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-35.htm">Deuteronomy 1:35-38</a>).<p>&#8226; New-covenant believers are warned by this example: &#8220;Do not be idolaters as some of them were&#8230; God was not pleased with most of them, and their bodies were scattered in the wilderness&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-5.htm">1 Corinthians 10:5-11</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/20-21.htm">Ezekiel 20:21</a> recounts Israel&#8217;s ongoing refusal to obey God&#8212;rejecting His statutes, ordinances, and Sabbaths&#8212;despite His clear promise that obedience brings life.
