In the ancient Near East, oaths and covenants were considered sacred and binding, often sealed by invoking the name of a deity. Zedekiah's oath was made in the name of the Lord, making his betrayal not only a political act but also a spiritual transgression. This reflects the biblical theme of faithfulness to one's word, as seen in <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a> and <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>, where vows made before God are to be honored. The breaking of the covenant symbolizes Israel's broader unfaithfulness to God, a recurring theme in the prophetic literature.<p><b>Seeing that he gave his hand in pledge yet did all these things,</b><br>The act of giving one's hand in pledge was a customary gesture of agreement and trust in ancient cultures, akin to a handshake today. It signified a personal commitment to uphold the terms of an agreement. Zedekiah's pledge to Nebuchadnezzar was a formal acknowledgment of his vassal status, intended to ensure peace and stability. However, his subsequent rebellion by seeking an alliance with Egypt (<a href="/2_kings/24-20.htm">2 Kings 24:20</a>) demonstrated a lack of integrity and wisdom. This act of treachery is reminiscent of the warnings in <a href="/proverbs/6.htm">Proverbs 6:1-5</a> about the dangers of rash pledges and the importance of fulfilling one's commitments.<p><b>he will not escape!</b><br>This phrase serves as a prophetic declaration of the inevitable consequences of Zedekiah's actions. Despite his attempts to evade the repercussions of his rebellion, he would face judgment. Historically, this prophecy was fulfilled when Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians in 586 BC, and Zedekiah was captured, blinded, and taken to Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/25-7.htm">2 Kings 25:7</a>). This underscores the biblical principle that God holds individuals and nations accountable for their actions, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, "Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows." The certainty of divine justice is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, emphasizing that no one can escape the consequences of sin without repentance and divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
