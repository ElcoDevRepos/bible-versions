The "many peoples" refers to the surrounding nations who would witness the downfall of Egypt, a powerful and influential nation at the time. Historically, Egypt was a dominant force in the ancient Near East, and its fall would have been shocking to other nations. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over all nations, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Jeremiah, where God uses nations to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>and their kings will shudder in horror because of you</b><br>The reaction of the kings highlights the fear and awe that God's judgment can instill. In the ancient world, kings were seen as powerful and often divine figures, yet here they are depicted as trembling. This serves as a reminder of the ultimate authority of God over earthly rulers, a theme echoed in <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, where God is described as the one who "removes kings and sets up kings." The horror experienced by these kings underscores the severity of Egypt's judgment and serves as a warning to other nations.<p><b>when I brandish My sword before them</b><br>The imagery of God brandishing a sword is a powerful symbol of divine judgment and warfare. In biblical literature, the sword often represents God's instrument of justice and wrath, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-6</a>. This phrase emphasizes that the judgment is not merely a natural occurrence but a deliberate act of God. The sword being "before them" suggests that the nations are witnesses to God's direct intervention, reinforcing His role as the ultimate judge.<p><b>On the day of your downfall</b><br>This phrase specifies a particular time of judgment, indicating that Egypt's fall is both certain and divinely appointed. The "day" often signifies a moment of significant divine action in biblical prophecy, akin to the "Day of the Lord" found in other prophetic texts. It serves as a reminder of the inevitability of God's plans and the fulfillment of His prophetic word, as seen in the consistent pattern of prophecy and fulfillment throughout the Bible.<p><b>each of them will tremble every moment for his life.</b><br>The individual response of trembling "every moment" highlights the pervasive and personal impact of God's judgment. It suggests a continuous state of fear and anxiety, reflecting the totality of God's power and the seriousness of His decrees. This personal fear is reminiscent of the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), but here it is a fear of impending judgment. The phrase underscores the vulnerability of even the most powerful individuals when faced with divine judgment, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture, reminding believers of the importance of aligning with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

The phrase underlines that the Lord alone directs history; He &#8220;makes nations great, and destroys them&#8221; (<a href="/job/12-23.htm">Job 12:23</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, it reminds us that God&#8217;s acts&#8212;whether mercy or judgment&#8212;reveal His holiness to the watching world (<a href="/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and their kings will shudder in horror because of you</b><p>Leaders who once looked to Egypt for power or protection will quake.<p>&#8226; This fulfills God&#8217;s word that earthly rulers ultimately answer to Him (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Compare the reaction of Moab&#8217;s princes in <a href="/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4</a> or the merchants of Babylon in <a href="/revelation/18-9.htm">Revelation 18:9</a>; when a strong empire collapses, its allies panic.<p>&#8226; The shuddering of kings shows that no throne stands secure apart from the Lord (<a href="/psalms/2-10.htm">Psalm 2:10&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when I brandish My sword before them</b><p>The &#8220;sword&#8221;

Though foreign armies carry it out, the real wielder is God: &#8220;The sword is Mine&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25</a>).<p>&#8226; For Christians, this underlines Christ&#8217;s future role as Judge, pictured with &#8220;a sharp sword&#8221;

The certainty of judgment urges all people to &#8220;seek the LORD while He may be found&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>each of them will tremble every moment for his life</b><p>Fear spreads from royalty to commoners;

Such terror highlights the emptiness of trusting in human power rather than God (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet believers find security, for &#8220;there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus&#8221;

The Lord personally wields the sword, sets the day, and ensures that even the mightiest learn that sovereignty belongs to Him alone. For us, the passage warns against pride and misplaced trust while pointing to the refuge found in submitting to the righteous Judge who holds history&#8212;and our lives&#8212;in His hands.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/32-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will cause many</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(rab&#183;b&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7227.htm">Strong's 7227: </a> </span><span class="str2">Much, many, great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">peoples</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5971.htm">Strong's 5971: </a> </span><span class="str2">A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to be appalled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;ha&#774;&#183;&#353;im&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
