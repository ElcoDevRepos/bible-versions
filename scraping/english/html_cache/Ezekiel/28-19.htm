Tyre was a significant Phoenician city known for its wealth and influence, and its king was a symbol of pride and arrogance. The nations' reaction of being "appalled" indicates the severity of the downfall. This echoes the broader biblical theme of God's judgment on pride and self-exaltation, as seen in the fall of Babylon (<a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>) and the judgment on Egypt (<a href="/ezekiel/32-10.htm">Ezekiel 32:10</a>). The reaction of the nations underscores the public and humiliating nature of the judgment, serving as a warning to others.<p><b>You have come to a horrible end</b><br>The "horrible end" signifies the complete and utter destruction that has befallen the subject. In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/28.htm">Ezekiel 28</a>, this is a prophetic declaration against the king of Tyre, whose pride and self-deification led to his downfall. Historically, Tyre was besieged and eventually conquered by various empires, including the Babylonians and later Alexander the Great. This phrase can also be seen as a typological foreshadowing of the ultimate defeat of Satan, who is often associated with the prideful figure in this chapter. The "horrible end" serves as a reminder of the consequences of rebellion against God.<p><b>and will be no more.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The finality of "will be no more" emphasizes the totality of the judgment. This phrase indicates not just a temporary setback but a permanent eradication. In the historical context, Tyre's eventual decline and loss of its former glory fulfill this prophecy. Theologically, this can be seen as a representation of the ultimate fate of all who oppose God, aligning with the eschatological themes found in Revelation, where evil is ultimately destroyed (<a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>).

Alexander scraped the city into the sea in 332 BC, and though later settlements existed, the ancient glory vanished&#8212;exactly as prophesied.<p>&#8226; This finality also hints at a deeper reality. The lament over Tyre&#8217;s king rises beyond a human monarch to point toward the ultimate rebel, Satan, who will likewise be &#8220;no more&#8221; after the lake of fire (<a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s judgments are not temporary slaps on the wrist; they are decisive acts that end rebellion (<a href="/isaiah/14-15.htm">Isaiah 14:15&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/28-19.htm">Ezekiel 28:19</a> declares that the once-celebrated city-state of Tyre would become a benchmark of divine judgment.

The verse reminds us that worldly success can vanish overnight under God&#8217;s hand, and it foreshadows the ultimate defeat of every proud, rebellious power. The Lord&#8217;s word proved literally true for Tyre, and it assures us that His final judgments&#8212;swift, shocking, and complete&#8212;will likewise stand unchallenged.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be a terror</span>, etc. The knell of doom, as heard in <a href="/ezekiel/27-36.htm">Ezekiel 27:36</a>, rings out again. The same judgment falls alike on the city and on its king. The question when and in what manner the prediction received its fulfillment has been much discussed. Josephus ('Ant.,' 10:11. 1; 'Contra Apion,' 1:19) states that Nebuchadnezzar besieged the island Tyre and Ithobal (Ethbaal III.) for thirteen years; that, on his father's death, leaving his Phoenician and other captives to be brought by slower stages, he himself hastened to Babylon, and that afterwards he conquered the whole of Syria and Phoenicia; but he does not say, with all the Tyrian records before him, that the city was actually captured by him. It has been inferred, indeed, from <a href="/ezekiel/29-18.htm">Ezekiel 29:18</a>, that Nebuchadnezzar's siege of Tyre ended in, at least, partial failure, that he and his army had no "wages" for their work, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that the spoil of the city was meager and disappointing. Possibly the merchant-princes of the city had contrived to carry off part of their treasures in their ships. On the other hand, it may be noted <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the national historians of the ancient world (perhaps not of that only) willingly minimized the disasters of their country; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the Phoenician fragment quoted by Josephus ('Contra Apion,' 1:21) simply for synchronistic purposes, shows a significant change of government following on the siege. Ithobal was "king" during the thirteen years, but afterwards "judges" were appointed, and these ruled for periods of two, or three, or ten months. All this indicates a period of confusion and anarchy, the consequence of some great catastrophe. As a whole, too, we have to remember that it was with Tyre, as with Babylon and with other nations. The prophecies against them had "springing and germinant accomplishments." What the prophet saw in vision, as wrought out in a moment of time, was actually the outcome of the slow decay of centuries, and of catastrophes separated from each other by long intervals of a dwindling history. The main facts of that history may be briefly stated. There was, as implied in <a href="/isaiah/23-17.htm">Isaiah 23:17</a>, a revival of commerce under the Persian monarchy, and of this we have traces in <a href="/nehemiah/13-16.htm">Nehemiah 13:16</a>. Two hundred and fifty years after Nebuchadnezzar, Tyre was still so strongly fortified that Alexander the Great did not take it till after a seven years' siege (Died. Sic., 17:20; Arrian., 2:17; Q. Curtius, 4:2-4). It rose again into wealth and power under the Selencidare, and the Romans made it the capital of their province of Phoenicia. It appears as a flourishing town in <a href="/matthew/15-21.htm">Matthew 15:21</a>; <a href="/acts/12-20.htm">Acts 12:20</a>; <a href="/acts/21-37.htm">Acts 21:37</a>, and is described by Strabo (16:2, 23), as having two harbors and lofty houses. From A.D. to 1125 it was in the hands of the Saracens. Saladin attacked it without success in A.D. . In A.D. , after Acre had been taken by storm by El-Ashraf, Sultan of Egypt, Tyro passed into his hands without a struggle. When it again passed into the power of the Saracens, its fortifications were demolished, and from that time it sank gradually into its present obscurity. The present <span class="accented">Sur is a</span> small town of narrow, crooked, and dirty streets, and the ruins of the old Phoenician city cover the suburbs to the extent of half a league round. The harbor is choked up with sand, and with remains of the old palaces and walls and temples, and is available for small boats only. The sea has swallowed up its grandeur. The soft on which the traveler stands is a mass of <span class="accented">debris</span>, in which marble, porphyry, and granite mingle with coarser stones. So it has come to pass that it is little more than "a place for the spreading of nets" and that the sentence, "Thou shalt never be any more," seems to be receiving its fulfillment.
