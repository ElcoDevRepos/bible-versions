The context of <a href="/ezekiel/28.htm">Ezekiel 28</a> is a lamentation over the King of Tyre, but it is often interpreted as a dual reference to both the earthly king and a symbolic representation of Satan. The beauty mentioned here can be seen as both literal, in terms of the wealth and splendor of Tyre, and metaphorical, representing the original perfection of Lucifer before his fall. Pride is a sin that leads to downfall, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall."<p><b>you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor;</b><br>The corruption of wisdom due to splendor suggests that the King of Tyre, or Lucifer, allowed external magnificence to cloud judgment and lead to moral decay. This reflects the biblical principle that true wisdom comes from humility and the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The splendor that should have been a testament to God's glory became a source of self-exaltation, leading to corruption. This mirrors the fall of Lucifer, who was created perfect in wisdom and beauty but became corrupt through pride (<a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-15</a>).<p><b>so I cast you to the earth;</b><br>This phrase signifies judgment and expulsion. In the historical context, it refers to the downfall of the King of Tyre, whose city was eventually destroyed. Symbolically, it parallels the casting down of Satan from heaven, as described in <a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>. The act of being cast to the earth represents a loss of position and authority, a theme echoed in the fall of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden due to sin (Genesis 3).<p><b>I made you a spectacle before kings.</b><br>The imagery of becoming a spectacle before kings indicates public humiliation and serves as a warning to others. Historically, the fall of Tyre was witnessed by surrounding nations, demonstrating the consequences of pride and rebellion against God. This concept is reinforced in the New Testament, where the defeat of spiritual powers is made a public spectacle through Christ's victory on the cross (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>). The phrase underscores the ultimate triumph of God's justice and the futility of opposing His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
