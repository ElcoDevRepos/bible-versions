The expression "as surely as I live" is an oath formula, underscoring the seriousness of the message. It reflects God's eternal nature and His sovereign rule over all creation. This is a common biblical expression used to affirm the truthfulness of a statement (e.g., <a href="/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>, <a href="/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>).<p><b>even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it,</b><br>Noah, Daniel, and Job are presented as paragons of righteousness. Noah is known for his faithfulness in a corrupt generation (Genesis 6-9), Daniel for his unwavering devotion in a pagan society (Daniel 1-6), and Job for his perseverance in suffering (Job 1-2). Their inclusion highlights the severity of the judgment being pronounced, as even these exemplary figures could not avert it. This also suggests a historical context where these figures were well-known and respected for their righteousness.<p><b>they could not deliver their own sons or daughters.</b><br>This phrase underscores the principle of individual responsibility before God. It reflects the biblical teaching that each person is accountable for their own actions (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>). The inability of these righteous men to save their children emphasizes the personal nature of salvation and judgment.<p><b>Their righteousness could deliver only themselves.</b><br>The emphasis here is on personal righteousness and its limitations. While righteousness is commendable, it cannot be transferred or imputed to others in terms of salvation from temporal judgment. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that each person must have their own relationship with God (<a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that righteousness comes through faith in Jesus Christ, who alone can deliver from ultimate judgment (<a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man who found favor in the eyes of the Lord and was chosen to survive the flood with his family (Genesis 6-9).

The seriousness of the impending judgment is therefore beyond dispute. In <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/14.htm">Ezekiel 14</a> the Lord has already listed four devastating judgments (famine, beasts, sword, plague, vv. 12-21); this oath tells the exiles that none of these threats will be withdrawn.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Declares the Lord GOD</b><p>The message is not Ezekiel&#8217;s personal opinion but the sovereign decree of the covenant-keeping LORD (<a href="/isaiah/45-18.htm">Isaiah 45:18</a>; <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>). Because God speaks with absolute authority and perfect truthfulness (<a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>), the people must accept that the coming discipline is certain and deserved.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it</b><p>God selects three men whose reputations for righteousness were legendary:<p>&#8226; Noah&#8212;&#8220;righteous and blameless&#8221; in a corrupt world (<a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>; 7:1; <a href="/2_peter/2-5.htm">2 Peter 2:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Daniel&#8212;already famous in Babylon for integrity and faith (<a href="/daniel/6-4.htm">Daniel 6:4</a>; 9:23).<p>&#8226; Job&#8212;&#8220;blameless and upright,&#8221; persevering through suffering (<a href="/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>; <a href="/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>).<p>Their combined presence could not reverse Judah&#8217;s fate; entrenched idolatry had exhausted divine patience (<a href="/jeremiah/15-1.htm">Jeremiah 15:1</a>).

Righteous parents cannot rescue unrepentant children, nor can godly children shield erring parents (<a href="/2_kings/23-25.htm">2 Kings 23:25-27</a>).
