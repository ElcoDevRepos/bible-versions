Historically, the Zadokites were a priestly family that remained faithful to God during times of widespread idolatry in Israel. The sanctuary refers to the holy place where God's presence dwelt, highlighting the sacredness and purity required to enter. This exclusivity underscores the importance of holiness and obedience in approaching God, a theme consistent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>and draw near to My table</b><br>The table likely refers to the table of showbread in the temple, which symbolized God's provision and covenant with Israel. Drawing near to the table signifies a close relationship with God and the privilege of serving in His presence. This act of drawing near is a precursor to the New Testament concept of believers having direct access to God through Jesus Christ, who is often seen as the ultimate fulfillment of the temple and its furnishings.<p><b>to minister before Me</b><br>Ministering before God involves performing sacred duties and offering sacrifices, which were central to the priestly role. This service was not just a ritual but a representation of intercession between God and His people. The priests' ministry foreshadows the mediatory work of Christ, who serves as the ultimate High Priest, interceding on behalf of humanity.<p><b>They will keep My charge</b><br>Keeping God's charge involves obedience to His commandments and maintaining the sanctity of worship. This phrase reflects the covenantal relationship between God and His chosen servants, where faithfulness is rewarded with the privilege of serving in His presence. It also points to the broader biblical theme of stewardship and responsibility, which is echoed in the New Testament teachings on faithfulness and service in the Kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.
