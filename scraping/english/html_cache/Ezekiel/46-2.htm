The "prince" likely refers to a leader or ruler in Israel, possibly a Davidic figure, symbolizing governance under God's law. The "portico of the gateway" refers to the entrance of the temple, emphasizing the sacredness of the space. This entrance from the outside signifies the prince's role as a mediator between the people and God, similar to how Christ is seen as the mediator in the New Testament (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><b>and stand by the gatepost</b><br>Standing by the gatepost signifies a position of readiness and respect. The gatepost marks the boundary between the sacred and the common, highlighting the prince's role in maintaining the sanctity of worship. This act of standing can be seen as a type of Christ, who stands at the door and knocks (<a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>), inviting believers into fellowship.<p><b>while the priests sacrifice his burnt offerings and peace offerings</b><br>The involvement of priests in offering sacrifices underscores the importance of the Levitical priesthood in mediating between God and man. Burnt offerings symbolize atonement and dedication to God, while peace offerings represent fellowship and thanksgiving. This reflects the sacrificial system established in Leviticus, pointing to Christ's ultimate sacrifice, which fulfills and surpasses these offerings (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>He is to bow in worship at the threshold of the gate</b><br>Bowing in worship indicates humility and reverence before God. The threshold of the gate represents the transition from the secular to the sacred, emphasizing the prince's acknowledgment of God's sovereignty. This act of worship parallels the humility of Christ, who, though divine, humbled Himself in obedience to God (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>).<p><b>and then depart</b><br>The departure of the prince after worship suggests a return to his duties, having fulfilled his religious obligations. This reflects the balance between worship and service, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. It also mirrors the pattern of Christ, who often withdrew to pray and then returned to minister to the people (<a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35-39</a>).<p><b>but the gate must not be shut until evening</b><br>Keeping the gate open until evening signifies continued access to God's presence and blessings throughout the day. This openness can be seen as a type of the New Covenant, where believers have continual access to God through Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>). The evening closure marks the end of the day's activities, symbolizing rest and completion, akin to the rest found in Christ (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prince.htm">The Prince</a></b><br>A leader or ruler who has a special role in the temple worship.

The prince stops at the threshold; he does not usurp priestly territory (<a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>).<p>&#8226; His station parallels kings who honored priestly boundaries, the opposite of Uzziah who forced his way into the sanctuary and was judged (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-18</a>).<p>&#8226; This balance of civil and priestly roles foreshadows perfect harmony in Messiah&#8217;s kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The priests sacrifice his burnt and peace offerings</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;While the priests sacrifice his burnt offerings and peace offerings.&#8221; Priests alone handle the altar (<a href="/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>; 3:2).<p>&#8226; The prince supplies the animals (<a href="/ezekiel/45-17.htm">Ezekiel 45:17</a>), but mediation remains through the priesthood, keeping the pattern God established at Sinai (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Millennial sacrifices serve as memorials of Christ&#8217;s once-for-all atonement (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>) and provide tangible worship for nations on earth (<a href="/zechariah/14-16.htm">Zechariah 14:16-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bowing in worship at the threshold</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;He is to bow in worship at the threshold of the gate.&#8221; The prince&#8217;s posture reflects humility (<a href="/psalms/95-6.htm">Psalm 95:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Bowing at the threshold&#8212;within sight of the altar yet not upon it&#8212;demonstrates submission to God&#8217;s holiness (<a href="/ezekiel/44-4.htm">Ezekiel 44:4</a>).<p>&#8226; This resonates with David&#8217;s longing: &#8220;I would rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/84-10.htm">Psalm 84:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then depart</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;And then depart&#8221; shows that worship has an orderly beginning and end. The prince does not linger to control proceedings (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p>&#8226; His exit allows the people to follow the same pattern (<a href="/ezekiel/46-8.htm">Ezekiel 46:8-9</a>), modeling corporate rhythm of approach, worship, and return to daily life under God&#8217;s blessing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The gate must not be shut until evening</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;But the gate must not be shut until evening.&#8221; The open gate signals extended access for worshippers the prince represents (<a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>, daily offerings morning and evening).<p>&#8226; Light remains until sundown, symbolizing God&#8217;s invitation; in the New Jerusalem the gates &#8220;will never be shut by day&#8212;there will be no night there&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/21-25.htm">Revelation 21:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Keeping the gate open also underscores security and peace in Messiah&#8217;s reign&#8212;no enemy will breach the sacred precincts (<a href="/isaiah/60-11.htm">Isaiah 60:11</a>,18).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/46-2.htm">Ezekiel 46:2</a> pictures the future Davidic prince modeling reverent, orderly worship in the millennial temple. He enters humbly, stands at the appointed place, relies on priests to present his offerings, bows in adoration, departs in obedience, and leaves the gateway open for continued access until evening. The verse highlights God-ordained roles, the necessity of mediation, and the gracious invitation for all to worship the LORD in His restored sanctuary.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/46.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Stand by the post of the gate.--</span>The prince shall enter the sanctuary by the east gate of the outer court, pass through that court to the inner gate, and "worship at the threshold of the gate" immediately adjoining the inner court, while the priests make ready his sacrifices. But he is not to enter the inner court, or to assume any priestly functions. Afterwards he is to go forth by the same way (<a href="/ezekiel/46-8.htm" title="And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.">Ezekiel 46:8</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/44-3.htm" title="It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.">Ezekiel 44:3</a>), and the gate stands open until evening, though no one else is to enter thereby.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - The reason for the opening of this inner east gate should be that the prince might enter it as far as its threshold, and stand there worshipping by the posts of the gate, while his burnt offerings and his peace offerings were being prepared by the priests, who, rather than the prince, were the proper ministers for conducting the sacrificial ceremony. The prince should reach his station at the threshold of the inner gate, <span class="cmt_word">by the way of the porch of that</span> (or, the) <span class="cmt_word">gate without</span>; but whether this signified that he should pass through the eastern gate of the outer court, and so advance towards the inner east gate, as Ewald, Keil, Kliefoth, and Plumptre assume, or, as Hengstenberg, Schroder, and Smend suppose, that he should enter the inner gate by the way of the porch of the gate, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the outside, from the outer court into which he had previously entered through either the north or the south outer gates, cannot be decided. In favor of the former may be urged the consideration that it seems more natural to apply <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span> to the outer gate than to the outer court, since no, one could enter the inner gate except from the outer court, unless he were already in the inner court; but in favor of the latter is <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the stringent character of the language in <a href="/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1-3</a>, which expressly declares that the outer east gate should not be opened, and that no man <span class="accented">should enter in by it</span>, thus scarcely admitting of an exception; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the statement in vers. 9, 10 of the present chapter, that in the "appointed feasts" the prince and the people alike should enter the outer court either by the north or the south gate, since, if any of these "feasts" fell upon a sabbath, this regulation would not be practicable, if the prince and the people were required to enter by different doors. The question, however, in itself is immaterial. The points of importance are that the prince should worship in the porch of the inner gate, and that, on finishing his worship, he should retire, and that the gate should not be shut; until the evening. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/46-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The prince</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1441;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#347;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
