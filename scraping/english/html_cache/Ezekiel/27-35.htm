The "coastlands" likely include regions around the Mediterranean Sea, which were connected through trade with Tyre. Tyre was a major maritime power, and its destruction would have sent shockwaves through these trading partners. The term "appalled" indicates a sense of shock and horror, reflecting the magnitude of Tyre's fall. This reaction underscores the city's influence and the economic and cultural ties it had with surrounding nations. The prophecy against Tyre serves as a warning of God's judgment against pride and self-reliance, themes echoed in other scriptures such as <a href="/isaiah/23.htm">Isaiah 23</a> and <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, which also describe the fall of great cities.<p><b>Their kings shudder with fear;</b><br>The "kings" here represent the rulers of the nations that traded with Tyre. Their fear is a response to the sudden collapse of a powerful ally and trading partner. This fear is not just economic but also political, as Tyre's fall could signal a shift in regional power dynamics. The imagery of kings shuddering suggests a deep, visceral reaction, highlighting the seriousness of the situation. This phrase can be connected to the broader biblical theme of the transient nature of earthly power and the ultimate sovereignty of God, as seen in passages like <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, where God is described as the one who "removes kings and sets up kings."<p><b>their faces are contorted.</b><br>The contortion of faces symbolizes extreme distress and confusion. This vivid imagery conveys the depth of the emotional and psychological impact of Tyre's destruction on its neighbors. In the ancient Near Eastern context, facial expressions were often used to convey inner turmoil and despair. This reaction can be seen as a fulfillment of divine prophecy, demonstrating the certainty and severity of God's judgments. The contorted faces also serve as a metaphor for the upheaval and disorder that follows the fall of a great city, reminiscent of the lamentations over Babylon in <a href="/revelation/18-9.htm">Revelation 18:9-19</a>, where the merchants and kings mourn the city's demise.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/inhabitants_of_the_coastlands.htm">Inhabitants of the Coastlands</a></b><br>These are the people living in the regions along the Mediterranean Sea.

Think of merchants, sailors, and port cities that depended on Tyre&#8217;s trade routes&#8212;Spain (Tarshish), Cyprus, the Aegean islands, even distant Britain. These coastal peoples had witnessed Tyre&#8217;s wealth (<a href="/ezekiel/27-3.htm">Ezekiel 27:3, 12, 25</a>) and now watch helplessly as it sinks. The scene echoes earlier warnings that God&#8217;s judgment on a proud city ripples outward (<a href="/ezekiel/26-15.htm">Ezekiel 26:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1-5</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-9.htm">Revelation 18:9-10</a>). In other words, when the Lord pulls down a hub of sin-soaked prosperity, everyone tied to it feels the tremor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Are appalled over you</b><p>&#8220;Appalled&#8221; pictures stunned disbelief&#8212;mouths open, hands on heads. The coastlands never expected Tyre&#8217;s fortified island and financial clout to crack. Yet God&#8217;s word overrides human confidence every time (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10-11</a>). The reaction mirrors Nineveh&#8217;s collapse (<a href="/nahum/3-5.htm">Nahum 3:5-7</a>) and Babylon&#8217;s in <a href="/revelation/18-15.htm">Revelation 18:15-17</a>. Judgment opens blind eyes to the frailty of human glory and the certainty of divine justice. The takeaway is sober: if even Tyre can fall, no nation, company, or individual is untouchable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Their kings shudder with fear</b><p>Rulers who once bartered with Tyre now tremble. They grasp that if the Lord can topple such a powerhouse, their own thrones stand on thin ice. Ezekiel&#8217;s earlier oracle against Egypt stated the same principle: &#8220;the hearts of the mighty will melt&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/32-10.htm">Ezekiel 32:10</a>). Similar language appears in <a href="/joshua/2-11.htm">Joshua 2:11</a> when Canaanite kings &#8220;lost heart&#8221; hearing of God&#8217;s acts. The pattern is clear&#8212;when God judges, earthly authority feels its limits. The right response is humble reverence, not renewed self-reliance (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Their faces are contorted</b><p>The original picture is of faces twitching or paling&#8212;visible, involuntary terror. God&#8217;s interventions aren&#8217;t abstract; they register on human features. Jeremiah used identical imagery about Edom (<a href="/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>). Revelation shows merchants &#8220;weeping and mourning&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/18-11.htm">Revelation 18:11</a>). Physical reactions underscore how real and sudden divine judgment can be. No amount of diplomatic decorum hides raw fear when God&#8217;s hand moves.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/27-35.htm">Ezekiel 27:35</a> shows the collapse of Tyre reverberating across the Mediterranean world. Coastal peoples gape, their kings tremble, and terror twists their faces. The verse reminds us that God&#8217;s judgments on pride and idolatrous wealth reach far beyond the immediate target, exposing the fragility of every earthly security. The fear it sparks is meant to drive observers to humble dependence on the Lord, whose word stands when every fortress and fortune falls.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/27-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1434;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3427.htm">Strong's 3427: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sit down, to dwell, to remain, to settle, to marry</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the coastlands</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#183;y&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
