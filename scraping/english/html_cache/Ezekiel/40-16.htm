In ancient Near Eastern architecture, such features were not only functional but also symbolic of protection and vigilance. The beveled windows allowed light to enter while maintaining security, symbolizing spiritual illumination and divine oversight. This imagery can be connected to the idea of God as a watchful guardian over His people, as seen in <a href="/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a>, where God is described as one who neither slumbers nor sleeps.<p><b>The porticos also had windows all around on the inside.</b><br>The presence of windows in the porticos indicates openness and transparency, reflecting the accessibility of God's presence to His people. In the context of the temple vision, these windows may symbolize the revelation of divine truth and the invitation for worshippers to approach God. The design of the porticos with windows all around suggests a welcoming environment, reminiscent of the open invitation to come into God's presence, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/55.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>, which calls all who are thirsty to come to the waters.<p><b>Each side pillar was decorated with palm trees.</b><br>Palm trees in biblical symbolism often represent victory, peace, and eternal life. The decoration of the side pillars with palm trees could signify the triumph of God's kingdom and the peace that comes from His rule. In the context of the temple vision, these palm trees may also point to the flourishing and prosperity of God's people under His care. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where a great multitude stands before the throne with palm branches in their hands, symbolizing victory and salvation through Christ. The use of palm trees as decoration also connects to the Feast of Tabernacles, a time of rejoicing and remembrance of God's provision, as described in <a href="/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the detailed vision of a new temple in chapters 40-48.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The vision of the temple in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40</a> represents a future restoration and ideal worship space, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gateway.htm">The Gateway</a></b><br>Part of the temple structure, the gateway is described with specific architectural details, emphasizing order and divine design.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/palm_trees.htm">Palm Trees</a></b><br>Decorative elements in the temple vision, symbolizing victory, peace, and eternal life, often associated with the presence of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/windows_with_beveled_frames.htm">Windows with Beveled Frames</a></b><br>Architectural features that allow light into the temple, symbolizing illumination and divine revelation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_order_and_design.htm">Divine Order and Design</a></b><br>God's attention to detail in the temple's design reflects His nature of order and beauty.

The beveled windows flood the entire gateway complex with guarded yet pervasive light, picturing God&#8217;s pure illumination. Porticos repeat that message, guiding worshipers deeper into continual fellowship. Palm carvings announce victory and flourishing anchored in the Lord. Collectively, the verse teaches that God builds His dwelling with beauty, order, and meaning, ensuring that all who enter are reminded of His light, His faithfulness, and His triumphant life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> there were <span class="cmt_word">narrow</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">closed</span>) <span class="cmt_word">windows</span>, probably of lattice-work, so fixed as to prevent either egress or ingress. That these "windows" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, so called from being perforated) were intended to impart light to the gateway, either in whole or in part, is apparent, though it is difficult to form a clear idea of how they were situated. They were in the chambers, and in their posts and in the arches, or <span class="accented">colonnades</span> (Revised Version margin). In the chambers, or "lodges," they were most likely in the back walls, and in or near the posts, or pillars, belonging to the doors of these chambers, the clause, "and in their posts," being regarded as epexegetic of the preceding, and designed to furnish a more precise explanation of the particular part of the guard-room in which the windows were. Similar windows existed in the Solomonic temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-4.htm">1 Kings 6:4</a>). The "arches," or "colonnades" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;</span>), were probably wall-projections on the sides of the chambers, to that light was admitted from three sides. Thus to one standing within, the whole gateway appeared studded round and round with windows. The description of the gate closes with the statement that upon each post were palm trees, which may signify either that the shaft was fashioned like a palm tree, as is sometimes seen in ancient buildings in the East (Dr. Currey, Plumptre) or that it was ornamented with representations of palm branches or palm trees (Keil, Ewald, Kliefoth). Hengstenberg's idea, that "whole palms beside the pillars are meant," is favored by Smend, who cites, in addition to ver. 26, <a href="/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18</a>, etc., and <a href="/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>;
