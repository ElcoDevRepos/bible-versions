The imagery of falling by the sword is a common biblical metaphor for defeat and destruction in battle, often used to describe divine judgment against nations or individuals who have opposed God's will. In the context of Ezekiel, this prophecy is directed towards Egypt, a nation that had been a significant power in the ancient Near East. Historically, Egypt had been involved in various conflicts with Israel and other nations, often opposing God's people. The sword symbolizes God's instrument of judgment, and falling among the slain suggests a complete and utter defeat, aligning with the broader theme of divine retribution found throughout the prophetic books.<p><b>The sword is appointed!</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the certainty and inevitability of the judgment. The appointment of the sword signifies that this is a divine decree, not a random act of violence. In biblical terms, when God appoints something, it is assured to come to pass. This reflects the sovereignty of God over the nations and His control over historical events. The use of the sword as an appointed instrument of judgment can be seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/jeremiah/25-31.htm">Jeremiah 25:31</a>, where God declares His judgment against the nations. It underscores the theme of divine justice and the fulfillment of God's prophetic word.<p><b>Let them drag her away along with all her multitudes.</b><br>This part of the verse portrays the aftermath of the judgment, where the defeated are taken away. The imagery of being dragged away suggests humiliation and subjugation, common consequences for defeated nations in the ancient world. The mention of "her multitudes" indicates the vast number of people affected by this judgment, highlighting the comprehensive nature of God's decree against Egypt. This can be connected to the broader biblical narrative where entire nations face consequences for their actions, as seen in the fall of Babylon (Isaiah 47) and other empires. The dragging away of multitudes also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and separation described in eschatological passages, such as <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>, where nations are gathered and judged before Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
