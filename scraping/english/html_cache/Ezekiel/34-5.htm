In biblical context, shepherds often symbolize leaders or kings, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> and <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, where God and Jesus are depicted as shepherds. The scattering of the people reflects the consequences of poor leadership, as seen in the historical context of Israel's exile. The shepherds, or leaders, failed to care for the flock, leading to their dispersion. This imagery is also prophetic, pointing to the coming of Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd, who would gather and care for His people, as prophesied in <a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>.<p><b>and when they were scattered</b><br>The scattering of the people signifies the dispersion and exile of Israel due to their disobedience and the failure of their leaders. Historically, this refers to events like the Babylonian exile, where the Israelites were taken from their land. Theologically, scattering is often associated with judgment, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>. However, it also sets the stage for eventual restoration, as God promises to regather His people, a theme echoed in <a href="/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24</a> and fulfilled in the New Testament through the gathering of believers in Christ.<p><b>they became food for all the wild beasts</b><br>This phrase symbolizes vulnerability and danger faced by the Israelites in exile. In ancient Near Eastern culture, wild beasts often represented chaos and threat, as seen in <a href="/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3-7</a>. The lack of protection from a shepherd left the people exposed to external threats, both physical and spiritual. This imagery underscores the need for a true shepherd, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who protects His flock from spiritual predators, as described in <a href="/john/10-12.htm">John 10:12-13</a>. The phrase also serves as a warning against false leaders who fail to protect and nurture their people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherds.htm">Shepherds</a></b><br>Symbolic of leaders or rulers responsible for guiding and protecting the people of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were scattered due to the failure of their leaders.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wild_beasts.htm">Wild Beasts</a></b><br>Representing the dangers and adversaries that prey upon the unprotected and scattered people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context in which the Israelites were taken captive and scattered, highlighting their vulnerability.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_responsibility_of_leadership.htm">The Responsibility of Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders are accountable for the spiritual and physical well-being of those they lead.

The people of Israel had been dispersed&#8212;physically through exile and spiritually through wayward hearts.<p>&#8226; Similar moments appear in <a href="/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>, where the flock is scattered when the shepherd is struck, and in <a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>, where Jesus sees crowds &#8220;harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scattering speaks of isolation, loss of identity, and the breakdown of covenant community life. Each individual is left to fend for himself, far from the safety of the fold God intended.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for lack of a shepherd</b><p>The root problem is leadership failure. God declares earlier in the chapter that Israel&#8217;s &#8220;shepherds&#8221; were feeding themselves instead of the flock (<a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-4</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a> voices Moses&#8217; concern that Israel not be &#8220;like sheep without a shepherd.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_kings/22-17.htm">1 Kings 22:17</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-2</a> echo judgment on uncaring leaders, while <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-13</a> contrasts hirelings with the Good Shepherd who lays down His life.<p>Without godly guidance, people drift from truth, protection, and provision. This verse exposes not merely unfortunate circumstances, but leadership that abdicated its God-given responsibility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and when they were scattered</b><p>The repetition highlights consequence. Once scattering begins, it tends to deepen: distance fuels confusion, and confusion fuels further wandering.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a> warned that persistent disobedience would result in worldwide dispersion.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/34-6.htm">Ezekiel 34:6</a> shows the flock roaming &#8220;over all the face of the earth, with no one to search or seek for them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; parable of the lost sheep in <a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4</a> underscores the Shepherd&#8217;s heart to pursue every stray&#8212;something Israel&#8217;s human leaders had failed to do.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they became food for all the wild beasts</b><p>Vulnerable sheep attract predators. &#8220;Wild beasts&#8221; symbolize every oppressive power&#8212;foreign nations, idols, false teachers&#8212;that prey on God&#8217;s people.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/79-2.htm">Psalm 79:2</a> speaks of enemies feeding &#8220;the flesh of Your servants to the birds of the air.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29</a> warns that &#8220;savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a> describes the devil as a &#8220;roaring lion looking for someone to devour.&#8221;<p>When shepherds neglect their post, evil crouches at the door, and the scattered become easy prey.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5</a> reveals a tragic chain reaction: absent shepherds lead to scattered sheep; scattered sheep invite predators. God&#8217;s people suffered because their leaders failed to guard, guide, and gather. Yet the passage also sets the stage for hope: later in the chapter the Lord Himself promises, &#8220;I will search for My sheep and seek them out&#8221; (34:11). The Good Shepherd still steps in where human shepherds fall short, restoring the scattered and protecting them from every wild beast.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/34.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">They were scattered, because</span>. . . .--The calamities of the people are attributed to the fault of the rulers, not because the people themselves were free from sin--the contrary has already been abundantly asserted in this book--but because the people's sins were largely due to the evil example, the idolatries, the oppressions, and the disobedience of their rulers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they were scattered</span>.
