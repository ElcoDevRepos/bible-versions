In the context of Ezekiel, God is asserting His role as the ultimate judge and ruler. The use of "I, the LORD" is a reminder of the covenant name of God, Yahweh, which signifies His eternal presence and faithfulness. This declaration is consistent with other prophetic statements where God asserts His authority, such as in <a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/22-29.htm">Jeremiah 22:29</a>.<p><b>the time is coming, and I will act.</b><br>This indicates the imminence of God's judgment. The phrase "the time is coming" suggests a prophetic fulfillment that is near, reflecting the urgency of the message. Historically, this refers to the impending destruction of Jerusalem, which occurred in 586 BC. The certainty of God's action is a theme found throughout the prophets, as seen in <a href="/amos/8-2.htm">Amos 8:2</a> and <a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>, where God's timing is perfect and His actions are decisive.<p><b>I will not refrain or show pity, nor will I relent.</b><br>Here, God is expressing the inevitability and severity of His judgment. The lack of pity or relenting underscores the righteousness of God's justice. This is a response to the persistent sin and rebellion of the people, as detailed in <a href="/ezekiel/8.htm">Ezekiel 8-11</a>, where the abominations in the temple are described. The concept of God not relenting is also seen in <a href="/jeremiah/15-6.htm">Jeremiah 15:6</a>, highlighting the seriousness of Israel's sin.<p><b>I will judge you according to your ways and deeds,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes personal responsibility and accountability. The judgment is based on the actions and behaviors of the people, aligning with the principle found in <a href="/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30</a>, where individuals are called to repent and turn from their transgressions. This reflects the biblical theme of reaping what one sows, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>, and underscores the justice of God in dealing with sin.<p><b>&#8217; declares the Lord GOD.&#8221;</b><br>The closing declaration reaffirms the authority and finality of God's word. The use of "Lord GOD" (Adonai Yahweh) combines the titles of master and covenant-keeping God, emphasizing both His authority and His relationship with His people. This phrase is a common conclusion in prophetic literature, serving as a divine seal on the message, as seen in similar declarations in <a href="/ezekiel/5-17.htm">Ezekiel 5:17 and 17</a>:24.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is speaking with authority and finality.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God is delivering this message.

In Scripture, when the Lord prefaces a statement this way, His words carry unchallengeable authority (see <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reassures the faithful that what follows is certain, while warning the rebellious that refusal will not annul God&#8217;s decree (compare <a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The time is coming, and I will act</b><p>&#8226; God is not merely forecasting; He is announcing the nearness of execution. Ezekiel had earlier received a similar assurance: &#8220;The word that I speak will be fulfilled without delay&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/12-25.htm">Ezekiel 12:25</a>).<p>&#8226; This immediacy counters any complacency. Like <a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>, there may have been a perceived delay, but God&#8217;s timing is perfect and deliberate (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will not refrain or show pity</b><p>&#8226; Refrain implies holding back judgment; pity speaks of compassion. Both are now withdrawn because the people have consistently rejected repeated calls to repent (<a href="/ezekiel/5-11.htm">Ezekiel 5:11</a>; 8:18).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s mercy is vast (<a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8&#8211;10</a>), yet persistent hard-heartedness eventually leaves only justice (<a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nor will I relent</b><p>&#8226; Relent means to change course or mitigate punishment. The Lord underscores that there will be no last-minute reversal (<a href="/jeremiah/4-28.htm">Jeremiah 4:28</a>; <a href="/amos/7-8.htm">Amos 7:8</a>).<p>&#8226; This highlights His unwavering holiness: sin must be addressed, and divine integrity requires follow-through (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will judge you according to your ways and deeds</b><p>&#8226; Judgment is not arbitrary; it is perfectly aligned with personal conduct (<a href="/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30</a>; <a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently ties consequences to behavior&#8212;&#8220;whatever a man sows, he will reap&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p>&#8226; For Judah, idolatry, injustice, and bloodshed have stacked up an account now coming due (<a href="/2_kings/24-3.htm">2 Kings 24:3&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>declares the Lord GOD</b><p>&#8226; The closing signature reaffirms divine authorship and finality. Similar seals appear throughout Ezekiel (e.g., 17:24; 22:14), stressing that no higher court of appeal exists.<p>&#8226; By coupling &#8220;Lord&#8221; (Master) with &#8220;GOD&#8221; (Yahweh), the text blends sovereign authority with covenant faithfulness, reminding readers that even judgment flows from God&#8217;s righteous character (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/24-14.htm">Ezekiel 24:14</a> is a solemn proclamation that God&#8217;s long-promised judgment on unrepentant Judah is now irreversible. Every phrase stacks certainty upon certainty: God has spoken, the appointed moment has arrived, mercy has been exhausted, and judgment will be measured exactly to human conduct. The verse stands as both a warning to the rebellious and a reassurance to believers that the Lord&#8217;s words are true, His timing flawless, and His justice perfectly fair.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/24-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have spoken;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1433;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(dib&#183;bar&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the time] is coming,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and I will act.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
