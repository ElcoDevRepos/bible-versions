This mirrors the instructions given in <a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a> and <a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>, emphasizing the importance of offering the best to God. The lamb is a significant type of Christ, who is referred to as the "Lamb of God" in <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, symbolizing Jesus' sinless nature and His role as the ultimate sacrifice for sin.<p><b>as a daily burnt offering to the LORD</b><br>The "daily burnt offering" was a continual reminder of the people's need for atonement and dedication to God. Instituted in <a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>, the daily offering was a central part of Israel's worship, signifying ongoing devotion and the need for constant reconciliation with God. This practice foreshadows the perpetual intercession of Christ, as described in <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>, who continually mediates on behalf of believers.<p><b>you are to offer it every morning</b><br>The instruction to offer the sacrifice "every morning" underscores the importance of regular, disciplined worship and the need for daily renewal of one's relationship with God. This practice can be seen as a precursor to the Christian discipline of daily prayer and devotion, as encouraged in passages like <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, which speaks of God's mercies being new every morning.

The presentation of these sacrifices was not to be the special duty of the prince, but should devolve upon the community as a whole, who are now addressed as "thou" (vers. 13, 14) and "they" (ver. 15), and who should act in its fulfillment through their priests. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/46-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And you shall provide</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">an unblemished</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8549.htm">Strong's 8549: </a> </span><span class="str2">Entire, integrity, truth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">lamb</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1462;&#1448;&#1489;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;e&#183;&#7687;e&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
