The term "sister" indicates a relationship or comparison between Jerusalem and Sodom, suggesting that Jerusalem's sins were comparable to or even worse than those of Sodom. The scorn mentioned here highlights the attitude of the Israelites towards Sodom, viewing it with contempt and disdain. This reflects a common human tendency to judge others while ignoring one's own faults, a theme echoed in Jesus' teachings in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/matthew/7-3.htm">Matthew 7:3-5</a>.<p><b>in the day of your pride</b><br>The "day of your pride" refers to a period when Jerusalem was prosperous and self-sufficient, leading to arrogance and a false sense of security. This pride is condemned throughout scripture, as it often leads to a departure from reliance on God. <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a> warns that "pride goes before destruction," a principle that is evident in the downfall of both Sodom and Jerusalem. The pride of Jerusalem is seen as a root cause of its moral and spiritual decline, leading to behaviors that warranted judgment. This serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of pride and the importance of humility before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

The most tenable interpretation may be expressed by a paraphrase. The name of Sodom was not in the lips of Judah in the days of her prosperity. It was too vile for utterance, except as a byword of reproach. Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9, 10</a>) had in vain reminded her that she had made herself like them. Her fate could never be like theirs. Now, in the day of the discovery (the uncovering, or laying bare) of her wickedness (ver. 57), she had learnt the lesson. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/16-56.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Did you not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1444;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">treat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1497;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your sister</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1461;&#1428;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_269.htm">Strong's 269: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sister -- a sister</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Sodom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1456;&#1491;&#1465;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#333;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5467.htm">Strong's 5467: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sodom -- a Canaanite city near the Dead Sea</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as an object of scorn</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#353;&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#8216;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8052.htm">Strong's 8052: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something heard, an announcement</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of your pride,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1469;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(g&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#257;&#183;yi&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1347.htm">Strong's 1347: </a> </span><span class="str2">Arrogance, majesty, ornament</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/16-56.htm">Ezekiel 16:56 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/16-56.htm">Ezekiel 16:56 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/16-56.htm">Ezekiel 16:56 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/16-56.htm">Ezekiel 16:56 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/16-56.htm">Ezekiel 16:56 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/16-56.htm">Ezekiel 16:56  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/16-56.htm">Ezekiel 16:56 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/16-56.htm">Ezekiel 16:56 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/16-56.htm">Ezekiel 16:56 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/16-56.htm">Ezekiel 16:56 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/16-56.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 16:56 For your sister Sodom was not mentioned (Ezek.
