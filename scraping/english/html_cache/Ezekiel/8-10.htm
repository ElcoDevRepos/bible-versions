This phrase indicates his obedience and willingness to see the truth, no matter how disturbing. The act of going in and looking signifies a deeper understanding and revelation of the spiritual state of Israel. It reflects the role of a prophet as one who sees and communicates God's perspective to the people.<p><b>and engraved all around the wall</b><br>The presence of engravings on the temple walls suggests a deliberate and permanent defilement of a sacred space. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, walls were often used to depict important religious and cultural symbols. The fact that these engravings are in the temple, a place meant for the worship of Yahweh, highlights the severity of Israel's idolatry and spiritual corruption. This act of engraving indicates a deep-seated rebellion against God's commandments, particularly the prohibition against idolatry.<p><b>was every kind of crawling creature and detestable beast</b><br>The depiction of crawling creatures and detestable beasts is reminiscent of the unclean animals described in Levitical law (Leviticus 11). These images symbolize impurity and chaos, directly opposing the holiness and order that God desires. The presence of such creatures in the temple signifies the extent of Israel's apostasy, as they have embraced pagan practices and turned away from God's covenant. This imagery also echoes the idolatrous practices of surrounding nations, which Israel was warned against.<p><b>along with all the idols of the house of Israel</b><br>The mention of idols underscores the primary sin being addressed: idolatry. The house of Israel, chosen to be a holy nation, has instead adopted the worship of false gods, violating the first and second commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). This idolatry is not just a physical act but represents a spiritual adultery, as Israel has forsaken their covenant relationship with God. The presence of these idols in the temple, the very heart of Israel's worship, indicates a complete spiritual decay and a need for divine intervention and judgment. This scene foreshadows the coming destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, as prophesied by Ezekiel and other prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the central figure in this vision, tasked with conveying God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The vision takes place in the temple in Jerusalem, a sacred place that has been defiled by idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry.htm">Idolatry</a></b><br>The event described is a vision of the abominations committed by the Israelites, specifically the worship of idols within the temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/creeping_things_and_detestable_beasts.htm">Creeping Things and Detestable Beasts</a></b><br>These represent the various idols and false gods that the Israelites were worshiping, contrary to God's commandments.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_israel.htm">The House of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Israel, who have turned away from God and engaged in idolatrous practices.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is a serious sin that leads to spiritual decay.

His readiness shows the heart of a servant and underscores that God alone directs prophetic vision.<p>- The phrase &#8220;I went in&#8221; reminds us that God often leads His people into hidden places so that sin can be exposed. Nothing is concealed from the One &#8220;to whom we must give account&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>- &#8220;Looked&#8221; stresses careful, deliberate observation. Ezekiel is not glancing; he is taking in the full weight of what God reveals, much like Jeremiah was told to &#8220;see&#8221; the almond branch (<a href="/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11-12</a>) or John was invited to &#8220;come up here and I will show you&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>).<p>- The scene occurs inside the sanctuary, highlighting how sin can lurk beneath an apparently religious exterior. <a href="/psalms/139-11.htm">Psalm 139:11-12</a> affirms that even darkness is as light to God; therefore, hidden corruption cannot remain hidden for long.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>engraved all around the wall was every kind of crawling creature and detestable beast</b><p>- The walls that once should have proclaimed God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>, where Solomon carved cherubim and palm trees) are now covered with images of &#8220;crawling creature and detestable beast.&#8221; <a href="/leviticus/11-41.htm">Leviticus 11:41-44</a> calls such creatures unclean, so their presence in sacred space is a direct violation of God&#8217;s holiness code.<p>- Engraving signals permanence; the leaders did not dabble in idolatry but chiseled it into the very fabric of the temple. <a href="/romans/1-23.htm">Romans 1:23</a> describes this downward exchange: &#8220;They traded the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.&#8221;<p>- The pairing of &#8220;crawling creature&#8221; with &#8220;detestable beast&#8221; echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/4-16.htm">Deuteronomy 4:16-18</a>, which warns against fashioning likenesses of any creature that moves on the ground. Israel ignored this clear command.<p>- By filling the walls with unclean images, the people effectively replaced the Lord&#8217;s throne with the symbolism of Egypt and Canaan (see <a href="/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a> for similar imported cultic imagery). The entire atmosphere shifted from holy to defiled.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with all the idols of the house of Israel</b><p>- The phrase &#8220;all the idols&#8221; shows the breadth of apostasy. This was not one idol tucked in a corner; it was a collection representing the whole &#8220;house of Israel.&#8221; <a href="/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3</a> later calls them &#8220;idols in their hearts,&#8221; linking external images to internal rebellion.<p>- These idols stand in defiant contrast to the second commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4-5</a>). The very nation chosen to showcase God&#8217;s uniqueness filled His temple with substitutes, much like Judah had earlier &#8220;set up their abominations in the house that is called by My name&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/7-30.htm">Jeremiah 7:30</a>).<p>- Idolatry in the sanctuary signals spiritual adultery. <a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12-13</a> speaks of Israel seeking counsel from wooden idols and sacrificing under sacred oaks. Ezekiel&#8217;s vision confirms that such unfaithfulness had now penetrated the temple&#8217;s innermost chambers.<p>- Because leadership was involved (<a href="/ezekiel/8-11.htm">Ezekiel 8:11</a> lists seventy elders), the entire community faced judgment. <a href="/2_kings/17-16.htm">2 Kings 17:16-18</a> shows that when the nation abandoned God for idols, &#8220;the Lord was very angry&#8230;and removed them from His presence.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/8-10.htm">Ezekiel 8:10</a> paints a sobering picture: the prophet obediently enters a hidden chamber and sees walls etched with unclean animals and idols, a vivid snapshot of Israel&#8217;s covert yet systemic idolatry. What should have been a sanctuary of divine glory had become a gallery of detestable images, revealing hearts that had turned from the Creator to created things. The passage exposes sin, underscores God&#8217;s omniscience, and warns that when His people engrave idolatry into their lives, judgment is inevitable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts.</span>--The description of the idolatrous rites here practised clearly indicates their Egyptian origin. Creature worship was indeed practised among other nations, and the painting of idolatrous objects upon walls is expressly mentioned in <a href="/context/ezekiel/23-14.htm" title="And that she increased her prostitutions: for when she saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,">Ezekiel 23:14-16</a>, as introduced by the Jews from Chaldaea; yet the combination is so thoroughly Egyptian, and the political relations of the time also point so strongly in the same direction, that the origin seems settled. It was during this period that Jeremiah was obliged to contend strenuously against the desire of a considerable part of the court to enter into an alliance with Egypt against Chaldaea. The party among the Jews who sought an Egyptian alliance, as abundantly appears from Jeremiah, was also the party most unwilling to submit to the Divine commandments. They were the persons who engaged in this creature-worship; and they are here represented as constituting the leaders of the nation. As if this were not enough, "all the idols of the house of Israel," gathered from every quarter, were also portrayed upon the walls.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every form of creeping things.</span> The words obviously paint the theriomorphic worship of Egypt, the scarabseus probably being prominent. The alliance between Jehoiakim and Pharaoh (<a href="/2_kings/24.htm">2 Kings 24</a>:33-35), and which Zedekiah was endeavouring to renew, would naturally bring about a revival of that cultus.
