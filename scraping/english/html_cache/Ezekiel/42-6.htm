This tripartite structure may symbolize completeness or divine order, as the number three often holds significance in biblical numerology. The three stories could also represent different levels of holiness or function within the temple precincts, similar to the divisions seen in the Tabernacle and Solomon's Temple.<p><b>and unlike the courts, they had no pillars</b><br>The absence of pillars in these chambers contrasts with other parts of the temple, such as the courts, which often featured pillars as structural and symbolic elements. Pillars in biblical architecture can symbolize strength and stability, as seen in the pillars of Jachin and Boaz in Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/7-21.htm">1 Kings 7:21</a>). The lack of pillars here might indicate a different purpose or function for these chambers, possibly related to storage or priestly activities rather than public worship.<p><b>So the upper chambers were set back further than the lower and middle floors</b><br>The setback design of the upper chambers suggests a tiered structure, which could have practical purposes such as allowing light and air to reach each level. This architectural feature might also symbolize a progression towards greater sanctity or separation from the profane, as one moves upward. The concept of ascending to higher levels can be seen in other biblical contexts, such as the ascent to the mountain of the Lord (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a>) or the spiritual ascent in the Christian life (<a href="/philippians/3-14.htm">Philippians 3:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.

This repetition signals continuity: God&#8217;s holiness and provision for priestly ministry remain constant from the first temple to Ezekiel&#8217;s future temple.<p>&#8226; Practically, multiple stories maximize sacred space without expanding the footprint&#8212;an efficient, divinely sanctioned design (<a href="/ezekiel/41-6.htm">Ezekiel 41:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>No pillars like the courts</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and unlike the courts, they had no pillars.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Outer courts in ancient temples often featured colonnades (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>; <a href="/john/10-23.htm">John 10:23</a>). By contrast, these chambers rely on the surrounding walls for support.<p>&#8226; The absence of pillars highlights separation: the courts accommodate crowds and public worship, but these inner rooms are reserved for priests and holy articles (<a href="/ezekiel/42-13.htm">Ezekiel 42:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; It also points to God&#8217;s sufficiency. The chambers stand firm without visible columns, a subtle reminder that the Lord Himself upholds His house (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Upper chambers set back</b><p>&#8220;So the upper chambers were set back further than the lower and middle floors.&#8221;<p>&#8226; As the stories rise, each floor recedes, creating wider lower rooms and narrower upper rooms&#8212;just as in Solomon&#8217;s temple where &#8220;the structure narrowed as it ascended&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/6-6.htm">1 Kings 6:6</a>).<p>&#8226; This stepped design provides stable support: each higher level rests partly on the wall of the level below, offsetting weight without external pillars (<a href="/ezekiel/41-7.htm">Ezekiel 41:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the upward progression that grows increasingly restricted pictures ascending holiness&#8212;the closer one moves toward God&#8217;s glory, the narrower the way (<a href="/matthew/7-14.htm">Matthew 7:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/42-6.htm">Ezekiel 42:6</a> gives a literal snapshot of future temple side-chambers: three stacked levels, no supporting pillars, and tiered setbacks.

These could not have been the ornamental pillars at the entrance of the various porches, for the connection implies that they supported something. It is quite likely, therefore, that there were cloisters around the inside of the wall of the courts (on the pavement), as in the later Temple.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6</span> supplies the reason for this shortening of the upper stories.
