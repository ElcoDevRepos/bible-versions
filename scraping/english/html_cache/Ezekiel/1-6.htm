The four faces&#8212;of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle&#8212;are often interpreted as representing the fullness of creation and the attributes of God. The face of a man symbolizes intelligence and reason, the lion represents majesty and strength, the ox signifies service and power, and the eagle denotes swiftness and vision. These creatures are similar to the cherubim described in <a href="/ezekiel/10.htm">Ezekiel 10</a> and the living creatures in <a href="/revelation/4-7.htm">Revelation 4:7</a>, suggesting a continuity in the depiction of heavenly beings. The number four is significant in biblical numerology, often representing universality or completeness, as seen in the four corners of the earth or the four winds.<p><b>and four wings</b><br>The four wings of each creature indicate their readiness and ability to move swiftly in any direction, symbolizing the omnipresence and omnipotence of God. Wings in biblical literature often denote divine protection and the ability to transcend earthly limitations. In <a href="/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4</a>, God describes carrying the Israelites on "eagles' wings," emphasizing deliverance and care. The wings also suggest a connection to the seraphim in <a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>, who use their wings to cover their faces and feet, indicating reverence and humility before God. The presence of wings underscores the heavenly origin and nature of these creatures, setting them apart from earthly beings and highlighting their role as attendants to the divine throne.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.
