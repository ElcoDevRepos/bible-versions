The phrase underscores the authority and divine origin of the message. In the context of Ezekiel, it emphasizes that the prophet is not speaking on his own behalf but is conveying a message directly from God. This is consistent with other prophetic introductions found in books like Jeremiah and Isaiah, where the prophets serve as intermediaries between God and His people. The phrase also highlights the personal relationship between God and His prophets, as seen in the calling of other prophets such as Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) and Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>). The use of "the word of the LORD" signifies the importance and seriousness of the message, as it is not merely human wisdom but divine instruction.

Just as Ezekiel had already received prior oracles (<a href="/ezekiel/22-1.htm">Ezekiel 22:1</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-45.htm">Ezekiel 20:45</a>), this &#8220;And&#8221; reminds us God&#8217;s dealings with His people are continuous.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently chains God&#8217;s messages together; see how <a href="/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a> or <a href="/jeremiah/1-3.htm">Jeremiah 1:3</a> likewise connect prophetic words over time.<p>&#8226; The continuity assures us that the Lord&#8217;s judgment announced here is not isolated&#8212;it builds on all He has previously revealed about holiness, sin, and repentance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the word of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The word&#8221; stresses that what follows is divine speech, not human opinion. This echoes <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>, where all Scripture is breathed out by God, and <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>, which underlines God&#8217;s truthfulness.<p>&#8226; &#8220;of the LORD&#8221; grounds the authority: Yahweh Himself&#8212;the covenant-keeping God&#8212;speaks. In <a href="/1_samuel/3-21.htm">1 Samuel 3:21</a> the Lord &#8220;revealed Himself&#8230; by the word of the LORD,&#8221; showing that His word is the primary medium of revelation.<p>&#8226; Here in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/22.htm">Ezekiel 22</a>, that word will expose national corruption (vv. 24-31) and pronounce judgment (cf. <a href="/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1</a>). The authority belongs wholly to God, so the coming rebuke carries eternal weight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>came to me</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s word &#8220;came&#8221; to Ezekiel, highlighting divine initiative. Ezekiel did not seek out the message; it pursued him. Similar language appears in <a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4</a> and <a href="/jonah/1-1.htm">Jonah 1:1</a>, underscoring prophetic calling.<p>&#8226; &#8220;to me&#8221; underscores personal responsibility. The prophet must receive, internalize (<a href="/ezekiel/3-10.htm">Ezekiel 3:10</a>), and proclaim it faithfully (<a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, while we are not writing Scripture, the principle stands: God&#8217;s word still seeks us out (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>) and calls us to stewardship (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying</b><p>&#8226; The participle points forward to specific content. God is not silent; He speaks clearly (<a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3-9</a>).<p>&#8226; What follows (<a href="/ezekiel/22-24.htm">Ezekiel 22:24-31</a>) is a detailed indictment of Israel&#8217;s leaders&#8212;prophets, priests, princes, and people&#8212;mirroring the layered guilt seen in <a href="/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a> and <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Saying&#8221; also implies accountability: when God speaks, listeners must respond (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>). In Ezekiel&#8217;s day, the response was largely rejection, leading to exile (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-17</a>). For us, <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a> calls for doers of the word, not hearers only.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/22-23.htm">Ezekiel 22:23</a> may appear to be a simple narrative segue, yet each phrase carries rich truth. The &#8220;And&#8221; ties God&#8217;s fresh word to His unbroken conversation with His people. &#8220;The word of the LORD&#8221; declares absolute authority. &#8220;Came to me&#8221; shows divine initiative and personal stewardship, while &#8220;saying&#8221; anticipates a clear, actionable message. Taken together, the verse reminds us that God still speaks, His word remains binding, and every recipient&#8212;ancient prophet or modern disciple&#8212;must listen and obey.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23, 24.</span> - A fresh section opens, and the prophet addresses himself, not to Jerusalem only, but to the whole land. <span class="cmt_word">A land that is not cleansed</span>.
