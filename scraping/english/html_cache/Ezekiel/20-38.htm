The context is God's promise to separate the faithful from the unfaithful among the Israelites. Historically, this reflects the period of the Babylonian exile, where God used foreign nations to discipline Israel. Theologically, it underscores God's holiness and intolerance of sin, reminiscent of the purging of the rebels during the wilderness wanderings (Numbers 14). This act of purging can also be seen as a type of Christ's work, who purifies His church, separating the wheat from the chaff (<a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>).<p><b>I will bring them out of the land in which they dwell,</b><br>This refers to God's sovereign control over the nations and His ability to uproot His people from their places of comfort or rebellion. Historically, this can be linked to the Babylonian captivity, where Israelites were taken from their homeland. It also echoes the Exodus narrative, where God brought the Israelites out of Egypt. This movement signifies God's ongoing plan to fulfill His promises, even through judgment.<p><b>but they will not enter the land of Israel.</b><br>This phrase highlights the consequence of rebellion and disobedience. The land of Israel represents God's promise and blessing, akin to the Promised Land in the Exodus story. The denial of entry serves as a warning and a fulfillment of God's justice, similar to how the generation that left Egypt was not allowed to enter Canaan (<a href="/numbers/14-30.htm">Numbers 14:30</a>). It emphasizes the seriousness of covenant faithfulness and the reality of divine judgment.<p><b>Then you will know that I am the LORD.</b><br>This concluding phrase is a common refrain in Ezekiel, emphasizing the purpose of God's actions: to reveal His identity and sovereignty. It serves as a reminder of God's ultimate authority and the importance of recognizing His lordship. This revelation is both a warning and an invitation to repentance and faith. It connects to the broader biblical theme of God's desire for His people to know Him, as seen in the covenantal relationship throughout Scripture (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, who are in exile due to their rebellion against God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, serving as a backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_israel.htm">The Land of Israel</a></b><br>The promised land, symbolizing God's covenant and blessings, which the rebellious will not enter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who judges and purges His people to maintain holiness and fulfill His covenant.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_holiness_and_justice.htm">God's Holiness and Justice</a></b><br>God is holy and cannot tolerate rebellion.

A striking instance of the way in which the Divine purposes are fulfilled through the operations of ordinary laws, occurred on the return of the Jews from their exile. After a residence of more than two generations in Babylonia, they had made themselves homes there, and had become prosperous and contented. Jerusalem and Judaea were utterly desolated and environed with their persistent enemies. The journey thither was long, attended with hardships and danger, and at its close lay the toilsome and self-sacrificing work of pioneers. When therefore, the permission was given for the return, only those who were most earnest in their zeal for the home and religion of their fathers were ready to avail themselves of the opportunity. A great sifting of the people thus took place from the very circumstances of the case, and only a comparatively small portion constituting the better part, returned to rebuild Jerusalem and the Temple.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - The thought of the shepherd suggests, as in <a href="/matthew/25-33.htm">Matthew 25:33</a>, the separation of the sheep from the goats. The land of the restored Israel was to be a land of righteousness, and the rebels were not to enter into it. Was Ezekiel thinking of those who were thus to die in the "wilderness of the peoples" as a counterpart of those who perished in the forty years of the wandering, and did not enter Canaan? Ver. 36 seems to imply that he was looking for a repetition of that history. The solemn fast kept by Ezra by the river of Ahava (<a href="/ezra/8-21.htm">Ezra 8:21-22</a>) may be noted as corresponding, on a small scale, to Ezekiel's expectations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/20-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And I will purge you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;r&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
