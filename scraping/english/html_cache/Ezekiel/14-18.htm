The expression "as surely as I live" is an oath formula, underscoring the seriousness of the message. It reflects God's eternal nature and His ultimate authority over life and death. This is a common expression in prophetic literature, highlighting the unchanging and sovereign nature of God (see <a href="/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>, <a href="/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>).<p><b>even if these three men were in it,</b><br>The "three men" refer to Noah, Daniel, and Job, who are mentioned earlier in the chapter (<a href="/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14</a>). These individuals are exemplars of righteousness and faithfulness in the Hebrew Scriptures. Noah is known for his obedience and faith during the flood (Genesis 6-9), Daniel for his unwavering faith in exile (Daniel 1-6), and Job for his perseverance through suffering (Job 1-42). Their mention signifies the extreme measure of righteousness required to avert judgment.<p><b>they could not deliver their own sons or daughters.</b><br>This highlights the principle of individual responsibility before God. In the context of Ezekiel, it underscores the severity of the judgment coming upon Jerusalem and Judah. The righteousness of even the most faithful individuals cannot save others; each person is accountable for their own relationship with God (see <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>). This also reflects the cultural understanding of family and communal identity, where the actions of one often affected the whole.<p><b>They alone would be delivered.</b><br>This emphasizes personal accountability and the limits of intercessory righteousness. The deliverance of these righteous men alone signifies that salvation is a personal matter, not transferable to others, even family members. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where salvation is through personal faith in Jesus Christ (<a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9-10</a>). The idea of individual deliverance also points to the ultimate deliverance found in Christ, who is the fulfillment of righteousness for all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and righteous God who speaks through Ezekiel, emphasizing His authority and the certainty of His declarations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_three_men.htm">The Three Men</a></b><br>Refers to Noah, Daniel, and Job, who are mentioned earlier in the chapter as paragons of righteousness.

God is saying, &#8220;When My just discipline falls in any of these ways, these are the terms under which it will unfold.&#8221; Much like the conditional statements of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15&#8211;68</a> and the specific calamities of <a href="/leviticus/26-21.htm">Leviticus 26:21&#8211;26</a>, the timing here is God&#8217;s righteous response to entrenched sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD</b><p>God stakes His own life on the certainty of what follows. This oath formula appears elsewhere (<a href="/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>) and underscores His unchanging character (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>). Because the Lord alone is eternal (<a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>) and cannot lie (<a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>), His sworn word is an ironclad guarantee that the announced judgment will not be revoked apart from genuine repentance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>even if these three men were in it</b><p>The three men&#8212;Noah, Daniel, and Job&#8212;are singled out in verse 14 as paragons of righteousness. Each was known for steadfast faith under pressure (<a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>; <a href="/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22</a>; <a href="/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>). The sentence stresses that not even their presence could alter God&#8217;s decree upon a persistently rebellious nation, echoing Abraham&#8217;s negotiation for Sodom in <a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22&#8211;33</a> yet showing that Judah had sunk beneath even Sodom&#8217;s threshold (<a href="/ezekiel/16-48.htm">Ezekiel 16:48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they could not deliver their own sons or daughters</b><p>Personal righteousness cannot be transferred, even to one&#8217;s closest kin. This dovetails with <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>, where &#8220;the righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him alone.&#8221; Similar individual accountability surfaces in <a href="/jeremiah/15-1.htm">Jeremiah 15:1</a>, where Moses and Samuel could not sway God&#8217;s resolve toward rebellious Judah. Salvation and deliverance remain an individual matter (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They alone would be delivered</b><p>Each man&#8217;s rescue would be limited to himself. God honors genuine faith wherever it is found (<a href="/2_peter/2-5.htm">2 Peter 2:5</a> regarding Noah; <a href="/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a> regarding Job; <a href="/daniel/12-13.htm">Daniel 12:13</a> for Daniel), but He does not override others&#8217; unbelief. The principle anticipates New Testament teaching that &#8220;each will receive his own reward according to his own labor&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-8.htm">1 Corinthians 3:8</a>) and confirms that familial or national identity cannot substitute for personal trust and obedience (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/14-18.htm">Ezekiel 14:18</a> underscores the unbreakable link between individual faithfulness and individual deliverance. Even the exemplary righteousness of Noah, Daniel, and Job cannot shield unrepentant family members or a sin-saturated nation from God&#8217;s just judgments. The verse affirms God&#8217;s absolute reliability (&#8220;as surely as I live&#8221;) and the principle that every person stands accountable to Him, inviting each hearer to embrace personal repentance and obedience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/14-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">then as surely</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1431;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as I live,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;ay-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2416.htm">Strong's 2416: </a> </span><span class="str2">Alive, raw, fresh, strong, life</span><br /><br /><span class="word">declares</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#8217;um)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5002.htm">Strong's 5002: </a> </span><span class="str2">An oracle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_136.htm">Strong's 136: </a> </span><span class="str2">The Lord</span><br /><br /><span class="word">GOD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1460;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3069.htm">Strong's 3069: </a> </span><span class="str2">YHWH</span><br /><br /><span class="word">even if these</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
