Measuring is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, symbolizing divine assessment and the establishment of boundaries (see <a href="/zechariah/2.htm">Zechariah 2:1-2</a>, <a href="/revelation/11.htm">Revelation 11:1</a>). It underscores the importance of God's meticulous design for His temple, reflecting His holiness and the need for purity in worship.<p><b>from the front of the lower gateway</b><br>The lower gateway likely refers to the entrance of the outer court of the temple. In ancient Near Eastern architecture, gateways were significant as they controlled access and symbolized transition from the secular to the sacred. This gateway's position emphasizes the structured approach to worship and the progression towards God's presence.<p><b>to the outside of the inner court</b><br>The inner court represents a more sacred area within the temple complex, reserved for priests and specific sacrificial activities. This separation highlights the holiness of God and the need for consecration when approaching Him. The inner court's exclusivity points to the need for mediation, fulfilled in the New Testament by Jesus Christ as our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>it was a hundred cubits</b><br>A cubit is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches or 45 centimeters. The specific measurement of a hundred cubits indicates the grandeur and significance of the temple structure. This precise dimension reflects God's intentional design and the importance of adhering to His specifications, as seen in the construction of the Tabernacle (Exodus 25-27).<p><b>on the east side as well as on the north</b><br>The mention of both the east and north sides suggests symmetry and balance in the temple's design. The east side holds particular significance in biblical texts, often associated with the direction of God's glory (<a href="/ezekiel/43.htm">Ezekiel 43:1-4</a>) and the return of Christ (<a href="/matthew/24-27.htm">Matthew 24:27</a>).
