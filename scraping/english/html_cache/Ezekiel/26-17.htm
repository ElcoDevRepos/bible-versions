Lamentations are often used in the Bible to express grief over the fall of cities or nations, as seen in the Book of Lamentations regarding Jerusalem. The lament here is directed towards Tyre, a significant city in ancient times. The use of lamentation signifies the gravity of Tyre's downfall and the impact it had on surrounding nations.<p><b>&#8220;How you have perished,</b><br>The word "perished" indicates total destruction. Tyre's fall was prophesied by Ezekiel and fulfilled through historical events, notably the sieges by Nebuchadnezzar and later by Alexander the Great. This phrase underscores the completeness of Tyre's destruction, which was once thought improbable due to its strong defenses and strategic location.<p><b>O city of renown</b><br>Tyre was famous for its wealth, trade, and influence. It was a major Phoenician city known for its production of purple dye and maritime prowess. The city's renown is highlighted here to emphasize the shock and significance of its downfall. Tyre's reputation is also mentioned in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/23.htm">Isaiah 23</a>, which speaks of its pride and eventual judgment.<p><b>inhabited by seafaring men&#8212;</b><br>The inhabitants of Tyre were known for their skills in navigation and trade across the Mediterranean. This phrase highlights the city's identity as a maritime power. The Phoenicians, of whom the Tyrians were a part, were renowned for their shipbuilding and exploration, which contributed to their economic strength and cultural influence.<p><b>she who was powerful on the sea,</b><br>Tyre's power was largely derived from its control of sea trade routes. The city's strategic location on the coast allowed it to dominate maritime commerce. This phrase reflects Tyre's economic and military strength, which was largely based on its naval capabilities. The sea was both a source of wealth and a means of defense for Tyre.<p><b>along with her people,</b><br>The people of Tyre were integral to its success and reputation. This phrase acknowledges the collective identity and efforts of Tyre's inhabitants in building and maintaining the city's power. The mention of the people also serves to humanize the lament, as it is not just the city but its citizens who suffer the consequences of its fall.<p><b>who imposed terror on all peoples!</b><br>Tyre's influence and power were such that it could impose its will on other nations, often through economic dominance or military might. This phrase suggests that Tyre was feared by other nations, which adds to the irony and poignancy of its downfall. The city's ability to impose terror is contrasted with its ultimate destruction, serving as a reminder of the transient nature of earthly power. This theme is echoed in other biblical prophecies, such as those against Babylon and Egypt, where once-mighty powers are brought low.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

God allows them to feel the shock of sudden loss so the world sees His hand of judgment (<a href="/ezekiel/27-29.htm">Ezekiel 27:29-32</a>). Similar scenes echo in <a href="/revelation/18-9.htm">Revelation 18:9-11</a>, where kings and traders mourn over fallen Babylon. The pattern reminds us: earthly power may dazzle, but when the Lord speaks, even unbelievers are forced to acknowledge His verdict.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Saying</b><p>The lament is more than raw emotion; it is a public proclamation. Just as Jeremiah gathered professional mourners to voice Israel&#8217;s sorrow (<a href="/jeremiah/9-17.htm">Jeremiah 9:17-19</a>), God orchestrates this chorus so the truth about Tyre&#8217;s pride and downfall is broadcast.

Once the maritime marketplace of the Mediterranean, now a heap of stones (<a href="/ezekiel/26-4.htm">Ezekiel 26:4</a>).

Their collective downfall illustrates <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>: &#8220;the wages of sin is death,&#8221; both individual and societal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who imposed terror on all peoples!</b><p>Tyre intimidated competitors through economic leverage and military presence, spreading fear instead of blessing. God&#8217;s covenant people were always meant to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>), but Tyre chose domination. As <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a> warns, &#8220;God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.&#8221; Tyre sowed terror, and terror returned upon her own head.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/26-17.htm">Ezekiel 26:17</a> captures the stunned funeral song of the nations as Tyre&#8212;once proud, renowned, and feared&#8212;collapses under God&#8217;s righteous judgment. Each phrase exposes the fragility of human glory and the certainty of divine justice. Wealth, reputation, skill, and power cannot shield a society that exalts itself against the Lord. The lament of Tyre stands as a sober reminder: only humble obedience secures lasting security, while pride guarantees eventual, unmistakable ruin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Inhabited of seafaring men.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">in-habited from the sea. </span>The word, which is very common, never bears the sense of men. The thought is that the rock of Tyre, built up with dwellings to the water's edge was like a city rising from the sea.<p><span class= "bld">Which cause their terror.</span>--This clause has occasioned much difficulty. The literal translation is, <span class= "ital">she and her inhabitants, which gave their fear to all her inhabitants. </span>"Fear" is here used in the sense of that which causes fear; and the meaning is, that the power of Tyre was so feared that every Tyrian was respected for her sake, just as at a later day every Roman bore about with him something of the majesty of Rome, or, as now, the citizen of a great Power is respected among foreigners for his country's sake. (Comp. <a href="/ezekiel/32-24.htm" title="There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.">Ezekiel 32:24</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/32-26.htm" title="There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living.">Ezekiel 32:26</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Inhabited of seafaring</span>, etc.; Hebrew, from <span class="accented">the seas</span>. The sense is the same, but we lose the poetry of the original in the paraphrase. Possibly, however, the phrase may represent the position of Tyro as rising out of the sea or as deriving its wealth from it. Ewald adopts a conjectural reading, which gives "destroyed from the seas;" or, with another conjecture, "She that was settled from the days of the remote past." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/26-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then they will lament</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1488;&#1448;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#347;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
