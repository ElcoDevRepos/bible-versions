It underscores the distinction between God and man, highlighting Ezekiel's position as a mediator. This title is also significant in the New Testament, where Jesus frequently refers to Himself as the "Son of Man," indicating His role as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity.<p><b>they will tie with ropes</b><br>This phrase indicates a literal or symbolic restraint placed upon Ezekiel by the people. It reflects the opposition and resistance he would face in his prophetic ministry. The use of ropes suggests a forced limitation on his freedom, symbolizing the spiritual bondage of the people who refuse to heed God's message. This act of binding can be seen as a foreshadowing of the rejection and suffering that Jesus Christ would endure, as He was also bound and led away by those who opposed Him.<p><b>and you will be bound</b><br>The binding of Ezekiel serves as a powerful symbol of the people's rejection of God's word. It illustrates the spiritual blindness and stubbornness of Israel, who are unwilling to listen to the prophet's warnings. This act of being bound can also be seen as a type of Christ, who was bound during His trial and crucifixion, representing the ultimate rejection by His own people.<p><b>so that you cannot go out among the people</b><br>Ezekiel's inability to go out among the people signifies the separation between the prophet and the rebellious nation. It highlights the consequences of Israel's disobedience, as they are deprived of the guidance and presence of God's messenger. This separation can be paralleled with the spiritual separation that sin causes between humanity and God, a gap that is ultimately bridged by Jesus Christ through His sacrificial death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

God forewarns him of literal restraints from his own community&#8212;exiles who resent his message (<a href="/ezekiel/2-6.htm">Ezekiel 2:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Physical binding echoes earlier prophetic experiences: Jeremiah was put in stocks (<a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>), and Paul was foretold to be bound in Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/21-11.htm">Acts 21:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Such hostility fulfils Jesus&#8217; promise that His servants will be persecuted (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>), yet persecution never thwarts God&#8217;s purposes (<a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you will be bound</b><p>&#8226; The wording shows God&#8217;s sovereignty: although &#8220;they&#8221; do the tying, God predicts it and uses it. Nothing happens outside His plan (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Being bound becomes a sign-act; Ezekiel&#8217;s constraint mirrors Judah&#8217;s impending captivity (<a href="/ezekiel/4-8.htm">Ezekiel 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Personal limitation often precedes greater prophetic clarity. Paul wrote epistles from prison; Ezekiel will receive visions while confined (<a href="/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that you cannot go out among the people</b><p>&#8226; Isolation underscores the seriousness of Judah&#8217;s spiritual deafness. If they refuse to heed, the prophet&#8217;s silence dramatizes the coming silence of God&#8217;s mercy (<a href="/amos/8-11.htm">Amos 8:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The restriction protects Ezekiel from fruitless debate; his role is to speak only when God opens his mouth (<a href="/ezekiel/3-26.htm">Ezekiel 3:26-27, 33</a>:22).<p>&#8226; Separation also preserves holiness. Like Moses outside the camp (<a href="/exodus/33-7.htm">Exodus 33:7</a>) and Jesus withdrawing to lonely places (<a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>), Ezekiel&#8217;s distance keeps him focused on divine, not public, opinion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/3-25.htm">Ezekiel 3:25</a> forecasts literal ropes and real confinement, yet every detail serves God&#8217;s larger message. The prophet&#8217;s personal calling, the hostility he faces, the sovereign use of his suffering, and the enforced isolation all weave together to illustrate Judah&#8217;s own captivity and God&#8217;s unwavering control. Far from silencing God&#8217;s word, the ropes amplify it, proving that no human restraint can bind the purposes of the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">They shall put bands upon thee.</span>--Ezekiel's contemporary prophet, Jeremiah, was actually thrown into prison in Judaea, and even into a foul dungeon (<a href="/jeremiah/37-21.htm" title="Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.">Jeremiah 37:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm" title="Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.">Jeremiah 38:6</a>); but nothing of this kind is to be understood here. There is no trace of such treatment throughout the book, nor is it likely that it would have been suffered by Nebuchadnezzar among his captives, or possible under the administration of Daniel. Besides, a similar laying of bands upon him (although for a different purpose) is mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/4-8.htm" title="And, behold, I will lay bands on you, and you shall not turn you from one side to another, till you have ended the days of your siege.">Ezekiel 4:8</a>, which must necessarily be understood figuratively. The compulsion described in this and the following verse was a moral one. Ezekiel's countrymen, especially during the period of his warnings until the destruction of Jerusalem, should so absolutely refuse to hear him, that it would become practically impossible for him to declare his prophecies; he would be as if he were bound.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall put bands</span> <span class="cmt_word">upon thee,</span> etc. Did the warning mean that the prophet's hearers would treat him as the men of Jerusalem treated Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/32-3.htm">Jeremiah 32:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-1.htm">Jeremiah 33:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>)? Of this, at all events, we have no record, and so far we are led to the other alternative of taking the words (as in <a href="/ezekiel/4-8.htm">Ezekiel 4:8</a>) in a figurative sense. The prophet would feel, as he stood in the presence of the rebellious house, as tongue tied, bound hand and foot by their hardness of heart, teaching by strange and startling signs only, and, it may be, writing his prophecies. In <a href="/ezekiel/24-27.htm">Ezekiel 24:27</a>, four years later, and again in <a href="/ezekiel/29-21.htm">Ezekiel 29:21</a>, we have a distinct reference to a long period of such protracted silence. We may compare, as in some sense parallel, the silence of Zacharias (<a href="/luke/1-22.htm">Luke 1:22</a>). That silence unbroken for nine months was a sign to those who "were looking for redemption in Jerusalem," more eloquent than speech. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/3-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
