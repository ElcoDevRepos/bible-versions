Zedekiah's rebellion against Babylon was a significant event, as it marked a breach of the oath he had sworn in God's name (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>). This rebellion is a pivotal moment in Judah's history, leading to the Babylonian siege and eventual destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. The act of rebellion against Babylon, a dominant empire of the time, highlights the political tensions and the struggle for autonomy faced by smaller states like Judah.<p><b>by sending his envoys to Egypt</b><br>Zedekiah's decision to send envoys to Egypt reflects a common political strategy of seeking alliances with other powerful nations. Egypt, a traditional rival of Babylon, was seen as a potential ally that could provide military support. This action is reminiscent of earlier periods in Israel's history when reliance on foreign powers, rather than on God, led to negative consequences (<a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-2</a>). The geopolitical landscape of the ancient Near East was complex, with Egypt and Babylon often vying for control over the region, including Judah.<p><b>to ask for horses and a large army</b><br>Horses and chariots were symbols of military strength and power in the ancient world. By seeking these from Egypt, Zedekiah was attempting to bolster his military capabilities against Babylon. This reliance on military might contrasts with the biblical theme of trusting in God for deliverance (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>). The request for a large army underscores the desperation and precariousness of Judah's situation, as they faced the might of Babylon.<p><b>Will he flourish?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the wisdom of Zedekiah's actions. The implied answer is negative, suggesting that rebellion against Babylon and reliance on Egypt will not lead to prosperity or success. This aligns with the prophetic warnings given by Jeremiah, who advised submission to Babylon as God's instrument of judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/27-12.htm">Jeremiah 27:12-15</a>). The question invites reflection on the futility of seeking security outside of God's will.<p><b>Will the one who does such things escape?</b><br>The question emphasizes the inevitability of consequences for breaking covenants and defying God's ordained order. Zedekiah's actions are portrayed as not only politically unwise but also morally and spiritually wrong. The notion of inescapable judgment is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, where actions contrary to God's commands lead to divine retribution (<a href="/amos/9.htm">Amos 9:1-4</a>).<p><b>Can he break a covenant and yet escape?</b><br>The covenant in question is the oath of loyalty Zedekiah swore to Nebuchadnezzar, which was made in God's name (<a href="/ezekiel/17-13.htm">Ezekiel 17:13-14</a>). Breaking this covenant is seen as a serious offense, not just against Babylon, but against God Himself. The gravity of covenant-breaking is a central theme in the Bible, where faithfulness to one's word is highly valued (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>). This phrase underscores the moral and spiritual dimensions of Zedekiah's rebellion, highlighting the broader biblical principle that God holds individuals and nations accountable for their promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, by seeking an alliance with Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who had installed Zedekiah as a vassal king in Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The nation to which Zedekiah turned for military support against Babylon, symbolizing reliance on worldly powers rather than God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The agreement between Zedekiah and Nebuchadnezzar, which Zedekiah broke by seeking help from Egypt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet_ezekiel.htm">Prophet Ezekiel</a></b><br>The messenger of God who delivered this parable and prophecy, warning of the consequences of breaking covenants.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_breaking_covenants.htm">The Consequences of Breaking Covenants</a></b><br>Zedekiah's rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar illustrates the serious consequences of breaking covenants, both human and divine.

By ignoring the warning in <a href="/ezekiel/17-12.htm">Ezekiel 17:12&#8211;14</a>, he violated the oath he had sworn in God&#8217;s name to serve Nebuchadnezzar. Scripture treats that oath as binding (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4&#8211;6</a>), and breaking it placed him in direct opposition to the LORD, not merely to a foreign ruler (<a href="/jeremiah/27-12.htm">Jeremiah 27:12&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by sending his envoys to Egypt to ask for horses and a large army</b><p>Zedekiah sought military help from Egypt (<a href="/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5&#8211;7</a>), repeating Judah&#8217;s old pattern of trusting worldly alliances instead of the LORD (<a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1&#8211;3</a>; 31:1). <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a> specifically warned Israel&#8217;s kings against returning to Egypt for horses, underscoring how far he strayed from covenant obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will he flourish?</b><p>God&#8217;s answer is implied: no. <a href="/bsb/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1</a> contrasts the flourishing of the righteous with the chaff-like fate of the wicked.

Zedekiah tried to flee Jerusalem through a breach in the wall, yet Babylonian soldiers overtook him on the plains of Jericho (<a href="/jeremiah/52-7.htm">Jeremiah 52:7&#8211;9</a>), illustrating that human schemes cannot outrun God&#8217;s decree.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Can he break a covenant and yet escape?</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/17-18.htm">Ezekiel 17:18&#8211;19</a> states plainly that God would &#8220;bring down on his own head&#8221; the oath Zedekiah despised.

The sanctity of an oath had always been most strongly insisted upon in Israelitish history. It must be remembered that even when, as in the case of the Gibeonites (Joshua , 9), the oath had been obtained by fraud, and centuries had passed since it was given, God yet sorely punished the land for its violation (<a href="/context/2_samuel/21-1.htm" title="Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.">2Samuel 21:1-2</a>); and in this case the king had been more than once Divinely warned through the prophet Jeremiah of the danger of his treachery. As Zedekiah's intrigues with Egypt were just now going on, it was particularly important that they should be exposed, and their result foretold to the captives who were yet trusting in the safety of Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they might give him horses.</span> The "chariots and horses" of Egypt seem, throughout its whole history, to have been its chief element of strength.
