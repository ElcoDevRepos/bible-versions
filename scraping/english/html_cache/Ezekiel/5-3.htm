Throughout the Bible, the concept of a remnant is significant, often representing those who remain faithful to God amidst widespread unfaithfulness. This idea is echoed in passages like <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>, where a remnant of Israel returns to God. The act of taking a few strands signifies God's mercy and the preservation of a faithful group despite impending judgment.<p><b>and secure them in the folds of your garment.</b><br>Securing the strands in the folds of a garment suggests protection and care. In ancient Near Eastern culture, garments were often used to carry and protect valuable items, indicating the preciousness of the remnant. This imagery can be connected to the protective nature of God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>, where God covers His people with His feathers. Additionally, the garment can symbolize righteousness, as in <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>, where garments of salvation and robes of righteousness are mentioned. This act foreshadows the ultimate protection and salvation found in Jesus Christ, who is the fulfillment of God's promise to preserve a faithful remnant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
