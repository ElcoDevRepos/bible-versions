The Edomites were descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother, and this animosity can be traced back to the sibling rivalry between Esau and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23-34</a>). The "ancient hatred" signifies a deep-seated hostility that persisted over generations. This enmity is also mentioned in other scriptures, such as <a href="/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>, where Edom's perpetual anger is condemned. The historical context shows that Edom often took advantage of Israel's vulnerabilities, exacerbating the conflict.<p><b>and delivered the Israelites over to the sword</b><br>This phrase highlights Edom's betrayal and active participation in the violence against Israel. During times of Israel's distress, particularly during the Babylonian invasion, Edom sided with the enemies of Israel, contributing to their downfall (<a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10-14</a>). This act of delivering Israel to the sword is seen as a grave sin, as it involved not only passive indifference but active aggression against their kin. The sword symbolizes warfare and destruction, emphasizing the severity of Edom's actions.<p><b>in the time of their disaster</b><br>The "time of their disaster" refers to the period of calamity for Israel, particularly the Babylonian conquest and the subsequent exile in 586 BC. This was a time of great suffering and loss for the Israelites, as Jerusalem was destroyed, and many were taken captive. The disaster was a fulfillment of prophetic warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, who had forewarned of the consequences of Israel's disobedience to God.<p><b>at the final stage of their punishment</b><br>This phrase indicates that the disaster was part of God's judgment upon Israel for their sins, as prophesied by Ezekiel and other prophets. The "final stage" suggests the culmination of a series of divine judgments that had been progressively unfolding. It underscores the idea that while God used other nations as instruments of His judgment, those nations, like Edom, were still held accountable for their actions. This reflects the biblical principle that God is sovereign over history, using it to accomplish His purposes while maintaining justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, known for its longstanding enmity with Israel.

The &#8220;ancient hatred&#8221; points back to the hostility that began with Esau&#8217;s grudge against Jacob (<a href="/genesis/27-41.htm">Genesis 27:41</a>) and continued through the generations (<a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>; <a href="/bsb/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 10</a>-11).<p>- This animosity was not a fleeting emotion but a settled, covenant-breaking attitude that stood in direct opposition to God&#8217;s promise to bless Israel (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p>- By calling the hatred &#8220;ancient,&#8221; the Lord highlights its deliberate, ongoing nature&#8212;Edom chose to keep nourishing it rather than repent (<a href="/malachi/1-2.htm">Malachi 1:2-4</a>).<p>- Cross reference: <a href="/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>, &#8220;Remember, O LORD, against the Edomites the day of Jerusalem, when they said, &#8216;Lay it bare, lay it bare to its foundations!&#8217;&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and delivered the Israelites over to the sword</b><p>- Edom actively participated in Israel&#8217;s downfall instead of offering aid. <a href="/bsb/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 11</a>-14 details how Edom stood aloof, gloated, looted, and even captured fugitives for the enemy.<p>- This turned Edom from passive neighbor to willing accomplice of violence. <a href="/proverbs/17-5.htm">Proverbs 17:5</a> warns, &#8220;He who is glad at calamity will not go unpunished&#8221;.<p>- By &#8220;delivered,&#8221; the text shows Edom&#8217;s responsibility; they were not mere bystanders but deliberate facilitators of Israel&#8217;s suffering.<p>- Cross reference: <a href="/lamentations/4-21.htm">Lamentations 4:21-22</a> contrasts Edom&#8217;s rejoicing with God&#8217;s assurance that their own judgment would follow.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the time of their disaster</b><p>- God had permitted Babylon to discipline Judah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>); Edom exploited that divine chastening for personal vengeance.<p>- <a href="/zechariah/1-15.htm">Zechariah 1:15</a> says, &#8220;I was only a little angry, but they added to the calamity&#8221;, capturing the way surrounding nations intensified Israel&#8217;s distress beyond God&#8217;s intended measure.<p>- The phrase underscores Edom&#8217;s lack of compassion&#8212;kicking a brother nation when it was already down, violating the moral expectation of helping the afflicted (<a href="/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the final stage of their punishment</b><p>- Israel&#8217;s &#8220;punishment&#8221; (exile) was nearing its ordained completion (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-2.htm">Isaiah 40:2</a>). Edom&#8217;s aggression came just as God&#8217;s discipline was about to lift, showing utter disregard for His redemptive timetable.<p>- By interfering at that critical moment, Edom aligned itself against God&#8217;s restorative plan, guaranteeing severe retribution (<a href="/ezekiel/35-6.htm">Ezekiel 35:6-9</a>).<p>- Cross reference: <a href="/ezekiel/21-25.htm">Ezekiel 21:25-27</a> reveals that God alone decides when judgment ends; any nation presuming to extend or intensify it is arrogating divine authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a> condemns Edom for a persistent, deep-seated hatred that erupted in active violence against Israel precisely when Israel was most vulnerable and when God&#8217;s discipline was nearly complete. The verse highlights God&#8217;s justice: He remembers centuries-old grievances, holds nations responsible for aiding oppression, and protects His redemptive purposes for His people. Edom&#8217;s ancient grudge, their hand in Israel&#8217;s bloodshed, their exploitation of calamity, and their intrusion into God&#8217;s timetable collectively explain why judgment on Mount Seir is certain and severe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/35.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Perpetual hatred.--</span>Enmity towards Israel is also imputed to the Ammonites, Moabites, and Philistines in Ezekiel 25; but that of Edom was deeper and coeval with its first ancestor (see <a href="/genesis/25-22.htm" title="And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus?

The time specifically referred to is that of the overthrow of Jerusalem, as both that of their great "calamity" and that when "their iniquity had an end." (On the last phrase, see Note on <a href="/ezekiel/21-29.htm" title="Whiles they see vanity to you, whiles they divine a lie to you, to bring you on the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity shall have an end.">Ezekiel 21:29</a>.)

This was the first of the two specific grounds upon which Eden should feel the stroke of Divine vengeance. Edom had been Israel's hereditary foe from the days of Esau and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/25-22.htm">Genesis 25:22</a>, <span class="accented">sqq</span>.; and Genesis 27:37) downwards. Inspired with unappeasable wrath (<a href="/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>), during the period of the wandering he had refused Israel, "his brother," a passage through his territory (<a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>; <a href="/judges/11-17.htm">Judges 11:17</a>), and in the days of Jehoshaphat had combined with Ammon and Moab to invade Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-10.htm">2 Chronicles 20:10, 11</a>; cf. <a href="/psalms/83-1.htm">Psalm 83:1-8</a>). His relentless antipathy to Israel culminated, according to Ezekiel (cf. <a href="/obadiah/1-13.htm">Obadiah 1:13</a>), in the last days of <span class="cmt_word">Jerusalem, in the time of her calamity</span>, when Nebuchadnezzar's armies encompassed her walls, in the time that her <span class="cmt_word">iniquity</span> <span class="cmt_word">had an end</span>; or, in <span class="accented">the time of the iniquity of the end</span> (Revised Version); meaning, according to Keil, "the time of Judah's final transgression;" or, according to Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' the time when the capture of the city put an end to her iniquity; but, with more probability, according to Hengstenberg, Plumptre, and others, the time of that iniquity which brought on her end (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/21-29.htm">Ezekiel 21:29</a>). Ewald translates, "at the time of her extremest punishment," taking <span class="accented">avon</span> in the sense of punishment - a rendering the Revisers have placed in the margin. Then, according to Obadiah (vers. 11-14), the Edomites had not only stood coolly by, but malevolently exulted when they beheld Jerusalem besieged by the Babylonian warriors; and not only joined with the foreign invaders in the sacking of the city, but occupied its gates and guarded the roads leading into the country, so as to prevent the escape of any of the wretched inhabitants, and even hewed down with the sword such fugitives as they were not able to save alive and deliver up to captivity. To this Ezekiel refers when he accuses Edom of having <span class="cmt_word">shed</span> the <span class="cmt_word">blood of the children of Israel</span> by the fores of the sword; literally, of having <span class="accented">poured the children of Israel upon the hands of the sword; i.e.</span> of having delivered them up to the sword (cf. <a href="/psalms/63-11.htm">Psalm 63:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/18-21.htm">Jeremiah 18:21</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1431;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3282.htm">Strong's 3282: </a> </span><span class="str2">Heed, purpose, to indicate the reason, cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you harbored</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1457;&#1497;&#1444;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#277;&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">an ancient</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#183;l&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5769.htm">Strong's 5769: </a> </span><span class="str2">Concealed, eternity, frequentatively, always</span><br /><br /><span class="word">hatred</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1489;&#1463;&#1443;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;&#7687;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_342.htm">Strong's 342: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hostility</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and delivered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;tag&#183;g&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
