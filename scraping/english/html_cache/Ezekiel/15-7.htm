In biblical terms, God setting His face against someone signifies His determination to bring about their downfall. This is consistent with the covenantal language found in <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>, where God warns Israel of the consequences of disobedience. The imagery of God's face suggests His personal involvement and the seriousness of the judgment.<p><b>Though they may have escaped the fire,</b><br>The fire here symbolizes previous judgments or trials that the people have endured. In the context of Ezekiel, this could refer to the earlier Babylonian invasions or other calamities that Israel faced. The idea is that even if they have survived past judgments, it does not guarantee future safety. This reflects the persistent nature of God's judgment against unrepentant sin.<p><b>yet another fire will consume them.</b><br>This indicates that further judgment is inevitable. The use of fire as a metaphor for judgment is common in the Bible, symbolizing purification and destruction. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of God's refining fire, as seen in passages like <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>. The consuming fire represents the totality of God's judgment, leaving nothing unaddressed.<p><b>And when I set My face against them,</b><br>Reiterating the earlier phrase, this emphasizes the certainty and seriousness of God's judgment. The repetition underscores the inevitability of the consequences for their actions. It also serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and His right to judge His people according to His covenant.<p><b>you will know that I am the LORD.</b><br>This phrase is a recurring theme in Ezekiel, highlighting the purpose of God's actions: to reveal His identity and authority. The acknowledgment of God as LORD is central to the covenant relationship. This recognition is not just intellectual but involves a deep understanding of God's holiness, justice, and mercy. It echoes the purpose of the plagues in Egypt, as seen in <a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a>, where God's actions lead to the acknowledgment of His sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who speaks through Ezekiel, expressing His judgment and intentions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, who are the primary audience of Ezekiel's prophecies, often depicted as rebellious and idolatrous.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city representing the heart of Israel, often a focal point of God's judgment due to its people's sins.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period during which the Israelites were exiled to Babylon, a backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty and Judgment</a></b><br>God is sovereign and His judgments are just.

It is not an impersonal force but God Himself turning toward the people in judgment, as in <a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10</a> and <a href="/psalms/34-16.htm">Psalm 34:16</a>, where His face is likewise &#8220;against&#8221; evildoers.<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores His righteous character: He cannot overlook persistent rebellion. <a href="/jeremiah/21-10.htm">Jeremiah 21:10</a> echoes this stance when the Lord tells Jerusalem, &#8220;I have set My face against this city for harm and not for good.&#8221;<p>&#8226; For the exiles hearing Ezekiel, this announcement removed every illusion of safety; the covenant Lord whom they presumed was &#8220;for&#8221; them now confronts them because of their unrepentant idolatry (<a href="/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Though they may have escaped the fire</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;fire&#8221; recalls earlier verses where the useless vine (Judah) is tossed into flames (<a href="/ezekiel/15-4.htm">Ezekiel 15:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; A first wave of discipline had already come&#8212;many had been deported to Babylon, yet some remained. They thought they had &#8220;escaped.&#8221; <a href="/amos/4-11.htm">Amos 4:11</a> speaks similarly of people &#8220;like a firebrand snatched from the blaze,&#8221; still refusing to return to God.<p>&#8226; The line exposes false security: surviving a prior calamity is not proof of God&#8217;s favor if repentance is absent (<a href="/isaiah/9-13.htm">Isaiah 9:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>yet another fire will consume them</b><p>&#8226; Judgment is progressive; refusing the warning only intensifies the consequence. Babylon would return, burn Jerusalem, and destroy the temple (<a href="/jeremiah/52-13.htm">Jeremiah 52:13</a>; <a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Fire represents both literal devastation and the consuming holiness of God (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The certainty of this second fire shows that partial judgment is mercy meant to lead to repentance. When mercy is despised, justice advances (<a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And when I set My face against them, you will know that I am the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The ultimate goal is not destruction for its own sake but revelation: &#8220;you will know that I am the LORD.&#8221; God&#8217;s actions, whether mercy or judgment, reveal His identity (<a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7</a>; 7:4).<p>&#8226; For those who turn, the knowledge of the Lord becomes salvation; for those who persist in sin, it comes through judgment. Either way, He secures His glory (<a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>; <a href="/romans/11-22.htm">Romans 11:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The repeated refrain in Ezekiel assures the exiles that history is not random. God is actively shaping events so His people&#8212;and the watching nations&#8212;recognize His sovereign, covenant-keeping nature.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/15-7.htm">Ezekiel 15:7</a> declares that God personally opposes unrepentant Judah, exposes their false security, and promises a more severe judgment that will culminate in the people unmistakably recognizing His lordship. Surviving an earlier calamity is no guarantee of safety; true refuge is found only in turning back to the Lord who righteously judges and mercifully saves.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/15-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And I will set</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7791;at&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
