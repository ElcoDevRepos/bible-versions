In biblical history, mountains often served as places of refuge and safety (e.g., Lot fleeing to the mountains in <a href="/genesis/19-17.htm">Genesis 19:17</a>). The imagery of mountains suggests a place away from the destruction of the cities, symbolizing divine protection and a chance for renewal. This echoes the theme of a faithful remnant found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a> and <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>, where God preserves a group of people despite widespread judgment.<p><b>moaning like doves of the valley</b><br>Doves are often associated with mourning and lamentation in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a> and <a href="/nahum/2-7.htm">Nahum 2:7</a>. The valley, in contrast to the mountains, represents lowliness and vulnerability. This imagery conveys deep sorrow and repentance among the survivors. The dove's mournful cooing symbolizes the profound grief and regret for the sins that led to their current plight. This reflects the biblical principle that true repentance involves a heartfelt acknowledgment of one's sins, as seen in <a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>.<p><b>each for his own iniquity</b><br>This phrase emphasizes personal responsibility for sin. In the context of Ezekiel, the people of Israel are being held accountable for their individual and collective transgressions. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching that each person is responsible for their own actions, as stated in <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>. The acknowledgment of personal iniquity is a crucial step toward repentance and restoration, a theme that is central to the message of the prophets and the teachings of Jesus Christ, who calls individuals to repent and believe in the gospel (<a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/survivors.htm">Survivors</a></b><br>These are the remnants of Israel who escape the impending judgment and destruction prophesied by Ezekiel.

Here, they are depicted as the physical location where the survivors find temporary safety.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/doves.htm">Doves</a></b><br>The imagery of doves moaning is used to convey deep sorrow and mourning. Doves are often associated with peace and innocence, highlighting the contrast between their nature and the lamentation they express.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/valleys.htm">Valleys</a></b><br>Valleys in the Bible can symbolize low points or places of vulnerability. The mention of doves in the valleys emphasizes the depth of the survivors' despair.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/iniquity.htm">Iniquity</a></b><br>This refers to the sin and moral corruption that led to the judgment.

(<a href="/matthew/24-16.htm">Matthew 24:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Living in caves and crags speaks of hardship rather than comfort, showing sin&#8217;s bitter consequences (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Moaning like doves of the valley</b><p>&#8226;
