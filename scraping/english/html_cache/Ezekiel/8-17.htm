It underscores the contrast between God's divine nature and human frailty. This title is also significant in the New Testament, where Jesus frequently refers to Himself as the "Son of Man," highlighting His role as the representative and redeemer of humanity.<p><b>&#8220;do you see this?</b><br>This phrase indicates a divine revelation being shown to Ezekiel. It suggests that God is revealing hidden sins to the prophet, emphasizing the importance of spiritual insight and discernment. This mirrors the role of prophets as seers who perceive spiritual realities beyond the physical realm.<p><b>Is it not enough for the house of Judah to commit the abominations they are practicing here,</b><br>The "house of Judah" refers to the southern kingdom, which had fallen into idolatry and other sins. The term "abominations" often refers to idolatrous practices, which were detestable to God. This reflects the historical context of Judah's spiritual decline, leading to the Babylonian exile. The abominations are a direct violation of the covenant relationship established in the Mosaic Law.<p><b>that they must also fill the land with violence</b><br>The mention of "violence" indicates social injustice and moral decay. This reflects the broader biblical theme that idolatry often leads to ethical corruption. The prophets frequently condemned violence and injustice, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15-17</a> and <a href="/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>, where God calls for justice and righteousness.<p><b>and continually provoke Me to anger?</b><br>This phrase highlights God's righteous indignation towards sin. The continual provocation suggests a persistent and unrepentant attitude among the people. This is consistent with the biblical narrative where God is patient but ultimately just, as seen in His dealings with Israel throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>Look, they are even putting the branch to their nose!</b><br>This enigmatic phrase likely refers to a pagan ritual or act of contempt towards God. Some scholars suggest it may involve a gesture associated with idol worship or a disrespectful act towards Yahweh. The exact meaning is uncertain, but it underscores the depth of Judah's rebellion. This act symbolizes the complete disregard for God's holiness and commands, contrasting with the reverence due to Him as seen in the worship practices outlined in the Torah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, chosen by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_judah.htm">House of Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, known for its capital, Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/abominations.htm">Abominations</a></b><br>Refers to the idolatrous practices and detestable acts committed by the people of Judah, which were offensive to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/violence.htm">Violence</a></b><br>The moral and social corruption that filled the land as a result of turning away from God's commandments.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/branch_to_their_nose.htm">Branch to their nose</a></b><br>A debated phrase, possibly referring to a pagan ritual or act of contempt towards God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin is never trivial in the eyes of God.

A people who go astray from their duty to God are always found to neglect also their duty to man. Israel had before fallen into great and grievous sins. Within the memory of those still living, the good king Josiah, supported by the prophet Jeremiah and many others, had made great effort at reformation, and had purged the Temple of its abominations; hence God says the people "have <span class= "ital">returned </span>to provoke me to anger."<p><span class= "bld">Put the branch to their nose.</span>--This is an obscure expression, on which the learning and ingenuity of commentators have been spent in vain. It is an allusion to some custom well known at the time, but now lost. The simplest explanation seems to be in a reference to the habit of the Parsees (mentioned by Strabo) in their worship to hold twigs of the tamarisk, palm, and the pomegranate before their mouths.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - For <span class="cmt_word">returned</span> read, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">turned again.</span> The wind seems chosen with special reference to the attitude of the idol worshippers. It may be noted that even here the prophet speaks not only of the idolatry of Judah, but of its <span class="cmt_word">violence</span> also, as bringing down the judgments of Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">Lo, they put the branch to their nose.</span> The opening word expresses the prophet's burning indignation. The act described probably finds its best explanation in the Persian ritual of the Avesta. When men prayed to the sun, they held in their left hands a bouquet of palm, pomegranate, and tamarisk twigs, while the priests for the same purpose held a veil before their mouth (Spiegel, 'Iran. Alterth.,' 3:571, 572, in Smend), so that the bright rays of the sun might not be polluted by human breath. And this was done in the very temple of Jehovah by those who were polluting the whole land by their violence. The LXX. gives, as an explanation, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, as though the act was one of scornful pride (comp. <a href="/isaiah/65-5.htm">Isaiah 65:5</a>), the sign of a temper like that of the Pharisee as he looked upon the publican (<a href="/luke/18-11.htm">Luke 18:11</a>). Lightfoot takes the "nose" as the symbol of anger, and looks on the phrase as proverbial: "They add the twig to their anger, fuel to the fire;" but this has little to commend it.
