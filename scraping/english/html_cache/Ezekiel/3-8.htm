In the context of Ezekiel's prophetic mission, God is preparing him to confront a rebellious and obstinate people. The hardening of Ezekiel's face symbolizes the strength and determination needed to deliver God's message without fear or compromise. This mirrors the cultural context of ancient Near Eastern prophets who often faced opposition and hostility. The phrase also echoes the biblical theme of God equipping His servants for their tasks, similar to how He strengthened Moses (<a href="/exodus/4-15.htm">Exodus 4:15-16</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>).<p><b>and your forehead as hard as their foreheads</b><br>The forehead represents determination and resilience. In ancient cultures, the forehead was often seen as a symbol of one's resolve and character. By making Ezekiel's forehead hard, God is ensuring that he can withstand the stubbornness and resistance of the people of Israel. This imagery is reminiscent of the "set face" of Jesus as He resolutely headed towards Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>), indicating a prophetic type of Christ's unwavering commitment to His mission. The hardening also serves as a protective measure, ensuring that Ezekiel remains steadfast in the face of potential ridicule or persecution, much like the armor of God described in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Of course it must have a different shade of meaning in its application to the rebellious people and to the prophet; but the main thought is taken from the figure of horned animals in their contests, and God promises Ezekiel to make him in the struggle stronger than those who oppose him. The same thing is expressed by another figure in <a href="/ezekiel/3-9.htm" title="As an adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.">Ezekiel 3:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have made thy face strong;</span> literally, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">hard.</span> Ezekiel's name was at once <span class="accented">nomen et omen.</span> Hard as Israel might be, he could be made <span class="accented">harder, i.e.</span> stronger, than they, end should prevail against them (compare the parallels of <a href="/isaiah/1-7.htm">Isaiah 1:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20</a>).
