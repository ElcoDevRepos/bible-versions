In biblical times, gold and silver were considered valuable and were often used in religious and royal contexts. The reference to God giving these items underscores His provision and generosity towards Israel. This imagery is reminiscent of the wealth given to the Israelites during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>) and the adornment of the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25:1-9</a>). The gifts symbolize the covenant relationship between God and His people, where Israel was to reflect God's glory and holiness.<p><b>and you made male idols</b><br>The creation of male idols signifies Israel's turn to idolatry, a direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). In the ancient Near East, idol worship was prevalent, and these idols often represented fertility gods or deities associated with prosperity and protection. The act of making idols from the gifts God provided is a profound betrayal, illustrating Israel's spiritual adultery. This behavior is condemned throughout the prophetic books, where idolatry is equated with unfaithfulness to God (<a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20-28</a>, <a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12-13</a>).<p><b>with which to prostitute yourself</b><br>The metaphor of prostitution is used frequently in the Bible to describe Israel's unfaithfulness to God (<a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-9</a>). This language conveys the depth of Israel's betrayal, as they exchanged their exclusive relationship with God for alliances with foreign nations and their gods. The imagery of prostitution emphasizes the spiritual adultery and the breaking of the covenant relationship. It also reflects the cultural practices of the time, where temple prostitution was part of pagan worship rituals. This phrase serves as a stark warning against the dangers of idolatry and the consequences of turning away from God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
