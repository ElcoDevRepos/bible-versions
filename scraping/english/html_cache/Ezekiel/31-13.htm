In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/31.htm">Ezekiel 31</a>, the imagery of a tree represents Assyria, a once-mighty empire that has been brought low. The birds nesting on the fallen trunk suggest that what was once a symbol of strength and dominance has become a place of habitation for lesser creatures. This imagery is reminiscent of <a href="/daniel/4-12.htm">Daniel 4:12</a>, where a tree provides shelter for birds, symbolizing the reach and influence of a kingdom. The fallen trunk indicates a complete reversal of fortune, highlighting the theme of divine judgment against pride and arrogance. The birds, often seen as scavengers in biblical literature, emphasize the desolation and vulnerability of the fallen empire.<p><b>and all the beasts of the field lived among its boughs</b><br>The beasts living among the boughs further illustrate the desolation and transformation of the once-great tree. In biblical symbolism, beasts often represent nations or peoples (<a href="/daniel/7-17.htm">Daniel 7:17</a>). The presence of these creatures among the boughs suggests that the fallen empire has become a dwelling place for those who once might have been its subjects or adversaries. This imagery can be connected to the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>, where a future harmonious kingdom is described with animals living peacefully together, contrasting the current state of chaos and disorder. The phrase underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and the inevitable downfall of those who exalt themselves against Him. It serves as a warning to other nations and leaders about the consequences of pride and the ultimate authority of God over all creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Ezekiel often uses birds to picture surrounding peoples or lesser powers (<a href="/ezekiel/31-6.htm">Ezekiel 31:6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-23.htm">Ezekiel 17:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Here the &#8220;birds&#8221; are not perched in a living cedar but circling a felled one&#8212;an image of opportunistic nations flocking to profit from Assyria&#8217;s (and, by warning, Egypt&#8217;s) collapse.<p>&#8226; Similar wording in <a href="/daniel/4-12.htm">Daniel 4:12</a> shows birds representing peoples who once found security in a great empire; <a href="/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2</a> turns the picture dark, portraying fallen Babylon as a haunt for unclean birds.<p>&#8226; The phrase confirms that when God topples a proud kingdom, even minor players recognize the shift and quickly move in.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>nested on its fallen trunk</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Fallen trunk&#8221; underlines total judgment: the mighty cedar is now a carcass on the forest floor.<p>&#8226; Nations that once merely sheltered under its shade now settle on the very ruins&#8212;evidence that God&#8217;s sentence is final, not partial (<a href="/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-8.htm">Isaiah 14:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The nesting speaks of permanence; these newcomers intend to stay, dividing spoils, redrawing borders, rewriting alliances.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/32-4.htm">Ezekiel 32:4</a> echoes the idea: Pharaoh&#8217;s body becomes food for birds and beasts&#8212;power reversed, glory gone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all the beasts of the field</b><p>&#8226;

Their presence alongside the birds shows that every level of society, from lesser peoples to greater forces, will exploit the fallen empire.<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a> portrays beasts as empires; Ezekiel borrows the motif, stressing that when one empire dies, others rise from its remains.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>lived among its boughs</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Boughs&#8221; once lifted high now lie broken and accessible, inviting occupation.<p>&#8226;

The broken branches become new borders, shelter, and resources for whoever moves in.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/37-35.htm">Psalm 37:35-36</a> gives a similar contrast: the flourishing tree cut down and found no more. The wicked empire is gone, but ordinary life for others carries on amid its debris.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/31-13.htm">Ezekiel 31:13</a> paints a vivid, literal aftermath of divine judgment: the grand cedar&#8212;Assyria in historical focus, Egypt by prophetic warning&#8212;has been felled by God&#8217;s hand. In its downfall every kind of people and power rushes in, settling on the trunk, roaming the broken branches, and making permanent claims where arrogance once reigned. The verse reassures that no empire, however towering, can resist God&#8217;s decree; when He brings it down, the very symbols of its pride become a playground for the small and the strong alike, proving His sovereignty over all nations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Upon his ruin shall all the fowls.--</span>There is no inconsistency between this and the previous verse. <span class= "bld">At</span> the fall all nations and people rush away, to avoid becoming involved in the catastrophe; but as soon as the giant cedar is prostrate, they gather upon its trunk and branches to fatten upon its ruin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon his ruin</span>.
