It represents the ten tribes that broke away from the united monarchy after Solomon's reign. In biblical context, Samaria is often associated with idolatry and apostasy, as the Northern Kingdom frequently turned away from God to worship Baal and other deities. The reference to Samaria as an "older sister" suggests a familial relationship, indicating shared heritage and similar sins. This comparison highlights the spiritual adultery and unfaithfulness of Jerusalem, as Samaria was known for its rebellion against God.<p><b>who lived with her daughters to your north;</b><br>The "daughters" of Samaria refer to the smaller towns and villages that were part of the Northern Kingdom. Geographically, Samaria was located to the north of Jerusalem, which aligns with the historical and geographical context of the divided kingdoms. The phrase emphasizes the widespread influence of Samaria's idolatry and corruption, affecting not just the capital but the surrounding regions. This northern location also serves as a reminder of the Assyrian conquest in 722 BC, when Samaria fell due to its persistent sin.<p><b>and your younger sister was Sodom,</b><br>Sodom is infamous for its destruction due to extreme wickedness, as recorded in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. By calling Sodom a "younger sister," the text draws a parallel between the sins of Jerusalem and those of Sodom, suggesting that Jerusalem's behavior was as reprehensible as that of Sodom. This comparison is a severe indictment, as Sodom is often used as a symbol of ultimate moral decay and divine judgment. The reference serves as a warning of the consequences of persistent sin and rebellion against God.<p><b>who lived with her daughters to your south.</b><br>The "daughters" of Sodom likely refer to the cities of the plain mentioned in Genesis, such as Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, which were also destroyed. Geographically, Sodom was located to the south of Jerusalem, near the Dead Sea. This southern location underscores the comprehensive nature of the indictment against Jerusalem, as it is surrounded by examples of divine judgment. The historical destruction of Sodom serves as a prophetic warning to Jerusalem, emphasizing the certainty of judgment if repentance is not forthcoming.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The primary subject of <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>, representing the people of Judah.

Chronologically, Sodom was not younger than Jerusalem, nor is there evidence that Samaria was older. The terms are to be understood of Samaria as the capital of the far larger northern kingdom, and of Sodom as a single city of no great population. The Orientals, in describing geographical positions, considered themselves as facing the east, and hence Samaria (at the north) was on the left, and Sodom on the right. Sodom is spoken of poetically as if still in existence. They were both the spiritual sisters of Judah, just as all alike were daughters of the Amorite and Hittite.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - No very adequate reason appears for the assignment of the respective ages of the two sisters. Historically, Sodom, as the oldest representative of evil, would have seemed to claim precedence. Samaria may have had this position assigned to it as more closely connected with Judah. The left and right hands indicate respectively a position to the north and south of Jerusalem, the observer of the heavens looking east, as, we may note, the temple did (<a href="/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>).
