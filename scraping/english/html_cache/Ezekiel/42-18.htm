Measuring is a recurring theme in Ezekiel, symbolizing divine judgment and restoration. The south side of the temple complex is significant as it represents the direction of warmth and light, often associated with blessing and life in biblical symbolism. This act of measuring also reflects the meticulous nature of God's design for His dwelling place among His people.<p><b>to be five hundred cubits long</b><br>The measurement of five hundred cubits indicates a substantial and complete structure, emphasizing the grandeur and perfection of God's temple. A cubit, approximately 18 inches or 45 centimeters, was a standard unit of measurement in ancient times, derived from the length of the forearm. This specific measurement aligns with the detailed descriptions found in other parts of Ezekiel's vision, underscoring the temple's vastness and the comprehensive nature of God's plan for His people. The number five hundred, being a multiple of ten, often symbolizes completeness and divine order in biblical numerology. This measurement can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ, who embodies the true temple and the presence of God among humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.

<a href="/bsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40&#8211;42</a> describes a visionary tour in which &#8220;a man whose appearance was like bronze&#8221; uses a measuring rod to mark out a future temple complex (<a href="/ezekiel/40-3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; The portion in 42:15&#8211;20 specifically shifts from interior rooms to the enclosure wall surrounding the entire sanctuary, portraying a boundary that protects holiness (cf. <a href="/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1-5</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-1.htm">Revelation 11:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Verse 18 fits into a four-direction sequence: north, east, south, west&#8212;underscoring symmetry and completeness (<a href="/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He measured</b><p>&#8226; Measurement in Scripture conveys precision, ownership, and intentional design (<a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-15.htm">Revelation 21:15-17</a>).<p>&#8226; By recording exact lengths, the text reassures readers that God&#8217;s future plans are concrete, not symbolic abstractions.<p>&#8226; The measuring agent acts under divine authority, reminding us that God alone defines true worship space (<a href="/ezekiel/43-12.htm">Ezekiel 43:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The south side</b><p>&#8226; South is associated with warmth, light, and access in Israel&#8217;s geography; naming it shows that no side is overlooked (<a href="/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-19.htm">Isaiah 60:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The orderly listing of directions emphasizes that God&#8217;s holiness radiates in every direction, inviting all nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1-12</a>).<p>&#8226;

Squares in Scripture often symbolize perfection and completeness, as seen in the Most Holy Place (<a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>) and the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>).<p>&#8226;

this wall is not a token fence but a substantial barrier marking the line between sacred and profane (<a href="/ezekiel/42-20.htm">Ezekiel 42:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Length also hints at capacity: the vast courtyard anticipates multitudes who will come to worship (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-16.htm">Zechariah 14:16</a>).<p>&#8226; A fixed length invites trust&#8212;if God specifies these details, He surely governs the larger redemptive plan (<a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Practical applications</b><p>&#8226;

<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Precision encourages faith: when Scripture records specifics, we can trust its broader promises with equal confidence (<a href="/psalms/119-160.htm">Psalm 119:160</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/42-18.htm">Ezekiel 42:18</a>&#8212;&#8220;He measured the south side to be five hundred cubits long&#8221;&#8212;records one segment of a perfectly square wall encircling God&#8217;s future temple. The verse highlights divine precision, equal honor to every direction, and a secure boundary that preserves holiness. Its meticulous detail assures us that God&#8217;s redemptive blueprint is exact, trustworthy, and spacious enough for all who will come to worship Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/42-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He measured</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1425;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4058.htm">Strong's 4058: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stretch, to measure, to be extended</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the south</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(had&#183;d&#257;&#183;r&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1864.htm">Strong's 1864: </a> </span><span class="str2">The south, poet, the south wind</span><br /><br /><span class="word">side</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#363;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7307.htm">Strong's 7307: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wind, breath, exhalation, life, anger, unsubstantiality, a region of the sky, spirit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[to be] five</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;m&#234;&#353;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2568.htm">Strong's 2568: </a> </span><span class="str2">Five</span><br /><br /><span class="word">hundred</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3967.htm">Strong's 3967: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hundred</span><br /><br /><span class="word">cubits</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#257;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7070.htm">Strong's 7070: </a> </span><span class="str2">A reed, a, rod, shaft, tube, stem, the radius, beam</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[long].</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mid&#183;d&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4060.htm">Strong's 4060: </a> </span><span class="str2">Extension, height, breadth, a measure, a portion, a vestment, tribute</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/42-18.htm">Ezekiel 42:18 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/42-18.htm">Ezekiel 42:18 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/42-18.htm">Ezekiel 42:18 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/42-18.htm">Ezekiel 42:18 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/42-18.htm">Ezekiel 42:18 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/42-18.htm">Ezekiel 42:18  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/42-18.htm">Ezekiel 42:18 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/42-18.htm">Ezekiel 42:18 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/42-18.htm">Ezekiel 42:18 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/42-18.htm">Ezekiel 42:18 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/42-18.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 42:18 He measured on the south side five (Ezek.
