Historically, Egypt was conquered by Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar, fulfilling earlier prophecies of judgment. The restoration suggests God's sovereignty over nations, emphasizing His control over historical events. This restoration is not a full return to former glory but a limited reprieve, highlighting God's mercy even in judgment. The concept of restoration after captivity is also seen in the return of the Israelites from Babylon, drawing a parallel between the two nations' experiences.<p><b>and bring them back to the land of Pathros</b><br>Pathros refers to Upper Egypt, a region south of Memphis. It is significant as the ancestral homeland of the Egyptians, emphasizing a return to their roots. This geographical reference underscores the historical and cultural identity of Egypt, as Pathros was known for its ancient civilization. The return to Pathros symbolizes a re-establishment of national identity, albeit in a diminished capacity. The mention of Pathros also connects to other biblical references to Egypt's geography, such as in Isaiah and Jeremiah, where Egypt's fate is often discussed.<p><b>the land of their origin</b><br>This phrase highlights the deep historical roots of the Egyptian people in Pathros. It serves as a reminder of Egypt's ancient heritage and its longstanding presence in the biblical narrative. The land of origin signifies a return to beginnings, which can be seen as a humbling process, stripping away the grandeur of Egypt's past empires. This return to origins can be compared to the spiritual journey of returning to foundational truths, a theme prevalent in the prophetic literature.<p><b>There they will be a lowly kingdom</b><br>The prophecy concludes with a declaration of Egypt's future status as a "lowly kingdom." This indicates a significant reduction in power and influence, contrasting sharply with Egypt's historical position as a dominant empire. The term "lowly" suggests humility and subservience, possibly as a vassal state. This humbling of Egypt serves as a warning to other nations about the consequences of pride and opposition to God's will. It also reflects the biblical theme of God exalting the humble and bringing down the proud, as seen in the teachings of Jesus and throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Historically this has been eminently true. For a little while Egypt struggled against its oppressors, but its power was already broken, and from the time of its conquest by Cambyses it has never been for any length of time independent. There are few stronger contrasts in any inhabited country than between the ancient glory, dignity, power, and wealth of Egypt, and its later insignificance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Into the land of Pathros</span>.
