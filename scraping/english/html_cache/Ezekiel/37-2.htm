The act of being led around suggests a thorough examination, highlighting the importance of understanding the full scope of the vision. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where God leads His prophets to witness significant events, such as Moses on Mount Sinai or John in the Book of Revelation. The guidance underscores the prophetic nature of the vision, as Ezekiel is shown the reality of Israel's spiritual state.<p><b>and I saw a great many bones</b><br>The "great many bones" symbolize the vast number of Israelites who are spiritually dead and in exile. This imagery is powerful, representing the nation of Israel scattered and lifeless, much like bones without flesh. The bones can also be seen as a metaphor for hopelessness and despair, reflecting the condition of the people who have been cut off from their homeland and their God. This vision is a stark reminder of the consequences of disobedience and idolatry, as outlined in the covenant curses of <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>on the floor of the valley</b><br>The valley is often a place of battle or judgment in biblical literature. This setting may evoke memories of the Valley of Jezreel, a site of numerous conflicts in Israel's history. The valley floor, being a low point, symbolizes the depth of Israel's desolation and separation from God. It is a place where life seems impossible, yet it is precisely here that God chooses to demonstrate His power to restore and revive.<p><b>and indeed, they were very dry</b><br>The dryness of the bones emphasizes the extent of Israel's spiritual death and the impossibility of life returning by natural means. In the ancient Near East, dry bones would indicate a long period without life, suggesting that Israel's exile and spiritual decay have persisted for a significant time. This detail underscores the miraculous nature of the prophecy that follows, as only divine intervention can bring life to such a state. The dryness also connects to other biblical themes of spiritual thirst and the need for the living water that only God can provide, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42:1-2</a> and <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, called to deliver messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
