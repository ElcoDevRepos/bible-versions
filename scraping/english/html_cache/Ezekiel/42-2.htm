In Ezekiel's vision, the north is associated with God's glory entering the temple (<a href="/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a>). The north-facing door may also suggest a connection to the northern tribes of Israel, indicating inclusivity in worship. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the north was often seen as a place of divine assembly, which could imply the building's sacred purpose.<p><b>was a hundred cubits long</b><br>A cubit is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches or 45 centimeters. Therefore, a hundred cubits would be about 150 feet or 45 meters. This substantial length indicates the building's importance and grandeur. In the context of the temple complex, such dimensions reflect the majesty and holiness of God's dwelling place. The precise measurements also emphasize the order and perfection associated with divine architecture, as seen in other biblical structures like Noah's Ark and Solomon's Temple.<p><b>and fifty cubits wide.</b><br>At fifty cubits wide, the building's proportions are significant, suggesting a balanced and harmonious design. This width, approximately 75 feet or 22.5 meters, complements the length, creating a rectangular shape that is common in ancient temple architecture. The dimensions may symbolize completeness and stability, reflecting God's unchanging nature. The use of specific measurements in Ezekiel's vision underscores the detailed planning and divine inspiration behind the temple's construction, paralleling the meticulous instructions given for the Tabernacle in Exodus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.

Here he pauses to note &#8220;the building,&#8221; signaling that this is a distinct structure within the northern outer court.<p>- Consistent with <a href="/ezekiel/40-13.htm">Ezekiel 40:13, 40</a>:17&#8211;19, and 41:12, every detail is reported so the reader can picture a real edifice that will one day stand, just as <a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a> required Moses to follow the heavenly pattern for the tabernacle.<p>- By calling it simply &#8220;the building,&#8221; the prophet underscores its supporting role. It serves priests in their ministry (<a href="/ezekiel/42-13.htm">Ezekiel 42:13-14</a>); nevertheless, because it belongs to the temple compound, its design is recorded with the same precision God applied to the inner sanctuary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with the door facing north</b><p>- Orientation matters. The north side faced the main approach from the outer court (compare <a href="/ezekiel/40-20.htm">Ezekiel 40:20-23</a>). This allowed priests to enter and exit without crossing sacred inner areas, preserving holiness&#8212;echoing <a href="/numbers/3-38.htm">Numbers 3:38</a>, where access points were assigned to maintain order around the tabernacle.<p>- A northern doorway aligns with the overall symmetry God built into the complex (see <a href="/ezekiel/40-44.htm">Ezekiel 40:44-46</a>). Orderly arrangement reflects His character (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>) and teaches worshipers that God is not random but deliberate.<p>- It may also anticipate the prophetic flow of nations coming from every direction to worship the Messiah in the millennial age (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was a hundred cubits long</b><p>- One hundred cubits (about 175 feet/53 m) matches the length of other northern side buildings (<a href="/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13</a>). These repeated dimensions show the structure&#8217;s harmony within the larger plan.<p>- The substantial length emphasizes capacity: room enough for many priests to store garments, eat holy portions, and rest between shifts (<a href="/ezekiel/42-13.htm">Ezekiel 42:13</a>). God provides abundantly for those who serve Him (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">Deuteronomy 12:7</a>).<p>- Literal measurements anchor the prophecy to future reality, countering any notion that these chapters are only symbolic (cf. <a href="/revelation/21-15.htm">Revelation 21:15-17</a>, where John likewise records temple-city dimensions).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and fifty cubits wide</b><p>- Half the length, giving a 2:1 ratio that recurs throughout the vision (<a href="/ezekiel/40-13.htm">Ezekiel 40:13</a>; 40:15; 41:1-2). Such proportions create visual harmony and speak of God&#8217;s balance&#8212;neither excess nor deficiency.<p>- Width defines usable interior space. Like Solomon&#8217;s side rooms (<a href="/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5-10</a>), these quarters enable orderly priestly life, reinforcing the principle that God cares about practical details (<a href="/exodus/35-30.htm">Exodus 35:30-35</a>).<p>- The repeated mention of width highlights boundaries. Even in blessing, God sets limits (<a href="/job/38-8.htm">Job 38:8-11</a>) so that holiness is protected and worship remains pure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/42-2.htm">Ezekiel 42:2</a> gives a concise architectural note, yet every phrase contributes to God&#8217;s larger message: the future temple is literal, orderly, spacious, and purpose-built for holy service. The northern building&#8217;s placement, measurements, and function all declare that the Lord who designs is the Lord who dwells among His people, providing precisely what is needed for reverent, joyful worship in the coming kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/42.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Before the length.--</span>This verse is still a part of the same sentence, and means, "he brought me before the long side of 100 cubits with the door toward the north, and the breadth 50 cubits." The entrance being on the north was necessarily in the outer court, and the whole description requires that the long way of the building should be east and west. The width therefore of 50 cubits projected into the court just as far as the gateways of the inner court. The measurements of this "chamber" are external, since the prophet did not enter it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - With this verse the Authorized and Revised Versions begin a new sentence, and are in this at one with Smend; but the majority of expositors place the second verse under the regimen of the verb, "he brought me," in ver. 1, and understand the seer to state that he was planted down <span class="cmt_word">before the length</span> (or, long side) <span class="cmt_word">of an hundred cubits</span>, <span class="accented">with the door toward the north</span>, <span class="accented">and the breadth fifty</span> cubits. That is to say, the building which contained the sacristies, or priests' chambers, was a hundred cubits long and fifty bread. As the building on the separate place was also a hundred cubits long (<a href="/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13</a>), it might seem as if this erection ran exactly parallel to that, and this view is taken by Hengstenberg, Schroder, and Plumptre; but Kliefoth, Keil, and Currey, on the authority of <a href="/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19</a>, locate a priests' kitchen behind the priests' chambers towards the west, and reserve for it forty cubits, on the plausible ground that it would not likely be smaller in size than the sacrificial kitchen for the people (see <a href="/ezekiel/46-22.htm">Ezekiel 46:22</a>). Hence, if the building under consideration began forty cubits east of the gizrah wall, it would extend twenty cubits over the end and along the length of the temple. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/42-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The building</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1465;&#1433;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;re&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_753.htm">Strong's 753: </a> </span><span class="str2">Length</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with the door</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1514;&#1463;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(pe&#183;&#7791;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6607.htm">Strong's 6607: </a> </span><span class="str2">An opening, door, entrance way</span><br /><br /><span class="word">facing north</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6828.htm">Strong's 6828: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hidden, dark, the north as a, quarter</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[was] a hundred</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;m&#234;&#183;&#8217;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3967.htm">Strong's 3967: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hundred</span><br /><br /><span class="word">cubits</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;am&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_520.htm">Strong's 520: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mother, a cubit, a door-base</span><br /><br /><span class="word">long</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1465;&#1430;&#1495;&#1463;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;r&#333;&#183;&#7717;a&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7341.htm">Strong's 7341: </a> </span><span class="str2">Breadth, width</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[and] fifty</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;mi&#353;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2572.htm">Strong's 2572: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fifty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">cubits wide.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;am&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_520.htm">Strong's 520: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mother, a cubit, a door-base</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/42-2.htm">Ezekiel 42:2 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/42-2.htm">Ezekiel 42:2 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/42-2.htm">Ezekiel 42:2 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/42-2.htm">Ezekiel 42:2 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/42-2.htm">Ezekiel 42:2 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/42-2.htm">Ezekiel 42:2  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/42-2.htm">Ezekiel 42:2 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/42-2.htm">Ezekiel 42:2 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/42-2.htm">Ezekiel 42:2 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/42-2.htm">Ezekiel 42:2 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/42-2.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 42:2 Before the length of one hundred cubits (Ezek.
