In the biblical context, false prophets were those who claimed to speak for God but delivered messages that were not from Him. This was a serious offense, as it misled the people and often led them away from true worship. The "hand" of God symbolizes His power and authority to execute judgment. False visions and lying divinations refer to deceptive messages that were either self-generated or influenced by demonic forces. This aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a>, which warns against false prophecy and outlines the criteria for true prophecy.<p><b>They will not belong to the council of My people</b><br>The "council of My people" refers to the assembly or gathering of God's chosen people, Israel. In ancient Israel, councils were places of decision-making and leadership. Being excluded from this council signifies a loss of status and authority. It reflects the seriousness of their offense, as they are no longer considered part of the community that seeks God's guidance. This exclusion is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/1-5.htm">Psalm 1:5</a>, where the wicked will not stand in the congregation of the righteous.<p><b>or be recorded in the register of the house of Israel</b><br>The "register of the house of Israel" likely refers to genealogical records or lists of those who belong to the covenant community. Being erased from this register implies a complete disassociation from the blessings and identity of God's people. This is a severe consequence, as it means losing one's place in the covenant promises. This concept is echoed in <a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32-33</a>, where God speaks of blotting out names from His book.<p><b>nor will they enter the land of Israel</b><br>This phrase indicates a denial of entry into the Promised Land, which was a significant aspect of God's covenant with Israel. The land was a symbol of God's promise and blessing, and being barred from it signifies a loss of inheritance and divine favor. This echoes the punishment of the Israelites in the wilderness, who were denied entry into the land due to their disobedience (<a href="/numbers/14-30.htm">Numbers 14:30</a>).<p><b>Then you will know that I am the Lord GOD.</b><br>This concluding phrase emphasizes the purpose of God's judgment: to affirm His sovereignty and identity as the true God. It serves as a reminder that God's actions, whether in blessing or judgment, reveal His character and authority. This acknowledgment of God as Lord is a recurring theme in Ezekiel, underscoring the importance of recognizing His ultimate authority and the truth of His word. This is consistent with the broader biblical narrative, where God's actions are intended to lead people to a deeper understanding and relationship with Him, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a> and <a href="/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5-6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_prophets.htm">False Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals claiming to speak for God but delivering false visions and lying divinations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_israel.htm">The House of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Israel, God's chosen nation, who are in exile during Ezekiel's time.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_council_of_my_people.htm">The Council of My People</a></b><br>A metaphorical assembly representing those who are truly part of God's covenant community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_israel.htm">The Land of Israel</a></b><br>The promised land given to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, symbolizing God's covenant promises.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_prophecy.htm">Discernment in Prophecy</a></b><br>Believers must exercise discernment to distinguish between true and false prophets.

False prophets were claiming to speak for the LORD while inventing their own messages (<a href="/jeremiah/14-14.htm">Jeremiah 14:14</a>; 23:16). Like the magicians opposing Moses (<a href="/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11-12</a>) and the sorcerer Elymas opposing Paul (<a href="/acts/13-8.htm">Acts 13:8-10</a>), they stood under direct, decisive judgment. The same warning echoes in the New Testament: &#8220;There will be false teachers among you&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>). God&#8217;s people must test every message by Scripture (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will not belong to the council of My people</b><p>The &#8220;council&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/23-18.htm">Jeremiah 23:18, 22</a>) speaks of intimate fellowship and decision-making among God&#8217;s covenant community. To be excluded is to lose voice, influence, and honor. Jesus foreshadows this when He says, &#8220;Depart from Me&#8221; to those who boasted of ministry yet practiced lawlessness (<a href="/matthew/7-22.htm">Matthew 7:22-23</a>).

Likewise, <a href="/revelation/22-15.htm">Revelation 22:15</a> pictures the unrepentant &#8220;outside&#8221; the New Jerusalem. God&#8217;s justice ensures that those who manipulate His word cannot share in His inheritance (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then you will know that I am the Lord GOD</b><p>Every act of judgment or blessing serves this ultimate purpose: the unmistakable revelation of God&#8217;s character and sovereignty (<a href="/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7</a>; 36:23). When the false prophets fall, the remnant will recognize the LORD&#8217;s holiness, truthfulness, and faithfulness. This recognition invites repentance and renewed trust, echoing Paul&#8217;s warning that judgment begins with God&#8217;s household (<a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/13-9.htm">Ezekiel 13:9</a> declares God&#8217;s decisive stance against spiritual fraud. He personally opposes false voices, strips them of influence, erases their standing, excludes them from inheritance, and uses their downfall to reveal His lordship. The passage urges us to prize truth, discern teaching by Scripture, and rest in the certainty that God safeguards His people and His name.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">The assembly of my people.</span>--The original word bears also the meanings placed in the margin, but the sense here is correctly given in the text. The several clauses are intended to emphasise the utter exclusion of the false prophets from the people of God: they shall not be in the congregation; their names shall not be written in the genealogical registers of Israel; they shall not even enter the land when the purified and repentant people should once more return.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mine hand shall be,</span> etc. After Ezekiel's manner, the thought of ver. 6 is repeated in an altered form in vers. 7, 8. What had been a statement appears as a question to which there could be but one answer. The prophet, as it were, cross examines his rivals. Could they deny the charge? Was not every word of it true? Then, after the statement of the sin of the false prophets, comes the proclamation of the punishment. The hand of Jehovah would be upon them for evil and not for good. <span class="cmt_word">In the assembly of my people.</span> The Hebrew word indicates not a large popular gathering, but a secret council of those who deliberate together to carry out their plans (<a href="/psalms/89-7.htm">Psalm 89:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/111-1.htm">Psalm 111:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>). The prophets who had acted together, and been looked up to by the people as forming such a council, should lose that position of authority. The words that follow point to a yet lower degradation. They should be in the strictest sense of the word excommunicated. The city of Jerusalem, perhaps every city of Judah, had its register of citizens. In such a register were inscribed also the names of proselytes of other races (<a href="/psalms/87-6.htm">Psalm 87:6</a>), and so men came to think of a like register as kept by the King of kings, containing the names of those who were heirs of the "life" of the true Israel (<a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>; <a href="/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>). In neither of those registers, the earthly and the heavenly (but stress is probably laid upon the former), shall the false prophets find a place. <a href="/ezra/2-62.htm">Ezra 2:62</a> gives an example of the use made of such registers on the return from the Captivity. One notes the contrast between the "<span class="accented">my</span> people" which recognizes Israel as still the heritage of Jehovah, and the "<span class="accented">thy</span> people" used in <a href="/ezekiel/3-11.htm">Ezekiel 3:11</a> of the rebellious house of the Captivity. For the false prophets there should be no return to the <span class="cmt_word">land of Israel</span> such as that which the prophet anticipated for the faithful and the penitent (<a href="/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21</a>; comp. <a href="/isaiah/57-13.htm">Isaiah 57:13</a>). Here there is no specific mention of the name being struck out. The prophet contemplates a new register, in which their names will never even have appeared. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/13-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">My hand</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
