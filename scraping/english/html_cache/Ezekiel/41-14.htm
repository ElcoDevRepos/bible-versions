This orientation is symbolic of the rising sun, representing new beginnings and the glory of God. The eastward direction is also significant in biblical prophecy and eschatology, as it is often associated with the coming of the Lord (e.g., <a href="/matthew/24-27.htm">Matthew 24:27</a>). The eastern gate of the temple holds particular importance in Ezekiel's vision, as it is the gate through which the glory of the Lord enters (<a href="/ezekiel/43.htm">Ezekiel 43:1-4</a>).<p><b>including the front of the temple</b><br>The front of the temple refers to the entrance area, which is a focal point for worship and sacrifice. In the context of Ezekiel's vision, the temple's front is meticulously measured, emphasizing the order and precision of God's design. This reflects the holiness and sanctity of the temple as the dwelling place of God among His people. The front of the temple is also where significant events occur, such as the presentation of offerings and the gathering of worshippers, highlighting its role as a place of divine encounter.<p><b>was a hundred cubits</b><br>A cubit is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches or 45 centimeters. Therefore, a hundred cubits would be approximately 150 feet or 45 meters. This measurement underscores the grandeur and majesty of the temple structure. The use of precise measurements in Ezekiel's vision signifies God's attention to detail and the perfection of His plans. The number 100, being a complete and rounded figure, may symbolize completeness and divine order. The temple's dimensions reflect its role as a microcosm of God's perfect kingdom, foreshadowing the ultimate fulfillment of God's presence with His people in the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.
