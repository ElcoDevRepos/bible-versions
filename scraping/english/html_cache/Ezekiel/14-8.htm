In biblical terms, God setting His face against someone signifies His disfavor and intent to bring about consequences for disobedience. This is consistent with <a href="/leviticus/20-3.htm">Leviticus 20:3-5</a>, where God sets His face against those who turn to other gods. It reflects the seriousness of idolatry and rebellion against God, emphasizing His holiness and justice.<p><b>and make him a sign and a proverb;</b><br>In ancient cultures, a "sign" and "proverb" often referred to a person or event that became a lesson or warning to others. This phrase suggests that the individual will serve as a cautionary tale, illustrating the consequences of turning away from God. This is similar to the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah, which became proverbial for divine judgment (Genesis 19). It underscores the didactic purpose of God's judgments, teaching His people through the experiences of others.<p><b>I will cut him off from among My people.</b><br>To be "cut off" in the Old Testament often meant death or exile, signifying a complete removal from the community of God's people. This reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where disobedience could lead to severe consequences, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. It highlights the seriousness of maintaining purity and faithfulness within the community, as well as the consequences of failing to do so.<p><b>Then you will know that I am the LORD.</b><br>This phrase is a recurring theme in Ezekiel, emphasizing the recognition of God's sovereignty and authority. It serves as a reminder that God's actions, whether in judgment or blessing, are ultimately to reveal His identity and power. This echoes the purpose of the plagues in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a>), where God's acts were meant to demonstrate His supremacy over all other gods and nations. It points to the ultimate goal of God's dealings with humanity: that they may know and acknowledge Him as the one true God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

class="vheading2">What Does Ezekiel 14:8 Mean</div><b>I will set My face against that man</b><p>When the LORD says He will &#8220;set My face against&#8221; someone, it signals deliberate, personal opposition.<p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10</a> and <a href="/leviticus/20-3.htm">Leviticus 20:3&#8211;6</a> show the same phrase used of those who cling to idolatry; God&#8217;s attention turns from blessing to active resistance.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/34-16.htm">Psalm 34:16</a> echoes, &#8220;The face of the LORD is against those who do evil.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/14.htm">Ezekiel 14</a>, the man has set idols in his heart (v. 3). God therefore responds in kind&#8212;turning His face toward him, not for favor, but for judgment.<p>The refusal to repent brings a relational rupture. Divine love continues, but fellowship is forfeited; the covenant King must defend His holiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and make him a sign and a proverb</b><p>The judged individual becomes a living cautionary tale.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a> foretold that covenant breakers would become &#8220;an object of horror, a proverb, and a byword.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9</a> repeats the warning, and <a href="/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a> reminds believers that Old Testament judgments were &#8220;examples&#8230;written for our admonition.&#8221;<p>God publicizes the consequence so others will choose obedience. The sinner&#8217;s downfall, painful as it is, serves a merciful purpose: it broadcasts the danger of hidden idolatry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will cut him off from among My people</b><p>To be &#8220;cut off&#8221; is to lose covenant privileges&#8212;exclusion from worship, community, and ultimately life itself.<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a>, <a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>, and <a href="/numbers/15-30.htm">Numbers 15:30</a> &#8211; 31 show that stubborn, high-handed sin invited this sentence.<p>&#8226; In Ezekiel&#8217;s day the cutting off included exile and, for many, death (<a href="/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>).<p>The phrase underscores that God&#8217;s people are defined by worshipful allegiance. Persistent idolatry severs the tie. While the faithful remnant remains secure, the unrepentant lose the protection they presumed upon.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then you will know that I am the LORD</b><p>Every act of divine judgment or mercy has this goal: deeper revelation of God&#8217;s character.<p>&#8226; Ezekiel repeats the refrain (6:7; 7:4; 11:10) as a drumbeat&#8212;history is the stage on which God makes Himself unmistakably known.<p>&#8226; When justice falls, survivors grasp both His holiness and His faithfulness (<a href="/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Ultimately, Christ&#8217;s cross and resurrection bring the fullest disclosure (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>).<p>God desires a people who know Him relationally, not merely intellectually; His judgments shake complacency and compel true acknowledgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/14-8.htm">Ezekiel 14:8</a> warns that concealed idolatry invites four escalating outcomes: God&#8217;s personal opposition, public exposure as a cautionary tale, severance from covenant blessings, and an unmistakable revelation of who the LORD is.
