It emphasizes the humanity of the prophet in contrast to the divine nature of God. This title is also significant in the New Testament, where Jesus frequently refers to Himself as the "Son of Man," highlighting His role as the representative human and the fulfillment of messianic prophecy (<a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>).<p><b>&#8220;I am sending you to the Israelites,</b><br>God commissions Ezekiel to be a prophet to the Israelites, who are in exile in Babylon. This mission underscores God's continued relationship with His chosen people despite their disobedience. The sending of prophets is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, as seen with figures like Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>), who were also sent to deliver God's messages.<p><b>to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against Me.</b><br>The Israelites are described as a rebellious nation, highlighting their persistent disobedience and idolatry. This rebellion is a central theme in the history of Israel, as seen in the wilderness wanderings (<a href="/numbers/14-9.htm">Numbers 14:9</a>) and during the period of the judges (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-19</a>). The rebellion against God is not just a historical issue but a spiritual one, reflecting the human tendency to turn away from divine authority.<p><b>To this very day they and their fathers have rebelled against Me.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the continuity of rebellion from past generations to the present. The reference to "their fathers" connects the current generation with the sins of their ancestors, as seen in the repeated cycles of apostasy and repentance throughout Israel's history (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-23</a>). It serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the need for repentance and return to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who commissions Ezekiel to speak to the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, described here as rebellious and having transgressed against God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebellion.htm">Rebellion</a></b><br>The act of defying or resisting authority, in this context, the Israelites' disobedience to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/transgression.htm">Transgression</a></b><br>The violation of a command or law, referring to the Israelites' continuous sin against God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_rebellion.htm">Understanding Rebellion</a></b><br>Recognize that rebellion against God is a recurring theme in Scripture, and it often leads to consequences.

After the captivity of the ten tribes, the two forming the kingdom of Judah, with such remnants of the others as had been induced by Hezekiah and others to cast in their lot with them, are constantly spoken of as "Israel." (See <a href="/ezra/2-2.htm" title="Which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:">Ezra 2:2</a>.) The continuity of the whole nation was considered as preserved in the remnant, and hence this same mode of expression passed into the New Testament. (See <a href="/acts/26-7.htm" title="To which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.">Acts 26:7</a>.) It is only when there is especial occasion to distinguish between the two parts of the nation, as in <a href="/context/ezekiel/4-5.htm" title="For I have laid on you the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shall you bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.">Ezekiel 4:5-6</a>, that the name of Israel is used in contrast with that of Judah.<p><span class= "bld">A rebellious nation.</span>--Literally, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">rebellious nations, </span>the word being the same as that commonly used distinctively for the heathen, so that the children of Israel are here spoken of as "rebellious heathen." There could be no epithet which would carry home more forcibly to the mind of an Israelite the state of antagonism in which he had placed himself against his God. (Comp. the "Lo-ammi" of <a href="/hosea/1-9.htm" title="Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for you are not my people, and I will not be your God.">Hosea 1:9</a>, and also the discourse of our Lord in <a href="/john/8-39.htm" title="They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.">John 8:39</a>.) Yet still, the God from whom they had turned aside was even now sending to them His prophet, and seeking to win them back to His love and obedience, in true correspondence to the vision of the bow in the cloud about the majesty on high. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To a rebellious nation</span>; literally, with Revised Version, <span class="accented">nations that are rebellious.</span> The Hebrew word (<span class="accented">goim</span>) is that used elsewhere for "heathen" and that may be its sense here.
