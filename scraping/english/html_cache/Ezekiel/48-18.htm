The "holy portion" is a designated area set apart for the priests, the temple, and the Levites, emphasizing the centrality of worship and the presence of God among His people. The land "bordering" and "running adjacent" to this holy portion signifies the importance of proximity to the sacred space, reflecting the idea that the closer one is to the divine, the more blessed and significant the land becomes. This allocation underscores the theme of holiness and separation found throughout the book of Ezekiel.<p><b>will be 10,000 cubits on the east side and 10,000 cubits on the west side</b><br>The specific measurement of 10,000 cubits on both the east and west sides indicates a balanced and orderly distribution of land. In biblical terms, the use of precise measurements often symbolizes God's order and sovereignty. The cubit, an ancient unit of length, reflects the historical context of the time, where measurements were based on the length of the forearm. This symmetry in measurement may also symbolize fairness and equality in the distribution of resources among the people, a recurring theme in the prophetic vision of a restored Israel.<p><b>Its produce will supply food for the workers of the city</b><br>This phrase highlights the practical aspect of the land's use, where the produce serves to sustain those who labor in the city. It reflects the biblical principle of provision and stewardship, where the land is not only a spiritual inheritance but also a means of sustenance. The mention of "workers of the city" suggests a community-oriented approach, where the needs of those who serve are met through the resources provided by God. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate provider and sustainer of His people, ensuring that their physical and spiritual needs are met. The emphasis on produce and provision also connects to other scriptural themes of God's faithfulness in providing for His people, as seen in the manna in the wilderness and the feeding of the multitudes in the Gospels.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile who received visions and messages from God concerning the restoration of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_portion.htm">Holy Portion</a></b><br>A designated area set apart for the priests and the temple, symbolizing God's presence and holiness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/workers_of_the_city.htm">Workers of the City</a></b><br>Individuals responsible for maintaining the city, who benefit from the produce of the land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/east_and_west.htm">East and West</a></b><br>Directions indicating the extent of the land's allocation, emphasizing the comprehensive provision for the city.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/produce.htm">Produce</a></b><br>The agricultural yield from the land, intended to sustain those serving the city.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>God ensures that those who serve Him and His people are provided for, as seen in the allocation of land for the workers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_service.htm">Holiness and Service</a></b><br>The proximity of the land to the holy portion signifies the importance of holiness in service.

The verse highlights God&#8217;s precision, the harmonious link between worship and work, and His provision for every role in the restored kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/48.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Shall be for food.--</span>This piece of land, only four times the size of the city itself, would seem a very insufficient provision for raising all the food required for the labourers of the city. But here, as everywhere, it is to be remembered that the description is ideal<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - The remaining portions of the terumah should be two strips of land, each 10,000 &times; 5000 reeds, one on each side of the city, the <span class="cmt_word">increase</span> or produce of which should be <span class="cmt_word">for food unto them that serve the city.</span> By "them that serve the city" Hitzig and Smend understand its ordinary inhabitants, since a district may be said to be cultivated through simple residence upon it (compare <span class="accented">colere locum</span>). Havernick, after Gesenius, thinks of the workmen who should be employed in building the city, against which may be urged that the city is supposed to be already built. Hengstenberg, with whom Plumptre seems disposed to agree, can only see in the city servers "a militia who take the city in the midst." Keil and Kliefoth find them in the laboring classes, who should not in this future state, as so often in ordinary states among men, be destitute of a possession in land, but should receive an allotment for their maintenance. But an obvious objection to this view is that it hands over the city land exclusively to the laboring classes, <span class="accented">forgetting</span> that the "other" classes require support as well as they. Probably the best interpretation is to regard <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, "them that serve the city," as standing in antithesis to the other two classes already mentioned - the Levites, whose office should be to serve the tabernacle (see <a href="/numbers/4-24.htm">Numbers 4:24, 26</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-6.htm">Numbers 18:6</a>, in which <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> is employed to denote the service of the Levites); and the priests, whose special function should be to serve the altar (see <a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>, in which, again, the same verb is used). Thus regarded, "they that serve the city" will mean all engaged in secular pursuits in the city, which approximates to the view of Hitzig; and the prophet's language will signify that all such should derive their sustenance from the city lands, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> should either have direct access to these lands to cultivate them for themselves, or should obtain a share in the produce of these lands for other services rendered to the city. With this accords the further statement that those who served the city should serve it <span class="cmt_word">out of all the tribes of Israel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> its inhabitants should not, as formerly, be drawn chiefly from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, but contain representatives from all the tribes of Israel (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/45-6.htm">Ezekiel 45:6</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/48-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The remainder</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;han&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
