The speaker is likely an angelic guide or the Lord Himself, as seen throughout Ezekiel's visions. This communication underscores the divine origin of the instructions and the importance of the message being conveyed.<p><b>These are the kitchens</b><br>The mention of "kitchens" highlights the practical aspects of temple worship. In the context of the temple, these kitchens were necessary for preparing the sacrificial meals. Archaeological findings in ancient Near Eastern temples often include areas designated for food preparation, supporting the historical accuracy of such details in Ezekiel's vision.<p><b>where those who minister at the temple</b><br>This refers to the Levitical priests, who were set apart for service in the temple. Their duties included offering sacrifices, maintaining the temple, and teaching the law. The role of the priests is central to the worship practices outlined in the Mosaic Law, emphasizing the need for holiness and order in approaching God.<p><b>will cook the sacrifices</b><br>Cooking the sacrifices was part of the ritual process, transforming the offerings into meals that could be consumed. This practice is rooted in the Levitical laws, where certain sacrifices, like peace offerings, were shared between the altar, the priests, and the offerer. It symbolizes fellowship with God and the community.<p><b>offered by the people</b><br>The involvement of the people in offering sacrifices highlights the communal aspect of worship. Sacrifices were a means for the Israelites to atone for sin, express gratitude, and seek fellowship with God. This phrase underscores the participatory nature of worship and the covenant relationship between God and His people.<br><br>This verse, within the broader context of Ezekiel's vision of a restored temple, points to a future hope of renewed worship and relationship with God. It also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfills and transcends the sacrificial system, offering believers direct access to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions and messages from God concerning the future of Israel and the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.

43:6-7).<p>- The phrase reminds us of earlier prophetic encounters such as &#8220;The word of the LORD came to me&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4</a>) and affirms the same divine authority here.<p>- Because the speaker is commissioned by God, what follows is as trustworthy as the Lord&#8217;s earlier instructions about the altar (<a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>) or the tabernacle dimensions (<a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>These are the kitchens</b><p>- In the wider context (<a href="/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19-23</a>), the angel has just shown Ezekiel four large, walled enclosures&#8212;literal facilities within the future temple.<p>- Kitchens signal God&#8217;s practical care: worship includes real food, heat, utensils, and space, echoing Solomon&#8217;s temple where vessels and utensils were specifically listed (<a href="/1_kings/7-48.htm">1 Kings 7:48-50</a>).<p>- Similar cooking courtyards appeared during Josiah&#8217;s Passover, where &#8220;they roasted the Passover animals&#8230;

<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/44-11.htm">Ezekiel 44:11-16</a>).<p>- God ensures they have a dedicated, uncontaminated place to fulfill their duties, preventing the mixture of sacred and common (<a href="/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10</a>).<p>- By giving them their own kitchens, the text upholds the principle that ministry requires provision (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will cook the sacrifices</b><p>- Not every offering was burned entirely; peace offerings, grain offerings, and certain portions were eaten (<a href="/leviticus/6-14.htm">Leviticus 6:14-18</a>; 7:11-17).<p>- Cooking keeps the meat holy until it is consumed, avoiding abuses like those of Eli&#8217;s sons who demanded raw portions (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a>).<p>- Designated kitchens also prevent holy food from being prepared in common areas, maintaining ritual purity (<a href="/ezekiel/46-20.htm">Ezekiel 46:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Offered by the people</b><p>- Worshippers bring their offerings, while priests handle preparation&#8212;showing partnership in worship (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>;

will be holy to the LORD of Hosts&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/14-21.htm">Zechariah 14:21</a>); Ezekiel&#8217;s kitchens anticipate that reality by consecrating everyday cookware for God&#8217;s glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The verse explains a literal set of temple kitchens designed for priestly use.
