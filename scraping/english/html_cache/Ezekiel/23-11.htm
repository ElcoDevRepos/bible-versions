The name means "My tent is in her," symbolizing God's presence in the city. The phrase "saw this" refers to the idolatry and unfaithfulness of Samaria (Oholah), which had already been judged by God. Jerusalem had the opportunity to learn from Samaria's mistakes but failed to do so. This reflects the biblical principle that witnessing the consequences of sin should lead to repentance, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>, where past events serve as warnings.<p><b>yet in her lust and prostitution</b><br>The terms "lust" and "prostitution" are metaphors for idolatry and spiritual unfaithfulness. In the ancient Near Eastern context, idolatry was often associated with literal sexual immorality, as pagan worship included ritualistic sexual acts. The use of these terms underscores the depth of Jerusalem's betrayal against God, who had established a covenant relationship with them. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic writings, such as Hosea, where Israel's idolatry is likened to adultery.<p><b>she was more depraved than her sister</b><br>Despite witnessing Samaria's downfall, Jerusalem's actions were even more corrupt. This highlights the progressive nature of sin and the hardening of the heart when warnings are ignored. Historically, Jerusalem engaged in alliances and idolatries that were more extensive and egregious than those of Samaria. Theologically, this serves as a warning about the dangers of complacency and the false security of being God's chosen people. It also foreshadows the coming judgment upon Jerusalem, as prophesied in Ezekiel and fulfilled in the Babylonian exile. This phrase emphasizes the need for genuine repentance and the consequences of spiritual infidelity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/oholibah.htm">Oholibah</a></b><br>Symbolic name for Jerusalem, representing the Southern Kingdom of Judah.
