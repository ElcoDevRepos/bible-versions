The actions of the Israelites are not just violations of law but are seen as direct offenses against God Himself. This reflects the covenant relationship where God is not just a distant deity but one who is personally involved with His people. The use of "Me" underscores the personal nature of the sin, similar to how David acknowledges his sin against God in <a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>.<p><b>On that very same day:</b><br>The immediacy of the actions highlights the severity and audacity of the sin. It suggests a deliberate and conscious choice to sin against God, showing a hardened heart. This phrase can be connected to the idea of "today" in <a href="/hebrews/3-15.htm">Hebrews 3:15</a>, which warns against hardening one's heart. The timing also suggests a lack of repentance or awareness of the gravity of their actions.<p><b>they defiled My sanctuary:</b><br>The sanctuary, or temple, was the dwelling place of God among His people, representing His holiness and presence. To defile it was to show utter disrespect for God's holiness. Historically, this could refer to the introduction of idolatry or pagan practices within the temple, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/21-4.htm">2 Kings 21:4-5</a> with Manasseh's reign. The defilement of the sanctuary is a recurring theme in Ezekiel, symbolizing the spiritual corruption of the people.<p><b>and profaned My Sabbaths:</b><br>The Sabbath was a sign of the covenant between God and Israel, a day set apart for rest and worship. Profaning the Sabbath indicates a rejection of God's order and a failure to honor Him. This connects to the broader biblical theme of rest and trust in God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a> and <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>.
