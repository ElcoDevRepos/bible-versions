The "she" refers to Oholibah, symbolizing Jerusalem, as introduced earlier in the chapter. The defilement indicates spiritual adultery, where Jerusalem has turned away from God to pursue idolatry and alliances with pagan nations. This reflects the broader biblical theme of Israel's unfaithfulness, akin to a wife being unfaithful to her husband, as seen in <a href="/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1-3</a>. The defilement is not just a physical act but a spiritual corruption, highlighting the gravity of idolatry in the eyes of God.<p><b>both of them had taken the same path.</b><br>The "both" refers to Oholah and Oholibah, representing Samaria and Jerusalem, respectively. Both cities, and by extension the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, have engaged in similar sinful behaviors, despite their distinct histories. This phrase underscores the shared guilt and the repeated pattern of sin among God's people. Historically, both kingdoms sought political alliances with foreign powers like Assyria and Egypt, which often involved adopting their religious practices. This path of idolatry and reliance on human strength rather than God is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-2</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>. The phrase serves as a warning against the dangers of forsaking God's covenant and the inevitable consequences of such actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
