The repetition of "the word of the LORD" emphasizes the authority and divine origin of the message. In the context of Ezekiel, this phrase is a common introduction to prophetic revelations, underscoring the role of Ezekiel as a mouthpiece for God. The phrase "came to me" suggests a personal and direct encounter with God, highlighting the intimate relationship between the prophet and the divine. This is consistent with other prophetic books where God speaks directly to His chosen messengers, such as <a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4</a> and <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>. The use of "saying" introduces the specific message that follows, preparing the reader for the divine instructions or revelations that are to be delivered.

Mean</div><b>Again</b><p>- The verse opens with the simple word &#8220;Again,&#8221; reminding us that God speaks repeatedly and faithfully. Ezekiel has already received many oracles, and the Lord adds another one&#8212;not because He was unclear before, but because He keeps pursuing His people (<a href="/jeremiah/13-3.htm">Jeremiah 13:3</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>).<p>- Scripture often shows God returning to His servants with fresh words at critical moments (<a href="/jonah/3-1.htm">Jonah 3:1</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1</a>). This repetition underlines His patience and persistence.<p>- For us, &#8220;Again&#8221; assures that divine revelation is not a one-time event; God continues to guide, correct, and encourage (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the word of the LORD</b><p>- This phrase marks the message as coming straight from the Almighty, carrying absolute authority (<a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>).<p>- &#8220;Word&#8221; points to both God&#8217;s spoken directives and the written Scriptures that record them (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).<p>- Because it is the LORD&#8217;s word, it is flawless, binding, and life-giving (<a href="/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>). We can trust every syllable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>came to me</b><p>- Ezekiel stresses that he personally received the message. God engages real people in real history (<a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-2.htm">Jeremiah 1:2</a>).<p>- The verb &#8220;came&#8221; indicates initiative from God, not human effort. Ezekiel didn&#8217;t manufacture a prophecy; he received one (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p>- The personal encounter highlights intimacy: God reaches individual hearts before addressing the wider audience (<a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying</b><p>- The Lord&#8217;s word is not abstract; it communicates specific content. God speaks so His people know exactly what He means (<a href="/exodus/4-12.htm">Exodus 4:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a>).<p>- This single word introduces a fresh proclamation that follows in verses 17&#8211;38, promising both judgment and restoration.<p>- It underscores that revelation is meant to be shared faithfully; the prophet must relay it word-for-word (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/36-16.htm">Ezekiel 36:16</a>, &#8220;Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,&#8221; is more than a narrative bridge. Each phrase reinforces core truths: God persistently reveals Himself, His word bears supreme authority, He entrusts that word to chosen servants, and He always speaks with purpose. The verse sets the stage for the sweeping promise of national cleansing and renewal that follows, reminding us that every divine utterance&#8212;no matter how brief&#8212;carries eternal weight and invites wholehearted trust.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - The oracle, commencing with this verse and extending to <a href="/ezekiel/37-14.htm">Ezekiel 37:14</a>, has an ultimate connection with that which precedes.
