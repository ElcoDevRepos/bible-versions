Historically, Israel often strayed by adopting the idolatrous practices of surrounding nations, which led to their spiritual and physical downfall. The prophets frequently called Israel to repentance, emphasizing the covenant relationship established at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). The imagery of straying is akin to a sheep wandering from its shepherd, a theme echoed in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> and later in Jesus' parable of the lost sheep (<a href="/luke/15-3.htm">Luke 15:3-7</a>).<p><b>and no longer defile themselves with all their transgressions</b><br>Defilement here refers to the spiritual impurity resulting from sin, particularly idolatry, which was rampant in Israel. The Law given through Moses outlined specific practices that would defile the people, and the prophets, including Ezekiel, called for purification and repentance (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-30</a>). This defilement is not just ritual but moral, affecting the nation's relationship with God. The New Testament continues this theme, urging believers to live holy lives (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p><b>Then they will be My people and I will be their God</b><br>This covenantal language is central to the relationship between God and Israel, first articulated in <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a> with Abraham and reiterated throughout the Old Testament. It signifies a mutual commitment: God as protector and provider, and Israel as a nation set apart for His purposes. This promise finds its ultimate fulfillment in the New Covenant through Jesus Christ, where believers are grafted into this relationship (<a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-24</a>), and <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a> envisions its complete realization.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The use of "declares the Lord GOD" underscores the authority and certainty of the message. In Hebrew, "Adonai Yahweh" emphasizes both the sovereignty and the personal nature of God. This declaration is a divine assurance that God's purposes will be accomplished, reflecting His unchanging nature and faithfulness (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).

The phrase reminds us that God&#8217;s covenant dealings are specific: He speaks to real people in real history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>May no longer stray from Me</b><p>Straying pictures sheep wandering from their shepherd. Israel&#8217;s idolatry prompted exile (<a href="/2_kings/17-15.htm">2 Kings 17:15</a>).

The course of thought is this: If any land should sin as grievously as Israel had done, and God should send a judgment, it would not be spared, though Noah, Daniel and Job were in it. This is repeated in connection with each one of four successively mentioned judgments; and then the climax is reached, that much less can Jerusalem be spared when all these judgments are combined together. In the end, the justice of the Divine dealings shall be acknowledged.<p>A few years earlier, Jeremiah (Jeremiah 14, 15) had uttered a very similar prophecy in connection with the denunciation of false prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/14-13.htm" title="Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say to them, You shall not see the sword, neither shall you have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.">Jeremiah 14:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-15.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.">Jeremiah 14:15</a>) in which not only he himself is forbidden to intercede for the people <a href="/jeremiah/14-11.htm" title="Then said the LORD to me, Pray not for this people for their good.">Jeremiah 14:11</a>), but it is said (<a href="/jeremiah/15-1.htm" title="Then said the LORD to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.">Jeremiah 15:1</a>) that the presence of Moses and Samuel would be unavailing. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - The words come as a gleam of light through the darkness.
