The "whirlwind" is often associated with God's presence and power, as seen in <a href="/job/38.htm">Job 38:1</a> and <a href="/2_kings/2.htm">2 Kings 2:1</a>. The direction "from the north" is significant; in biblical times, the north was often seen as the direction from which divine judgment or significant events would come, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>. This could symbolize impending judgment on Jerusalem, as Babylon, the instrument of God's judgment, lay to the north of Israel.<p><b>a great cloud with fire flashing back and forth</b><br>The "great cloud" is a common biblical symbol of God's glory and presence, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a> and <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>. The "fire flashing back and forth" suggests the intensity and dynamic nature of God's presence. Fire is a frequent biblical symbol of purification and judgment, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a> and <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>. This imagery underscores the holiness and consuming nature of God.<p><b>and brilliant light all around it</b><br>The "brilliant light" signifies the glory and majesty of God, often described as unapproachable light in <a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>. This light represents divine revelation and truth, illuminating the darkness of human understanding. It also connects to the Shekinah glory, the visible manifestation of God's presence, as seen in <a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>.<p><b>In the center of the fire was a gleam like amber</b><br>The "center of the fire" suggests the heart of God's presence, where His essence and glory are most intense. "Amber" is a translation of the Hebrew word "chashmal," which is often understood as a glowing metal or electrum, a natural alloy of gold and silver. This gleam represents the purity and preciousness of God's nature. The imagery of precious metals is often used in scripture to describe divine attributes, as seen in <a href="/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>. This vision of divine glory foreshadows the ultimate revelation of God in Jesus Christ, who is described as the radiance of God's glory in <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of this vision.

The vision is actually seen in Chaldaea, but it has reference to Jerusalem, and is described as if viewed from that standpoint.<p><span class= "bld">A great cloud.</span>--As in the Divine manifestation on Sinai (<a href="/context/exodus/19-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, See, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to the LORD.">Exodus 19:9-16</a>). The cloud serves at once as the groundwork for all the other details of the manifestation--a place in, and by means of which, all are located, and also as a hiding-place of the Divine majesty, so that all may be seen which human eye can bear, and that which it cannot bear may yet be known to be there, shrouded in the cloud. The transposition of a single letter from the end of one word in the Hebrew to the beginning of the next will change the reading to "a whirlwind out of the north brought on a great cloud." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A whirlwind came out of the north</span>. What, we ask, was the meaning of this symbolism? In <a href="/jeremiah/1-13.htm">Jeremiah 1:13, 14</a> a like symbol is explained as meaning that the judgments which Judah was to suffer were to come from the north, that is, from Chaldea, upon the prophet's countrymen. Here the prophet is himself in Chaldea, and what he sees is the symbol, not or calamities, but of the Divine glory, and that explanation is, accordingly, inapplicable. Probably the leading thought here is that the Divine presence is no longer in the temple at Jerusalem, It may return for a time to execute judgment (<a href="/ezekiel/8-4.htm">Ezekiel 8:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1, 19, 20</a>), and may again depart (<a href="/ezekiel/11-23.htm">Ezekiel 11:23</a>), but the abiding glory is elsewhere, and the temple is as Shitoh had been of old (<a href="/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60</a>). Ezekiel was looking on the visible symbol of what had been declared in unfigurative language by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12, 14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-6.htm">Jeremiah 26:6, 9</a>). That the north should have been chosen rather than any other quarter of the heavens is perhaps connected <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> with <a href="/job/37-22.htm">Job 37:22</a>, where it appears as the region of "fair weather," the unclouded brightness of the "terrible majesty" of God; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> with <a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>, where "the sides of the north" are the symbols of the dwelling place of God. For the Jews this was probably associated with the thought of the mountain heights of Lebanon as rising up to heaven (Currey, on <a href="/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a>, in 'Speaker's Commentary'), or with the fact that the "north side" of Zion (<a href="/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>), as the site of the temple, was the "dwelling place of the great King." Parallels present themselves in the Assyrian hymns that speak of the "feasts of the silver mountains, the heavenly courts" (as the Greeks spoke of Olympus), "where the gods dwell eternally" ('Records of the Past,' 3:133), and this ideal mountain was for them, like the Meru of Indian legend, in the farthest north. So, in the legendary geography of Greece, the Hyperborei, or "people beyond the north," were a holy and blessed race, the chosen servants of Apollo (Herod., 4:32-36: Pindar, 'Pyth.,' 10:4; AEsch., 'Choeph.,' 373). Possibly the brilliant coruscations of an Aurora Borealis may have led men to think of it as they thought of the glory of the dawn or the brightne<span class="accented">ss</span> of the lightning, as a momentary revelation of the higher glory of the throne of God. (For the "whirlwind" as the accompaniment of a Divine revelation, see <a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>; <a href="/job/38-1.htm">Job 38:1</a>; <a href="/acts/2-2.htm">Acts 2:2</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">A great cloud,</span> etc. So far the signs of the approaching theophany were like those on Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16, 18</a>) and Horeb (<a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With a fire infolding itself;</span> the Revised Version margin gives <span class="accented">flashing continually.</span> The Authorized Version suggests the thought of a globe of fire darting its rays through the surrounding darkness. <span class="cmt_word">The colour of amber;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the eye.</span> The Hebrew word for "amber" (chashmal) occurs only here and in ver. 27 and ch. 8:2. It is almost absolutely certain that it does not mean what we know as "amber." The LXX. and Vulgate give <span class="accented">electrum</span>, and this, in later Greek and Latin authors, has "amber" for one of its meanings. Primarily, however, it was used for a metallic substance of some kind, specifically for a compound four parts of gold and one of silver (Pithy, 'Hist. Nat.,' 23:4, s. 23). Some such compound is probably what we have to think of here, and so the description finds a parallel in <a href="/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>. This, in its ineffable brightness, is seen in the centre of the globe of fire. One may compare Dante's vision of the Divine glory ('Paradise,' 33:55). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I looked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1441;&#1512;&#1462;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;re)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
