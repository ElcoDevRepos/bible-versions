Sodom is infamous for its destruction due to wickedness (Genesis 19), and Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, known for idolatry and rebellion against God (<a href="/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>). The term "daughters" signifies the smaller towns or communities associated with these cities. The use of "sisters" highlights the shared guilt and judgment among these cities and Jerusalem, which is the primary subject of Ezekiel's prophecy. This phrase underscores the theme of collective sin and the consequences that follow.<p><b>will return to their former state.</b><br>This phrase suggests a restoration or return to a previous condition. In the context of biblical prophecy, it can imply both a physical and spiritual restoration. For Sodom, this is a challenging concept, as the city was utterly destroyed. However, it may symbolize a future hope or metaphorical restoration. For Samaria, it could mean a return from exile or a spiritual renewal. Theologically, this points to God's mercy and the possibility of redemption, even for those who have fallen far from His grace. It also foreshadows the ultimate restoration of all things in the eschatological future, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11-12</a> and <a href="/acts/3-21.htm">Acts 3:21</a>.<p><b>You and your daughters will also return to your former state.</b><br>Here, "you" refers to Jerusalem and "your daughters" to the surrounding towns or people of Judah. The promise of returning to a "former state" can be seen as a message of hope and restoration for Jerusalem, despite its current state of judgment and exile. Historically, this was partially fulfilled when the Jewish exiles returned from Babylonian captivity (<a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>). Spiritually, it points to the broader theme of repentance and restoration found throughout Scripture, where God promises to restore His people if they turn back to Him (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). This also connects to the New Testament theme of spiritual renewal through Christ, who offers redemption and restoration to all who believe (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the exiles in Babylon.

The &#8220;daughters&#8221; are the smaller towns once linked to Sodom (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>). By calling them sisters, the Lord reminds Jerusalem that infamous Sodom&#8217;s sin (<a href="/ezekiel/16-49.htm">Ezekiel 16:49&#8211;50</a>) now mirrors her own. Even Jesus later cites Sodom to warn of judgment and mercy (<a href="/matthew/11-23.htm">Matthew 11:23&#8211;24</a>; <a href="/luke/17-28.htm">Luke 17:28&#8211;29</a>).<p>&#8226;The shocking comparison forces Judah to see herself plainly.<p>&#8226;If God judged Sodom, Judah cannot presume immunity (<a href="/2_peter/2-6.htm">2 Peter 2:6</a>).<p>&#8226;Yet the mention of Sodom sets up an unexpected note of future grace, anticipating <a href="/ezekiel/16-60.htm">Ezekiel 16:60&#8211;63</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Samaria with her daughters</b><p>Samaria, capital of the northern kingdom, fell to Assyria in 722 BC (<a href="/bsb/2_kings/17.htm">2 Kings 17</a>). Her &#8220;daughters&#8221; are the surrounding settlements. Like Jerusalem, Samaria had once enjoyed covenant privileges but turned to idolatry (<a href="/hosea/8-5.htm">Hosea 8:5&#8211;6</a>). Ezekiel has already called the two capitals &#8220;Oholah&#8221; and &#8220;Oholibah,&#8221; adulterous sisters (<a href="/bsb/ezekiel/23.htm">Ezekiel 23</a>). The Lord&#8217;s reminder here presses home that Jerusalem&#8217;s religious heritage did not spare her any more than it spared Samaria.<p>&#8226;Samaria&#8217;s downfall is a warning (<a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6&#8211;11</a>), yet God still speaks of her future.<p>&#8226;His dealings with Israel&#8217;s divided kingdoms reveal both impartial judgment and unchanging covenant love (<a href="/amos/9-8.htm">Amos 9:8&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will return to their former state</b><p>The promise that Sodom and Samaria &#8220;will return to their former state&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/16-55.htm">Ezekiel 16:55</a>) sounds almost unbelievable after total devastation. Taking the words at face value:<p>&#8226;&#8220;Former state&#8221; looks back to a time before judgment, when each region enjoyed settled life. In keeping with <a href="/ezekiel/16-53.htm">Ezekiel 16:53&#8211;54</a>, God intends to reverse captivity and ruin.<p>&#8226;Scripture often pairs judgment with restoration: compare Moab in <a href="/jeremiah/48-47.htm">Jeremiah 48:47</a> and Elam in <a href="/jeremiah/49-39.htm">Jeremiah 49:39</a>.<p>&#8226;In the larger prophetic canvas, the land south of the Dead Sea (Sodom&#8217;s region) and the hills of Samaria are included in future blessing when Messiah reigns (<a href="/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/47-8.htm">Ezekiel 47:8&#8211;12</a>).<p>Thus the verse underscores both God&#8217;s power to rebuild hopeless ruins and His determination to vindicate His own holiness by showing mercy where none is expected.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You and your daughters will also return to your former state</b><p>Jerusalem, the primary addressee, will share in that same restoration. Ezekiel has already promised that the exiles will come home (<a href="/ezekiel/11-17.htm">Ezekiel 11:17</a>; 36:24). Here the Spirit links Judah&#8217;s return with the return of her &#8220;sisters,&#8221; making three clear points:<p>&#8226;Restoration is entirely God&#8217;s gift&#8212;Jerusalem cannot claim superior merit (<a href="/romans/11-32.htm">Romans 11:32</a>).<p>&#8226;The Lord&#8217;s final plan gathers and reconciles, healing old rivalries between north and south (<a href="/ezekiel/37-15.htm">Ezekiel 37:15&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226;When Judah is restored, she will remember her sin, loathe it, and never open her mouth in pride again (<a href="/ezekiel/16-61.htm">Ezekiel 16:61&#8211;63</a>). Grace produces humble gratitude.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/16-55.htm">Ezekiel 16:55</a> announces a surprising, sweeping restoration: the notorious ruins of Sodom, the fallen capital of Samaria, and devastated Jerusalem itself will all be brought back to life by the same gracious hand that once judged them. The verse showcases God&#8217;s fidelity to His covenant, His authority over nations and geography, and His purpose to humble pride so that mercy, not merit, gets the last word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 55.</span> - Read <span class="accented">and</span> for <span class="cmt_word">when</span>, as in ver. 53. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/16-55.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And your sisters,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1463;&#1431;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;a&#183;yi&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
