Unlike other prophets, such as Jonah who was sent to Nineveh, Ezekiel's audience is his own people, the Israelites. The language barrier is not an issue, indicating that the challenge lies not in communication but in the people's receptiveness. This underscores the spiritual stubbornness of Israel, as they are familiar with God's laws and messages but choose to ignore them. The reference to "unfamiliar speech" can also be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual distance between God and His people, despite their shared language and heritage.<p><b>but to the house of Israel&#8212;</b><br>The "house of Israel" refers to the collective nation, emphasizing their identity as God's chosen people. Historically, this period is during the Babylonian exile, a time of great turmoil and identity crisis for the Israelites. Ezekiel's role is to remind them of their covenant with God and call them to repentance. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of Israel's repeated cycles of rebellion and redemption. Theologically, it points to the persistent love and patience of God, who continues to reach out to His people despite their disobedience. This mission foreshadows the ultimate reconciliation through Jesus Christ, who is sent to the "lost sheep of Israel" (<a href="/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>) and ultimately to all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_israel.htm">House of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Israel, God's chosen nation, who were in exile due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, a significant event in Israel's history that shaped much of the prophetic literature.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_audience.htm">Understanding Our Audience</a></b><br>Just as Ezekiel was sent to his own people, we are often called to minister to those within our own communities.

Ezekiel will speak to those who share his vocabulary, idioms, and thought patterns.<p>&#8226; Contrast Jonah, who struggled with preaching in Nineveh, a foreign context (<a href="/jonah/1-2.htm">Jonah 1:2</a>).<p>&#8226; At Pentecost, God bridged language barriers supernaturally (<a href="/acts/2-6.htm">Acts 2:6&#8211;8</a>), but here no such barrier exists.<p>Removing linguistic hurdles means Israel cannot claim, &#8220;We didn&#8217;t understand what you were saying.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or difficult language</b><p>The Lord eliminates another excuse: complexity. Ezekiel isn&#8217;t wrestling with syntax or dialects that could muddle the message.<p>&#8226; Paul pursued the same clarity: &#8220;I would rather speak five coherent words to instruct others&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-19.htm">1 Corinthians 14:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Moses worried about eloquence (<a href="/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10</a>), yet God assured him the message&#8217;s power lies in divine truth, not verbal polish.<p>Israel will hear God&#8217;s warning in plain, accessible terms.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but to the house of Israel&#8212;</b><p>The audience is covenant people who already possess God&#8217;s law and prophets (<a href="/romans/3-1.htm">Romans 3:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Hosea was sent to call an unfaithful Israel back to covenant love (<a href="/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus wept over Jerusalem for its hardness of heart despite unparalleled privilege (<a href="/luke/13-34.htm">Luke 13:34</a>).<p>Ezekiel&#8217;s mission spotlights responsibility: greater knowledge brings greater accountability (<a href="/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47-48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/3-5.htm">Ezekiel 3:5</a> underscores that God sends His prophet to a familiar, covenant community so the blame for rejection cannot rest on language barriers or cultural confusion.

Similar facts are continually encountered in the Scriptures, whether in its histories, as in those of Naaman the Syrian, of the faith of the Syro-Ph?nician woman (<a href="/context/matthew/15-21.htm" title="Then Jesus went there, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.">Matthew 15:21-28</a>), and of the Roman centurion (<a href="/context/matthew/8-10.htm" title="When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to them that followed, Truly I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.">Matthew 8:10-12</a>), or in the express declarations of our Lord that the teaching and signs given to Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum in vain would have been more than sufficient for the conversion of Tyre, or Sidon, or even of Sodom (<a href="/matthew/11-21.htm" title="Woe to you, Chorazin! woe to you, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.">Matthew 11:21</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-23.htm" title="And you, Capernaum, which are exalted to heaven, shall be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in you, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.">Matthew 11:23</a>; <a href="/context/matthew/12-41.htm" title="The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.">Matthew 12:41-42</a>). If it be asked, Why then should so much of the Divine compassion be expended upon a nation which so generally refused to avail itself of its blessings? the answer must be that only thus could even a few be raised at all above the very lowest spiritual plane, and that the raising of these few leads ultimately to the elevation of many. As an accountable being, man must be left free to neglect the proffered grace; and, as in the case of the Israelites to whom Ezekiel was sent, there would always be many who choose to do so. The consequence of this neglect must be such a hardening of the heart as was now shown by these people, and every man is warned by their example of the responsibility attached to the enjoyment of religious privilege. But the same thing would have happened with any other nation; and that God's faithfulness should not fail, and that His purposes for man's salvation should be accomplished, more grace must yet be given and His people must still be pleaded with, that at least a remnant of them might be led to repentance and be saved from the impending ruin. Theodoret calls attention to the contrast between the restriction of the grace of the Old Dispensation to a single people, and the universal diffusion of the preaching of the Gospel. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of a strange speech and of a hard language</span>, etc.; literally, as in margin, both of Authorized Version and Revised Version, <span class="accented">to a people deep of lip and heavy of tongue</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to a barbarous people outside the covenant, Chaldeans, Assyrians, Scythians: not speaking the familiar sacred speech of Israel (compare the "stammering lips and another tongue" of <a href="/isaiah/28-11.htm">Isaiah 28:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-19.htm">Isaiah 33:19</a>). The thought implied is that Ezekiel's mission, as to "the lost sheep of the house of Israel" (<a href="/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>), was outwardly easier than if he had been sent to the heathen. With Israel there was at least the medium of a speech common both to the prophet and his hearers.
