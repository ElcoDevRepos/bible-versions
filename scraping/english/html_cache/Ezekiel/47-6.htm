The question "do you see this?" invites Ezekiel to pay close attention to the vision, highlighting its significance. This vision is part of a larger prophetic revelation concerning the future restoration and blessing of Israel. The phrase underscores the importance of spiritual perception and understanding, a theme prevalent in prophetic literature. It echoes similar divine inquiries in Scripture, such as God's questions to Job, which are designed to provoke reflection and insight.<p><b>he asked.</b><br>The speaker is the angelic guide who has been leading Ezekiel through the vision. This guide functions as a divine messenger, providing clarity and interpretation of the vision. The presence of an angelic interpreter is common in apocalyptic literature, as seen in the books of Daniel and Revelation, where heavenly beings often explain visions to the prophets. This interaction emphasizes the need for divine assistance in understanding God's revelations.<p><b>Then he led me back to the bank of the river.</b><br>The river in this vision flows from the temple, symbolizing life, healing, and the presence of God. Being led back to the riverbank suggests a return to a place of observation and reflection. The river's source in the temple connects it to the idea of God's blessings flowing from His presence, reminiscent of the rivers in Eden (<a href="/genesis/2-10.htm">Genesis 2:10</a>) and the river of life in <a href="/revelation/22.htm">Revelation 22:1-2</a>. This imagery points to the eschatological hope of restoration and renewal, where God's life-giving presence transforms creation.

The word <span class= "ital">brink</span> in this verse and <span class= "ital">bank</span> in the next are the same in the original. The prophet does not <span class= "ital">return</span> to the brink, for he had not left it, but is told to pass <span class= "ital">along</span> it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then he... caused me to return to the brink of the river</span>. The difficulty lying in the word "return" has given rise to a variety of conjectures. Hengstenberg supposes the prophet had made trial of the river's depth by wading in (perhaps up to the neck), and that the angel caused him to return from the stream to the bank According to Hitzig, the measuring had taken place at some distance from the stream, and the prophet, having come up to his guide from the bank after making trial of the water's depth, was Once more conducted back to the river's brink. Havernick conceives the sense to be that the prophet, having accompanied the angel to the point where the stream debouched into the Dead Sea was led back to the riverbank. All difficulty, however, vanishes if, either with Schroder we refer <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> to a mental returning, as if the import were that the angel, having ascertained that the prophet had "seen" the river's course, now told him to direct his attention to the bank, or, with Keil and Kliefoth, translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> by "along" or "on" rather than "to." As the prophet had been led along or on the river's bank to see the increasing breadth and depth of the water, so was he now "caused to return" along or on the same bank to note the abundance of the foliage with which it was adorned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Do you see this,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;en-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of man?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he asked.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Then he led me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1460;&#1499;&#1461;&#1445;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#183;li&#183;&#7733;&#234;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">back</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1461;&#1430;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#353;i&#183;&#7687;&#234;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the bank</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1508;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#601;&#183;p&#772;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8193.htm">Strong's 8193: </a> </span><span class="str2">The lip, language, a margin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the river.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7717;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5158.htm">Strong's 5158: </a> </span><span class="str2">A stream, a winter torrent, a, valley, a shaft</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Ezekiel 47:6 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Ezekiel 47:6 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Ezekiel 47:6 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Ezekiel 47:6 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Ezekiel 47:6 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Ezekiel 47:6  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Ezekiel 47:6 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Ezekiel 47:6 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Ezekiel 47:6 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Ezekiel 47:6 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/47-6.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 47:6 He said to me Son of man (Ezek.
