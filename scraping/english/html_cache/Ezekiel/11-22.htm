In Ezekiel's vision, they are depicted as having a significant role in the divine chariot, symbolizing God's mobility and sovereignty. The wheels beside them suggest a complex and dynamic structure, indicating God's ability to move and act throughout the earth. This imagery connects to <a href="/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>, where the prophet first describes the vision of the living creatures and the wheels, emphasizing God's omnipresence and omnipotence.<p><b>spread their wings,</b><br>The spreading of wings signifies readiness for movement and action. In biblical symbolism, wings often represent protection and divine intervention. The cherubim's action here indicates a transition or a significant shift in God's dealings with His people. This movement can be seen as a prelude to God's departure from the temple, highlighting the seriousness of Israel's sin and the impending judgment.<p><b>and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.</b><br>The glory of God, often referred to as the Shekinah, represents His manifest presence. In the Old Testament, God's glory filled the tabernacle and later the temple, signifying His dwelling among His people. Here, the glory being above the cherubim suggests a departure from the temple, as described in the broader context of <a href="/ezekiel/10.htm">Ezekiel 10 and 11</a>. This departure is a profound moment, indicating God's judgment on Jerusalem due to their persistent idolatry and rebellion. Theologically, it foreshadows the eventual return of God's glory in the person of Jesus Christ, who embodies the fullness of God's presence among humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings often associated with the presence and glory of God.
