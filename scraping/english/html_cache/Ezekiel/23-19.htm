In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/23.htm">Ezekiel 23</a>, the allegory of two sisters, Oholah and Oholibah, represents the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Their promiscuity symbolizes idolatry and unfaithfulness to God. The multiplication of promiscuity suggests a deepening of their spiritual adultery, as they increasingly turned to foreign alliances and pagan worship, contrary to the covenant relationship with Yahweh. This reflects the persistent nature of sin and the tendency to become more entrenched in rebellion against God.<p><b>remembering the days of her youth</b><br>This phrase points to a recollection of past behaviors and experiences. In the context of Israel and Judah, it refers to their early history and initial unfaithfulness to God. The "days of her youth" alludes to the time when the Israelites were in Egypt, where they were first exposed to idolatry and pagan practices. This remembrance is not a nostalgic longing for innocence but a return to former sinful ways. It highlights the danger of looking back to past sins with desire, rather than learning from them and moving forward in faithfulness to God.<p><b>when she had prostituted herself in the land of Egypt</b><br>This phrase explicitly connects the current unfaithfulness of Israel and Judah to their historical idolatry in Egypt. The metaphor of prostitution is used throughout the Bible to describe spiritual unfaithfulness and idolatry. In Egypt, the Israelites were influenced by the surrounding culture and its gods, which led to their initial spiritual corruption. This historical context underscores the persistent struggle of God's people to remain distinct and faithful amidst pagan influences. It serves as a warning against returning to former sins and highlights the need for repentance and renewal in the covenant relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/oholibah.htm">Oholibah (Jerusalem)</a></b><br>In <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/23.htm">Ezekiel 23</a>, Oholibah represents Jerusalem.
