This command to "hear the word of the Lord GOD" signifies a divine message of judgment. The Ammonites are being directly addressed by God, indicating the seriousness of their actions and the impending consequences. This reflects the prophetic tradition where God communicates His will through prophets to nations, both Israelite and foreign.<p><b>for this is what the Lord GOD says:</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority and certainty of the message. It is not merely a human opinion but a divine decree. The repetition of "Lord GOD" emphasizes God's sovereignty and His role as the ultimate judge over all nations, not just Israel.<p><b>&#8216;Because you exclaimed, &#8220;Aha!&#8221;</b><br>The exclamation "Aha!" is an expression of malicious joy or gloating over another's misfortune. This reaction from the Ammonites reveals their enmity and lack of compassion towards Israel. Biblically, such attitudes are condemned, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17-18</a>, which warns against rejoicing at an enemy's downfall.<p><b>when My sanctuary was profaned,</b><br>The profaning of the sanctuary refers to the desecration of the Temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship and symbol of God's presence among His people. This event was a significant calamity for Israel, and the Ammonites' reaction to it highlights their disrespect for what was sacred to God. The Temple's destruction is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, symbolizing judgment and the need for repentance.<p><b>when the land of Israel was laid waste,</b><br>The devastation of the land of Israel was a result of military conquest and divine judgment due to the nation's sins. This phrase indicates the complete desolation and suffering experienced by the Israelites. The land, promised to Abraham and his descendants, being laid waste, signifies a temporary withdrawal of God's blessing and protection.<p><b>and when the house of Judah went into exile,</b><br>The exile of Judah was a pivotal event in Israel's history, marking the loss of national identity and autonomy. It fulfilled prophecies of judgment for disobedience, such as those found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The exile also set the stage for future restoration and the coming of the Messiah, who would ultimately fulfill God's promises to His people. The Ammonites' gloating over Judah's exile further illustrates their antagonism and lack of empathy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A group of people descended from Lot, living east of the Jordan River.

The Ammonites&#8217; gleeful taunts against Judah&#8217;s sorrow provoked divine judgment, teaching that no nation may revel in another&#8217;s downfall without facing the LORD&#8217;s righteous response. God&#8217;s Word stands true: He disciplines His own, but He also defends them, ensuring that mockers receive justice and the covenant story moves forward to ultimate restoration.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/25-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1469;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
