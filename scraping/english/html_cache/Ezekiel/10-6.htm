Linen garments were typically worn by priests (<a href="/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39-42</a>), signifying holiness and service to God. This figure is tasked with carrying out divine commands, indicating a role of significant authority and responsibility. The LORD's command underscores His sovereignty and the execution of His divine will.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Take fire from within the wheelwork, from among the cherubim,&#8221;</b><br>The "wheelwork" refers to the complex vision of the chariot-throne of God described in <a href="/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>, where wheels are associated with the cherubim, symbolizing God's omnipresence and mobility. Fire often represents God's judgment and purification (<a href="/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6-7</a>). The cherubim are angelic beings that guard the holiness of God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a> and <a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>. This command to take fire suggests an impending act of judgment, likely related to the destruction of Jerusalem, as fire is a common biblical symbol for divine judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>).<p><b>the man went in and stood beside a wheel</b><br>The obedience of the man clothed in linen highlights the immediate and unquestioning response to God's command, reflecting the proper attitude of submission to divine authority. Standing beside a wheel signifies readiness to act and the proximity to the divine presence, as the wheels are part of the chariot-throne. This scene emphasizes the organized and purposeful nature of God's actions, as well as the readiness of His servants to execute His will. The imagery of the wheel also connects to the idea of God's plans being in motion, unstoppable and directed by His sovereign will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God who commands the events in this vision.

<a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, the Lord&#8217;s command brought the vision of judgment in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/9.htm">Ezekiel 9</a>; now it advances.<p>&#8226; The exiles hearing this would know that the coming destruction of Jerusalem is not random politics but divine decree (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15&#8211;52</a>; <a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1&#8211;10</a>).<p>God&#8217;s commands are never suggestions, and they always accomplish what He intends (<a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The man clothed in linen</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;the man clothed in linen&#8230;&#8221;

<a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>).<p>&#8226; The command comes straight from God&#8217;s mobile throne, underscoring that Jerusalem&#8217;s fate issues from His very presence (<a href="/psalms/97-2.htm">Psalm 97:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/8-5.htm">Revelation 8:5</a> offers a striking parallel: an angel takes fire from the heavenly altar and hurls it to earth, signaling judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From among the cherubim</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;from among the cherubim&#8230;&#8221;

On the mercy-seat they symbolized both access to and separation from God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Drawing fire &#8220;from among the cherubim&#8221; shows that judgment flows out of holiness itself;

Every detail&#8212;God&#8217;s command, the linen-clad servant, the fiery wheels, the cherubim&#8212;highlights the sovereign, holy, and purposeful nature of divine judgment. At the same time, the scene calls believers to trust God&#8217;s righteousness, heed His word promptly, and remember that the same throne dispensing fire also offers mercy to those who walk in obedience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/10-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
