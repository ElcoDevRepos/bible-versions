In Ezekiel's vision, the portico facing the outer court symbolizes accessibility and openness, inviting worshippers to approach the holy place. This orientation towards the outer court may reflect the inclusivity of God's invitation to all people, reminiscent of the temple's role as a house of prayer for all nations (<a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>). The outer court itself represents the area accessible to the general populace, contrasting with the inner courts reserved for priests, highlighting the gradation of holiness.<p><b>and its side pillars were decorated with palm trees on each side</b><br>Palm trees are a recurring motif in biblical temple imagery, symbolizing beauty, victory, and eternal life. Their presence on the side pillars of the portico may evoke the grandeur of Solomon's Temple, where palm trees were also used as decorative elements (<a href="/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>). The palm tree is often associated with righteousness and flourishing (<a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>), suggesting that the temple is a place where God's righteousness is manifest. This imagery can also be seen as a type of Christ, who embodies victory over sin and death, offering eternal life to believers.<p><b>Eight steps led up to it</b><br>The number eight in biblical numerology often signifies new beginnings or resurrection, as seen in the eight people saved in Noah's Ark (<a href="/1_peter/3-20.htm">1 Peter 3:20</a>) and the resurrection of Jesus occurring on the first day of the week, which is also the eighth day. The eight steps leading up to the portico may symbolize the ascent to a new spiritual life or a higher state of holiness. This ascent can be seen as a metaphor for the believer's journey towards God, emphasizing the transformative process of approaching the divine presence. The steps also reflect the physical elevation of the temple, which is a common feature in ancient temple architecture, signifying the separation between the sacred and the profane.<div

class="vheading2">What Does Ezekiel 40:34 Mean</div><b>Its portico faced the outer court</b><p>&#8226; Ezekiel is measuring the north inner gate, yet the porch faces outward (<a href="/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a>). This reminds us that even the inner structures remain open to those approaching from outside, echoing the invitation of <a href="/psalms/100-4.htm">Psalm 100:4</a>&#8212;&#8220;Enter His gates with thanksgiving&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The outward-facing portico keeps worship oriented toward the Lord&#8217;s mission to draw people in, much like the temple of Solomon that was built &#8220;for all peoples&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/8-41.htm">1 Kings 8:41-43</a>).<p>&#8226; By positioning the entry toward the outer court, the vision anticipates the future gathering of the nations in <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a> and <a href="/zechariah/14-16.htm">Zechariah 14:16</a>, when worship flows outward while still centered on God&#8217;s holiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Its side pillars were decorated with palm trees on each side</b><p>&#8226; Palm imagery first adorned Solomon&#8217;s temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>). Ezekiel repeats it here (<a href="/ezekiel/40-16.htm">Ezekiel 40:16</a>; 41:18-20), confirming continuity between the former and future houses of worship.<p>&#8226; Palms are symbols of victory and righteous flourishing&#8212;&#8220;The righteous will flourish like a palm tree&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>). They look back to the Exodus (<a href="/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a>) and forward to the redeemed multitude waving palms before the throne (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Their placement on both sides of the pillars frames the entrance in living testimony that life and victory belong to everyone who comes through this gate, fulfilling the promise of <a href="/ezekiel/47-12.htm">Ezekiel 47:12</a> that life-giving trees will line the river flowing from the sanctuary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eight steps led up to it</b><p>&#8226; Earlier gates to the outer court had seven steps (<a href="/ezekiel/40-22.htm">Ezekiel 40:22, 26</a>); the inner gates require eight. Each additional step pictures increased nearness to God and therefore greater elevation of heart (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Eight often signals new beginnings&#8212;Noah stepped onto a renewed earth (<a href="/genesis/8-18.htm">Genesis 8:18</a>), circumcision on the eighth day (<a href="/leviticus/12-3.htm">Leviticus 12:3</a>), and Christ&#8217;s resurrection on the first day of a new week (<a href="/mark/16-9.htm">Mark 16:9</a>). The eight steps thus whisper of the ultimate renewal the Lord promises in <a href="/ezekiel/37-26.htm">Ezekiel 37:26-28</a>.<p>&#8226; Practical access matters: steps ensure the worshiper looks up while ascending, drawing the eyes and the spirit heavenward (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-13.htm">2 Chronicles 6:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/40-34.htm">Ezekiel 40:34</a> paints a literal entryway into the future temple that also carries rich meaning. An outward-facing portico shows God&#8217;s heart to welcome; palm-engraved pillars proclaim flourishing victory for the faithful; eight ascending steps invite worshipers to rise into a fresh, closer walk with Him. Together these details assure us that the Lord is preparing a real, holy, and hope-filled place where His people will draw near and thrive forever.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/40-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Its portico</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;lam&#183;m&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
