In the context of Ezekiel, this reflects the broader theme of personal responsibility and the possibility of falling away from faith. The historical context involves the Israelites in exile, where maintaining faithfulness was a significant challenge. This idea is echoed in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4-6</a>, which warns against falling away after having received the knowledge of the truth.<p><b>and practices iniquity,</b><br>Practicing iniquity implies a deliberate and ongoing choice to engage in sinful behavior. This is not a momentary lapse but a lifestyle change. The Hebrew word for iniquity often denotes moral perversity and injustice, which were prevalent in the societies surrounding Israel. This reflects the human tendency to conform to the sinful practices of the world, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, which urges believers not to conform to the patterns of this world.<p><b>committing the same abominations as the wicked,</b><br>Abominations refer to actions that are detestable to God, often associated with idolatry and moral corruption. In Ezekiel's time, these included practices like idol worship and unjust treatment of others. The phrase underscores the severity of turning to such sins, equating the once-righteous person with those who have never known God. This is reminiscent of the warnings in <a href="/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11</a> about returning to folly.<p><b>will he live?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the seriousness of turning away from righteousness. It implies that spiritual life and eternal security are at stake. The question challenges the notion of once-saved-always-saved, suggesting that continued faithfulness is necessary for salvation. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>, where He states that not everyone who calls Him Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of the Father.<p><b>None of the righteous acts he did will be remembered.</b><br>This phrase highlights the principle that past righteousness does not compensate for present unfaithfulness. It reflects the biblical theme of perseverance, where the end of one's life is more significant than the beginning. This is seen in the parable of the ten virgins in <a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>, where preparedness and ongoing faithfulness are crucial.<p><b>Because of the unfaithfulness and sin he has committed,</b><br>Unfaithfulness here is a breach of the covenant relationship with God, akin to spiritual adultery. Sin, in this context, is a willful rebellion against God's laws. The historical backdrop involves Israel's repeated unfaithfulness despite God's continued mercy. This mirrors the warnings in <a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a> about friendship with the world being enmity with God.<p><b>he will die.</b><br>The consequence of spiritual death is emphasized, which in the Old Testament often referred to separation from God and His blessings. This is not merely physical death but eternal separation, as seen in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>, where the wages of sin is death. The phrase serves as a sobering reminder of the stakes involved in one's spiritual journey, urging believers to remain steadfast in their faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, emphasizing personal responsibility and the need for repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/righteous_man.htm">Righteous Man</a></b><br>Represents individuals who have lived according to God's laws but choose to turn away and commit sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wicked.htm">Wicked</a></b><br>Those who live in opposition to God's commandments, engaging in sinful behaviors and abominations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/abominations.htm">Abominations</a></b><br>Refers to actions detestable to God, often associated with idolatry and moral corruption.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a></b><br>Symbolizes spiritual separation from God due to sin, as well as the potential for physical death as a consequence of turning away from righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_responsibility.htm">Personal Responsibility</a></b><br>Each individual is accountable for their own actions.
