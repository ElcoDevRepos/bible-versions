The lifting up by the Spirit suggests a supernatural experience, similar to other instances in Ezekiel (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/3-12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12, 14</a>; 8:3) where the Spirit transports him. This emphasizes the power and presence of the Holy Spirit in guiding and revealing God's will to His prophets.<p><b>and carried me back to Chaldea</b><br>Chaldea refers to the region of southern Babylonia, where the Jewish exiles were taken after the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem. This transportation back to Chaldea signifies a return to the place of exile, highlighting the connection between Ezekiel's prophetic experiences and the reality of the exiles' situation. It underscores the importance of the message being directly relevant to the exiles' current circumstances.<p><b>to the exiles</b><br>The exiles are the Jewish people who were taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar and brought to Babylon. This context is crucial as Ezekiel's prophecies are directed towards these displaced people, offering them hope, warning, and guidance. The mention of the exiles emphasizes God's continued concern and communication with His people, even in their captivity.<p><b>in the vision given by the Spirit of God</b><br>This phrase confirms that the experience was a vision, a common method through which God communicated with His prophets. The vision is attributed to the Spirit of God, affirming its divine origin and authority. Visions were a significant means of revelation in the Old Testament, providing insight into God's plans and purposes (e.g., Daniel's visions in <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7-12</a>).<p><b>After the vision had gone up from me</b><br>The conclusion of the vision indicates a return to normal consciousness for Ezekiel. This transition marks the end of the divine revelation and the beginning of the prophet's responsibility to communicate the message to the people. It reflects the pattern of prophetic experiences where the prophet receives a vision, understands its significance, and then shares it with the intended audience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the central figure in this passage, receiving visions from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit_of_god.htm">The Spirit of God</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit, who empowers and guides Ezekiel, lifting him up and transporting him in visions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exiles.htm">The Exiles</a></b><br>The Israelites who were taken captive and are living in Babylonia, representing the people to whom Ezekiel is sent.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonia.htm">Babylonia</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are exiled, a place of both physical and spiritual captivity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision.htm">The Vision</a></b><br>A divine revelation given to Ezekiel, which is a means of communication from God to His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit is active in guiding, empowering, and revealing God's will to His people.
