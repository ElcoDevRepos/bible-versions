In the prophetic books, the phrase often introduces a direct message from God, underscoring the seriousness and certainty of the prophecy. It reflects the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces, delivering His judgments and promises. This introduction is common in prophetic literature, establishing the message as not merely human opinion but divine decree.<p><b>Surely I will deliver you into the hands of those you hate:</b><br>This part of the verse indicates a reversal of fortunes for the people being addressed, likely the inhabitants of Jerusalem or the nation of Israel. Historically, Israel had alliances with various nations, often turning to them for military support or political alliances, which were contrary to God's commands to rely solely on Him. The "hands of those you hate" could refer to nations like Babylon or Assyria, with whom Israel had contentious relationships. This phrase highlights the consequences of Israel's unfaithfulness and idolatry, as they are handed over to their enemies as a form of divine judgment.<p><b>from whom you turned away in disgust:</b><br>This phrase suggests a previous relationship or alliance that was broken due to disdain or betrayal. In the historical context, Israel often turned away from alliances with pagan nations when they no longer served their interests or when they realized the moral and spiritual corruption involved. This turning away is symbolic of Israel's inconsistent faithfulness, both to God and to their political allies. The disgust could also reflect the moral and spiritual revulsion that should have been directed towards idolatry and pagan practices, yet was often ignored until it was too late. This serves as a reminder of the consequences of unfaithfulness and the importance of steadfastness in one's commitments, both to God and in human relationships.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/oholah_and_oholibah.htm">Oholah and Oholibah</a></b><br>Symbolic names for Samaria and Jerusalem, representing the Northern and Southern Kingdoms of Israel, respectively.
