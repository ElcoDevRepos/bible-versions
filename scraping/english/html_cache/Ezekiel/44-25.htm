Contact with a dead body was considered a source of ritual impurity (<a href="/leviticus/21.htm">Leviticus 21:1-4</a>). This regulation underscores the holiness required of those who minister before the Lord, reflecting God's own holiness (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44-45</a>). The prohibition against defilement by the dead is also a reminder of the separation between life and death, purity and impurity, which is a recurring theme in the Old Testament. This separation is symbolic of the spiritual purity required to approach God.<p><b>However, for a father, a mother, a son, a daughter, a brother, or an unmarried sister, he may do so,</b><br>The allowance for priests to become ritually impure for close family members highlights the importance of familial obligations and the value placed on family relationships in ancient Israelite society. This exception demonstrates a balance between the demands of religious duty and the natural human need to mourn and honor one's family. The inclusion of "an unmarried sister" is significant, as she would have been under the care and protection of her family, emphasizing the responsibility of the priest to his immediate kin. This provision reflects the compassionate nature of the law, recognizing the deep bonds of family and the necessity of mourning. It also points to the humanity of the priesthood, acknowledging that priests, though set apart, are still part of the community and family structures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The primary focus of this verse, priests were set apart for service in the temple and were required to maintain ritual purity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/dead_body.htm">Dead Body</a></b><br>Contact with a dead body was considered a source of ritual impurity in ancient Israelite culture.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/family_members.htm">Family Members</a></b><br>The verse lists specific family members for whom a priest may make an exception to the rule of avoiding defilement.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple.htm">Temple</a></b><br>The place where priests served, requiring them to maintain a state of ritual purity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, who conveyed God's instructions and visions to the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>Priests were called to a higher standard of holiness, symbolizing the need for believers to live set apart for God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/family_and_duty.htm">Family and Duty</a></b><br>While family obligations are important, they must be balanced with spiritual responsibilities and commitments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/ritual_purity_and_spiritual_purity.htm">Ritual Purity and Spiritual Purity</a></b><br>The Old Testament laws on ritual purity point to the New Testament call for spiritual purity and holiness in the life of a believer.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/exceptions_and_compassion.htm">Exceptions and Compassion</a></b><br>The allowance for priests to defile themselves for close family members shows God's compassion and understanding of human relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_death.htm">Symbolism of Death</a></b><br>Death as a source of impurity symbolizes the spiritual death that sin brings, reminding believers of the need for spiritual cleansing through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_44_25_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 44:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_44_25_s_role_in_priests_purity.htm">How does Ezekiel 44:25 guide priests in maintaining ceremonial purity today?

As under the Law, so in the ideal constitution of Ezekiel, the priests should not be at liberty to contract ceremonial impurity through touching a corpse except in the case of near relations (comp. <a href="/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-4</a>). That neither in Leviticus nor in Ezekiel is the priest's wife among the excepted is surprising, and hardly to be explained, with Knobel, on the ground that a wife is not a blood-relation, since according to the Divine conception of marriage husband and wife are one (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>), but either by holding, with Keil, that the wife, who stands nearer her husband than any of the relatives named, was viewed as included under the phrase, "and for his kin that is near unto him" (<a href="/leviticus/21-2.htm">Leviticus 21:2</a>), or by supposing it self-evident that such defilement could not be avoided in the case of a wife and was therefore tacitly allowed. Smend, as usual, finds signs of Ezekiel's priority to the priest-code, first in the circumstance that Ezekiel regarded it as perfectly natural that a priest should sorrow for his wife (<a href="/ezekiel/24-15.htm">Ezekiel 24:15-18</a>), which showed he had no acquaintance with <a href="/leviticus/21.htm">Leviticus 21</a>; and secondly, in the fact that <a href="/leviticus/21-11.htm">Leviticus 21:11</a> prohibits absolutely to the high priest all contact with a corpse, which, it is argued, betrays a greater strictness than existed in the days of Ezekiel. But as the prohibition in <a href="/leviticus/21-11.htm">Leviticus 21:11</a> applies only to the high priest, who in Ezekiel's temple has no place, an argument as to which of the books had priority of origin cannot properly be founded on so insecure a Basis. Knobel remarks on <a href="/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-4</a> that "among the Greeks, priests and priestesses remained at a distance from funerals (Plato, 'De Legg.,' 12. p. 947); while among the Romans ought the <span class="accented">Flamen dialis</span> to touch no corpse (Gell., 10:15), the augur perform no funeral rites (Tacit., 'Ann.,' 1:31), and the pontifex accompany no funeral procession (Die Cass., 56:31); not at all should he behold a dead body (Serv., 'Ad AEn.,' 6:176),and in case he had occasion to pronounce a funeral oration, a curtain should hang between him and the corpse." As to the cleansing of a defiled priest, that should be conducted in accordance with the customary regulations (comp. <a href="/numbers/19.htm">Numbers 19</a>.),with this difference - that on the termination of the ordinary rites, which extended over seven days, an additional seven days, according to Havernick and Keil (though Hengstenberg and Plumptre decide for only one heptade), should elapse, at the end of which, on the presentation of a sin offering, he should be restored to service in the inner sanctuary. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/44-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A priest must not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">defile himself</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1496;&#1464;&#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7789;&#257;&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
