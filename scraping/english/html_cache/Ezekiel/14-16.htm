The expression "as surely as I live" is an oath formula, underscoring the seriousness of the message. It reflects God's eternal nature and His sovereign power over life and death. This phrase is used elsewhere in Scripture to affirm God's unchanging nature and His commitment to His word (<a href="/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>, <a href="/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>).<p><b>even if these three men were in it</b><br>The "three men" refer to Noah, Daniel, and Job, who are mentioned earlier in the chapter (<a href="/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14</a>). These individuals are exemplars of righteousness and faithfulness in the Old Testament. Noah is known for his obedience in building the ark (Genesis 6-9), Daniel for his unwavering faith in Babylon (Daniel 1-6), and Job for his perseverance through suffering (Job 1-42). Their mention highlights the severity of the judgment, as even their presence would not avert it.<p><b>they could not deliver their own sons or daughters</b><br>This phrase underscores the personal nature of righteousness and accountability before God. It reflects the biblical principle that each person is responsible for their own relationship with God (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>). The inability to save even their own children emphasizes the totality of the judgment and the necessity of individual repentance and faith.<p><b>They alone would be delivered</b><br>This indicates that personal righteousness is recognized by God, but it does not extend to others by association. The deliverance of these righteous individuals aligns with the biblical theme of God's protection and reward for the faithful (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>, <a href="/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of salvation through personal faith in Jesus Christ (<a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9-10</a>).<p><b>but the land would be desolate</b><br>The desolation of the land signifies the complete and devastating nature of God's judgment. This reflects the historical context of the Babylonian exile, where the land of Judah was left desolate due to the people's unfaithfulness (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>). It serves as a warning of the consequences of sin and a call to repentance. The desolation also points to the eschatological judgment and the ultimate restoration of creation through Christ (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the mouthpiece of God, delivering messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and just God who speaks through Ezekiel, emphasizing His authority and the certainty of His declarations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_three_men.htm">The Three Men</a></b><br>Refers to Noah, Daniel, and Job, who are mentioned earlier in the chapter as paragons of righteousness.
