In the ancient Near Eastern context, a mob or assembly often symbolized collective judgment or punishment. The imagery of a mob suggests a public and communal act of retribution, aligning with the legal practices of the time where communities participated in the execution of justice. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to national calamity. Theologically, it underscores the seriousness of spiritual adultery and the communal consequences of sin.<p><b>who will stone you</b><br>Stoning was a common method of execution in ancient Israel, prescribed in the Mosaic Law for certain transgressions, including idolatry and adultery (<a href="/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/22-24.htm">Deuteronomy 22:24</a>). It was a communal act, emphasizing the collective responsibility of the community to uphold God's law. This method of execution highlights the gravity of Jerusalem's sins, equating her idolatry with spiritual adultery deserving of death. The act of stoning also serves as a type of divine judgment, foreshadowing the ultimate judgment that will be executed by God Himself.<p><b>and cut you to pieces with their swords</b><br>The use of swords indicates a violent and thorough destruction, symbolizing the complete and utter devastation that would come upon Jerusalem. Historically, this reflects the Babylonian conquest, where the city was besieged and destroyed. The sword is often a symbol of divine judgment throughout Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-6</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/25-31.htm">Jeremiah 25:31</a>), and here it signifies the execution of God's righteous wrath. This imagery also connects to the broader biblical theme of the sword as a tool of both judgment and purification, as seen in the New Testament where the Word of God is described as a sword (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>, <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Jerusalem is portrayed as the adulterous wife, so the punishment fits the crime under the covenant.<p>&#8226; Public stoning involved witnesses (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">Deuteronomy 17:6-7</a>). The nations act as witnesses, confirming God&#8217;s verdict that His people have broken faith.<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; challengers cite this same law in <a href="/john/8-5.htm">John 8:5</a>, showing how deeply the concept of stoning for unfaithfulness was rooted in Israel&#8217;s conscience.<p>&#8226; The image underscores finality&#8212;no appeal remains when covenant charges are proven (<a href="/hebrews/10-28.htm">Hebrews 10:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and cut you to pieces with their swords</b><p>&#8226; The sword is another covenant curse (<a href="/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25</a>).
