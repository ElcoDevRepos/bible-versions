Historically, the Israelites were exiled due to their disobedience and idolatry, notably during the Babylonian captivity. This regathering is not only a physical return to the land of Israel but also a spiritual restoration. It echoes the promises found in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3-5</a> and <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11-12</a>, where God promises to bring His people back. This act of gathering signifies God's faithfulness to His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>I will accept you as a pleasing aroma</b><br>The imagery of a "pleasing aroma" is deeply rooted in the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, where offerings made to God were described as a "pleasing aroma" (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9, 2</a>:2). This signifies God's acceptance and favor. In the New Testament, this concept is fulfilled in Christ, whose sacrifice is described as a "fragrant offering" (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>). The acceptance of Israel as a pleasing aroma indicates a restored relationship with God, where their worship and lives are once again pleasing to Him.<p><b>And I will show My holiness through you in the sight of the nations</b><br>God's holiness is a central theme throughout Scripture, and His desire is to manifest His holiness through His people. In the context of Ezekiel, Israel's restoration and obedience would demonstrate God's holiness and power to the surrounding nations. This is a fulfillment of God's promise to make Israel a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>). The ultimate expression of God's holiness is seen in Jesus Christ, who perfectly reveals God's nature and through whom believers are called to be holy (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).

peoples</b><p>&#8226; The verse begins with God Himself taking the initiative. He is not delegating the task; He says, &#8220;I bring you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This promise reflects earlier prophecies of a literal regathering of Israel, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3-4</a> (&#8220;He will gather you again from all the peoples&#8230;&#8221;) and <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11-12</a>.<p>&#8226; The action underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness to His covenant, even after judgment and exile (<a href="/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37</a>).<p>&#8226; It anticipates the ultimate, future return that no enemy or circumstance can prevent, highlighting the sovereignty of the Lord over history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and gather you from the lands to which you have been scattered</b><p>&#8226; Scattering was a consequence of rebellion (<a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-19.htm">Ezekiel 36:19</a>). Regathering is the gracious reversal.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Gather&#8221; implies tenderness&#8212;like a shepherd collecting sheep (<a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase covers the whole globe. God&#8217;s people, dispersed &#8220;to the four corners of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>), will literally be brought back to their land.<p>&#8226; This gathering also sets the stage for renewed national worship in accordance with passages such as <a href="/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24-27</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will accept you as a pleasing aroma</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Pleasing aroma&#8221; echoes sacrificial language (<a href="/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>; <a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). The people themselves become the acceptable offering.<p>&#8226; Acceptance follows repentance and purification foretold in <a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25</a> (&#8220;I will sprinkle clean water on you&#8221;).<p>&#8226; New-covenant overtones appear: just as Christ &#8220;gave Himself up for us as a fragrant offering&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>), Israel&#8217;s restored relationship will be grounded in God-provided atonement.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s pleasure signals that past sin is fully dealt with, allowing unhindered fellowship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And I will show My holiness through you in the sight of the nations</b><p>&#8226; The purpose of restoration is not merely Israel&#8217;s comfort but God&#8217;s glory.

The ultimate goal is the public display of God&#8217;s holiness so the watching world sees His glory. This passage assures believers that God keeps His word, transforms repentant hearts, and uses His restored people to broadcast His greatness to every nation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will be sanctified in you,</span> etc. God is sanctified when he is manifested and recognized as holy (<a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a>). That recognition would be the consequence of the restoration of Israel, for then it would be seen, even by the heathen, that the God of Israel had been holy and just and true in his judgments, and that he seeks to make men partakers of his holiness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/20-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When I bring</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7779;&#238;&#183;&#8217;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
