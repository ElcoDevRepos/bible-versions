The imagery of God stretching out His hand is often used in the Old Testament to denote divine action, whether in deliverance or judgment (<a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a>, <a href="/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>). In this context, it is a declaration of impending punishment against the Ammonites for their hostility towards Israel. The stretching out of God's hand is a powerful metaphor for His sovereign control and ability to execute justice.<p><b>and give you as plunder to the nations.</b><br>This indicates that the Ammonites will be conquered and their wealth taken by foreign powers. Historically, the Ammonites were situated east of the Jordan River, in present-day Jordan. They were often in conflict with Israel and other neighboring nations. The prophecy suggests that their land and resources would be seized by invading armies, a common fate for nations that opposed God's people (<a href="/jeremiah/49.htm">Jeremiah 49:1-6</a>).<p><b>I will cut you off from the peoples</b><br>This phrase implies a complete severance from the community of nations. The Ammonites would lose their identity and autonomy, becoming insignificant in the geopolitical landscape. This reflects the broader biblical theme of divine retribution for those who oppose God's covenant people. The cutting off from the peoples can also be seen as a form of divine exile, similar to the fate of Israel when they were unfaithful (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63-64</a>).<p><b>and exterminate you from the countries.</b><br>This suggests a total destruction or removal from their land. The Ammonites would face annihilation or dispersion, a fate that befell many ancient peoples who opposed God's will. The term "exterminate" underscores the severity of the judgment. Historically, the Ammonites eventually disappeared as a distinct people, absorbed into other cultures and nations, fulfilling this prophecy.<p><b>I will destroy you,</b><br>The repetition of the theme of destruction emphasizes the certainty and completeness of the judgment. This destruction is not just physical but also cultural and spiritual. The Ammonites' gods and practices would be eradicated, highlighting the supremacy of the God of Israel. This serves as a warning to all nations about the consequences of opposing God's purposes.<p><b>and you will know that I am the LORD.&#8217;</b><br>This concluding phrase is a common refrain in Ezekiel, underscoring the purpose of divine judgment: to reveal God's sovereignty and identity. The recognition of the LORD as the true God is a central theme in the prophetic literature. It serves as both a warning and an invitation to repentance. The ultimate goal of judgment is not just punishment but the acknowledgment of God's rightful place as the sovereign ruler of all nations (<a href="/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7, 7</a>:4).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
