The "inner court" is a significant area within the temple complex in Jerusalem, reserved for priests and sacred activities. This location underscores the gravity of the idolatry being committed, as it occurs in a place meant for holy worship. The temple, built by Solomon, was the center of Jewish worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among His people.<p><b>and there at the entrance to the temple of the LORD</b><br>The entrance to the temple signifies a threshold between the sacred and the profane. This location highlights the audacity of the idolatrous acts, as they occur right at the gateway to the most sacred space. The temple entrance was a place of reverence, where worshipers would prepare to enter the presence of God.<p><b>between the portico and the altar</b><br>The portico, or porch, was a covered area leading into the temple, while the altar was used for sacrifices. This positioning indicates a deliberate choice to turn away from the altar, symbolizing a rejection of the sacrificial system established by God. The altar was central to the worship and atonement practices of Israel, making this act of idolatry even more egregious.<p><b>were about twenty-five men</b><br>The number twenty-five may represent the leaders of the people, possibly including priests or elders. This group symbolizes a collective turning away from God, indicating widespread corruption among those who should have been spiritual leaders. Their actions reflect a broader national apostasy.<p><b>with their backs to the temple of the LORD</b><br>Turning their backs to the temple signifies a complete rejection of God and His covenant. This act of turning away is symbolic of Israel's spiritual adultery and abandonment of their relationship with God. It is a physical manifestation of their spiritual state.<p><b>and their faces toward the east</b><br>Facing east, the direction of the rising sun, indicates a deliberate choice to worship something other than God. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the east was often associated with the sun and other deities. This orientation signifies a preference for pagan practices over the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>and they were bowing to the east in worship of the sun</b><br>Sun worship was common among Israel's neighbors, such as the Egyptians and Babylonians. This act of bowing to the sun represents the adoption of foreign religious practices, directly violating the first commandment. It highlights the syncretism and idolatry that plagued Israel, leading to their eventual exile. This scene serves as a stark warning against the dangers of turning away from God and embracing the practices of surrounding cultures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, who is being shown visions of the abominations taking place in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/inner_court_of_the_house_of_the_lord.htm">Inner Court of the House of the LORD</a></b><br>The sacred area within the temple where only priests were allowed, signifying a place of holiness and worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/twenty-five_men.htm">Twenty-five Men</a></b><br>Likely representing the leaders or priests of Israel, who are engaging in idolatrous worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_of_the_lord.htm">Temple of the LORD</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sun_worship.htm">Sun Worship</a></b><br>An idolatrous practice where the men are turning their backs on God to worship the sun, a direct violation of the first commandment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry_in_the_heart.htm">Idolatry in the Heart</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but anything that takes the place of God in our hearts.

This vivid scene reveals the depth of Judah&#8217;s apostasy, explains why divine judgment is imminent, and warns every generation that outward religious privilege cannot shield willful hearts from accountability when they replace the worship of the living God with any rival glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Between the porch</span> <span class= "bld">and the altar.</span>--Ezekiel now returns to the court of the priests, and there sees--not <span class= "ital">about, </span>but <span class= "ital">as it were </span>(referring to the nature of the vision)--"twenty-five men." These are probably the high priest and the heads of the twenty-four courses, representing the whole body of the priests, as the elders represented the whole body of the people. They were standing between the altar and the Temple, therefore in the most sacred part of the court, and there, turning their backs upon the Temple of the Lord, worshipped the sun. The adoration of the sun, probably the earliest form of false religion, was the especial worship of Persia, but had been long since practised by the kings and people of Judah (<a href="/2_kings/23-5.htm" title="And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.">2Kings 23:5</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-11.htm" title="And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.">2Kings 23:11</a>). Thus all classes of the nation are seen to be involved in common sin; and the priests particularly, the especial guardians of true religion, are found practising this sin under circumstances of peculiar insult to God. That the "chief priests" did pollute the sanctuary at this time is expressly asserted in the history at <a href="/2_chronicles/36-14.htm" title="Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 36:14</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He brought me into the inner court.</span> The last and the worst form of desecration follows. It was the "inner court" (<a href="/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a>) which, after the exile, was entered only by the priests. During the monarchy, however, it seems to have been accessible to kings and other persons of importance, as in the case of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/8-22.htm">1 Kings 8:22, 64</a>; <a href="/1_kings/9-25.htm">1 Kings 9:25</a>) in the revolution against Athaliah (<a href="/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4-15</a>), and Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/19-14.htm">2 Kings 19:14</a>), and Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/23-2.htm">2 Kings 23:2</a>). Ezekiel does not say that the men whom he saw were priests, though the number twenty-five suggests that they were taking the place of the high priest and the heads of the twenty-four courses of the priesthood (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-4.htm">1 Chronicles 24:4-19</a>), and so symbolized the whole order of the priesthood as the seventy elders represented the laity. In <a href="/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a> the chief of the priests is spoken of as having been prominent in "polluting the house of the Lord." They were seen turning their backs to the temple of Jehovah, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sanctuary. The very act was symbolical of their apostasy (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-6.htm">2 Chronicles 29:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>). And they did this in order that they might look to the east and worship the rising sun. That, and not the temple (<a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>), was the <span class="accented">Kiblah</span> of their adoration. The sun worship here appears to have had a Persian character, as being offered to the sun itself, and not to Baal, as a solar god. Of such a worship we have traces in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-3.htm">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>; <a href="/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5, 11</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So He brought</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
