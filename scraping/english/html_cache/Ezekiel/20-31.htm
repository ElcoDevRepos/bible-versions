This practice was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>). The Israelites' participation in such rituals indicates a severe departure from their covenant with Yahweh, reflecting a syncretism with pagan practices. This act of offering gifts in such a manner was seen as a profound violation of the sanctity of life and a direct affront to God&#8217;s commandments.<p><b>you continue to defile yourselves with all your idols to this day</b><br>Idolatry was a persistent issue for Israel, as seen throughout the Old Testament. The worship of idols was not merely a religious misstep but a moral and spiritual defilement that corrupted the people and their relationship with God. The phrase "to this day" underscores the ongoing nature of their rebellion, highlighting a pattern of unfaithfulness that persisted despite numerous warnings from prophets. This defilement through idolatry is a recurring theme in Ezekiel, emphasizing the need for repentance and return to true worship.<p><b>So should I be consulted by you, O house of Israel?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the audacity of the Israelites in seeking guidance from God while simultaneously engaging in practices that are abhorrent to Him. It reflects the hypocrisy of attempting to maintain a relationship with God while living in blatant disobedience. The "house of Israel" is a collective term for the nation, indicating that this was a widespread issue, not limited to a few individuals. The question challenges the sincerity of their faith and their understanding of what it means to be in covenant with God.<p><b>As surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD</b><br>This phrase is an oath formula, emphasizing the certainty and seriousness of God's declaration. It is a solemn affirmation of His authority and the truth of His words. The use of "as surely as I live" underscores the eternal and unchanging nature of God, contrasting with the fickle and transient nature of human faithfulness. It serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and His ultimate control over the affairs of humanity.<p><b>I will not be consulted by you!</b><br>God's refusal to be consulted by the Israelites is a direct consequence of their persistent idolatry and rebellion. It signifies a withdrawal of His guidance and favor, a severe judgment for a people who have continually rejected His ways. This statement reflects the broken relationship between God and Israel, a theme that runs throughout the book of Ezekiel. It serves as a warning of the consequences of disobedience and the importance of genuine repentance and faithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_israel.htm">House of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the collective people of Israel, who were in rebellion against God during this period.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry.htm">Idolatry</a></b><br>The worship of idols, which was a significant issue for the Israelites, leading them away from God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrifice_of_sons.htm">Sacrifice of Sons</a></b><br>A reference to the abominable practice of child sacrifice, which some Israelites engaged in, influenced by surrounding pagan cultures.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who is addressing the people's unfaithfulness and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry leads to spiritual blindness and moral decay.
