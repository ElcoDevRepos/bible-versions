It underscores Ezekiel's role as a representative of humanity and a messenger of God. This title is also significant in the New Testament, where it is used by Jesus to refer to Himself, highlighting His incarnation and role as the mediator between God and man.<p><b>&#8220;do you see what they are doing&#8212;</b><br>This phrase introduces a vision where God reveals to Ezekiel the idolatrous practices of the Israelites. It is a call to witness the spiritual state of the nation, emphasizing the importance of spiritual discernment. The vision serves as a divine indictment against Israel's unfaithfulness, highlighting the need for repentance and return to covenant faithfulness.<p><b>the great abominations that the house of Israel is committing&#8212;</b><br>The "great abominations" refer to the idolatrous practices and detestable acts being committed by the Israelites, which are an affront to God. Historically, these abominations included idol worship and syncretism with pagan religions, which were strictly forbidden in the Mosaic Law. This phrase underscores the severity of Israel's sin and the breach of their covenant relationship with God.<p><b>to drive Me far from My sanctuary?</b><br>The sanctuary, or the temple in Jerusalem, was the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. The abominations committed by Israel were causing God to withdraw His presence, symbolizing a broken relationship. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's holiness and the consequences of sin, which separates humanity from God. The temple's desecration foreshadows its eventual destruction, a judgment for Israel's unfaithfulness.<p><b>Yet you will see even greater abominations.&#8221;</b><br>This statement indicates that the idolatry and sinfulness of Israel are even more profound than what has been initially revealed. It prepares Ezekiel for further revelations of Israel's spiritual corruption. This phrase serves as a warning of the progressive nature of sin and the deepening of Israel's apostasy. It also points to the need for a new covenant, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who restores the broken relationship between God and humanity through His atoning sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of God's visions and messages, tasked with delivering them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, God is revealing to Ezekiel the abominations being committed by the Israelites, which are driving Him away from His sanctuary.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_israel.htm">The House of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Israel, who are engaging in idolatrous practices and other sins that are considered abominations by God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctuary.htm">The Sanctuary</a></b><br>This is the holy place where God's presence dwells among His people, symbolizing His relationship with Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/abominations.htm">Abominations</a></b><br>These are the sinful acts, particularly idolatry and other forms of spiritual unfaithfulness, that the Israelites are committing, which are offensive to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_idolatry.htm">The Seriousness of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but anything that takes the place of God in our lives.

God personally addresses Ezekiel, commands him to look, and reveals that the people&#8217;s persistent abominations are driving His presence from the temple. What seems shocking now will only intensify, proving that sin hardens and alienates unless repented of. The verse calls every generation to recognize how serious a holy God is about idolatry and to cling to His presence rather than expel it through unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">That I should go far off from my sanctuary.</span>--In the original this is simply an infinitive, without any subject expressed, "for the removing far off," and may therefore be understood either of the removing of the people or of the Divine abandonment of the sanctuary. The latter sense, however, which is that given in the Authorised Version, is more probable and more in accordance with the whole teaching of the vision. There was a strong feeling among the people that they were safe at Jerusalem; God, Whom they still regarded, notwithstanding their idolatries, as a powerful national God, would certainly protect His temple. It is the office of the prophet to show that, the transgressions of the people led, as their natural consequence, to his giving over the city to desolation. The "great abominations" spoken of are the constant refrain of this chapter (<a href="/ezekiel/8-9.htm" title="And he said to me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.">Ezekiel 8:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-13.htm" title="He said also to me, Turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations that they do.">Ezekiel 8:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-15.htm" title="Then said he to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations than these.">Ezekiel 8:15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-17.htm" title="Then he said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, see, they put the branch to their nose.">Ezekiel 8:17</a>). The people's own acts make necessary the judgments impending over them.
