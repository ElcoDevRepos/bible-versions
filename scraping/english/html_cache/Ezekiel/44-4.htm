The north gate is significant as it was traditionally used for sacrificial offerings, symbolizing a place of approach to God. The temple represents the center of worship and God's presence among His people. This vision occurs during the Babylonian exile, a time when the physical temple in Jerusalem was destroyed, emphasizing the hope of restoration and God's enduring presence.<p><b>I looked and saw the glory of the LORD filling His temple,</b><br>The "glory of the LORD" is a recurring theme in Ezekiel, representing God's manifest presence. This glory had previously departed from the temple due to Israel's sin (Ezekiel 10), and its return signifies restoration and reconciliation. The filling of the temple with God's glory echoes the dedication of Solomon's temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>), where the glory of the LORD filled the house, indicating divine approval and presence.<p><b>and I fell facedown.</b><br>Ezekiel's response of falling facedown is a common biblical reaction to encountering God's glory, signifying reverence, awe, and submission. This posture is seen in other biblical figures such as Moses (<a href="/exodus/34-8.htm">Exodus 34:8</a>) and John (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>). It underscores the holiness of God and the appropriate human response to His overwhelming presence.
