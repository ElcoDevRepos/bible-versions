The knowledge of the LORD is a central theme in the prophetic literature, often associated with judgment and restoration. In the context of Ezekiel, this knowledge comes through the fulfillment of prophecy and the demonstration of God's power and holiness. The phrase echoes the covenantal language found in <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>, where God promises that the Israelites will know Him through His deliverance.<p><b>when I disperse them among the nations</b><br>The dispersion, or exile, of the Israelites is a significant event in biblical history, marking a period of judgment for their disobedience and idolatry. This scattering among the nations fulfills earlier warnings given by prophets like Moses in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>. The dispersion serves as both punishment and a means for the Israelites to witness to the nations, as seen in the broader narrative of the Old Testament. Historically, the Babylonian exile is the immediate context, where many Israelites were taken from their homeland.<p><b>and scatter them throughout the countries</b><br>This scattering is not just a physical relocation but also a spiritual and cultural upheaval. It reflects the consequences of breaking the covenant with God, as the Israelites are removed from the land promised to their ancestors. The scattering throughout various countries highlights the extent of God's judgment and the loss of national identity. However, it also sets the stage for eventual restoration and the gathering of the remnant, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>. The scattering can be seen as a type of Christ's mission to gather all nations to Himself, as He speaks of gathering His people from the four corners of the earth in <a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, who are being warned of impending judgment due to their disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, serving as a backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the various countries among which the Israelites will be scattered.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (YHWH)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, emphasizing His sovereignty and justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>God's actions in dispersing the Israelites demonstrate His control over nations and His commitment to justice.

&#8216;And they will know&#8230;&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/12-15.htm">Ezekiel 12:15</a>) signals the result God is aiming for&#8212;awareness, recognition, and personal acknowledgement.<p>&#8226; This is a recurring refrain in Ezekiel (cf. 6:7; 7:4); every act of judgment or mercy carries the same goal.<p>&#8226; Knowledge here is experiential, moving God&#8217;s people from religious formality to a heart-level conviction that He alone is true and sovereign.<p>&#8226; Even painful events can serve redemptive purposes, echoing <a href="/romans/11-22.htm">Romans 11:22</a>&#8217;s call to &#8220;consider both the kindness and severity of God.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that I am the LORD</b><p>The phrase establishes covenant identity: &#8220;I am Yahweh,&#8221;

exile answers that question decisively.<p>&#8226; The LORD&#8217;s name embodies His character&#8212;holy, just, steadfast in love&#8212;and His actions vindicate that character before the watching world (<a href="/isaiah/45-22.htm">Isaiah 45:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226;

it is a covenant warning come to life (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-23.htm">Ezekiel 20:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Exile functions as discipline: cutting Israel off from land, temple, and king so they confront the futility of idols (<a href="/jeremiah/16-13.htm">Jeremiah 16:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Scattering places witnesses of God&#8217;s justice in many cultures, turning Israel into a living parable (<a href="/psalms/44-11.htm">Psalm 44:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet dispersion contains hope: the same God who scatters promises regathering once repentance blooms (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and scatter them throughout the countries</b><p>The repetition intensifies the certainty and breadth of the judgment (<a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>;

The scattering preserves a remnant (<a href="/ezekiel/12-16.htm">Ezekiel 12:16</a>), ensuring God&#8217;s promises to Abraham continue despite national collapse.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/12-15.htm">Ezekiel 12:15</a> teaches that exile is God&#8217;s purposeful instrument: He scatters His people so they finally recognize Him as the LORD. Judgment is both disciplinary and revelatory, vindicating His holy name, exposing idolatry, and preparing the way for eventual restoration.
