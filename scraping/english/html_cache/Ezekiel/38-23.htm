In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38</a>, God is speaking about His intervention against Gog, a leader of a coalition of nations. The magnification and sanctification of God are themes throughout the Bible, emphasizing His supreme power and purity. In <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>, God is described as "majestic in holiness," and in <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>, the seraphim declare His holiness. This act of magnification and sanctification is a divine response to the rebellion and pride of nations, showcasing God's sovereignty and setting Him apart from all other gods.<p><b>and I will reveal Myself in the sight of many nations</b><br>God's revelation to the nations is a recurring theme in the prophetic books. Here, it signifies a public demonstration of His power and authority, not just to Israel but to the entire world. This revelation is often associated with acts of judgment and deliverance, as seen in the plagues of Egypt (Exodus 7-12) and the fall of Jericho (Joshua 6). The phrase suggests a global recognition of God's power, aligning with prophecies in <a href="/isaiah/45-22.htm">Isaiah 45:22-23</a>, where every knee will bow to Him. This revelation is both a warning and an invitation for the nations to acknowledge the true God.<p><b>Then they will know that I am the LORD</b><br>This concluding phrase underscores the purpose of God's actions: to affirm His identity as the LORD, the covenant-keeping God of Israel. The recognition of God as LORD is a central theme in Ezekiel, appearing numerous times throughout the book. It reflects the ultimate goal of God's dealings with humanity&#8212;to bring people to a knowledge of Him. This knowledge is not merely intellectual but relational, involving acknowledgment, reverence, and submission. The phrase echoes the covenant language found in <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>, where God promises to take Israel as His people and be their God. It also points forward to the eschatological hope in <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>, where the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of our Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is declaring His intention to reveal His power and holiness to the nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the various peoples and countries that will witness God's actions and come to recognize His sovereignty.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message, providing insight into God's plans and purposes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gog_and_magog.htm">Gog and Magog</a></b><br>Though not mentioned directly in this verse, they are the context of the surrounding chapters, representing forces opposed to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation through which God often reveals His power and holiness, serving as a backdrop for His actions in this prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God is in control of history and uses events to reveal His power and holiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/revelation_to_the_nations.htm">Revelation to the Nations</a></b><br>God's actions are not limited to Israel; He desires all nations to recognize His lordship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_magnification.htm">Holiness and Magnification</a></b><br>God&#8217;s holiness is central to His identity, and He will magnify Himself to ensure His holiness is known.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eschatological_implications.htm">Eschatological Implications</a></b><br>This prophecy points to future events where God will decisively act to establish His kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_reflection.htm">Personal Reflection</a></b><br>Believers are called to recognize and proclaim God&#8217;s sovereignty and holiness in their own lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_38_23_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 38:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_38_23_God_s_wish_for_global_fame.htm">How does Ezekiel 38:23 reveal God's desire to be "known among the nations"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_38_23_God_s_greatness_holiness.htm">What actions in Ezekiel 38:23 demonstrate God's "greatness and holiness"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_38_23_and_God_s_sovereignty.htm">How does Ezekiel 38:23 connect to God's sovereignty in other Scriptures?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Ezekiel_38_23_daily.htm">How can we apply the message of Ezekiel 38:23 in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_38_23_on_God_s_plan.htm">What does Ezekiel 38:23 teach about God's ultimate plan for humanity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_38_23_God_s_rule_over_nations.htm">How does Ezekiel 38:23 demonstrate God's sovereignty over nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_God_s_judgment_in_Ez_38_23.htm">What is the significance of God's judgment in Ezekiel 38:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_38_23_and_divine_justice.htm">How does Ezekiel 38:23 relate to the concept of divine justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ezekiel_38.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ezekiel 38?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/russia's_role_in_biblical_prophecy.htm">What role does Russia play in biblical prophecy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/do_non-biblical_sources_support_ezekiel_23.htm">Do any ancient sources outside the Bible corroborate the nations' interventions described in Ezekiel 23, or is the account solely a theological narrative?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_does_ezekiel_38_5-6_align_with_other_prophecies.htm">How does the prophecy of a coalition of nations in Ezekiel 38:5&#8211;6 align or conflict with other biblical prophecies of end-time alliances?

Throughout Scripture, the Lord invites people to &#8220;Magnify the LORD with me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-3.htm">Psalm 34:3</a>). Here, however, He takes the initiative. By defeating the coalition of Gog (<a href="/ezekiel/38-18.htm">Ezekiel 38:18&#8211;22</a>), He will:<p>&#8226; Showcase His unmatched power, echoing the Red Sea deliverance (<a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Silence every rival claim to glory, fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>, where &#8220;the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.&#8221;<p>The message is simple: human schemes will only amplify God&#8217;s brilliance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and sanctify Myself</b><p>To sanctify is to set apart as holy.

Ezekiel has stressed this theme before: &#8220;I acted for the sake of My name, that it should not be profaned&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/20-9.htm">Ezekiel 20:9</a>). By judging evil, the Lord:<p>&#8226; Confirms His holiness (<a href="/isaiah/5-16.htm">Isaiah 5:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Separates Himself from every false deity that seeks equal footing (<a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>His people are assured that their God is never compromised by the wickedness He judges.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I will reveal Myself in the sight of many nations</b><p>Revelation here is public, unmistakable, and global.
