It underscores the distinction between God and man, highlighting the divine authority of the message Ezekiel is to deliver.<p><b>speak to the house of Israel,</b><br>The "house of Israel" refers to the entire nation, including both the northern and southern kingdoms. This phrase indicates that the message is directed to the collective people of God, emphasizing their shared history and responsibility. Historically, Israel was chosen as God's covenant people, and this address serves as a reminder of their identity and obligations.<p><b>and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says:</b><br>This phrase asserts the divine origin of the message, underscoring its authority and importance. The use of "Lord GOD" (Adonai Yahweh) emphasizes God's sovereignty and covenantal relationship with Israel. It is a reminder that the message is not Ezekiel's own but is delivered on behalf of the Almighty.<p><b>In this way also your fathers blasphemed Me</b><br>The reference to "your fathers" connects the current generation with their ancestors, highlighting a pattern of disobedience and rebellion against God. Blasphemy here involves more than just verbal disrespect; it encompasses actions that profane God's name and violate His covenant. This historical context points to Israel's repeated idolatry and unfaithfulness throughout their history, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a> and <a href="/judges/2.htm">Judges 2</a>.<p><b>by their unfaithfulness against Me.</b><br>Unfaithfulness signifies a breach of the covenant relationship, akin to spiritual adultery. This phrase underscores the gravity of Israel's sin, which is not merely a legal infraction but a personal betrayal of God. The concept of unfaithfulness is echoed in other prophetic writings, such as Hosea, where Israel's idolatry is likened to marital infidelity. This unfaithfulness is a type of the broader human condition, pointing to the need for redemption through Christ, who is the faithful bridegroom to the Church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

Judgment is not random; it flows from a settled record of disobedience.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Son of man&#8221; reminds Ezekiel of his role: a mortal messenger standing before the eternal God (see <a href="/ezekiel/2-1.htm">Ezekiel 2:1-3</a>; 3:17).<p>&#8226; God still speaks through chosen servants today, calling each generation to account just as He did through Ezekiel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Speak to the house of Israel</b><p>&#8226; The audience is covenant people who should know better&#8212;those redeemed from Egypt, entrusted with the law, yet repeatedly wayward (<a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s warnings are family conversations, not distant pronouncements.
