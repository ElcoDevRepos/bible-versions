The context is a vision of a future temple and its surrounding environment, which begins in <a href="/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40</a>. Ezekiel, a priest and prophet during the Babylonian exile, is being shown a vision of restoration and hope for Israel. The arrival signifies a transition point in the vision, emphasizing the importance of what Ezekiel is about to witness.<p><b>I saw a great number of trees</b><br>The presence of a great number of trees symbolizes life, abundance, and healing. In biblical symbolism, trees often represent life and prosperity (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, <a href="/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a>). The abundance of trees suggests a reversal of the desolation experienced during the exile, pointing to a time of restoration and blessing. This imagery can also be seen as a type of the spiritual life and fruitfulness found in Christ, who is the source of living water (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>).<p><b>along both banks of the river</b><br>The river in Ezekiel's vision flows from the temple, symbolizing the life-giving presence of God. The geographical setting of trees along both banks suggests a fertile and thriving ecosystem, reminiscent of the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/2-10.htm">Genesis 2:10</a>). This imagery is echoed in <a href="/revelation/22.htm">Revelation 22:1-2</a>, where the river of the water of life flows from the throne of God, with the tree of life on either side. The river and its banks represent the spiritual nourishment and healing that come from God's presence, foreshadowing the ultimate restoration in the new creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the vision of the river flowing from the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_river.htm">The River</a></b><br>Symbolic of life and healing, this river flows from the temple, representing God's presence and blessing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_trees.htm">The Trees</a></b><br>These trees symbolize life, fruitfulness, and healing, growing along the banks of the river.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The source of the river, representing God's dwelling place and the origin of spiritual life and blessing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision.htm">The Vision</a></b><br>This vision is part of a larger prophetic revelation given to Ezekiel, illustrating the restoration and renewal that comes from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_the_source_of_life.htm">God as the Source of Life</a></b><br>Just as the river flows from the temple, God is the ultimate source of spiritual life and renewal.

The prophet sees this scene only after the water has grown from a trickle to a river he cannot cross, underscoring that God&#8217;s work unfolds in stages (<a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The river originates in the presence of God, just as in <a href="/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>, where a river &#8220;proceeds from the throne of God and of the Lamb.&#8221; The same God provides life-giving water in both visions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I saw</b><p>&#8226; Ezekiel&#8217;s personal testimony&#8212;&#8220;I saw&#8221;&#8212;underscores the reliability of the vision (<a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>; 43:3). He is not repeating hearsay but reporting what God shows him directly.<p>&#8226; The phrase stresses that divine revelation is rooted in real observation. Like Daniel (&#8220;I, Daniel, was looking,&#8221; <a href="/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a>) and John (&#8220;I saw a new heaven and a new earth,&#8221; <a href="/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>), Ezekiel is a faithful eyewitness, inviting the reader to trust what he records.<p>&#8226; Scripture presents prophetic sight as a gift enabling God&#8217;s servants to convey His plans accurately (<a href="/numbers/24-4.htm">Numbers 24:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a great number of trees</b><p>&#8226; Trees symbolize life, stability, and blessing (<a href="/genesis/2-9.htm">Genesis 2:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>).

Kliefoth's conclusion is better, that the trees had been there all the while, but that the prophet's attention had not been directed to them.
