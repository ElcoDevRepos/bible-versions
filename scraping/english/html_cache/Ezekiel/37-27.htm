The concept of God dwelling with His people is rooted in the tabernacle and temple traditions, where God's presence was physically manifested among the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>, <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). This promise is a future hope for restoration and reconciliation, pointing towards the ultimate fulfillment in the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>). Theologically, it underscores the intimate relationship God desires with His people, a theme that is central to the narrative of redemption.<p><b>I will be their God,</b><br>This phrase reaffirms the covenant relationship between God and His people, a recurring theme in the Bible (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>). It emphasizes God's sovereignty and His commitment to His people, assuring them of His protection, guidance, and provision. Historically, this promise was crucial for the Israelites, especially during times of exile and hardship, as it reminded them of their unique identity and God's unchanging faithfulness. This declaration also foreshadows the new covenant established through Jesus Christ, where believers are grafted into this relationship (<a href="/romans/9-25.htm">Romans 9:25-26</a>).<p><b>and they will be My people.</b><br>This phrase completes the covenant formula, highlighting the reciprocal relationship between God and His people. It signifies a community set apart for God's purposes, called to live in obedience and holiness (<a href="/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>, <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9-10</a>). In the context of Ezekiel, this promise offered hope to the exiled Israelites, assuring them of restoration and a renewed identity. Prophetically, it points to the eschatological gathering of God's people from all nations, united under the lordship of Christ (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9-10</a>). This relationship is ultimately fulfilled in the Church, the body of Christ, where believers are called to reflect God's character and mission in the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were in exile in Babylon at the time of Ezekiel's prophecy.

God promises a &#8220;sanctuary in their midst forever&#8221; (v.26), anticipating the millennial temple pictured in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a> and, beyond that, the eternal city where &#8220;the tabernacle of God is among men&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>).<p>- Key idea: God Himself intends to take up permanent, visible residence on earth with His redeemed people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will be with them</b><p>- The phrase highlights nearness and fellowship. It echoes <a href="/leviticus/26-11.htm">Leviticus 26:11-12</a>: &#8220;I will make My dwelling among you&#8230; I will walk among you.&#8221;<p>- God&#8217;s presence means protection (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1-7</a>), guidance (<a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>), and joy (<a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>).<p>- In the New Testament the promise begins to be tasted through the indwelling Spirit (<a href="/john/14-17.htm">John 14:17</a>) and the church, &#8220;a dwelling in which God lives by His Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-22.htm">Ephesians 2:22</a>). Yet Ezekiel looks beyond the present era to a future, tangible manifestation when Christ reigns bodily on earth (<a href="/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will be their God</b><p>- This covenant formula stresses divine ownership and authority.
