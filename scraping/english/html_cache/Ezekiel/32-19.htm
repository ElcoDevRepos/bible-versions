In the biblical context, Egypt was often seen as a symbol of worldly power and beauty, yet here it is being questioned. This echoes the theme found in <a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13-15</a>, where the pride of Babylon is similarly addressed. The question implies that despite Egypt's perceived beauty and strength, it is not above judgment. Historically, Egypt was a dominant power, but its reliance on its own beauty and strength rather than on God led to its downfall. This can be seen as a warning against pride and self-reliance, a theme consistent throughout Scripture.<p><b>Go down and be placed with the uncircumcised!</b><br>This phrase signifies Egypt's impending judgment and humiliation. In the ancient Near Eastern context, being "uncircumcised" was synonymous with being outside the covenant community of God, often referring to Gentile nations that did not know or follow Yahweh. The imagery of "going down" suggests descending into Sheol, the realm of the dead, which is a common motif in prophetic literature (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9-11</a>). This is a prophetic declaration of Egypt's fate, aligning with the broader biblical narrative where nations that oppose God and His people face judgment. Theologically, it underscores the idea that no nation, regardless of its power or beauty, is exempt from divine justice. This also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and separation of those who are not in covenant with God, as seen in the eschatological teachings of the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Yet God exposes the illusion of superiority. Just as Tyre boasted, &#8220;I am perfect in beauty&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/27-3.htm">Ezekiel 27:3</a>), and Assyria was &#8220;beautiful in its greatness&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/31-7.htm">Ezekiel 31:7</a>), Egypt too has elevated itself.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently warns that outward glory cannot shield a nation from divine judgment (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-15.htm">Isaiah 10:15</a>). The comparison invites Pharaoh to survey the ruins of other &#8220;beautiful&#8221; kingdoms already judged and realize he is no different.<p>&#8226; Like the rich man in <a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19&#8211;23</a>, earthly magnificence proves worthless when the Lord calls time. Egypt&#8217;s pride will not spare it from the fate already sealed for others (<a href="/ezekiel/28-12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go down</b><p>The command follows without pause: &#8220;Go down&#8221;.<p>&#8226; This is God&#8217;s verdict, not a suggestion. The phrase pictures a forced descent into Sheol, &#8220;the depths of the earth&#8221; where other fallen nations reside (<a href="/ezekiel/26-20.htm">Ezekiel 26:20</a>; 31:14-16).<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9-11</a> portrays a similar scene where the realm of the dead stirs at the arrival of a toppled ruler. Egypt, once towering along the Nile, now marches the same downward road.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Go down&#8221; also underscores divine sovereignty&#8212;Pharaoh cannot resist, negotiate, or delay. What a contrast to Exodus, where Pharaoh hardened his heart; here the Lord hardens the sentence, and Pharaoh must obey.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Be placed with the uncircumcised</b><p>The humiliation deepens: &#8220;and be placed with the uncircumcised!&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Circumcision was practiced in Egypt, so to die &#8220;the death of the uncircumcised&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/28-10.htm">Ezekiel 28:10</a>) signified total loss of covenant privilege and honor. Egypt will lie among those outside God&#8217;s promises, indistinguishable from pagan enemies (<a href="/jeremiah/9-25.htm">Jeremiah 9:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; This placement is permanent. <a href="/ezekiel/32-21.htm">Ezekiel 32:21</a> pictures mighty warriors already in the pit greeting Egypt with scorn. To share their lot is to share their shame.<p>&#8226; The warning echoes forward: only a heart made right with God truly separates His people from the uncircumcised of heart (<a href="/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28-29</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-13</a>). National rituals or external beauty cannot substitute for genuine submission to the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/32-19.htm">Ezekiel 32:19</a> strips Egypt of its boast. God asks, &#8220;Whom do you surpass in beauty?&#8221;&#8212;answer: no one. Commanded to &#8220;Go down,&#8221; Pharaoh must surrender to judgment. Finally, to &#8220;be placed with the uncircumcised&#8221; seals Egypt&#8217;s disgrace among all who die outside covenant grace. The verse declares that prideful splendor cannot avert God&#8217;s righteous sentence; only humble dependence on Him secures lasting honor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">With the uncircumcised.--</span>See Note on <a href="/ezekiel/28-10.htm" title="You shall die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 28:10</a>.

The lamentation, as might be expected from Ezekiel's standpoint, is an illustration of irony and triumph rather than of sorrow. The question implies a negative answer. Glorious as Egypt had been, other nations had equaled her. They had passed away, and so should she. <span class="cmt_word">With the uncircumcised</span>. The words, as in <a href="/ezekiel/31-18.htm">Ezekiel 31:18</a>, suggest the thought that Israel, so far as it was faithful to its calling, circumcised in heart as well as flesh (<a href="/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a>), had a higher and happier dwelling in Hades than the uncircumcised heathen. As the Egyptians practiced circumcision, the language of the prophet had a special significance. Their place in Hades was among the heathen to whom that hereto was unknown. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/32-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8216;Whom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">do you surpass in beauty?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1425;&#1502;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;m&#601;&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5276.htm">Strong's 5276: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be pleasant, delightful, or lovely</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Go down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3381.htm">Strong's 3381: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come or go down, descend</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and be placed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;k&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hofal - Imperative - masculine singular &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7901.htm">Strong's 7901: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lie down</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_854.htm">Strong's 854: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nearness, near, with, by, at, among</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the uncircumcised!</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;r&#234;&#183;l&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6189.htm">Strong's 6189: </a> </span><span class="str2">Having foreskin (uncircumcised)</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/32-19.htm">Ezekiel 32:19 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/32-19.htm">Ezekiel 32:19 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/32-19.htm">Ezekiel 32:19 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/32-19.htm">Ezekiel 32:19 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/32-19.htm">Ezekiel 32:19 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/32-19.htm">Ezekiel 32:19  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/32-19.htm">Ezekiel 32:19 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/32-19.htm">Ezekiel 32:19 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/32-19.htm">Ezekiel 32:19 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/32-19.htm">Ezekiel 32:19 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/32-19.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 32:19 Whom do you pass in beauty?
