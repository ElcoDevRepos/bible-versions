Historically, Nebuchadnezzar besieged Tyre for many years, and although he did not gain much material wealth from Tyre itself, God promised him Egypt as compensation. This reflects the biblical principle that God is sovereign over nations and uses them to accomplish His purposes. The land of Egypt, a symbol of wealth and power, was a significant reward, indicating the extent of God's control over earthly kingdoms.<p><b>because it was done for Me</b><br>This part emphasizes that Nebuchadnezzar's actions, though politically motivated, ultimately served God's divine plan. In the broader biblical narrative, God often uses pagan rulers to fulfill His purposes, as seen with Cyrus in <a href="/isaiah/45.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>. This underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and His ability to direct the affairs of nations to achieve His will. It also serves as a reminder that all actions, whether recognized or not, are under God's purview and can be used for His glory.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD</b><br>This declaration affirms the authority and certainty of the message. The use of "Lord GOD" (Yahweh Elohim) highlights both the covenantal and sovereign aspects of God's character. It assures the reader that the prophecy is not merely a human prediction but a divine decree. This phrase is a common prophetic formula that underscores the reliability and seriousness of the message, reminding the audience of God's ultimate authority over history and His faithfulness to His word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
