The "sword" represents the external military threat posed by the Babylonian army, which was known for its brutal conquests. Historically, sieges were common in ancient warfare, and cities often faced starvation and disease as a result. The "plague and famine" within the city walls indicate the dire conditions for those trapped inside. This reflects the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-21.htm">Deuteronomy 28:21-25</a>, where disobedience to God leads to such calamities. The imagery of sword, plague, and famine is also found in other prophetic books, such as Jeremiah and Lamentations, emphasizing the severity of God's judgment.<p><b>Those in the country will die by the sword,</b><br>The countryside, typically seen as a place of refuge, is no longer safe. The Babylonians would have ravaged the rural areas, killing those who attempted to flee or resist. This reflects the comprehensive nature of the judgment, leaving no place of safety. The sword symbolizes not only physical death but also divine retribution, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>, where God warns of scattering His people among the nations with a drawn sword behind them.<p><b>and those in the city will be devoured by famine and plague.</b><br>Within the besieged city, the inhabitants face starvation and disease, common consequences of prolonged sieges. The term "devoured" suggests an inescapable and consuming destruction. This aligns with the covenant curses in <a href="/leviticus/26-29.htm">Leviticus 26:29</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53</a>, where famine leads to extreme desperation. The mention of plague also recalls the plagues of Egypt, serving as a reminder of God's power and judgment. The conditions inside the city serve as a type of spiritual desolation, pointing to the need for repentance and foreshadowing the ultimate deliverance through Christ, who offers salvation from spiritual death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is delivering God's message of impending judgment on Jerusalem and Judah due to their persistent sin and rebellion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city facing imminent destruction due to its inhabitants' idolatry and disobedience to God.
