In biblical times, a name represented one's character and authority. God's actions are often motivated by the desire to uphold His holy name, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/48-9.htm">Isaiah 48:9-11</a>. This reflects the importance of God's name being revered and not associated with failure or unfaithfulness.<p><b>so that it would not be profaned</b><br>To profane means to treat something sacred with disrespect. God's concern here is that His name would not be dishonored among the nations. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where Israel's actions directly impacted how God's holiness was perceived by others. The concept of holiness and the avoidance of profanation is a recurring theme in Leviticus and throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>in the eyes of the nations</b><br>The nations refer to the Gentile peoples surrounding Israel. God's actions were not only for Israel's benefit but also served as a testimony to the surrounding nations. This highlights the missional aspect of Israel's calling, to be a light to the nations, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>. God's dealings with Israel were meant to demonstrate His power and righteousness to the world.<p><b>in whose sight I had brought them out</b><br>This refers to the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history where God delivered them from slavery in Egypt. The Exodus was a public demonstration of God's power and faithfulness, witnessed by other nations. It served as a testament to God's ability to save and His commitment to His people, as recounted in <a href="/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7-12</a>.
