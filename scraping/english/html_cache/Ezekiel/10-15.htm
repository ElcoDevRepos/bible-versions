In Ezekiel's vision, they are depicted as part of the divine chariot or throne of God, symbolizing His majesty and sovereignty. The act of rising upward signifies movement and action, indicating God's presence is not static but dynamic. This movement can be seen as a representation of God's readiness to execute judgment or to depart from the temple, as the context of Ezekiel involves the impending judgment on Jerusalem. The cherubim's upward movement also reflects the heavenly nature of their mission, as they are not bound to the earthly realm.<p><b>These were the living creatures I had seen by the River Kebar.</b><br>The reference to the living creatures connects this vision to Ezekiel's earlier vision in chapter 1, where he first encountered these beings by the River Kebar. The River Kebar, likely a canal near Babylon, is significant as it represents the place of exile for the Israelites. This geographical context underscores the theme of God's presence with His people even in exile. The living creatures, identified as cherubim in this chapter, serve as a reminder of God's glory and His continued involvement with His people despite their circumstances. The consistency in the description of these creatures between the two visions emphasizes the reliability and continuity of Ezekiel's prophetic experience. This connection also highlights the unity of God's message and His unchanging nature throughout the visions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book and the one receiving the vision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings associated with the presence and glory of God, often depicted as guardians of sacred spaces.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/living_creatures.htm">Living Creatures</a></b><br>These are the same beings Ezekiel saw in his earlier vision by the River Kebar, identified as cherubim in this passage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/river_kebar.htm">River Kebar</a></b><br>A canal near Babylon where Ezekiel received his initial vision of God's glory and the living creatures.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/vision_of_god's_glory.htm">Vision of God's Glory</a></b><br>The event in which Ezekiel sees the glory of God departing from the temple, symbolized by the movement of the cherubim.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_holiness.htm">Understanding God's Holiness</a></b><br>The presence of the cherubim signifies the holiness and majesty of God.
