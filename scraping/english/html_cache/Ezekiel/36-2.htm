It is a common prophetic formula used throughout the Old Testament to signify that the following message is not from the prophet himself but from God. This underscores the importance and seriousness of the message. Similar introductions can be found in other prophetic books, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah, where God directly addresses His people or their adversaries.<p><b>Because the enemy has said of you:</b><br>The "enemy" here refers to the surrounding nations, particularly Edom and other adversaries of Israel, who have taken advantage of Israel's weakened state. Historically, these nations often sought to exploit Israel during times of vulnerability, such as during the Babylonian exile. This reflects a recurring theme in the Old Testament where Israel's enemies mock or plot against them, as seen in Psalms and Lamentations.<p><b>&#8216;Aha!</b><br>This expression is one of derision and triumph, indicating the enemy's gloating over Israel's misfortune. It is an exclamation of scorn, similar to other instances in the Psalms where adversaries express joy over Israel's troubles. This highlights the contempt and hostility that Israel faced from surrounding nations.<p><b>The ancient heights have become our possession,&#8217;</b><br>The "ancient heights" refer to the high places in the land of Israel, which were often sites of worship and held significant cultural and religious importance. These locations were not only strategic military points but also symbolized the spiritual heritage of Israel. The enemy's claim to these heights signifies a deeper attempt to usurp Israel's land and spiritual legacy. This echoes the broader biblical narrative of the Promised Land and God's covenant with Israel, as seen in Genesis and Deuteronomy. The enemy's claim is ultimately futile, as God promises restoration and vindication for His people, a theme that runs throughout Ezekiel and other prophetic books.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and covenant-keeping God of Israel, who speaks through Ezekiel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_enemy.htm">The Enemy</a></b><br>Refers to the surrounding nations, particularly Edom, who rejoiced over Israel's downfall and sought to claim their land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ancient_heights.htm">The Ancient Heights</a></b><br>Symbolic of the land of Israel, particularly the high places that were often sites of worship and significance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who are in exile and whose land is being coveted by their enemies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>Despite the enemy's claims, God remains in control and has a plan for His people.

At the same time, Plumptre's suggestion ('Ezekiel: an Ideal Biography,' <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, vol. 8:284; and Unpublished Notes) is not without plausibility, that, considering the special significance of the term bamoth in Ezekiel, the phrase should be held as referring to the sanctuaries which stood upon those heights - including, of course, the chief sanctuary, or temple (Schroder); in support of which the dean cites the frequency with which the enemies of Israel, as, for instance, the Assyrians and the Moabites, in their inscriptions, boasted that they had captured these sanctuaries (see 'Records of the Past,' 2nd series, tel. 1. p. 107;
