The mention of Elam in this context reflects its historical enmity with Israel and its eventual downfall. The "multitudes around her grave" suggests a collective judgment, indicating that not only the leaders but also the people of Elam face divine retribution. This imagery of a grave signifies the finality of their judgment and the end of their influence.<p><b>All of them are slain, fallen by the sword&#8212;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the violent end that has come upon Elam. The sword is often a symbol of divine judgment in the Bible, representing God's instrument of justice. The historical context may refer to the various military defeats Elam suffered, particularly at the hands of the Assyrians and later the Babylonians. This serves as a reminder of the consequences of opposing God's people and His purposes.<p><b>those who went down uncircumcised to the earth below,</b><br>In the Hebrew context, circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and His people. To be "uncircumcised" was to be outside of this covenant, symbolizing spiritual impurity and separation from God. The phrase "earth below" refers to Sheol, the abode of the dead, indicating that these individuals died without the hope of covenantal relationship with God.<p><b>who once spread their terror in the land of the living.</b><br>Elam was known for its military prowess and had instilled fear in neighboring nations. This phrase highlights the reversal of fortunes; those who once caused terror are now themselves subject to terror in death. It serves as a warning against pride and reliance on military might, echoing themes found throughout the prophetic books.<p><b>They bear their disgrace with those who descend to the Pit.</b><br>The "Pit" is another term for Sheol, the place of the dead. Bearing disgrace in this context means that Elam's downfall is not only physical but also carries a lasting shame. This aligns with the biblical theme of divine justice, where the proud and wicked are brought low. The disgrace is shared with other nations and individuals who have similarly opposed God, reinforcing the idea of collective judgment and the ultimate futility of opposing God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elam.htm">Elam</a></b><br>An ancient kingdom located in what is now southwestern Iran.

The verse is a sober reminder that judgment is real, personal, and inescapable&#8212;and that only covenant relationship with the living God delivers from the fate of the Pit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">There is Elam.--</span>Jeremiah had already prophesied against Elam twelve years before (<a href="/jeremiah/49-34.htm" title="The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,">Jeremiah 49:34</a>). Elam is substantially equivalent to Persia, and had been repeatedly conquered by Assyria and Chaldaea. It was a fierce and warlike nation, and its soldiers had long served in Nebuchadnezzar's army. It was by the aid of Persia that he had succeeded in overthrowing Assyria. It was by a subsequent union of the same Power with the Medes that the Babylonian power was overthrown. Not until after that union did Persia become a very prominent nation. It continued a great Power until its conquest by Alexander. The prophet is therefore anticipating the events of the future when he represents Elam as already in the pit. But, as before said, his thought looks on to the ultimate result, without making prominent the comparative dates of the future. It is possible, however, so far to separate Elam from Persia as to look upon the former as one of those nations out of whose ruins the latter arose, and in this case Elam was already past. The former interpretation seems preferable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is Elam</span> etc. The nation so named appears grouped with Asshur in <a href="/genesis/10-22.htm">Genesis 10:22</a>; in <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a> it stands between Cush and Shinar; in <a href="/isaiah/22-6.htm">Isaiah 22:6</a> its warriors form part of the host of Sennacherib; in <a href="/ezra/4-9.htm">Ezra 4:9</a> they are named as having been among the settlers in Samaria; in <a href="/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a> as joining with the Medes in the attack on Babylon; in <a href="/jeremiah/25-25.htm">Jeremiah 25:25</a> again coupled with the Medes among the enemies of Nebuchadnezzar; in <a href="/daniel/8-2.htm">Daniel 8:2</a> as the province in which Shushan was situated, and therefore subject to Babylon.
