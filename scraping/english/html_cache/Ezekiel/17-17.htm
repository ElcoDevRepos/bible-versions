Historically, Egypt was a powerful nation with a formidable military force, often seen as a potential ally against Babylonian aggression. However, the reliance on Egypt for military support was a common but misguided strategy for Judah, as seen in other biblical accounts (<a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-5</a>). The "mighty army and vast horde" emphasizes Egypt's perceived strength and resources, yet it also highlights the futility of trusting in human power rather than in God.<p><b>will not help him in battle</b><br>This indicates the failure of Egypt to provide the expected assistance to Zedekiah, the king of Judah, against the Babylonian siege. Historically, Egypt's intervention was either too late or ineffective, as recorded in <a href="/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5-10</a>. This serves as a reminder of the unreliability of earthly alliances and the importance of seeking divine guidance and support. Theologically, it underscores the theme of divine sovereignty and judgment, where God uses nations to fulfill His purposes, regardless of human plans.<p><b>when ramps are built and siege walls constructed</b><br>The construction of siege ramps and walls was a common military tactic in ancient warfare, used to breach city defenses. Archaeological evidence from sites like Lachish provides insight into these methods, showing the intense and methodical nature of ancient sieges. This phrase paints a vivid picture of the impending destruction and the inevitability of Jerusalem's fall, as prophesied by Ezekiel. It also reflects the fulfillment of God's warnings through His prophets about the consequences of disobedience and rebellion.<p><b>to destroy many lives</b><br>The phrase highlights the tragic outcome of the siege, resulting in significant loss of life. This serves as a sobering reminder of the cost of sin and rebellion against God. The destruction of Jerusalem and the loss of life were not only historical events but also served as a prophetic warning to future generations. In a broader biblical context, it points to the ultimate judgment and the need for repentance and faith in God's salvation plan. Theologically, it foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who offers life and redemption to those who trust in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, representing worldly power and alliances that are ultimately unreliable.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mighty_army_and_great_company.htm">Mighty Army and Great Company</a></b><br>Symbolizes human strength and resources that are often trusted instead of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/siege_ramps_and_walls.htm">Siege Ramps and Walls</a></b><br>Represents the instruments of warfare and destruction, indicating the futility of relying on human defenses.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>The prophet delivering God's message, warning against misplaced trust.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The kingdom that sought help from Egypt, illustrating the consequences of turning away from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_worldly_alliances.htm">The Futility of Worldly Alliances</a></b><br>Trusting in human power and alliances, like Judah did with Egypt, leads to disappointment and failure.

Scripture treats this description as literal history&#8212;Egypt really did muster a &#8220;mighty army and vast horde&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5</a>). Yet the verse already hints that mere numbers do not equal true strength. &#8226; Israel had often been tempted to lean on Egypt&#8217;s military prowess (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1-3</a>), forgetting that &#8220;the LORD saves not with sword and spear&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>). &#8226; Ezekiel later underscores how unreliable Egypt is: &#8220;You have been a staff of reed&#8230; when they leaned on you, you broke and tore their shoulders&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/29-6.htm">Ezekiel 29:6-7</a>). God is reminding His people that human alliances, however impressive, cannot replace humble dependence on Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will not help him in battle</b><p>The &#8220;him&#8221; is King Zedekiah of Judah (<a href="/2_kings/24-20.htm">2 Kings 24:20</a>). Though Zedekiah broke covenant with Babylon and pinned his hopes on Egyptian rescue, the Lord plainly says Pharaoh &#8220;will not help.&#8221; Jeremiah heard the same word: &#8220;The Chaldeans&#8230; will return and fight against this city; they will capture it&#8221; even after Egypt&#8217;s army appears (<a href="/jeremiah/37-7.htm">Jeremiah 37:7-10</a>). What seems like a sure-fire strategy collapses because: &#8226; God had decreed judgment for covenant treachery (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13-16</a>). &#8226; Trust in flesh always disappoints (<a href="/psalms/118-8.htm">Psalm 118:8-9</a>). The lesson is stark&#8212;no alliance can overturn God&#8217;s declared purpose.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when ramps are built</b><p>&#8220;Ramps&#8221; speaks of the earthen siege mounds Babylonians routinely heaped against city walls (<a href="/jeremiah/32-24.htm">Jeremiah 32:24</a>). Ezekiel earlier dramatized this tactic by drawing a model of Jerusalem and setting up &#8220;siege ramps&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/4-2.htm">Ezekiel 4:2</a>). The prophetic detail reassures believers that God&#8217;s word matches the facts on the ground. As Babylon&#8217;s engineers piled soil and timber, every shovel-full confirmed the prophecy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and siege walls constructed</b><p>Alongside ramps came wooden or stone &#8220;siege walls&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-4.htm">Jeremiah 52:4</a>). These fortifications let the invaders move closer under cover. The careful mention of both ramps and walls shows that Babylon&#8217;s assault would be thorough, systematic, and unstoppable until God&#8217;s sentence was finished (<a href="/ezekiel/21-22.htm">Ezekiel 21:22</a>). Judah&#8217;s sin had erected its own barrier between the nation and divine protection (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>), so an enemy wall now rose against them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to destroy many lives</b><p>The heartbreaking outcome&#8212;loss of life&#8212;was never God&#8217;s delight (<a href="/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>), yet it was the inevitable wage of persistent rebellion. Jeremiah predicted sword, famine, and plague (<a href="/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a>); Ezekiel foretold one-third slain, one-third consumed by famine, one-third scattered (<a href="/ezekiel/5-10.htm">Ezekiel 5:10-12</a>). The phrase reminds us that sin ripples outward, harming &#8220;many lives,&#8221; not just the original rebels. At the same time, the faithful remnant could rest in God&#8217;s promise to &#8220;preserve a few&#8221; and ultimately bring restoration (<a href="/ezekiel/6-8.htm">Ezekiel 6:8</a>; 11:17).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a> declares that Egypt&#8217;s formidable might would prove useless because God had decreed Babylon&#8217;s victory over Judah. Every step of the siege&#8212;ramps piled high, walls erected, lives lost&#8212;played out exactly as spoken, underscoring Scripture&#8217;s absolute reliability. The verse calls believers, then and now, to abandon confidence in worldly alliances and rely wholly on the Lord, whose word never fails.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">By casting up mounts.--</span>This translation implies that "the casting up mounts and building forts" were to be the act of Pharaoh; but such things are done not by the relieving, but by the besieging army.

Pharaoh did him no good--did not "make for him in the war." The Chaldaeans speedily returned, drove away the Egyptians, and renewed the siege, finally capturing and burning the city.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By casting up mounts,</span> etc.; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">when they cast up mounts</span>.

The Egyptians, Ezekiel predicts, would be powerless to prevent that second and decisive siege.
