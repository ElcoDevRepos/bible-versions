It reflects the prophetic experience where God's Spirit enables the prophet to see visions or receive revelations. This lifting up is symbolic of divine intervention and guidance, similar to other instances in Ezekiel (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/3-12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12, 8</a>:3).<p><b>and brought me to the gate of the house of the LORD that faces east.</b><br>The east gate of the temple holds significant importance in biblical prophecy and symbolism. It is often associated with the glory of the Lord entering and departing (<a href="/ezekiel/43.htm">Ezekiel 43:1-4</a>). The eastward direction is also significant in biblical geography, as it is the direction from which God's glory returns to the temple, symbolizing restoration and hope.<p><b>And there at the entrance of the gate were twenty-five men.</b><br>The presence of twenty-five men may symbolize the leaders or representatives of the people, possibly including priests and elders. This number could be significant, as it might represent the 24 divisions of priests plus the high priest, or it could be a symbolic number representing the leadership of Israel. Their location at the temple gate suggests their role in religious and civic matters.<p><b>Among them I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah,</b><br>Jaazaniah and Pelatiah are identified by name, indicating their prominence and possibly their notoriety. Naming them highlights their specific roles or actions that are significant in the context of the vision. These individuals may have been known for leading the people astray or for their opposition to God's true prophets.<p><b>who were leaders of the people.</b><br>This phrase underscores the responsibility and influence these men held over the community. As leaders, their actions and decisions would have had significant impact on the spiritual and social state of the people.

The same Spirit later transports Philip in <a href="/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39</a>, showing a consistent biblical pattern of divine movement.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereign hand is evident; the prophet moves at the Spirit&#8217;s initiative, echoing <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7</a> &#8211;

There he confronts twenty-five influential men, including Jaazaniah and Pelatiah, whose corrupt leadership fuels national rebellion. By spotlighting specific individuals at the place of justice, God demonstrates His intimate awareness of sin and His resolve to hold leaders accountable, yet He also hints at future restoration when His glory comes back through the same gate.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Brought me unto the east gate of the Lord's house.</span>--This is the same place, the main outer entrance to the whole Temple enclosure, to which the prophet had seen the cherubim go (<a href="/ezekiel/10-19.htm" title="And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside them, and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.">Ezekiel 10:19</a>). It is not expressly said where he was brought from; but the last place mentioned was the court of the priests (<a href="/ezekiel/8-16.htm" title="And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.">Ezekiel 8:16</a>), and so far the vision appears to be consecutive. Standing in that innermost court, he had seen the Divine presence go forth to the outer entrance; and he also is now transported thither.<p>Here he sees twenty-five men, the same number whom he had seen worshipping the sun in the inner court. They appear, however, to have been priests, while these seem to be secular leaders. Hence they are generally supposed to be a different set of men. It is nevertheless by no means impossible that they may be the same idolatrous priests, who, by prostituting their holy office to idolatry, gained an ascendancy over a sinful people. Otherwise, the number twenty-five may represent the king, with two princes from each of the twelve tribes; or is possibly a number without any other especial significance than as representing a considerable array of the most prominent people of the nation. Two of these are mentioned by name. If the Jaazaniah here is the same with the Jaazaniah of <a href="/ezekiel/8-11.htm" title="And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the middle of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.">Ezekiel 8:11</a>, it settles the point that the men here are not to be understood of the priests, since he there represented a different class (see Note on <a href="/ezekiel/8-11.htm" title="And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the middle of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.">Ezekiel 8:11</a>). The names are significant: Jaazaniah = Jehovah hears, son of Azur = the helper; Pelatiah = God rescues, son of Benaiah =Jehovah builds. Names of this sort were common enough among the Jews, but they seem here intended to bring out the false hopes with which the people beguiled themselves; and in view of this, the sudden death of Pelatiah (verse. 13) was particularly impressive. These princes were active in misleading the people to their destruction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover the Spirit lifted me up,</span> etc. It is noticeable that the position to which Ezekiel was thus transported in his vision from his place in the inner court (<a href="/ezekiel/8-14.htm">Ezekiel 8:14</a>), was identical with that which he had just seen occupied by the cherub chariot before its departure (<a href="/ezekiel/10-19.htm">Ezekiel 10:19</a>). What he is about to see will throw light on the significance of their departure. The gate is probably, here as there, that of the court of the temple. <span class="cmt_word">Five and twenty men.</span> The number at first reminds us of the worshippers of the sun, in <a href="/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>; but that, as we saw, was probably a company of priests. On the other hand, the two who are named are styled <span class="cmt_word">princes of the people,</span> which suggests a lay rather than a priestly status, and they are seen in a different locality. Conjectures as to the significance of the number vary. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Two from each tribe of Israel, with the king at their head. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Two from each of the twelve divisions of the army, each containing twenty-four thousand men (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-1.htm">1 Chronicles 27:1-15</a>). <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Representatives of twelve regions of the city - a kind of municipal council, with their president. Possibly, after all, the number was used more or less vaguely - a "round" number, as we say (Smend). It is probably safe, however, to think of them as representing the lay element of authority. Nothing is known further as to the persons named. Jaazaniah is distinguished by his parentage from his namesake of <a href="/ezekiel/8-11.htm">Ezekiel 8:11</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/35-3.htm">Jeremiah 35:3</a>. Both were probably familiar to those for whom Ezekiel wrote, as leaders of the party that was "always devising mischief," in opposition, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to Jeremiah and the true prophets. Possibly the meanings of the names <span class="cmt_word">Jaazaniah</span> (equivalent to "God hearkens") the son of Azur (equivalent to "The Helper"), <span class="cmt_word">Pelatiah</span> (equivalent to "God rescues") <span class="cmt_word">the son of Benaiah</span> (equivalent to "God builds"), are chosen as with a grim irony. The name of Azur meets us in <a href="/jeremiah/28-1.htm">Jeremiah 28:1</a> as that of the father of the false prophet Hananiah. The death of Pelatiah was probably an historical event to which the prophet pointed as a warning to those who, either at Jerusalem or among the exiles, were speaking as he spoke. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/11-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the Spirit</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#363;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7307.htm">Strong's 7307: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wind, breath, exhalation, life, anger, unsubstantiality, a region of the sky, spirit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">lifted me up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;ti&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
