The mention of "elders" suggests experienced and knowledgeable artisans, emphasizing the high quality of workmanship. This reflects the importance of maritime trade in the ancient Near East and the reliance on skilled labor to maintain the integrity of ships. The imagery of repairing leaks symbolizes efforts to maintain the strength and prosperity of Tyre, the city being addressed in this chapter. In a broader biblical context, the use of skilled laborers can be seen in the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem (<a href="/1_kings/5-18.htm">1 Kings 5:18</a>), highlighting the value placed on craftsmanship.<p><b>All the ships of the sea and their sailors came alongside to barter for your merchandise.</b><br>This phrase underscores Tyre's role as a major hub of international trade. The city's strategic location on the Mediterranean coast made it a focal point for commerce, attracting ships from various regions. The act of bartering indicates a thriving economy based on the exchange of goods, a common practice in ancient times. This scene reflects the interconnectedness of ancient civilizations through trade and the wealth that such interactions brought to Tyre. The imagery of ships and sailors also evokes the idea of the sea as a conduit for cultural and economic exchange, similar to the description of the merchants of the earth in <a href="/revelation/18-11.htm">Revelation 18:11-13</a>, where the fall of a great commercial city is lamented.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders_of_gebal.htm">Elders of Gebal</a></b><br>Gebal, also known as Byblos, was an ancient Phoenician city renowned for its skilled craftsmen and builders.

The literal details emphasize Tyre&#8217;s unmatched maritime prowess while hinting at her fragility&#8212;constant leaks, dependence on human skill, and a market that will collapse under God&#8217;s judgment. The verse reminds believers that worldly success, however well-maintained, cannot withstand the Lord&#8217;s righteous verdict, urging trust in His unshakable kingdom instead.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">The ancients of Gebal.</span>--"The ancients" is a thoroughly Semitic expression for the prominent men of a city. Gebal, the ancient Byblos, the modern Gebeil, and the Gu-ba-lu of the Assyrian inscriptions, was a famous Ph?nician town just north of Beir-t. Its site is still rich in ruins. Its people were famous builders, and according to the margin of <a href="/1_kings/5-18.htm" title="And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stone squarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.">1Kings 5:18</a> (so also the Septuagint and Vulgate) were employed by Solomon on the work of the Temple. The representation is that the whole widely-dispersed Ph?nician race were tributary to the works of Tyre. At this point the figure of the ship gives place for a time to plain language, the better to set forth the military resources and power of this great city.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ancients of Gebal</span>.

Byblus was situated on an eminence overlooking the river Adonis between Beirut and Tripoli. Its modern name, <span class="accented">Gebail</span>, retains the old Semitic form, and its ruins abound in marble and granite columns of Phoenician and Egyptian workmanship. The work of the <span class="cmt_word">caulkers</span> was to stop the chinks of the ship, and the men of Gebal appear to have been especially skilful in this.
