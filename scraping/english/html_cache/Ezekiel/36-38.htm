The appointed feasts refer to the three major pilgrimage festivals: Passover, Shavuot (Pentecost), and Sukkot (Tabernacles), when Israelites were required to bring offerings to the temple. These events were marked by large gatherings and numerous sacrifices, symbolizing worship, community, and divine blessing. The imagery of numerous flocks suggests a future time of prosperity and spiritual renewal for Israel, reminiscent of the vibrant religious life centered around the temple.<p><b>so the ruined cities will be filled with flocks of people</b><br>The comparison of people to flocks indicates a return to populous and thriving communities in the cities that were once desolate. This restoration is a reversal of the judgment and exile experienced by Israel due to their disobedience. The imagery of flocks also suggests care and guidance, as a shepherd tends to his sheep, implying that God will oversee the return and flourishing of His people. This promise of restoration is consistent with other prophetic visions, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/33-12.htm">Jeremiah 33:12-13</a>, where desolate places are revived.<p><b>Then they will know that I am the LORD.</b><br>This concluding phrase emphasizes the ultimate purpose of God's actions: the recognition of His sovereignty and faithfulness. Throughout the book of Ezekiel, this refrain underscores the divine intention behind both judgment and restoration. The acknowledgment of God as LORD signifies a restored relationship between God and His people, characterized by obedience and worship. This recognition is not only for Israel but serves as a testimony to the nations, fulfilling the covenant promise that through Israel, all nations would be blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). The phrase also points to the eschatological hope of a future where God's presence is fully realized among His people, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel conveyed God's messages of judgment and restoration to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central city of worship for the Israelites, known for its temple and religious feasts.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruined_cities.htm">Ruined Cities</a></b><br>Refers to the cities of Israel that were devastated due to the people's disobedience and subsequent exile.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/flock_for_sacrifices.htm">Flock for Sacrifices</a></b><br>Symbolizes the people of Israel, likened to sacrificial animals, emphasizing their role in worship and dedication to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/appointed_feasts.htm">Appointed Feasts</a></b><br>These are the significant religious festivals in Jerusalem, such as Passover, which drew large gatherings of people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_hope.htm">Restoration and Hope</a></b><br>God's promise to fill the ruined cities with people signifies hope and restoration.
