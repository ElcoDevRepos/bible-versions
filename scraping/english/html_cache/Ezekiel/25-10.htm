The "it" refers to the territories of Moab and Seir, as mentioned in the preceding verses. The "people of the East" likely refers to nomadic tribes such as the Babylonians or other groups from the Arabian desert. Historically, these tribes were known for their invasions and conquests. This judgment reflects God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to use one nation to execute judgment on another. The Ammonites, descendants of Lot, had a history of enmity with Israel, and their judgment is consistent with God's promises to protect His people and punish their adversaries.<p><b>so that the Ammonites will no longer be remembered among the nations</b><br>This phrase signifies the complete obliteration of the Ammonites' identity and influence. In biblical terms, to not be remembered among the nations implies total destruction and loss of cultural and national identity. This prophecy aligns with other biblical passages where God promises to erase the memory of certain nations due to their sins and opposition to His people (e.g., <a href="/psalms/83-4.htm">Psalm 83:4</a>). The Ammonites' disappearance serves as a warning of the consequences of persistent rebellion against God. Historically, the Ammonites did indeed fade from prominence, fulfilling this prophecy. This also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and restoration themes found in eschatological passages, where God will establish His kingdom and remove all opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A nation descended from Lot, located east of the Dead Sea.

By saying &#8220;along with the Ammonites,&#8221; the Lord groups them with the very peoples who had mocked and opposed Israel (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/25-3.htm">Ezekiel 25:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/83-5.htm">Psalm 83:5-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Their alliance in sin earns an alliance in judgment, exactly as <a href="/proverbs/16-5.htm">Proverbs 16:5</a> warns: &#8220;Everyone who is proud in heart is detestable to the LORD; be assured, he will not go unpunished&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us that God&#8217;s justice is precise and corporate&#8212;He deals with nations collectively when they persist in rebellion (<a href="/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1-6</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As a possession</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Possession&#8221; means literal transfer of land and assets. Just as Israel once took Canaan (<a href="/joshua/1-3.htm">Joshua 1:3-4</a>), so the Ammonite territory will be seized.<p>&#8226; This fulfills the covenant principle of sowing and reaping: the Ammonites tried to possess Israel&#8217;s land (<a href="/ezekiel/21-28.htm">Ezekiel 21:28-29</a>), so their own inheritance is taken from them.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty over all geography stands out again (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>; <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To the people of the East</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;People of the East&#8221; points to nomadic desert tribes such as the Kedarenes and Nebaioth (<a href="/isaiah/60-7.htm">Isaiah 60:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-28.htm">Jeremiah 49:28-32</a>). History records these tribes moving westward into Ammonite territory after Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s campaigns.<p>&#8226; The transfer proves God&#8217;s ability to raise up unexpected instruments for His purposes (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6-11</a>).<p>&#8226; For Israel, it is reassurance that hostile borders can be rearranged by the Lord&#8217;s hand (<a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that the Ammonites will no longer be remembered</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;No longer be remembered&#8221; speaks of erasure from the stage of influential nations, not annihilation of every descendant.

Their contempt for Israel and pride against God bring a just, irreversible outcome. The verse underscores the Lord&#8217;s sovereign right to redistribute territory, raise up new powers, and silence nations that oppose His purposes&#8212;assuring His people that He always keeps His word and that arrogant opposition ultimately dissolves into forgotten history.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">With the Ammonites.</span>--The division between the verses here seriously obscures the sense. The meaning is that God will throw open Moab, as well as Ammon, to the sons of the east, and will give both nations in possession to them, so that Ammon shall be no more remembered, and judgment shall be executed on Moab. They were to be conquered and desolated by Nebuchadnezzar, but possessed by the Bedouins. The Ammonites and Moabites were nations so closely connected together that nearly all which has been said of the one applies to the other.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites</span>. The Authorized Version is obscure. What is meant is that the Moabites as well as the Ammonites were to be given to the nomadic tribes, the "children of the east," for a possession. The doom that Ammon was to be no more remembered (<a href="/ezekiel/21-32.htm">Ezekiel 21:32</a>) was to be carried out to the uttermost, and the children of the east were to complete what Nebuchadnezzar had begun. The utter destruction of Ammon was, as it were, uppermost in the prophet's thoughts, and that of Moab was but secondary. Historically, the words received a partial fulfillment in Nebuchadnezzar's conquests five years after the destruction of Jerusalem (Josephus,' Ant.,' 10:9.7, and M. yon Niebuhr's 'Geseh. Assurs,' p. 215), but the Ammonites were still an important people in the time of the Maccabees (1 Macc. 5:6, 30-45) and Justin Martyr ('Dial. cum Trypho, p. 272). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/25-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will give it</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1456;&#1514;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#7791;at&#183;t&#238;&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
