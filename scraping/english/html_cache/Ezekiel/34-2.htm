The "shepherds of Israel" refers to the leaders, including kings, priests, and prophets, who were responsible for guiding and caring for the people. In biblical context, shepherds symbolize leadership and care, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> and <a href="/john/10.htm">John 10</a>. The call to "prophesy against" indicates a divine judgment against these leaders for failing in their duties.<p><b>Prophesy and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says:</b><br>The repetition of "prophesy" underscores the urgency and importance of the message. "The Lord GOD" (YHWH Elohim) emphasizes the authority and sovereignty of God, who is delivering a direct message. This phrase establishes the divine origin of the prophecy, distinguishing it from human opinion.<p><b>&#8216;Woe to the shepherds of Israel, who only feed themselves!</b><br>"Woe" is a term of lament and impending judgment, often used by prophets to announce divine displeasure. The shepherds' self-serving behavior contrasts with their expected role of caring for the people. This selfishness is condemned in other scriptures, such as <a href="/jeremiah/23.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-2</a> and <a href="/zechariah/11-17.htm">Zechariah 11:17</a>, where leaders are criticized for neglecting their duties.<p><b>Should not the shepherds feed their flock?</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights the leaders' failure to fulfill their primary responsibility. The imagery of shepherds feeding their flock is a common biblical metaphor for leadership, as seen in <a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>, where Jesus instructs Peter to "feed my sheep."

In the passage in Jeremiah 23 they are treated under this name separately from the prophets and priests, and also in <a href="/jeremiah/2-8.htm" title="The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.">Jeremiah 2:8</a> they are distinguished from prophets and priests. The name itself is a peculiarly appropriate one, and seems to have been in use throughout the East, but especially in Israel, from the time when David was taken from the care of the flocks to feed the Lord's people. (Comp. <a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm" title="Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, you were he that led out and brought in Israel: and the LORD said to you, You shall feed my people Israel, and you shall be a captain over Israel.">2Samuel 5:2</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/78-70.htm" title="He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:">Psalm 78:70-71</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That do feed themselves.--</span>This selfishness is characteristic of the unfaithful shepherd (comp. <a href="/context/john/10-1.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.">John 10:1-17</a>), and is enlarged upon in <a href="/context/ezekiel/34-3.htm" title="You eat the fat, and you clothe you with the wool, you kill them that are fed: but you feed not the flock.">Ezekiel 34:3-4</a>. The history shows that for a long time it had been eminently true of the rulers, and especially of the kings of Israel. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prophesy against the shepherds of Israel</span>, etc. Our modern associations with the words, our use of terms like" the pastoral office," "the pastoral Epistles," lead us to think of the priests and prophets, the spiritual guides of the people, as being those whom the prophet has in view. In the language of the Old Testament, however, as in that of Homer ('Iliad,' 1:1. 263; 2:1. 85, etc.), the shepherds of the people are always its kings and other civil rulers (<a href="/1_kings/22-17.htm">1 Kings 22:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/77-20.htm">Psalm 77:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-71.htm">Psalm 78:71</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-6</a>), and those whom Ezekiel had in his thoughts were the tyrannous rulers of the house of David, like Jehoiakim and Zedekiah and their satellites. Our Christian thoughts of the word are the outcome of the leading of <a href="/john/10-1.htm">John 10:1-16</a>; <a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-4</a>; <a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; but it is probably true that even there the original thought is still dominant. Christ is the "good Shepherd," because he is the true King. His ministers are shepherds as being officers in his kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">Should not the shepherds feed the flocks?</span> The question is an appeal to the universal conscience of Israel and of mankind. No shepherd was worthy of his name who did not do that which the very name implied. He that neglects that duty is simply as a hireling or a robber (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10, 12</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of man,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1429;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">prophesy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5012.htm">Strong's 5012: </a> </span><span class="str2">To prophesy, speak, by inspiration</span><br /><br /><span class="word">against</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the shepherds</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8216;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7462.htm">Strong's 7462: </a> </span><span class="str2">To tend a, flock, pasture it, in, to graze, to rule, to associate with</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Prophesy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5012.htm">Strong's 5012: </a> </span><span class="str2">To prophesy, speak, by inspiration</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
