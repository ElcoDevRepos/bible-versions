In Hebrew, "Oholah" means "her tent," suggesting a place of worship or dwelling that is separate from God, while "Oholibah" means "my tent is in her," indicating God's presence or dwelling. This distinction highlights the spiritual infidelity of both cities, with Samaria representing the Northern Kingdom of Israel and Jerusalem the Southern Kingdom of Judah. The use of sister imagery underscores their shared heritage and covenant relationship with God, yet also their shared guilt in idolatry and unfaithfulness.<p><b>They became Mine and gave birth to sons and daughters.</b><br>This phrase reflects the covenant relationship between God and the people of Israel. "They became Mine" signifies God's choosing of Israel as His people, akin to a marriage covenant. The "sons and daughters" symbolize the generations of Israelites who were born into this covenant relationship. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where God is depicted as a husband to Israel (e.g., <a href="/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19-20</a>). The birth of sons and daughters also implies the continuation of the covenant promises made to the patriarchs, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>As for their identities, Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.</b><br>This clarifies the allegorical representation of the two cities. Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom, was known for its idolatry and alliances with foreign nations, which led to its downfall in 722 BC by the Assyrians. Jerusalem, the capital of the Southern Kingdom, despite having the temple and being the center of worship, also fell into idolatry and was eventually conquered by the Babylonians in 586 BC. The distinction between the two cities serves as a warning of the consequences of unfaithfulness to God. The prophetic message here is a call to repentance and a reminder of the judgment that comes from turning away from God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/oholah.htm">Oholah</a></b><br>Represents Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel.

(See Note there.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The occurrence of proper names is almost unique in the parables of the Bible, the Lazarus of <a href="/luke/16-20.htm">Luke 16:20</a> being the only other instance. Their meaning is sufficiently clear. <span class="cmt_word">Aholah</span> (but both names should begin with O rather than A) means "Her tent;" <span class="cmt_word">Aholibah</span>, "My tent is in her." A parallel, which may have suggested the names, is found in the <span class="accented">Aholibamah</span> (equivalent to "My tent is in the high place") of <a href="/genesis/36-2.htm">Genesis 36:2</a>, and another in the use of <span class="accented">Ohel</span> as a proper name in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-20.htm">1 Chronicles 3:20</a>. The common element of the two names is the word that is commonly used for the sacred tent or tabernacle in the Pentateuch and elsewhere. The distinctive element of each points to the fact that the worship in Samaria was unauthorized. Her "tent" was hers, not Jehovah's. Of Jerusalem with its temple Jehovah could say, "My tent is in her," and this, as magnifying her privilege, also aggravated her guilt. Keil and others take the adjective here, as in <a href="/ezekiel/16-46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46</a>, as meaning "greater" rather than "older." The former adjective is, of course, applicable to the greater power of the kingdom of the Ten Tribes, and, even if we retain the renderings of the Authorized Version, is probably the explanation of Samaria being named as the <span class="cmt_word">elder</span> of the two. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/23-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The older</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;w&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
