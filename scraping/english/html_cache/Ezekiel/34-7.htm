In ancient Near Eastern cultures, rulers and leaders were commonly depicted as shepherds of their people, responsible for their welfare and guidance. The term "shepherd" is used metaphorically to describe the role of kings, priests, and prophets. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages, such as <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where God is depicted as the ultimate Shepherd. The use of "therefore" indicates a conclusion or judgment based on previous statements, emphasizing the seriousness of the message.<p><b>hear the word of the LORD:</b><br>This command underscores the authority and divine origin of the message. The phrase "word of the LORD" is a common biblical expression indicating a direct communication from God, often through a prophet. In the context of Ezekiel, it signifies a prophetic declaration that demands attention and obedience. The call to "hear" implies not just listening but also understanding and acting upon the message. This is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where the failure to heed God's word often leads to judgment. The emphasis on hearing aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, the Shema, which calls Israel to listen and obey the LORD.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherds.htm">Shepherds</a></b><br>Symbolic of the leaders of Israel, including kings, priests, and prophets, who were responsible for guiding and caring for the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who is addressing the shepherds through Ezekiel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of God's chosen people, who are suffering due to the negligence of their leaders.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period during which the Israelites were exiled from their homeland, a backdrop to Ezekiel's prophecies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability_of_leaders.htm">Accountability of Leaders</a></b><br>Leaders are accountable to God for the care and guidance of those they lead.
