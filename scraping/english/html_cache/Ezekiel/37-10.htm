The act of prophesying as instructed highlights the role of the prophet as a faithful servant of God, emphasizing the importance of obedience in the life of a believer. This mirrors the broader biblical narrative where obedience to God's word leads to life and blessing, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. Ezekiel's actions also reflect the prophetic tradition where the prophet acts as a mouthpiece for God, delivering His messages to the people.<p><b>and the breath entered them</b><br>The breath entering the dry bones symbolizes the life-giving power of God's Spirit. In Hebrew, the word for breath, "ruach," can also mean spirit or wind, indicating the divine nature of this act. This imagery is reminiscent of the creation account in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where God breathes life into Adam, signifying the impartation of life and spirit. The breath entering the bones signifies a spiritual revival and renewal, pointing to the transformative power of God's Spirit in bringing life to what was once dead.<p><b>and they came to life</b><br>The transformation from death to life is a powerful image of resurrection and renewal. This phrase underscores the theme of hope and restoration, central to the message of <a href="/ezekiel/37.htm">Ezekiel 37</a>. It foreshadows the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the promise of eternal life for believers, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>. The coming to life of the bones serves as a metaphor for the restoration of Israel, both physically and spiritually, after the Babylonian exile.<p><b>and stood on their feet</b><br>The act of standing signifies strength, readiness, and empowerment. In biblical times, standing was often associated with being prepared for action or service. This phrase indicates that the once lifeless bones are now fully restored and ready to fulfill their purpose. It reflects the idea of being established and made firm, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13-14</a>, where believers are called to stand firm in their faith.<p><b>a vast army</b><br>The imagery of a vast army represents the collective strength and unity of God's people. It signifies not only the physical restoration of Israel but also their spiritual empowerment to fulfill God's purposes. This army is a symbol of victory and divine intervention, echoing the themes of God's sovereignty and power over nations. The concept of God's people as an army is also seen in <a href="/revelation/19-14.htm">Revelation 19:14</a>, where the armies of heaven follow Christ in His final victory. This phrase encapsulates the hope of a restored and unified people, ready to serve under God's command.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, called to deliver messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
