The "he" in this context is Nebuchadnezzar II, the Babylonian king, who historically besieged Tyre. The "villages of your mainland" indicates the settlements surrounding the island city of Tyre, which were more vulnerable to attack. The use of the sword symbolizes warfare and destruction, a common method of conquest in ancient times. This prophecy highlights the severity of God's judgment against Tyre for its pride and opposition to Israel, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/28-2.htm">Ezekiel 28:2</a>, where Tyre's ruler claims to be a god.<p><b>he will set up siege works against you,</b><br>Siege works were essential in ancient warfare, especially against fortified cities like Tyre. These included building ramps, towers, and other structures to breach city walls. The mention of siege works underscores the determination and resources that Nebuchadnezzar would employ to conquer Tyre. Historically, the siege of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar lasted 13 years, demonstrating the city's formidable defenses and the persistence required to overcome them. This phrase also reflects the fulfillment of God's prophetic word, as seen in other biblical accounts of sieges, such as the fall of Jerusalem in <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>.<p><b>build a ramp to your walls,</b><br>Building a ramp was a common siege tactic, allowing attackers to reach the top of city walls. This phrase indicates the strategic planning and engineering skills employed by ancient armies. The construction of ramps required significant manpower and resources, reflecting the intensity of the siege. In the broader biblical narrative, this imagery of overcoming walls can be seen as a metaphor for God's ability to break down human pride and resistance, as echoed in <a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4-5</a>, where spiritual strongholds are demolished by divine power.<p><b>and raise his shields against you.</b><br>Raising shields was a defensive measure to protect soldiers from projectiles during a siege. This phrase suggests the close combat and direct assault that Tyre would face. Shields were often used in a formation known as the "tortoise" or "testudo," providing a protective cover for advancing troops. The imagery of shields also symbolizes the protection and provision of God for His people, as seen in <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>, where God is described as a shield. In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/26-8.htm">Ezekiel 26:8</a>, however, it signifies the relentless and organized attack that Tyre would endure as part of divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered during the Babylonian exile.

The Lord declares that the Babylonian king will cut down those outlying communities first.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;villages&#8221; (literally, daughters) show how comprehensive the judgment will be: no ally, suburb, or trade post escapes (compare <a href="/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1-12</a>; <a href="/psalms/45-12.htm">Psalm 45:12</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;With the sword&#8221; stresses literal, physical warfare&#8212;just as Babylon used the sword against Jerusalem (<a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1-10</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty stands behind the invader. Ezekiel later affirms, &#8220;I have given the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar&#8230; as compensation for the labor he performed for Me&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/29-18.htm">Ezekiel 29:18-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he will set up siege works against you</b><p>After clearing the coast, Babylon&#8217;s engineers go to work. Siege works&#8212;mounds, towers, trenches&#8212;were the cutting-edge military technology of the day.<p>&#8226; Ezekiel had already dramatized such tactics: &#8220;Lay siege to it, build siege works against it&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/4-2.htm">Ezekiel 4:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Nebuchadnezzar used the same method on Jerusalem (<a href="/jeremiah/52-4.htm">Jeremiah 52:4</a>). The pattern proves that no city, however defended, can resist God&#8217;s decree of judgment.<p>&#8226; The detail assures readers that prophecy meets history: ancient records confirm Babylonian siege craft around Tyre for thirteen years.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>build a ramp to your walls</b><p>A siege ramp was an earthen incline pushed up against city walls so battering rams and soldiers could reach the top.<p>&#8226; Scripture often links ramps with doomed defenses: &#8220;They heap up earth and capture it&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/1-10.htm">Habakkuk 1:10</a>); &#8220;They cast up a siege ramp against the city&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/20-15.htm">2 Samuel 20:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The ramp signifies perseverance. Babylon would not quit until the Lord&#8217;s purpose was finished&#8212;an encouragement that the Lord&#8217;s promises, both of judgment and of blessing, are equally sure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and raise his shields against you</b><p>Soldiers advanced under overlapping shields (a testudo-like formation) or planted large shields to form a protective wall.<p>&#8226; Isaiah uses similar language: &#8220;He will not raise a shield or build a siege ramp against it&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/37-33.htm">Isaiah 37:33</a>) to promise deliverance for Jerusalem in Hezekiah&#8217;s day. Tyre, however, receives no such reprieve.<p>&#8226; Jeremiah&#8217;s call, &#8220;Prepare buckler and shield, advance for battle!&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/46-3.htm">Jeremiah 46:3</a>), reminds us that earthly armor is futile when the Lord directs events.<p>&#8226; The raised shields picture relentless pressure&#8212;day after day, Babylon presses closer until resistance collapses.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/26-8.htm">Ezekiel 26:8</a> paints a step-by-step, literal picture of Babylon&#8217;s assault on Tyre: coastal villages cut down, siege works erected, ramps piled high, shields locking in place. Each phrase underscores God&#8217;s absolute authority over nations, the certainty of His prophetic word, and the futility of trusting in walls, wealth, or strategy instead of in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">A fort . . . a mount.</span>--These and the following particulars of the siege indicate the use of the ordinary methods as in the attack of a city on the mainland. The explanation of this is doubtless partly in the fact that Palaeotyrus, Old Tyre, upon the mainland, was approached in the ordinary way, and partly that Nebuchadnezzar must have contrived a bridge of boats, or some other method of approaching the island across the shoal and narrow channel (1,200 yards), which at that time separated it from the mainland. That if he built a mole it was afterwards removed, is plain from the fact that when Alexander built one, 250 years later, sand accumulated upon it, until the island has now become a peninsula, connected with the shore by a beach of considerable width.<p><span class= "bld">The buckler </span>is that sort of roof made with shields used in ancient warfare by besiegers to defend themselves from the missiles of the besieged.
