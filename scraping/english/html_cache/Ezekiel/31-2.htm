It is used over 90 times in the book of Ezekiel. The term "son of man" is also significant in the New Testament, where it is frequently used by Jesus to refer to Himself, highlighting His incarnation and fulfillment of prophecy.<p><b>say to Pharaoh king of Egypt</b><br>Pharaoh represents the political and spiritual leadership of Egypt, a nation often seen as an adversary to Israel. Egypt's historical significance as a powerful empire is well-documented, and its interactions with Israel are numerous throughout the Old Testament. This address to Pharaoh indicates a message of judgment and comparison, reflecting the broader theme of God's sovereignty over all nations.<p><b>and to his multitude</b><br>The multitude refers to the people of Egypt, including its army and populace. This phrase underscores the collective nature of the message, indicating that it is not just for the leader but for the entire nation. Egypt's large population and military might were well-known, and this message serves as a warning to all who rely on their own strength rather than on God.<p><b>Who can be compared to your greatness?</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights Egypt's perceived greatness and power, which was unmatched in the ancient world. However, it also sets the stage for a comparison that will reveal Egypt's vulnerability before God.
