The "outer sanctuary" refers to the Holy Place, a significant area within the temple where priests performed daily rituals. This vision of the temple is part of a larger prophetic message concerning the restoration of Israel and the presence of God among His people. The temple's design reflects divine order and holiness, emphasizing the separation between the sacred and the profane.<p><b>and measured the side pillars to be six cubits wide on each side.</b><br>The act of measuring signifies God's precise plan and order. A cubit is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches or 45 centimeters, making the pillars about 9 feet or 2.7 meters wide. These measurements highlight the grandeur and stability of the temple structure, symbolizing strength and permanence. The pillars can also be seen as a type of Christ, representing His role as the cornerstone and support of the Church. The detailed measurements throughout Ezekiel's vision underscore the importance of God's meticulous design for His dwelling place, reflecting His glory and majesty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of the visions described in the book bearing his name.
