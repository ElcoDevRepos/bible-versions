The "day" signifies a specific time of divine intervention. The burial place in Israel indicates the complete defeat and humiliation of Gog, as burial in enemy territory was considered a disgrace. This prophecy is part of a larger eschatological vision where God demonstrates His sovereignty and protection over Israel.<p><b>the Valley of the Travelers</b><br>The "Valley of the Travelers" is a location that would have been known to the original audience, possibly a trade route or a place frequented by nomads. The term "travelers" could also symbolize those who pass through life without acknowledging God, thus becoming a fitting burial site for Gog and his forces. This valley becomes a significant geographical marker in the prophecy, emphasizing the public nature of Gog's defeat.<p><b>east of the Sea</b><br>The "Sea" likely refers to the Dead Sea, known for its geographical and historical significance in the region. The location "east of the Sea" situates the event within a recognizable landscape for the Israelites, reinforcing the reality of the prophecy. This area was often associated with judgment and desolation, fitting for the burial of Gog's forces.<p><b>It will block those who travel through</b><br>The burial site will become a significant obstruction, symbolizing the magnitude of the defeat. This phrase suggests that the aftermath of the battle will be so extensive that it will disrupt normal travel and commerce. It serves as a perpetual reminder of God's judgment against those who oppose His people.<p><b>because Gog and all his hordes will be buried there</b><br>The complete burial of Gog and his hordes signifies total victory and eradication of the threat. This imagery is reminiscent of other biblical accounts where God delivers His people by utterly defeating their enemies. It underscores the theme of divine justice and the futility of opposing God's will.<p><b>So it will be called the Valley of Hamon-gog</b><br>"Hamon-gog" means "the multitude of Gog," highlighting the vast number of forces that will be defeated and buried. Naming the valley serves as a memorial to God's deliverance and a warning to future generations. This act of naming is consistent with biblical practices where significant events are commemorated through place names, reinforcing the historical and theological significance of the event.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gog.htm">Gog</a></b><br>A leader of a coalition of nations prophesied to come against Israel.

Every mention of the name repeats the lesson: prideful aggression against God&#8217;s people ends in disgrace (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/39-16.htm">Ezekiel 39:16</a> notes even a nearby city will carry the name Hamonah (&#8220;multitude&#8221;), multiplying the reminder.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/39-11.htm">Ezekiel 39:11</a> promises a literal day when the Lord crushes Gog&#8217;s invasion, assigns the enemy a grave in Israel&#8217;s own land, turns a well-traveled valley into a massive burial ground, and renames the site &#8220;Valley of Hamon-gog.&#8221; The passage showcases God&#8217;s absolute control over timing, territory, and outcome; proclaims His commitment to protect Israel; and stands as a perpetual warning and witness to every nation and individual that opposes Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/39.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">The valley</span> <span class= "bld">of</span> <span class= "bld">the passengers.--</span>The name cannot be derived from the Scythians, as if they were spoken of "as a cloud passing over and gone," because the same word is used again in this verse, and also in <a href="/context/ezekiel/39-14.htm" title="And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain on the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.">Ezekiel 39:14-15</a>, evidently in a different sense. It simply denotes some (probably imaginary) thoroughfare, which is to be blocked up by the buried bodies of the slain. No definite locality is assigned to it, except that it is "on the east of the sea," meaning the Dead Sea. It was to be, therefore, on the extreme south-eastern outskirts of the land. This is another of the features of the description which indicate some other than a literal interpretation; for how should such a host, invading the land from the north for purposes of plunder, be found in that locality, and how could such vast numbers of dead bodies be transported thither?<p><span class= "bld">Stop the noses.</span>--The word "noses" is not in the original, and should be omitted. The meaning is simply that the bodies of the host shall so fill up the valley as to stop the way of travellers.<p><span class= "bld">The valley of Hamon-gog.--</span>It is better to translate the word Hamon, as in the margin: <span class= "ital">The valley of the multitude of Gog.</span> So also in <a href="/ezekiel/39-15.htm" title="And the passengers that pass through the land, when any sees a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog.">Ezekiel 39:15</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-16</span> contain a second proof of the completeness of Gog's destruction, viz. the length of time occupied in burying the slain and cleansing the land. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - Gog, who should invade Israel in the hope of acquiring the entire mastery of her land, would obtain at Jehovah's hands only <span class="cmt_word">a place there of graves</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either, as Hitzig, Ewald, Keil, and Smend suggest, a place where a grave might be possible - a place large enough to receive his slaughtered carcasses; or as Havernick proposes, "an altogether special grave as no other in Israel;" or as Schroder interprets, "a place where there is a grave for him and nothing else." Concerning both the designation and the site of this divinely provided sepulcher controversy has arisen. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">As to its site</span>. The notion of Michaelis and Eiehhom, that <span class="cmt_word">the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea</span> was in some way related to the mountains of Abarim mentioned in <a href="/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/32-49.htm">Deuteronomy 32:49</a>, and that of Hitzig, that it signified "the valley of the opposite heights," as in <a href="/1_samuel/17-3.htm">1 Samuel 17:3</a>, and was to be sought for in the "very great valley" of <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>, may at once be dismissed - the former as untenable, and -the latter as far-fetched. The suggestion of Hengstenberg and Kliefoth, that by the burial-place of Gog was meant the valley of Megiddo, where Josiah fell in battle against Pharaoh-Necho (<a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>), derives support from these considerations, that the very name of Megiddo points to battles, that in its vicinity are found such passes as are here described, and that its modern designation <span class="accented">Lejun</span> (<span class="accented">Leqio</span>), in all probability contains a reminiscence of the present passage. It is, however, open to the obvious objections that the place of Gog's burial was not contiguous to the field of his overthrow, and that the clause locating it "on the <span class="accented">east of the sea</span>," by which on this hypothesis must be understood the Mediterranean, is rather descriptive of the entire land than of any particular spot therein. Hence the view of Havernick, Ewald, Keil, and Smoud, which finds the valley in the neighborhood of the Dead Sea, is to be preferred, though, even with agreement as to this, interpreters are not unanimous as to the spot intended. Ewald thinks of "the horrible, unwholesome valley over against the sea, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/47-8.htm">Ezekiel 47:8</a>) the Dead Sea, that valley which covers the ancient overbearing ones (<span class="accented">die Zerreisenden</span>), the Sodomites, who resemble these;" Keil, translating <span class="accented">kidmath</span> as "in front of," holds by "the valley of the Jordan above the Dead Sea;" Havernick and Smend advocate "a place outside the Holy Land," though the clause, "a grave in Israel," seems against this. Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' hints, net without reason, that the valley was "imaginary." <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">As to its designation</span>. That in the word "passengers" lies a paronomasia is apparent; but whether threefold or only twofold is uncertain.
