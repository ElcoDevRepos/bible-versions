Oppression of the poor was a common sin condemned by the prophets (<a href="/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14-15</a>, <a href="/amos/4.htm">Amos 4:1</a>). In ancient Israel, the poor and needy were often landless, relying on the community's generosity. This behavior reflects a heart hardened against God's commands for compassion and justice.<p><b>he commits robbery and does not restore a pledge.</b><br>Robbery and failure to restore a pledge are direct violations of the commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>, <a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>). In biblical times, pledges were often items given as security for a loan (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-10.htm">Deuteronomy 24:10-13</a>). Not restoring a pledge, especially when it was a necessity for the debtor, was seen as a grave injustice. This behavior indicates a lack of integrity and disregard for the well-being of others, contrary to the righteous living God desires.<p><b>He lifts his eyes to idols;</b><br>Idolatry was a persistent issue in Israel's history, often leading to spiritual adultery against God (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>, <a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4-8</a>). Lifting one's eyes to idols signifies a deliberate act of worship and allegiance to false gods. This was not only a personal sin but also a communal one, as it could lead others astray. The prophets frequently warned against idolatry, emphasizing God's exclusive claim to worship (<a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10-11</a>).<p><b>he commits abominations.</b><br>The term "abominations" often refers to practices detestable to God, including idolatry, sexual immorality, and unjust practices (<a href="/leviticus/18-22.htm">Leviticus 18:22-30</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-12</a>).

Scripture consistently condemns this.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a> reminds us, &#8220;Whoever oppresses the poor shows contempt for their Maker.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14&#8211;15</a> pictures God summoning leaders to court for &#8220;crushing My people and grinding the faces of the poor.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/5-4.htm">James 5:4</a> warns that withheld wages &#8220;cry out against&#8221; the oppressor.<p>Ezekiel&#8217;s charge exposes a heart hardened against both God and neighbor. When we see injustice, we are called to act&#8212;protecting, providing, and advocating&#8212;because indifference aligns us with the oppressor, not with the Lord who &#8220;executes justice for the oppressed&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/146-7.htm">Psalm 146:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He commits robbery and does not restore a pledge</b><p>Robbery violates the eighth commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>). Refusing to return a pledged item deepens the wrong: in Israel, the poor often handed over a cloak or tool as collateral; keeping it overnight could endanger their well-being (<a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26&#8211;27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-12.htm">Deuteronomy 24:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/6-4.htm">Leviticus 6:4&#8211;5</a> makes restitution mandatory: the thief must &#8220;return what he has stolen&#8221; and add a fifth.<p>&#8226; Zacchaeus models true repentance by restoring fourfold (<a href="/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>).<p>By linking theft with failure to restore, Ezekiel shows that sin is not erased by mere confession; it demands tangible, corrective action toward those harmed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He lifts his eyes to idols</b><p>&#8220;Lifting the eyes&#8221; is an intentional, worshipful gaze. God commands, &#8220;You shall have no other gods before Me&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). Idolatry is spiritual adultery, trading the living God for lifeless substitutes (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; Ezekiel later explains that the exiles &#8220;defiled themselves with their idols&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/20-24.htm">Ezekiel 20:24</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_john/5-21.htm">1 John 5:21</a> still pleads, &#8220;Keep yourselves from idols.&#8221;<p>Idolatry always begins in the heart and always spills into life&#8212;shaping values, priorities, and treatment of others. When God is displaced, oppression and theft soon follow.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He commits abominations</b><p>&#8220;Abominations&#8221; covers the full range of practices God detests&#8212;sexually immoral acts (<a href="/leviticus/18-26.htm">Leviticus 18:26-30</a>), violence, deceit, and bloodshed (<a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Ezekiel previously labeled Jerusalem&#8217;s sin &#8220;abominations&#8221; that filled the land with violence (<a href="/ezekiel/8-17.htm">Ezekiel 8:17</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a> warns that those who cling to such deeds &#8220;will have their place in the lake that burns with fire.&#8221;<p>Sin is not random; it is relational rebellion.

Each phrase exposes a heart that rejects both love of neighbor and allegiance to the Lord. In contrast, those who belong to God champion justice for the poor, make wrongs right, worship Him alone, and cultivate purity.
