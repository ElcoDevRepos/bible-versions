In biblical times, raising one's hand was a gesture used to affirm the seriousness of a vow. This imagery is often associated with God's unchanging and authoritative nature, emphasizing His commitment to His word. It reflects the divine authority and the certainty of God's declarations.<p><b>I swore to them in the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness refers to the period of Israel's journey from Egypt to the Promised Land, a time marked by testing and rebellion. This oath was made during a time when the Israelites frequently disobeyed God, leading to His decision to deny entry to the Promised Land to the rebellious generation. The wilderness serves as a backdrop for God's testing and the people's failure to trust Him fully.<p><b>that I would not bring them into the land that I had given them</b><br>This refers to the consequence of Israel's disobedience and lack of faith. Despite God's promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to give their descendants the land of Canaan, the rebellious generation was barred from entering due to their unbelief and idolatry. This highlights the conditional nature of God's promises based on obedience and faithfulness.<p><b>a land flowing with milk and honey</b><br>This phrase describes the fertility and abundance of the Promised Land, symbolizing prosperity and divine blessing. It is a common biblical expression denoting a place of plenty and fulfillment. The imagery of milk and honey suggests a land capable of sustaining life and providing for the needs of its inhabitants, contrasting with the barrenness of the wilderness.<p><b>the glory of all lands</b><br>This emphasizes the unique and unparalleled value of the Promised Land. It was considered the most desirable and blessed of all territories, chosen by God for His people. This phrase underscores the special status of the land in God's redemptive plan and its significance in biblical history as the setting for the unfolding of God's covenant with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His judgment and decision regarding the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom God is speaking, specifically the generation that came out of Egypt and wandered in the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites wandered for 40 years due to their disobedience and lack of faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>Referred to as "a land flowing with milk and honey," symbolizing abundance and God's promise to His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God is delivering this message, during the time of the Babylonian exile.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_and_justice.htm">God's Faithfulness and Justice</a></b><br>Despite His promises, God is just and will not overlook disobedience.
