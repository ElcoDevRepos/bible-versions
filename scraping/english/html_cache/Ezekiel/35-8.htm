In the context of Ezekiel, this prophecy is directed against Mount Seir, representing Edom. Historically, Edom was a perpetual enemy of Israel, and this judgment reflects God's retribution for Edom's hostility. The imagery of mountains filled with the slain underscores the totality and severity of the judgment. Mountains in biblical literature often symbolize stability and permanence, but here they become sites of devastation, highlighting the reversal of fortune for Edom.<p><b>those killed by the sword will fall on your hills,</b><br>The sword is a common biblical symbol of warfare and divine judgment. The mention of those killed by the sword falling on the hills suggests a widespread and inescapable destruction. Hills, like mountains, were strategic locations in ancient warfare, often used for defense. The prophecy indicates that even these elevated places will not provide safety from God's judgment. This can be connected to other biblical passages where the sword is used as an instrument of God's wrath, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/25-31.htm">Jeremiah 25:31</a>, emphasizing the inevitability of divine justice.<p><b>in your valleys,</b><br>Valleys in the ancient Near East were often fertile and populated areas, essential for agriculture and habitation. The mention of valleys in this context suggests that the judgment will affect both the high and low places, leaving no part of the land untouched. This comprehensive destruction serves as a warning to those who oppose God's people. The valleys, typically places of life and sustenance, become sites of death, illustrating the complete reversal of Edom's fortunes.<p><b>and in all your ravines.</b><br>Ravines, being narrow and often difficult to traverse, symbolize hidden or protected areas. The inclusion of ravines in the prophecy indicates that there will be no refuge from the coming judgment. This reflects the thoroughness of God's retribution, as even the most secluded places will not escape His wrath. The imagery of ravines filled with the slain reinforces the totality of the devastation. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the broader biblical theme of God's justice reaching every corner of the earth, as seen in <a href="/amos/9-3.htm">Amos 9:3</a>, where even the depths of the sea cannot hide from God's hand.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, often at odds with Israel.

When the Lord declares, &#8220;I will fill its mountains with the slain&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/35-8.htm">Ezekiel 35:8</a>), He is promising a judgment that strikes at the very identity of Edom, a nation proud of its seemingly impregnable peaks (cf. Obadiah 3-4). What appears unassailable to human eyes is no obstacle to God.<p>&#8226; Similar language of total devastation is used against rebellious Israel herself in <a href="/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7</a> and against hostile nations in <a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-6</a>, underscoring that the Lord applies the same righteous standard to all.<p>&#8226; The principle is unmistakable: prideful reliance on natural defenses or human strength invites divine humbling (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>those killed by the sword will fall on your hills</b><p>The &#8220;sword&#8221; is a vivid emblem of God&#8217;s appointed instrument of justice (<a href="/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3-5</a>). Edom, once gloating over Jerusalem&#8217;s fall, will now experience the same sharp edge she applauded for others (<a href="/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>; <a href="/bsb/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 10</a>-14).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;will fall&#8221; signals the certainty of the decree&#8212;no treaty or alliance can stall the sovereign verdict (<a href="/jeremiah/25-29.htm">Jeremiah 25:29</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, it is a sober reminder that the measure we use toward others will be measured back to us (<a href="/matthew/7-2.htm">Matthew 7:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in your valleys</b><p>Judgment is not confined to the lofty heights; it reaches the low places as well. Valleys, often centers of agriculture and settlement, represent the everyday life of the nation. When God says the slain will be &#8220;in your valleys,&#8221; He is affirming that no pocket of Edomite society will be untouched.<p>&#8226; <a href="/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11-12</a> foretells a fire that consumes Edom&#8217;s &#8220;strongholds,&#8221; paralleling this valley-to-mountain sweep of destruction.<p>&#8226; The completeness of the coverage anticipates the future day when Christ&#8217;s righteous reign will extend &#8220;from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>), leaving no room for entrenched hostility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and in all your ravines</b><p>Ravines, with their twisting cliffs and hidden recesses, might seem a last refuge. God names them specifically to show that even the most obscure hideouts are exposed to His gaze (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/36-4.htm">Ezekiel 36:4</a> addresses &#8220;mountains and hills, ravines and valleys&#8221; of Israel, promising restoration; here, the same topography becomes the stage for Edom&#8217;s downfall&#8212;illustrating that outcomes differ based on covenant relationship and response to God.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1-6</a> pictures the Lord trampling nations in judgment; the detailed geography in <a href="/ezekiel/35-8.htm">Ezekiel 35:8</a> echoes that graphic scene of total accountability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/35-8.htm">Ezekiel 35:8</a> paints a comprehensive portrait of divine retribution: proud Edom, once confident in its crags and rejoicing over Israel&#8217;s anguish, will find its mountains, hills, valleys, and ravines strewn with the slain. The verse assures us that God&#8217;s justice penetrates every elevation and depression of human rebellion. His judgments are precise, thorough, and rooted in His unwavering commitment to defend His people and uphold His holiness. The lesson rings clear for every generation: no stronghold&#8212;whether geographic, political, or personal&#8212;can shield a heart that stands in arrogant opposition to the Lord of hosts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/35.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Rivers.</span>--As elsewhere = river-courses, in which water was found only at times.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will fill his mountains with his slain</span>; literally, <span class="accented">pierced through</span>; hence mortally wounded.

The physical features of Edom here specified by the prophet have often been attested by travelers. "Idumea embraces a section of a broad mountain range, extending in breadth from the valley of the Arabah to the desert plateau of Arabia. The ravines which intersect these sandstone mountains are very remarkable. Take them as a whole, there is nothing like them in the world, especially those near Petra. The deep valleys and the little terraces along the mountain-sides, and the broad downs upon their summits, are covered with rich soil, in which trees, shrubs, and flowers grow luxuriantly" (Porter, in Kitto's 'Cyclopaedia,' art. "Idumea"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/35-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will fill</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1514;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;mil&#183;l&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
