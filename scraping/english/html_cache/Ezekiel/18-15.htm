In ancient Israel, these high places were sites of idol worship, contrary to the worship of Yahweh. The Law of Moses explicitly forbade such practices (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-4</a>). The mountains were often associated with Canaanite deities, and eating at these sites symbolized participation in idolatry. This phrase emphasizes the importance of exclusive worship of the one true God, rejecting syncretism and the blending of pagan practices with the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>or look to the idols of the house of Israel</b><br>Idolatry was a persistent issue in Israel's history, leading to the nation's downfall and exile. The "idols of the house of Israel" refers to the various forms of idol worship that infiltrated Israelite society, including the worship of Baal, Asherah, and other deities. The prophets, including Ezekiel, consistently condemned this practice (<a href="/ezekiel/6-4.htm">Ezekiel 6:4-6</a>). This phrase underscores the call to faithfulness and the rejection of false gods, aligning with the first and second commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). It also highlights the spiritual adultery of Israel, contrasting with the faithfulness expected of God's people.<p><b>He does not defile his neighbor&#8217;s wife</b><br>Adultery is explicitly prohibited in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>) and is seen as a serious breach of covenantal faithfulness, both in marriage and in the community. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, marriage was a sacred covenant reflecting the relationship between God and His people. Defiling a neighbor's wife not only violated personal relationships but also disrupted the social and spiritual fabric of the community. This phrase emphasizes personal integrity and the sanctity of marriage, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32</a>, <a href="/matthew/5-27.htm">Matthew 5:27-28</a>). It also serves as a metaphor for spiritual unfaithfulness, where Israel is often depicted as an unfaithful spouse to God (<a href="/hosea/2-2.htm">Hosea 2:2-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who conveyed God's messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
