In biblical context, mountains often represent places of divine revelation and encounter. Mount Zion is significant as the location of the Temple, where God's presence dwelt among His people. This phrase emphasizes the sanctity and chosen status of this location as a place where God will gather His people.<p><b>the high mountain of Israel</b><br>This phrase underscores the prominence and importance of Mount Zion, not just geographically but spiritually. It is a place elevated above others, symbolizing its role as the spiritual center of Israel. The "high mountain" also reflects the idea of God's sovereignty and the exalted nature of His kingdom. In prophetic literature, mountains often symbolize kingdoms or governments, pointing to the future establishment of God's eternal kingdom.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD</b><br>This declaration emphasizes the authority and certainty of the message. The use of "Lord GOD" (Adonai Yahweh) highlights both the sovereignty and covenantal faithfulness of God. It assures the reader that what follows is a divine promise that will be fulfilled according to God's will and purpose.<p><b>there the whole house of Israel, all of them, will serve Me in the land</b><br>This phrase indicates a future time of restoration and unity for Israel. The "whole house of Israel" suggests the reunification of the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Serving God "in the land" points to a return from exile and a restoration of proper worship. This promise of national restoration is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, looking forward to a time when Israel will fully commit to God.<p><b>There I will accept them</b><br>God's acceptance signifies reconciliation and the restoration of a right relationship between Him and His people. This acceptance is contingent upon their return to Him and their obedience. It reflects the grace and mercy of God, who desires to restore His people despite their past unfaithfulness.<p><b>and will require your offerings and choice gifts</b><br>Offerings and gifts were central to Israelite worship, symbolizing devotion and gratitude to God. The requirement of offerings indicates a return to proper worship practices, as outlined in the Mosaic Law. It also suggests a future time when the sacrificial system will be restored, pointing to a renewed covenant relationship.<p><b>along with all your holy sacrifices</b><br>Holy sacrifices were integral to maintaining a covenant relationship with God, serving as atonement for sin and expressions of worship. This phrase underscores the importance of holiness and purity in worship. It also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfills and surpasses the sacrificial system, offering Himself as the perfect atonement for sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and covenant-keeping God of Israel, who speaks through the prophet Ezekiel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_mountain.htm">The Holy Mountain</a></b><br>Refers to Mount Zion in Jerusalem, symbolizing God's presence and the place of true worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_whole_house_of_israel.htm">The Whole House of Israel</a></b><br>Represents the entire nation of Israel, including both the northern and southern kingdoms, unified in worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/offerings_and_sacrifices.htm">Offerings and Sacrifices</a></b><br>Acts of worship and devotion that God requires from His people, symbolizing their commitment and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_centrality_of_worship.htm">The Centrality of Worship</a></b><br>Worship is at the heart of our relationship with God.

His own oath secures the promise; their restored sacrifices celebrate the redemption He provides. The verse assures us that God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness will culminate in a visible kingdom where His people, land, and worship are forever united under His sovereign delight.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(40) <span class= "bld">In mine holy mountain.</span>--See note on <a href="/ezekiel/17-23.htm" title="In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.">Ezekiel 17:23</a>. The former prophecy was distinctly Messianic; in this, taken by itself, there is nothing which might not refer to the restoration from the exile. Yet in view of the parallelism and connection between the two, we can hardly avoid the supposition, that in predicting the restoration the prophetic eye looked beyond to the greater glory of the Christian dispensation, of which that restoration was a type. But, however this may be, it is not necessary to explain any of the expressions in this passage as looking for their direct and immediate fulfilment beyond the restoration under Zerubbabel.<p><span class= "bld">All the house of Israel.</span>--It has already been shown (see notes on <a href="/ezekiel/2-3.htm" title="And he said to me, Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even to this very day.">Ezekiel 2:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/4-3.htm" title="Moreover take you to you an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between you and the city: and set your face against it, and it shall be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.">Ezekiel 4:3</a>) that the existing nation is recognised as constituting "Israel," except where special occasion arises for distinguishing between the ten tribes and the two. Here "Israel" is used throughout for the people whom the prophet is directed to address (<a href="/ezekiel/20-39.htm" title="As for you, O house of Israel, thus said the Lord GOD; Go you, serve you every one his idols, and hereafter also, if you will not listen to me: but pollute you my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.">Ezekiel 20:39</a>), as is further shown by the parallel, "all of them in the land." Though the restored nation was made up chiefly of Judah and Benjamin, there were also among them considerable remnants of the other tribes; and it is declared that the offerings of them all shall be alike acceptable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - From the earlier stage of the restoration the prophet passes on to its completion. The people have come to the <span class="cmt_word">mountain of the height of Israel</span> (<a href="/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1, 2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2, 3</a>). Ezekiel sees an Israel that shall at last be worthy of its name, the worship of false gods rooted out forever. The <span class="cmt_word">all of them</span> points to the breaking down of the old division between Israel and Judah (<a href="/isaiah/11-13.htm">Isaiah 11:13</a>). Jehovah would accept the "heave offering" (same word as in Exodus 24:27; <a href="/leviticus/7-14.htm">Leviticus 7:14</a>, <span class="accented">et</span> <span class="accented">al</span>.) and other oblations. The fact that Israel itself is said to be the "sweet savour" (Revised Version) which Jehovah accepts (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>) suggests a like spiritual interpretation of the other offerings, though the literal meaning was probably dominant in the prophet's own thoughts. The nearest approach to a parallelism in a later age is that presented by <a href="/romans/9.htm">Romans 9-11</a>; but it is noticeable how there St. Paul avoids any words that imply the perpetuation of the temple and its ritual, and confines himself to the spiritual restoration of his brethren according to the flesh. It was given to him to see, what the prophets did not see, that that perpetuation would frustrate the purpose of the restoration; that the temple and its ritual took their places among the things that "were decaying and waxing old," and were ready to vanish away (<a href="/hebrews/8-13.htm">Hebrews 8:13</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/20-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on My holy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1438;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#257;&#7695;&#183;&#353;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
