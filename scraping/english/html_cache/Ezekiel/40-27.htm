This inner court was reserved for the priests and certain sacrificial activities, emphasizing the holiness and separation inherent in the temple's design. The south-facing gate indicates a specific orientation, which may symbolize openness to the nations, as the south often represented the direction of Egypt and other Gentile lands. This gate's presence highlights the temple's role as a place of worship for all nations, a theme echoed in <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>, where God's house is called a "house of prayer for all peoples."<p><b>and he measured the distance from gateway to gateway toward the south</b><br>The act of measuring signifies order, precision, and divine planning. In biblical literature, measurements often indicate God's sovereignty and the importance of structure in worship. The specific mention of measuring from gateway to gateway underscores the meticulous nature of the vision given to Ezekiel, reflecting God's attention to detail in His dwelling place. This measurement also serves as a prophetic assurance of the temple's future restoration, aligning with the promises of restoration found in <a href="/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24-28</a>.<p><b>to be a hundred cubits</b><br>A cubit is an ancient unit of length, approximately 18 inches or 45 centimeters. Thus, a hundred cubits would be about 150 feet or 45 meters. This specific measurement indicates a significant distance, suggesting the grandeur and majesty of the temple complex. The use of precise measurements in Ezekiel's vision parallels the detailed instructions given for the tabernacle in <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-27</a>, emphasizing continuity in God's design for His dwelling places. The number 100, being a multiple of 10, often symbolizes completeness or perfection in biblical numerology, reinforcing the idea of divine perfection in the temple's construction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the detailed vision of a new temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_inner_court.htm">The Inner Court</a></b><br>Part of the temple complex in Ezekiel's vision, representing a place of greater holiness and proximity to God's presence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_south_gate.htm">The South Gate</a></b><br>One of the gates of the inner court, symbolizing access and entry into a deeper relationship with God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_measuring.htm">The Measuring</a></b><br>The act of measuring signifies God's order, precision, and the importance of the temple's design.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision_of_the_temple.htm">The Vision of the Temple</a></b><br>A prophetic vision given to Ezekiel, symbolizing hope, restoration, and God's future dwelling with His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_order_and_precision.htm">God's Order and Precision</a></b><br>The detailed measurements in Ezekiel's vision remind us of God's order and precision in His plans.
