In the context of Ezekiel, the prophet is addressing the exiles in Babylon, urging them to turn from their sinful ways. The concept of repentance is central to the message of the prophets and is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/55-7.htm">Isaiah 55:7</a>, which calls for the wicked to forsake their ways. The Hebrew word for "turns" (&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, shuv) is often used in the Old Testament to denote repentance, indicating a complete change of direction in one's life.<p><b>and does what is just and right</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the importance of not only turning away from sin but also actively pursuing righteousness. The biblical concept of justice and righteousness is deeply rooted in the character of God, as seen in passages like <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, which calls for doing justice, loving kindness, and walking humbly with God. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, justice and righteousness were often linked to social responsibility and care for the marginalized, reflecting God's covenantal expectations for His people.<p><b>he will live because of this</b><br>The promise of life is a recurring theme in Ezekiel, contrasting the death that comes from sin. This assurance of life is not merely physical but also spiritual, pointing to a restored relationship with God. Theologically, this reflects the principle found in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>, where choosing life is equated with loving and obeying God. The phrase also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of eternal life through faith and repentance, as seen in the ministry of Jesus Christ, who calls sinners to repentance and offers life abundantly (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God during the Babylonian exile,
