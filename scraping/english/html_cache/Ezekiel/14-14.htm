Noah is known for his obedience and faithfulness in building the ark (Genesis 6-9), Daniel for his unwavering devotion to God despite living in exile (Daniel 1-6), and Job for his patience and integrity amidst suffering (Job 1-2). Their inclusion underscores the severity of the judgment being pronounced, as even their presence would not avert it. This reflects the high regard for their righteousness in Jewish tradition and serves as a standard against which the people of Israel are measured.<p><b>their righteousness could deliver only themselves</b><br>This emphasizes the personal nature of righteousness and accountability before God. It suggests that individual righteousness cannot be transferred or imputed to others, highlighting the principle that each person is responsible for their own relationship with God. This is consistent with other biblical teachings, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>, where it is stated that each person is to be put to death for their own sin, not for the sins of others. It also foreshadows New Testament teachings on personal salvation and accountability (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).<p><b>declares the Lord GOD</b><br>This phrase asserts the authority and sovereignty of God in making this declaration. It is a common prophetic formula that underscores the divine origin of the message. The use of "Lord GOD" (YHWH Elohim) emphasizes both the covenantal relationship God has with His people and His supreme power. This declaration serves as a reminder of God's ultimate authority and the seriousness of His pronouncements, reinforcing the certainty and inevitability of the judgment being described.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, often using vivid imagery and symbolic actions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>Known for his righteousness and obedience, Noah was chosen by God to build the ark and preserve life during the great flood (Genesis 6-9).<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and statesman in Babylon, Daniel was renowned for his unwavering faith and integrity, even in the face of persecution (Book of Daniel).<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/job.htm">Job</a></b><br>A man of great patience and faith, Job endured immense suffering yet remained faithful to God, exemplifying righteousness and perseverance (Book of Job).<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city facing impending judgment due to the people's persistent idolatry and sin, as addressed by Ezekiel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/righteousness_and_personal_responsibility.htm">Righteousness and Personal Responsibility</a></b><br>The verse emphasizes that individual righteousness is crucial and cannot be transferred to others.

The verse underscores personal responsibility, the limits of intercession, and the unbreakable authority of God&#8217;s word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Noah, Daniel, and Job.</span>--These three are selected, doubtless, not only as examples of eminent holiness themselves, but as men who had been allowed to be the means of saving others. For Noah's sake his whole family had been spared (<a href="/genesis/6-18.htm" title="But with you will I establish my covenant; and you shall come into the ark, you, and your sons, and your wife, and your sons' wives with you.">Genesis 6:18</a>); Daniel was the means of saving his companions (<a href="/context/daniel/2-17.htm" title="Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:">Daniel 2:17-18</a>); and Job's friends had been spared in consequence of his intercession (<a href="/context/job/42-7.htm" title="And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends: for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.">Job 42:7-8</a>). Moses and Samuel might seem still more remarkable instances of the value of intercessory prayer; but these had already been cited by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/15-1.htm" title="Then said the LORD to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.">Jeremiah 15:1</a>). The mention of Daniel, a contemporary of Ezekiel, with the ancient patriarchs, Noah and Job, need occasion no surprise. The distance in time between Noah and Job was greater than between Job and Daniel, and it has been well said that there was need of the mention of a contemporary to bring out the thought--were there in Jerusalem the most holy men of either past or present times it would avail nothing. It is also to be remembered that Daniel was separated from Ezekiel by circumstances which created a distance between them corresponding to that which separated him in time from the patriarchs. Ezekiel was a captive among the captives; Daniel had now been for about twelve years in important office at the royal court, and possessed of the very highest rank. There is, therefore, no occasion for the strange supposition that the reference is to some older Daniel, of such eminence as to be spoken of in the way he is here and in <a href="/ezekiel/28-3.htm" title="Behold, you are wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from you:">Ezekiel 28:3</a>, and yet whose name has otherwise completely faded out from history. But besides all this, there was an especial propriety, and even necessity for the purpose in hand, that Daniel should be mentioned. He was not only in high office, but was the trusted counsellor of Nebuchadnezzar by whom Jerusalem was to be destroyed. He was also a very holy man, and a most patriotic Israelite. The Jews, therefore, might well have thought that his influence would avail to avert the threatened calamity, and by placing his name in the list. their last hope was to be dashed as it could be by nothing else.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">then even if these</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1433;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
