The "face of a man" symbolizes intelligence, wisdom, and the human aspect of God's creation. In biblical symbolism, man is often seen as the pinnacle of God's creation, made in His image (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>). The presence of the palm tree, a symbol of righteousness and victory (<a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>), suggests a connection between human wisdom and divine righteousness. The placement of the face toward the palm tree may indicate the direction of human focus or aspiration toward godly virtues.<p><b>and the face of a young lion was toward the palm tree on the other side</b><br>The "face of a young lion" represents strength, courage, and royalty. Lions are frequently used in Scripture to symbolize power and authority (<a href="/proverbs/28.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>, <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>). The young lion's face being directed toward the palm tree could signify the alignment of strength and authority with righteousness. In the context of the temple, this imagery may reflect the balance of human wisdom and divine strength, both oriented toward the righteousness symbolized by the palm tree.<p><b>They were carved all the way around the temple</b><br>The carvings being "all the way around the temple" suggest a comprehensive and encompassing presence of these symbols throughout the sacred space. This indicates that the attributes represented by the man and the lion&#8212;wisdom, strength, righteousness&#8212;are integral to the entire structure of the temple, symbolizing the pervasive nature of God's attributes in His dwelling place. The use of carvings in ancient Near Eastern temples was common, often serving both decorative and symbolic purposes. In Ezekiel's vision, these carvings emphasize the holiness and divine order of the temple, reflecting God's glory and the ideal relationship between God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the detailed vision of the new temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple.htm">Temple</a></b><br>The vision of the temple in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a> represents a future idealized temple, symbolizing God's presence and holiness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>The creatures with faces of a man and a lion are part of the cherubim, which are angelic beings associated with the presence and glory of God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/palm_trees.htm">Palm Trees</a></b><br>Symbolic of beauty, victory, and eternal life, palm trees are used in the temple's decoration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/vision.htm">Vision</a></b><br>The entire passage is part of a larger vision given to Ezekiel, symbolizing restoration and divine order.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_cherubim.htm">Symbolism of the Cherubim</a></b><br>The faces of a man and a lion on the cherubim represent aspects of God's creation&#8212;intelligence and strength.
