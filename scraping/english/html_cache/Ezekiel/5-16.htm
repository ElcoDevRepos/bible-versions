In ancient warfare, arrows were a common weapon, symbolizing swift and unavoidable judgment. The imagery of arrows suggests precision and intent, indicating that the famine is a direct consequence of the people's disobedience. This aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/32-23.htm">Deuteronomy 32:23-24</a>, where God warns of sending arrows of famine as a curse for breaking the covenant. The use of "shower" implies an overwhelming and inescapable onslaught, emphasizing the seriousness of the judgment.<p><b>that I will send to destroy you</b><br>The phrase highlights God's active role in the judgment. It reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where blessings and curses are contingent upon obedience (<a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-26</a>). The destruction is not arbitrary but a response to persistent rebellion and idolatry. Historically, this prophecy was fulfilled during the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem, where famine and destruction were rampant (<a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25:1-3</a>). This serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>I will intensify the famine against you</b><br>The intensification of the famine underscores the escalating nature of divine judgment. It suggests a progressive worsening of conditions, reflecting the seriousness of the people's sin. This intensification can be seen as a call to repentance, urging the people to recognize their need for God. Theologically, it points to the principle that sin leads to increasing separation from God, resulting in greater suffering. This is consistent with the warnings found in <a href="/leviticus/26-18.htm">Leviticus 26:18-20</a>, where God promises to multiply punishments if the people do not repent.<p><b>and cut off your supply of food</b><br>Cutting off the food supply signifies a complete breakdown of societal and economic structures. In the ancient Near East, food scarcity was a dire threat, often leading to social unrest and collapse. This phrase indicates the totality of the judgment, affecting every aspect of life. It also serves as a fulfillment of the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>, where God warns of hunger and deprivation as consequences of disobedience. Theologically, it points to the spiritual truth that apart from God, there is no sustenance or life, echoing Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a> about the necessity of abiding in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, called to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are in exile due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/famine.htm">Famine</a></b><br>A severe shortage of food, used here as a metaphor for God's judgment on the people for their sins.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, serving as the backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city that is under judgment, representing the spiritual and physical center of the Israelites' identity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin has real consequences, both spiritually and physically.

The image of arrows points to precision&#8212;every strike meets its mark (<a href="/psalms/7-12.htm">Psalm 7:12-13</a>).<p>- &#8220;Deadly&#8221; tells us these arrows are not warnings but executing sentences already passed (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-23.htm">Deuteronomy 32:23-24</a>, &#8220;I will spend My arrows against them&#8230; wasted from hunger,&#8221;).<p>- Famine and destruction arrive together: starvation collapses society, opening the door to violence and disease (<a href="/lamentations/4-9.htm">Lamentations 4:9</a>).<p>- The deluge language echoes the covenant curses promised if Israel broke faith (<a href="/leviticus/26-21.htm">Leviticus 26:21-22</a>). A literal siege would leave food stores empty, fulfilling the picture exactly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that I will send to destroy you</b><p>- The famine is dispatched by the Lord; He is not wringing His hands but ruling history (<a href="/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>).<p>- Judgment has a clear purpose: &#8220;to destroy,&#8221; meaning to bring Jerusalem to the end of her rebellion (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>).<p>- Instruments such as Babylon&#8217;s army are secondary; the Ultimate Sender is God (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>, &#8220;the rod of My anger&#8221;).<p>- The phrase underlines accountability: covenant people cannot blame chance, climate, or politics. They stand directly before a holy God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will intensify the famine against you</b><p>- Intensification signals escalating discipline (<a href="/leviticus/26-27.htm">Leviticus 26:27-29</a>). Earlier hunger warnings (<a href="/ezekiel/4-16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16-17</a>) were severe; now they become unbearable.<p>- Starvation strips away illusions of self-sufficiency. Every empty cupboard shouts, &#8220;Life depends on the Giver.&#8221;<p>- The escalation highlights God&#8217;s relentless pursuit; He will not let sin rest comfortably (<a href="/amos/4-6.htm">Amos 4:6-11</a>, a series of &#8220;yet you did not return to Me&#8221;).<p>- Literal history records the final Babylonian siege driving the city to extremes (<a href="/2_kings/25-3.htm">2 Kings 25:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and cut off your supply of food.</b><p>- Siege warfare made food lines the first casualty. God foretells the very tactic Nebuchadnezzar used&#8212;tightening the city till nothing got in or out (<a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1-2</a>).<p>- &#8220;Cut off&#8221; conveys a decisive act; the covenant curses included &#8220;I will break your staff of bread&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>).<p>- Physical bread gone, spiritual famine follows (cf. <a href="/amos/8-11.htm">Amos 8:11</a>). Idolatry had already severed them from the Bread of Life; now the outward sign matches the inward reality.<p>- The Lord&#8217;s goal is not random cruelty but sober justice and eventual restoration for a remnant (<a href="/ezekiel/6-8.htm">Ezekiel 6:8-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/5-16.htm">Ezekiel 5:16</a> is a literal, covenant-based verdict. God promises a downpour of precise, lethal judgments&#8212;famine chief among them&#8212;sent directly by His hand to break Jerusalem&#8217;s rebellion. Each phrase escalates the picture: targeted arrows, divine commissioning, intensified scarcity, total food cutoff. The verse showcases God&#8217;s holiness, the certainty of His word, and the high cost of persistent sin, while implicitly urging every reader to cling to the only source of life and provision&#8212;Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The evil arrows of famine,</span> etc. The thought of the "arrows" of God's judgment may have been taken from <a href="/deuteronomy/32-23.htm">Deuteronomy 32:23, 42</a>, and occurs frequently also in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/38-2.htm">Psalm 38:2</a><span class="accented">, et al.</span>).
