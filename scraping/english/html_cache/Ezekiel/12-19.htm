The "people of the land" refers to the Israelites, specifically those in exile and those remaining in Judah. This highlights the communal aspect of prophecy, where messages are intended for the collective rather than individuals.<p><b>that this is what the Lord GOD says</b><br>The use of "Lord GOD" underscores the authority and sovereignty of God. It is a reminder that the message comes from the highest authority, demanding attention and obedience. This phrase is a common prophetic formula, establishing the divine origin of the message.<p><b>about those living in Jerusalem and in the land of Israel</b><br>This specifies the audience of the prophecy, focusing on the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the broader region of Israel. Historically, this was a time of great turmoil, with the Babylonian threat looming. The mention of both Jerusalem and Israel indicates the comprehensive nature of the judgment, affecting both the city and the surrounding territories.<p><b>&#8216;They will eat their bread with anxiety</b><br>Eating bread with anxiety reflects the fear and uncertainty of the people due to the impending Babylonian siege. Bread, a staple of life, becomes a source of worry rather than sustenance. This imagery connects to <a href="/deuteronomy/28-65.htm">Deuteronomy 28:65</a>, where disobedience leads to a life of anxiety and fear.<p><b>and drink their water in dread</b><br>Water, essential for survival, is consumed with dread, symbolizing the pervasive fear among the people. This dread is due to the scarcity and insecurity brought by the siege. The phrase echoes the curses of the covenant for disobedience, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a>.<p><b>for their land will be stripped of everything in it</b><br>This prophecy foretells the desolation of the land, a consequence of the Babylonian invasion. The stripping of the land signifies both physical destruction and the removal of God's blessing. It reflects the covenantal curses for idolatry and injustice, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49-52</a>.<p><b>because of the violence of all who dwell in it</b><br>The violence refers to the moral and social corruption prevalent in Jerusalem and Israel. This internal decay is the reason for divine judgment. The phrase highlights the biblical principle that sin leads to destruction, as seen in the narratives of Sodom and Gomorrah and the warnings of the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_the_land.htm">The People of the Land</a></b><br>Refers to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the broader land of Israel who are being warned of impending judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, significant in biblical history as the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and covenant-keeping God of Israel, who communicates His will and judgments through His prophets.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exile.htm">The Exile</a></b><br>The period during which the Israelites were taken captive to Babylon, a time of judgment and reflection on their disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin leads to anxiety and despair, as seen in the lives of the Israelites.
