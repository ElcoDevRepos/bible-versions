The exile served as both punishment and a means of purification. The dispersion among the nations fulfilled earlier prophecies (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>) and demonstrated God's sovereignty over all nations. It also foreshadows the New Testament concept of believers as sojourners in a foreign land (<a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>).<p><b>your survivors will remember Me</b><br>The act of remembering God signifies a return to covenant faithfulness. In exile, the Israelites would reflect on their relationship with God, leading to repentance. This remembrance is a theme throughout Scripture, emphasizing the importance of recalling God's past deeds and promises (<a href="/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11</a>). It also points to the hope of restoration and renewal, as seen in the return from exile and ultimately in the redemptive work of Christ.<p><b>how I have been grieved by their adulterous hearts that turned away from Me</b><br>This phrase highlights God's personal and emotional response to Israel's unfaithfulness, likened to spiritual adultery. The imagery of adultery is used throughout the prophets to describe Israel's idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-10</a>). It underscores the seriousness of idolatry and the pain it causes God, who desires an exclusive relationship with His people. This reflects the New Testament teaching of the Church as the bride of Christ (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<p><b>and by their eyes that lusted after idols</b><br>The eyes symbolize desire and covetousness, leading to idolatry. This phrase indicates the Israelites' attraction to the pagan practices of surrounding nations, which led them away from God. The warning against idolatry is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing the need to guard one's heart and eyes (<a href="/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22-23</a>). It also serves as a reminder of the first commandment, to have no other gods before the Lord (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p><b>So they will loathe themselves for the evil they have done and for all their abominations</b><br>This self-loathing is a sign of genuine repentance and acknowledgment of sin. The recognition of their abominations, or detestable practices, is crucial for restoration. This mirrors the process of repentance described in the New Testament, where godly sorrow leads to salvation (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>). It also points to the transformative power of God's grace, which enables believers to turn from sin and seek holiness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who have been exiled due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the foreign lands where the Israelites have been taken captive, primarily Babylon.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/adulterous_hearts.htm">Adulterous Hearts</a></b><br>Symbolic of Israel's unfaithfulness to God, likened to marital infidelity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>The false gods and objects of worship that led Israel away from their covenant with Yahweh.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_grief_of_god.htm">The Grief of God</a></b><br>God is deeply grieved by our unfaithfulness and idolatry.

Here, as constantly in all parts of Scripture, apostacy from God is described under the figure of unfaithfulness in the marriage relation. "They shall loathe themselves" indicates a true repentance; they shall loathe the sin and themselves for having committed it. Thus their sin has drawn down punishment; punishment has destroyed many, but brought a "remnant" to repentance; and repentance leads to a true knowledge of God, and communion with Him. The Divine word and act has not been "in vain."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because I am broken with their whorish heart.</span> The words have been very differently rendered. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The Revised Version mainly follows the Authorized Version, but gives, <span class="accented">they shall remember</span>... <span class="accented">how I have been broken</span>, etc. So taken, the words are boldly anthropomorphic, and ascribe to Jehovah the word which implies the strongest form of human distress. The "whorish heart" of the people has made Jehovah himself "broken-hearted." <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Most recent critics, however, follow the rendering of the Vulgate (<span class="accented">contrivi</span>), and take the verb, which is passive in form, as being like a Greek verb in the middle voice, transitive in form, with an implied reflex force.
