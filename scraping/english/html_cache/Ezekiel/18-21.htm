In the context of Ezekiel, the Israelites were in exile due to their persistent sin and rebellion against God. The call to turn from sin is a central theme in the prophetic literature, highlighting God's desire for repentance rather than punishment (<a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>). The Hebrew concept of "turning" (shuv) implies a complete change of direction, akin to the New Testament call to repentance (metanoia). This turning is not merely a cessation of sinful acts but a heartfelt return to God, aligning with the message of John the Baptist and Jesus in the Gospels (<a href="/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>, <a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>).<p><b>keeps all My statutes</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's laws. In the Old Testament, the statutes refer to the laws given to Israel, including moral, ceremonial, and civil laws. Obedience to these statutes was a sign of faithfulness and covenant relationship with God (<a href="/deuteronomy/6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1-3</a>). The emphasis on "all" suggests comprehensive obedience, not selective adherence. This anticipates the New Covenant promise where God's laws are written on the hearts of believers (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, <a href="/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10</a>), fulfilled in Christ who perfectly kept the law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>and does what is just and right</b><br>Justice and righteousness are central attributes of God's character and expectations for His people. In the ancient Near Eastern context, these terms often related to fair treatment of others, honesty, and integrity in dealings. The prophets frequently called Israel to embody these values (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, <a href="/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>). This phrase reflects the ethical dimension of repentance, where true turning to God results in transformed behavior. Jesus exemplified perfect justice and righteousness, and His followers are called to imitate Him (<a href="/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21-24</a>).<p><b>he will surely live; he will not die</b><br>This promise of life contrasts with the death that sin brings (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). In Ezekiel's context, "live" refers to both physical preservation and spiritual restoration. The assurance of life is a recurring biblical theme, seen in the blessings of the covenant (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>) and the eternal life offered through Christ (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). The certainty of "surely" emphasizes God's faithfulness to His promises. This echoes the New Testament assurance of salvation for those who believe in Jesus and turn from sin (<a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>, <a href="/romans/8.htm">Romans 8:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, emphasizing personal responsibility and repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked_man.htm">The Wicked Man</a></b><br>Represents individuals who have lived in sin but have the opportunity to repent and turn towards righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_statutes.htm">God's Statutes</a></b><br>Refers to the laws and commandments given by God, which the Israelites were expected to follow.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/repentance.htm">Repentance</a></b><br>A central theme in this passage, highlighting the transformative power of turning away from sin and towards God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/life_and_death.htm">Life and Death</a></b><br>Symbolic of spiritual life and death, where obedience to God leads to life, and sin leads to death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_repentance.htm">The Power of Repentance</a></b><br>Repentance is a transformative act that can change the course of one's life.

The question is carried further into the relations between the past and the present of the same man, between his old and his new self. And in answering that question also Ezekiel becomes the preacher of a gospel. The judgment of God deals with each man according to his present state, not his past.
