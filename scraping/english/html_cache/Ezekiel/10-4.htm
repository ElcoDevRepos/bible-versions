In the context of Ezekiel, the cherubim are part of the vision of God's chariot-throne, symbolizing His divine presence and majesty. The cherubim are often associated with the holiness and unapproachable nature of God, as seen in their role in the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle and temple (<a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>). The rising of the glory signifies a transition, possibly indicating God's impending departure from the temple due to the people's unfaithfulness.<p><b>and stood over the threshold of the temple.</b><br>The threshold of the temple represents the entrance to the sacred space where God's presence was most intimately known. This movement to the threshold suggests a pause before departure, highlighting the gravity of the situation. It serves as a warning to the people of Israel about the consequences of their idolatry and disobedience. The temple, central to Jewish worship and identity, is now at risk of losing its most vital aspect: the presence of God.<p><b>The temple was filled with the cloud,</b><br>The cloud is a recurring symbol of God's presence throughout the Bible, notably during the Exodus when it guided the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>) and filled the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>). In Solomon's temple, the cloud also signified God's glory (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). Here, the filling of the temple with the cloud underscores the reality of God's presence and the seriousness of His potential departure. It serves as a visual manifestation of His glory and a reminder of His covenant with Israel.<p><b>and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the LORD.</b><br>The brightness signifies the overwhelming and awe-inspiring nature of God's glory. This brightness is often associated with divine revelation and holiness, as seen in other biblical theophanies (<a href="/exodus/24-17.htm">Exodus 24:17</a>, <a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>). The filling of the court, an area accessible to the people, indicates that God's glory is not confined to the inner sanctum but impacts all who are near. This serves as a powerful reminder of God's omnipresence and the seriousness of His judgment. The brightness also foreshadows the ultimate revelation of God's glory in Jesus Christ, who is described as the radiance of God's glory (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book and the one receiving the vision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_glory_of_the_lord.htm">The Glory of the LORD</a></b><br>This refers to the visible manifestation of God's presence, often associated with a cloud or brightness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings associated with the presence and glory of God, often depicted as guardians of sacred spaces.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites in Jerusalem, representing God's dwelling among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_threshold_of_the_temple.htm">The Threshold of the Temple</a></b><br>The entrance area of the temple, symbolizing a transition point where God's presence is moving.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_presence_of_god.htm">The Presence of God</a></b><br>God's glory is a powerful and awe-inspiring presence.

Now God&#8217;s glory, once enthroned &#8220;between the cherubim&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>), begins to move.<p>- This rising signals divine displeasure; the people&#8217;s ongoing idolatry forces the Lord to withdraw His manifest presence (<a href="/ezekiel/8-6.htm">Ezekiel 8:6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-26.htm">2 Kings 23:26</a>).<p>- Yet, even in judgment, God allows Ezekiel&#8212;and us&#8212;to witness His holiness and faithfulness, reminding us of passages like <a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1&#8211;5</a> where His glory fills the temple and confronts sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and stood over the threshold of the temple</b><p>- The threshold was the doorway between the holy place and the outer courts. When God pauses here, He is both warning and waiting, offering one more moment for repentance (compare <a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18</a>; 11:22&#8211;23).<p>- This &#8220;in-between&#8221; position anticipates departure, much as the glory cloud later leaves the Mount of Olives (<a href="/ezekiel/11-23.htm">Ezekiel 11:23</a>), a solemn echo of Ichabod&#8212;&#8220;the glory has departed&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/4-21.htm">1 Samuel 4:21</a>).<p>- For believers, it&#8217;s a sober reminder that unrepentant sin grieves the Spirit (<a href="/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>) and jeopardizes fellowship, even while God remains patient (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The temple was filled with the cloud</b><p>- The cloud is the same visible glory that filled the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34&#8211;35</a>) and Solomon&#8217;s temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>- It represents God&#8217;s tangible nearness: guidance by day (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>) and covering by night (<a href="/psalms/105-39.htm">Psalm 105:39</a>).<p>- Though departing, the Lord still manifests Himself in fullness, underscoring that He alone decides how and when His presence is displayed (<a href="/daniel/4-35.htm">Daniel 4:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the LORD</b><p>- Light streams from the inner court to the outer, so everyone in the temple complex can see it&#8212;much like the shepherds who saw &#8220;the glory of the Lord&#8221; shining around them (<a href="/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9</a>).<p>- This brightness conveys purity and judgment together (<a href="/habakkuk/3-4.htm">Habakkuk 3:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/15-8.htm">Revelation 15:8</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s glory cannot be contained; even in withdrawal it radiates, stressing His unchanging holiness (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>) and exposing all that is unclean (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/10-4.htm">Ezekiel 10:4</a> pictures God&#8217;s glory rising from its rightful throne above the cherubim, pausing at the temple threshold, filling every space with cloud and brilliant light, and signaling imminent departure because of Israel&#8217;s persistent rebellion. The scene warns that God will not dwell with unrepentant sin, yet it also testifies to His patience and His unwavering holiness. For us, it calls for humble repentance, reverent awe, and renewed gratitude that, through Christ, the glory of God has come to dwell in us and will never leave those who are truly His (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">The glory of the Lord went up from the cherub.</span>--As in <a href="/ezekiel/10-2.htm" title="And he spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill your hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.">Ezekiel 10:2</a>, the singular, <span class= "ital">cherub, </span>instead of the usual plural. Here it is thought to designate, not the four living creatures of the vision, but the cherubim overshadowing the mercy-seat, and to indicate that the manifestation of the Divine presence now left the Holy of Holies, and went to the threshold of the door of the house, preparatory to leaving it altogether. The expression is obscure, since the place of the manifestation of the Divine presence in the most holy place is usually described as "between the cherubim" (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm" title="And there I will meet with you, and I will commune with you from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are on the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give you in commandment to the children of Israel.">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="/numbers/7-89.htm" title="And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation to speak with him, then he heard the voice of one speaking to him from off the mercy seat that was on the ark of testimony, from between the two cherubim: and he spoke to him.">Numbers 7:89</a>; <a href="/psalms/80-1.htm" title="Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you that lead Joseph like a flock; you that dwell between the cherubim, shine forth.">Psalm 80:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/99-1.htm" title="The LORD reigns; let the people tremble: he sits between the cherubim; let the earth be moved.">Psalm 99:1</a>, &c.). Of the main point, however, there can be no doubt--that the Divine presence is represented as in the act of leaving the Temple. "The house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord's glory" as He departed, in striking contrast with the similar manifestations (<a href="/context/exodus/40-34.htm" title="Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.">Exodus 40:34-35</a>;
