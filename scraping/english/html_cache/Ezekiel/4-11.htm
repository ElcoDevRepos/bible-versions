This precise measurement signifies the scarcity of resources during the impending siege of Jerusalem. The act of measuring water highlights the dire conditions and rationing that the inhabitants would face. In biblical times, water was a precious commodity, especially in arid regions like the Middle East. This rationing serves as a symbolic act to convey the severity of the judgment coming upon Jerusalem due to their disobedience and idolatry. The scarcity of water can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual drought, where the people have turned away from the living water that God provides (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>).<p><b>and you are to drink it at set times</b><br>The instruction to drink the water at set times further emphasizes the discipline and control required during a siege. This reflects the reality of living under siege conditions, where resources must be carefully managed to ensure survival. The set times for drinking may also symbolize the structured and ordained nature of God's judgment, as well as His sovereignty over the events that unfold. This aspect of the prophecy can be connected to the broader biblical theme of God's timing and order, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, where there is a time for every purpose under heaven. Additionally, the discipline required in this act can be seen as a call to spiritual discipline and reliance on God, who provides for His people even in times of trial.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Just as God later says, &#8220;I will cut off the supply of bread in Jerusalem; they will eat bread by weight and in anxiety and drink water by measure and in dread&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/4-16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16</a>), the limited water mirrors the famine conditions that would accompany the Babylonian siege.<p>&#8226; Scripture often links measured rations with divine judgment: &#8220;When I cut off your supply of bread, ten women will bake your bread in a single oven and dole out the bread by weight&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>); &#8220;There was a great famine in Samaria&#8230; a donkey&#8217;s head was sold for eighty shekels of silver&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/6-25.htm">2 Kings 6:25</a>). The precise measurement underscores that the hardship comes from God&#8217;s hand, not mere chance.<p>&#8226; Yet even in judgment the Lord preserves life. He gives just enough for survival&#8212;echoing how He sustained Elijah with measured provisions (<a href="/1_kings/17-10.htm">1 Kings 17:10-16</a>) and later provided daily manna in exact portions (<a href="/exodus/16-16.htm">Exodus 16:16-18</a>). Scarcity becomes an invitation to depend wholly on Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to drink</b><p>&#8226; The ration is specifically &#8220;to drink,&#8221; reminding us that God&#8217;s discipline does not aim at annihilation but at repentance and restoration. Israel will not die of thirst; they will taste the bitterness of shortage so they might thirst again for the Lord (<a href="/psalms/42-1.htm">Psalm 42:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Water in Scripture pictures both physical necessity and spiritual satisfaction. Jesus later declares, &#8220;Whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst&#8221; (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>), pointing beyond Ezekiel&#8217;s literal pint to the ultimate quenching found in Christ.<p>&#8226; By commanding Ezekiel to live out the ration publicly, God turns the prophet into a living sermon&#8212;much like Hosea&#8217;s marriage (<a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>) or Isaiah&#8217;s children&#8217;s names (<a href="/isaiah/8-18.htm">Isaiah 8:18</a>). The message is unavoidable: if the righteous prophet must live on meager water, how much more will the unrepentant city?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you are to drink it at set times</b><p>&#8226; Scheduled sips picture the oppressive routine of siege life. Instead of drinking whenever thirst strikes, the people will wait for the appointed moment, their days governed by shortage rather than abundance. Jeremiah describes similar dread: &#8220;Their nobles send their servants for water; they go to the cisterns but find no water&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/14-3.htm">Jeremiah 14:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;set times&#8221; echoes God&#8217;s orderly provision in better days&#8212;morning and evening sacrifices (<a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>), fixed times for manna (<a href="/exodus/16-21.htm">Exodus 16:21</a>), and seasons for rain (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>). Under judgment those rhythms remain, but they are stripped to bare minimums.<p>&#8226; Rationed time and rationed supply also highlight personal responsibility. Ezekiel must obey the exact schedule; so will Jerusalem. Disregarding God&#8217;s timetable&#8212;whether Sabbath rest (<a href="/nehemiah/13-15.htm">Nehemiah 13:15-18</a>) or prophetic warnings&#8212;brings discipline. Now the clock itself becomes a teacher.<p>&#8226; The set times carry a hidden mercy: they prevent Ezekiel from draining his pint too quickly and dying. Even under wrath God&#8217;s structure preserves life, hinting at future restoration (<a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/4-11.htm">Ezekiel 4:11</a> commands the prophet to live on a one-pint, carefully timed daily water ration. The measured pint announces siege-driven scarcity; the act of drinking shows that discipline aims at repentance, not extinction; and the fixed schedule turns every hour into a reminder that the Lord, not circumstance, rules the nation&#8217;s fate. Scarcity, structure, and survival all converge to call God&#8217;s people back to wholehearted dependence on Him, anticipating the day when He will &#8220;pour out water on the thirsty land&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">The sixth part of an hin.</span>--There is also a difference among the authorities as to the measures of capacity for liquids. These would make the sixth part of an hin from six-tenths to nine-tenths of a pint. This also was to be drunk once a day.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sixth, part of an hin,</span> etc. According to the varying accounts of the "hin" given by Jewish writers, this would give from .6 to .9 of a pint. And this was, like the food, to be doled out once a day. Possibly "the bread of affliction and the water of affliction," in <a href="/1_kings/22-27.htm">1 Kings 22:27</a> and <a href="/isaiah/30-20.htm">Isaiah 30:20</a>, contains a reference to the quantity as well as the quality of a prison dietary as thus described.
