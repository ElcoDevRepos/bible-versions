In the context of ancient Israel, the Year of Jubilee allowed for the return of sold property to the original owner (<a href="/leviticus/25-13.htm">Leviticus 25:13</a>). However, Ezekiel's prophecy indicates that this customary restoration will not occur, symbolizing the permanence of the coming judgment. The seller's inability to recover his property underscores the severity of the situation, as the land, a significant aspect of God's covenant with Israel, will be lost due to their disobedience. This also highlights the futility of relying on economic or social norms when divine judgment is at hand.<p><b>For the vision concerning the whole multitude will not be revoked,</b><br>The "vision" refers to the prophetic revelation given to Ezekiel about the impending destruction and exile of Judah. This vision is comprehensive, affecting the "whole multitude," indicating that the judgment is all-encompassing and no one will be exempt. The irrevocable nature of the vision emphasizes God's sovereignty and the certainty of His word. This aligns with other prophetic declarations, such as those found in Isaiah and Jeremiah, where God's decrees are portrayed as unchangeable (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/4-28.htm">Jeremiah 4:28</a>). The use of "multitude" suggests a collective responsibility and consequence for the nation's sins.<p><b>and because of their iniquity,</b><br>The term "iniquity" refers to the moral and spiritual corruption of the people, which has provoked God's judgment. Throughout the book of Ezekiel, the prophet details the various sins of Israel, including idolatry, social injustice, and covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/ezekiel/8-6.htm">Ezekiel 8:6-18</a>). This phrase underscores the cause of the impending disaster: the people's persistent rebellion against God. Theologically, it reflects the principle that sin leads to judgment, a theme consistent throughout Scripture (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). The iniquity of Israel serves as a warning to all believers about the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>not one of them will preserve his life.</b><br>This phrase highlights the totality of the judgment, where no individual will escape the consequences of the nation's collective sin. It reflects the seriousness of divine justice, where the penalty for sin is death (<a href="/ezekiel/18-4.htm">Ezekiel 18:4</a>). The inevitability of this outcome serves as a sobering reminder of the holiness and righteousness of God. In a broader biblical context, it points to the need for a savior, as humanity is incapable of preserving life through its own efforts. This foreshadows the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who offers eternal life to those who believe in Him (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the mouthpiece of God, delivering messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are in exile due to their persistent disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, serving as a backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seller.htm">The Seller</a></b><br>Represents those who have lost their possessions due to the judgment of God, symbolizing the irreversible nature of God's decree.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision.htm">The Vision</a></b><br>Refers to the prophetic revelation given to Ezekiel about the impending judgment on Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/irreversibility_of_god's_judgment.htm">Irreversibility of God's Judgment</a></b><br>Once God has decreed judgment due to persistent sin, it cannot be reversed.

Among the Israelites the most important buying and selling was that of land, and it was provided in the law (<a href="/context/leviticus/25-14.htm" title="And if you sell ought to your neighbor, or buy ought of your neighbor's hand, you shall not oppress one another:">Leviticus 25:14-16</a>) that this should in no case extend beyond the year of jubilee, when all land must revert to its possessor by inheritance. The seller in that year should return to his possession. Now it is foretold that the desolation shall continue so long that, even if the seller lived, he should be unable to avail himself of the jubilee year. "It is a natural thing to rejoice in the purchase of property, and to mourn over its sale, but when slavery and captivity stare you in the face, rejoicing and mourning are equally absurd" (S. Jerome). The idea of the latter part of the verse is, that no one shall grow strong since his life is passed in iniquity.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the seller shall not return,</span> etc. At first the thought seems only to add to the sorrow of the seller. He is told that he, at least, shall not return to his old estate. Even though they should be alive at the year of jubilee, their exile had to last its appointed time, Ezekiel's forty (<a href="/ezekiel/4-6.htm">Ezekiel 4:6</a>) and Jeremiah's seventy years (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>). This, however, did not exclude the return of their children (<a href="/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>), and in the mean time all private sorrow would fall into the background as compared with the great public woe of the destruction of the holy city. <span class="cmt_word">The vision is touching,</span> etc. The noun is used as a synonym for prophecy, as elsewhere (<a href="/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>; <a href="/nahum/1-1.htm">Nahum 1:1</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>). It may be noted that it is specially characteristic of Ezekiel (seven times) and Daniel (eleven times). For the Authorized Version read with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">none shall return</span>, or better (with the Vulgate and Keil), <span class="accented">the vision touching the whole multitude shall not return, i.e.</span> shall go straight onward to do its work (comp. <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). So taken, there is a kind of play upon the iterated word: "The seller shall not turn his footsteps back, neither shall the prophecy." <span class="accented">Vestigia nulla retrorsum</span> shall be true of both. I take the other words, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">no man in the iniquity of his life shall strengthen himself</span>, noting the fact that the word for "strengthen" is that which enters into Ezekiel's name. It is as though he said, "God is the only true source of strength to thee, as thy very name bears witness." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/7-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The seller</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1499;&#1461;&#1431;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7733;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
