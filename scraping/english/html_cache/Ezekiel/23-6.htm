The use of blue in the garments of the individuals described here suggests their high status and importance. Biblically, blue was used in the tabernacle and priestly garments (<a href="/exodus/28-31.htm">Exodus 28:31</a>), symbolizing heavenly authority and divine service. The mention of blue here may indicate the allure and prestige of these foreign powers, which Israel found enticing.<p><b>governors and commanders</b><br>These terms refer to high-ranking officials and military leaders, indicating a structured and powerful political system. Historically, the Assyrian and Babylonian empires, which are likely referenced here, had complex hierarchies with governors overseeing provinces and commanders leading armies. This reflects the organized might of these nations, which Israel and Judah were tempted to rely on instead of trusting in God.<p><b>all desirable young men</b><br>This phrase highlights the physical appeal and vigor of these foreign leaders. In the context of Ezekiel, it underscores the temptation and allure of foreign alliances. The emphasis on their desirability suggests that Israel was drawn to their apparent strength and attractiveness, much like the forbidden allure of idolatry. This mirrors the spiritual adultery theme prevalent in the prophetic books, where Israel's unfaithfulness to God is likened to infidelity.<p><b>horsemen mounted on steeds</b><br>The imagery of horsemen on steeds conveys military strength and mobility. Horses were a symbol of power and warfare in the ancient Near East, and their use in battle was a significant advantage. This phrase emphasizes the military prowess of these nations, which Israel sought after. Biblically, reliance on horses and chariots is often contrasted with reliance on God (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>), highlighting the futility of trusting in human strength over divine protection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/oholah_and_oholibah.htm">Oholah and Oholibah</a></b><br>These are symbolic names for Samaria and Jerusalem, respectively.

Samaria twisted that symbol, admiring pagan finery instead of the Lord who gave it.<p>&#8226; The picture is literal&#8212;real uniforms, real allure&#8212;yet it also exposes a heart that preferred dazzling fashion over covenant faithfulness (<a href="/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16&#8211;23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Governors and commanders</b><p>&#8226; These were the empire&#8217;s top officials, men trusted with civil rule and military strategy (<a href="/daniel/3-2.htm">Daniel 3:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Samaria court-shopped among them, hoping worldly alliances would secure prosperity (<a href="/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Depending on human power always backfires; &#8220;Cursed is the man who trusts in man&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a>). God allowed the very leaders Samaria admired to become instruments of her chastening (<a href="/nahum/3-18.htm">Nahum 3:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All desirable young men</b><p>&#8226; The phrase underlines vigor, attractiveness, and promise (<a href="/2_samuel/14-25.htm">2 Samuel 14:25</a>). Samaria was drawn to outward sparkle, not inward character.<p>&#8226; What looked desirable became destructive; the youthful strength of Assyria would soon shatter the northern kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; God warns against judging by appearance alone (<a href="/proverbs/31-30.htm">Proverbs 31:30</a>).

Assyria&#8217;s horsemen were the ancient world&#8217;s cutting-edge military arm.<p>&#8226; Israel was specifically told not to seek safety in horses (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>). Ignoring that command, Samaria chased the very thing God forbade.<p>&#8226; The LORD would later hurl horse and rider into the sea of judgment, just as He did to Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/15-4.htm">Exodus 15:4</a>). Earthly might never outruns divine sovereignty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/23-6.htm">Ezekiel 23:6</a> paints a vivid, literal portrait of Samaria fawning over Assyria&#8217;s dazzling uniforms, exalted officials, youthful vigor, and formidable cavalry. Each attraction reveals a deeper spiritual adultery: treasuring worldly splendor above the God who had already clothed, led, strengthened, and defended His people. The verse stands as a sober reminder that what impresses the eye can ensnare the heart, and that trust placed anywhere but in the LORD inevitably invites ruin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Horsemen.</span>--The Assyrians, like the Egyptians, made large use of cavalry, as was necessary to a warlike nation; the multiplication of horses had on this account been forbidden to the Israelites (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm" title="But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: for as much as the LORD has said to you, You shall from now on return no more that way.">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Clothed with blue</span>.
