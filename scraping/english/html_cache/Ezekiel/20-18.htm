This time was marked by testing and rebellion, as seen in various accounts in Exodus and Numbers. The wilderness symbolizes a place of both physical and spiritual trial, where God provided for His people but also disciplined them for their disobedience.<p><b>I said to their children</b><br>This phrase indicates a direct communication from God to the next generation of Israelites. It highlights the importance of passing down God's commandments and the consequences of disobedience. The children of the rebellious generation were being warned to avoid the mistakes of their parents, emphasizing the continuity of God's covenant and expectations across generations.<p><b>Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers</b><br>The statutes of their fathers refer to the sinful practices and traditions that the previous generation had adopted, which were contrary to God's laws. This warning underscores the need for each generation to evaluate their practices against God's standards rather than blindly following ancestral customs. It echoes the call for repentance and renewal found throughout the prophetic literature.<p><b>or keep their ordinances</b><br>Ordinances here refer to the specific rules and practices that the Israelites' ancestors followed, which were often influenced by surrounding pagan cultures. This admonition serves as a reminder of the distinctiveness of God's law and the call to holiness, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/18-3.htm">Leviticus 18:3-5</a>, where God commands His people to live differently from the nations around them.<p><b>or defile yourselves with their idols</b><br>Idolatry was a persistent issue for Israel, as they frequently turned to the gods of neighboring nations. This phrase warns against the spiritual corruption that comes from idol worship, which is a recurring theme in the Old Testament. The prohibition against idolatry is rooted in the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>) and is a call to exclusive devotion to Yahweh. The New Testament continues this theme, with Paul warning against idolatry in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/10-14.htm">1 Corinthians 10:14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites, often focusing on their rebellion and the need for repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_children_of_israel.htm">The Children of Israel</a></b><br>The descendants of the Israelites who were led out of Egypt.

The Lord met His people there with cloud and fire (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>), manna (<a href="/exodus/16-15.htm">Exodus 16:15</a>), and covenant renewal (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-1.htm">Deuteronomy 29:1</a>).

At the same time, it would be a mistake to confine what he says exclusively to that generation. In this, as in the other parts of the discourse, he regards Israel as a whole, and while speaking of one period of their history especially, yet treats of national characteristics which may have come to their most marked development only at a later time. This generation was very earnestly warned against the sins of their fathers, and exhorted to obedience to the Divine law. The whole Book of Deuteronomy is the comment on <a href="/context/ezekiel/20-18.htm" title="But I said to their children in the wilderness, Walk you not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:">Ezekiel 20:18-20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I said unto their children,</span> etc. The words can refer to nothing but the great utterance of the Book of Deuteronomy as addressed to the children of those who had perished in the wilderness. That utterance also, it is implied, as indeed the Baal-peor history at the close of the forty years showed, fell on deaf ears. Then also there was, once again, in the inevitable anthropomorphic language, a change of purpose, from that of a rigorous judgment to the mercy which prevailed against it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/20-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the wilderness</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(bam&#183;mi&#7695;&#183;b&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
