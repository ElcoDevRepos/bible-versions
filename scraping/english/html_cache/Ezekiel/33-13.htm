In the context of Ezekiel, the prophet serves as a watchman, delivering God's messages. The assurance of life is contingent upon continued faithfulness, reflecting the conditional nature of Old Testament covenants (Deuteronomy 28). The promise of life is not merely physical but also spiritual, pointing to eternal life, a theme expanded in the New Testament (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<p><b>but he then trusts in his righteousness</b><br>This warns against self-reliance and pride. Trusting in one's own righteousness can lead to complacency and a false sense of security. The Pharisees in the New Testament exemplify this attitude, relying on their adherence to the law rather than faith in God (<a href="/luke/18-9.htm">Luke 18:9-14</a>). Theologically, this underscores the doctrine of justification by faith, not by works (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><b>and commits iniquity</b><br>Iniquity refers to moral wrongdoing or sin. The Hebrew word for iniquity, "avon," implies a twisting or perversion of what is right. This phrase highlights the danger of falling into sin despite a history of righteousness. It serves as a warning that past righteousness does not excuse future disobedience. The concept of iniquity is central to understanding human nature and the need for redemption through Christ (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>).<p><b>then none of his righteous works will be remembered</b><br>This reflects the principle of divine justice, where past good deeds do not outweigh present sin. It aligns with the biblical theme that God judges each person according to their deeds (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>). The idea of remembrance is significant in Scripture, often associated with God's covenant faithfulness (<a href="/genesis/9-15.htm">Genesis 9:15</a>). Here, it serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of turning away from righteousness.<p><b>he will die because of the iniquity he has committed</b><br>The consequence of sin is death, both physical and spiritual. This echoes the warning given to Adam in <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a> and is reiterated throughout Scripture (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). The death mentioned here is not only a natural consequence but also a divine judgment. It underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance. In the broader biblical narrative, it points to the necessity of Christ's atoning sacrifice, which offers life in place of death (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.
