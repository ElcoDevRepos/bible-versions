In the prophetic tradition, the phrase "the Lord GOD says" underscores that the message is not from the prophet himself but from God. This is a common introduction in prophetic literature, indicating the seriousness and divine origin of the message. It sets the stage for a parable or allegory, a method often used by prophets to convey deeper truths.<p><b>&#8216;A great eagle with great wings and long pinions,</b><br>The "great eagle" symbolizes a powerful nation or ruler. In the context of Ezekiel, this eagle represents Babylon and its king, Nebuchadnezzar. The imagery of an eagle is used elsewhere in Scripture to denote swiftness and strength (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>, <a href="/isaiah/46-11.htm">Isaiah 46:11</a>). The "great wings and long pinions" suggest the extensive reach and influence of Babylon, capable of swift and decisive action.<p><b>full of feathers of many colors,</b><br>The "feathers of many colors" may symbolize the diversity and wealth of the Babylonian empire, which was composed of various peoples and cultures. This imagery highlights the grandeur and splendor of Babylon, as well as its ability to attract and incorporate different nations under its rule. The multicolored feathers could also imply the strategic alliances and vassal states under Babylon's control.<p><b>came to Lebanon</b><br>Lebanon is known for its majestic cedar trees, which were highly valued in the ancient Near East for construction and trade. In this context, "Lebanon" symbolizes the land of Israel, particularly Jerusalem, which was under Babylonian influence. The use of "Lebanon" evokes the idea of beauty and strength, as well as the political and economic significance of the region.<p><b>and took away the top of the cedar.</b><br>The "top of the cedar" represents the leadership or the royal line of Judah. This action refers to the deportation of King Jehoiachin and the nobility of Judah to Babylon in 597 BC. The cedar, a symbol of strength and majesty, being stripped of its top, signifies the removal of the kingdom's power and autonomy. This act is a fulfillment of God's judgment on Judah for its disobedience, as prophesied by earlier prophets. The imagery also foreshadows the eventual restoration and hope for a remnant, as the cedar is not completely destroyed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_eagle.htm">The Great Eagle</a></b><br>Symbolizes a powerful king or nation.

Here the bird stands for Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon (<a href="/ezekiel/17-12.htm">Ezekiel 17:12</a>). God is showing, in vivid story form, how Babylon&#8217;s might would dominate Judah. We read this literally: God Himself identifies the eagle as a real monarch acting under divine sovereignty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Great Wings and Long Pinions</b><p>The &#8220;great wings and long pinions&#8221; highlight vast reach and military strength. Babylon could stretch its influence across territories just as an eagle&#8217;s wingspan covers great distances (<a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6&#8211;8</a>). The wording reminds us that nothing about Judah&#8217;s situation was outside God&#8217;s foreknowledge; He allowed an empire with &#8220;long pinions&#8221; to extend over His people for a season (<a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Full of Feathers of Many Colors</b><p>The plumage &#8220;of many colors&#8221; points to Babylon&#8217;s wealth, multicultural makeup, and the variety of nations already gathered under its rule (<a href="/daniel/2-37.htm">Daniel 2:37&#8211;38</a>). For Judah, this meant facing not merely a single army but the combined resources of a vast coalition. Yet even such splendor is set in contrast to the LORD&#8217;s greater glory (<a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>); earthly magnificence never rivals His.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Came to Lebanon</b><p>&#8220;Lebanon&#8221; is a poetic reference to Jerusalem because its temple and royal palace were paneled with Lebanese cedar (<a href="/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-23.htm">Jeremiah 22:23</a>). By using the name, God underscores Judah&#8217;s cherished identity and how Babylon would reach right into the heart of the covenant land. The prophecy came true when Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem in 597 BC (<a href="/2_kings/24-10.htm">2 Kings 24:10&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Took Away the Top of the Cedar</b><p>The &#8220;top of the cedar&#8221; signifies King Jehoiachin and the leading nobles (<a href="/ezekiel/17-13.htm">Ezekiel 17:13</a>; <a href="/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>). Babylon removed them to exile in Babylon, leaving a lesser &#8220;branch&#8221; (Zedekiah) behind. The act fulfills earlier warnings that unfaithfulness would strip Judah of her leadership (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>). God&#8217;s imagery is literal history recorded for us: the highest branch was physically uprooted and transplanted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/17-3.htm">Ezekiel 17:3</a> pictures Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s 597 BC invasion: a powerful, far-reaching, magnificently arrayed empire swoops into Jerusalem, seizes its king, and carries him off. The verse assures us that God&#8217;s Word is precise&#8212;every detail of the parable unfolded exactly as foretold. In the drama of the great eagle and the cedar top, the LORD reminds His people then and now that He remains sovereign over nations, faithfully directing history to accomplish His righteous purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">A great eagle with great wings.</span>--In the original "<span class= "ital">the </span>great eagle."

Nebuchadnezzar is compared to an eagle also in <a href="/jeremiah/48-40.htm" title="For thus said the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.">Jeremiah 48:40</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-22.htm" title="Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.">Jeremiah 49:22</a>; and Cyrus to a bird of prey in <a href="/isaiah/46-11.htm" title="Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executes my counsel from a far country: yes, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.">Isaiah 46:11</a>. He has great and long wings, because he has already flown victoriously over wide-spread lands; and he is "full of feathers which had divers colours," because he had embraced in his empire a variety of nations differing in languages, manners, and customs.<p><span class= "bld">Came unto Lebanon.</span>--Jerusalem is called Lebanon, as in <a href="/jeremiah/22-23.htm" title="O inhabitant of Lebanon, that make your nest in the cedars, how gracious shall you be when pangs come on you, the pain as of a woman in travail!">Jeremiah 22:23</a>; because Lebanon is the home of the cedar, and the royal palace in Jerusalem was so rich in cedar as to be called "the house of the forest of Lebanon" (<a href="/1_kings/7-2.htm" title="He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.">1Kings 7:2</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - The eagle with <span class="cmt_word">great wings and long pinions</span> (Revised Version) probably the golden eagle, the largest species of the genus - stands for Nebuchadnezzar, as it does in <a href="/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>. In <a href="/isaiah/46-11.htm">Isaiah 46:11</a> the "ravenous bird" represents Cyrus. Possibly the eagle head of the Assyrian god Nisroch (<a href="/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a>) may have impressed the symbolism on Ezekiel's mind. A doubtful etymology gives "the great eagle" as the meaning of <span class="accented">Nisroch</span>. The <span class="cmt_word">divers colours</span> indicate the variety of the nations under the king's sway (<a href="/daniel/3-4.htm">Daniel 3:4</a>: 4:1). If the cedar was chosen to t,e the symbol of the monarchy of Judah, then it followed that Lebanon, as the special home of the cedar, should take its place in the parable. Possibly the fact that one of the stateliest palaces of Solomon was known as the "house of the forest of Lebanon" (<a href="/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17, 21</a>) may have made the symbolism specially suggestive. The word for highest branch is peculiar to Ezekiel (here and in ver. 22).
