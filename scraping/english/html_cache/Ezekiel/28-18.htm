Tyre was a prominent ancient Phoenician city known for its wealth and trade. The king's iniquities and dishonest trading practices symbolize moral and spiritual corruption. This reflects the broader biblical theme of judgment against pride and exploitation, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Jeremiah, where similar judgments are pronounced against nations and leaders who exploit others for personal gain.<p><b>you have profaned your sanctuaries</b><br>The sanctuaries refer to places of worship or sacred spaces that have been defiled by the king's actions. In the ancient Near Eastern context, sanctuaries were central to religious and community life. Profaning them indicates a deep level of sacrilege and disrespect for the divine. This echoes the biblical principle that sin not only affects individuals but also desecrates what is holy, as seen in the desecration of the temple in Jerusalem (Ezekiel 8-11).<p><b>So I made fire come from within you, and it consumed you</b><br>This imagery of fire coming from within suggests self-destruction as a consequence of sin. Fire is often used in the Bible as a symbol of divine judgment and purification (e.g., <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>). The internal origin of the fire indicates that the king's downfall is a direct result of his own actions, aligning with the biblical principle that sin carries its own consequences (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>).<p><b>I reduced you to ashes on the ground</b><br>Being reduced to ashes signifies total destruction and humiliation. Ashes are a symbol of mourning and repentance in the Bible (<a href="/job/42-6.htm">Job 42:6</a>, <a href="/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a>), but here they represent the finality of judgment. This imagery is consistent with the fate of other proud and sinful entities in Scripture, such as Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-28</a>).<p><b>in the eyes of all who saw you</b><br>The public nature of the judgment serves as a warning to others. In biblical narratives, God's judgments are often witnessed by others to demonstrate His justice and power (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30-31</a>). This serves as a deterrent to similar behavior and underscores the theme of accountability before God. The visibility of the judgment reinforces the message that no one is beyond the reach of divine justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Ezekiel has already cataloged Tyre&#8217;s arrogance and idolatry (<a href="/ezekiel/28-2.htm">Ezekiel 28:2</a>; 28:5). The phrase reminds us:<p>&#8226; Sin accumulates; judgment weighs every act (<a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>).<p>&#8226; God does not overlook repeated rebellion (<a href="/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Even heavenly beings fell through multiplied iniquity (<a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-15</a>).<p>The verse affirms that sin is never trivial; it piles up until God must act.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the dishonesty of your trading</b><p>Tyre thrived on commerce, yet greed corrupted its marketplace (<a href="/bsb/ezekiel/27.htm">Ezekiel 27</a>). Scripture often links crooked business with divine displeasure:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Dishonest scales are an abomination to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/11-1.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Amos denounced merchants who &#8220;shortchange with dishonest scales&#8221; (<a href="/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5-7</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a> describes a global economy that collapses under similar corruption.<p>Material success gained by deceit invites God&#8217;s judgment, however glittering it looks.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you have profaned your sanctuaries</b><p>What should have been holy became polluted. Whether Ezekiel points to literal temples in Tyre or, typologically, to the king&#8217;s own privileged presence before God (<a href="/ezekiel/28-14.htm">Ezekiel 28:14</a>), the lesson holds:<p>&#8226; Sin desecrates whatever is meant for worship (<a href="/ezekiel/7-24.htm">Ezekiel 7:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers today are God&#8217;s temple; defilement still brings destruction (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16-17</a>).<p>When leaders embrace sin, even their most sacred spaces lose protection.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So I made fire come from within you</b><p>Judgment arises from the very center of the offender. Similar scenes appear when God judges Korah (<a href="/numbers/16-35.htm">Numbers 16:35</a>) or foretells Jerusalem&#8217;s fire (<a href="/jeremiah/21-14.htm">Jeremiah 21:14</a>). The principle:<p>&#8226; Sin carries the spark of its own ruin.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s wrath is both just and personal&#8212;He ignites what evil has stored up.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and it consumed you</b><p>The fire is thorough, leaving nothing untouched. Scripture often pictures God as &#8220;a consuming fire&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>). For Tyre&#8217;s king&#8212;and for Satan whom he mirrors&#8212;the consuming fire is decisive, not corrective.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I reduced you to ashes on the ground</b><p>Ashes signify total defeat and irreversible loss (<a href="/malachi/4-3.htm">Malachi 4:3</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-6.htm">2 Peter 2:6</a>). The loftiest ruler is brought down to dust, fulfilling the warning, &#8220;For dust you are, and to dust you shall return&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>).

On-lookers witness and tremble, much like the merchants who watch Babylon&#8217;s smoke from afar (<a href="/revelation/18-9.htm">Revelation 18:9-10</a>).

The fire begins within, moves outward, and ends in public humiliation. Whether applied to the proud king of Tyre, the ultimate fall of Satan, or any heart today, the message is clear: unchecked sin burns its own house down, but God&#8217;s righteous verdict is final, visible, and deserved.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Defiled thy sanctuaries.--</span>These are not to be understood so much of the actual temples of Tyre as of the ideal "holy mountain of God," in which the prophet has represented the prince of Tyre as "a covering cherub." Yet still, doubtless, even in the former sense, it was true that the Tyrians, like the Gentiles of whom St. Paul speaks in <a href="/romans/1-21.htm" title="Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.">Romans 1:21</a>, did not act up to the religious light they had, and violating their own consciences and sense of right, defiled even such representation of the true religion as still remained in their idolatrous worship. The main thought, however, is the former one, and it is in accordance with this that the fire is represented as going forth to consume the king. Many of the Hebrew manuscripts have <span class= "ital">sanctuary</span> in the singular.<p><span class= "bld">By the iniquity of thy traffick.--</span>Here, as so often in other cases, the sin is represented as consisting in the abuse of the very blessings which God had given, and this sin as leading directly to its own punishment. No fact is more striking in history, whether of Israel or of the heathen, than that the gifts of God, which should have been to their blessing and His glory, are perverted by the sinfulness of man: first to their own guilt, and then, in consequence, to their ruin.<p><a href="/context/ezekiel/28-20.htm" title="Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 28:20-26</a> constitute another distinct prophecy, of which <a href="/context/ezekiel/28-20.htm" title="Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 28:20-24</a> are occupied with the denunciation of judgment upon Zidon, and <a href="/context/ezekiel/28-25.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob.">Ezekiel 28:25-26</a> with promises to Israel. There are several obvious reasons, besides that of making up the number of the nations to seven, why at least a word of prophecy should have been directed especially against Zidon, notwithstanding her forming a part of Ph?nicia and contributing to the mariners of Tyre (<a href="/ezekiel/27-8.htm" title="The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were your mariners: your wise men, O Tyrus, that were in you, were your pilots.">Ezekiel 27:8</a>). In the first place, Zidon (situated about twenty-five miles north of Tyre) was the more ancient city from which Tyre had sprung, and always maintained her independence. Hence she might seem not to be exposed to the judgment of God upon Tyre, unless especially mentioned. Then also Zidon (rather than Tyre) had been peculiarly the source of corrupting idolatrous influences upon Israel. This had begun as early as the times of the Judges (<a href="/judges/10-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.">Judges 10:6</a>); it had been continued and increased in the days of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/11-33.htm" title="Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father.">1Kings 11:33</a>); it reached its consummation under the reign of Ahab, who married Jezebel, the daughter of the king of Zidon and high priest of Baal (<a href="/1_kings/16-31.htm" title="And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.">1Kings 16:31</a>), and who set up the worship of Baal as the state religion of Israel. That this influence was still powerful in Judah also in the days of Ezekiel is plain from the reference to the Thammuz worship in <a href="/ezekiel/8-14.htm" title="Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.">Ezekiel 8:14</a>. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/28-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">By the multitude</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1512;&#1465;&#1443;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;r&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
