The use of "plague and bloodshed" echoes the plagues of Egypt (Exodus 7-12), signifying God's power to protect His people and execute justice. Historically, plagues were seen as direct interventions by God, often used to demonstrate His sovereignty. Bloodshed implies a violent end, reminiscent of God's judgment on nations throughout the Old Testament, such as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19).<p><b>I will pour out torrents of rain, hailstones, fire, and sulfur on him and on his troops and on the many nations with him.</b><br>This imagery of natural disasters as instruments of divine judgment is consistent with biblical accounts of God's wrath. The "torrents of rain" and "hailstones" recall the seventh plague on Egypt (<a href="/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23-26</a>) and the defeat of the Amorites (<a href="/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>). "Fire and sulfur" are reminiscent of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>), symbolizing total annihilation. These elements highlight God's control over nature and His ability to use it to fulfill His purposes. The mention of "many nations" suggests a widespread coalition against Israel, emphasizing the global scope of this prophetic conflict.
