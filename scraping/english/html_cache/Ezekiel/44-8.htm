In the context of Ezekiel, the temple represents God's dwelling place among His people, and the "holy things" refer to the sacred duties, objects, and rituals that were to be handled with reverence and obedience. The neglect of these responsibilities signifies a broader spiritual decline and disobedience to God's commands, as outlined in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-3</a>). This failure is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where the Israelites often turned away from God's statutes, leading to judgment and exile.<p><b>but have appointed others to keep charge of My sanctuary for you.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the delegation of priestly duties to those who were not authorized by God to perform them. Historically, the Levitical priesthood was established to serve in the temple, with specific roles assigned to the descendants of Aaron (<a href="/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10</a>). By appointing others, possibly foreigners or those not of the Levitical line, the Israelites violated the divine order and purity required for temple service. This act can be seen as a compromise of spiritual integrity and a failure to uphold the covenant relationship with God. It reflects a broader pattern of Israel's leadership failing to adhere to God's instructions, which is echoed in other scriptures such as <a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a>, where Eli's sons also abused their priestly roles. This mismanagement of the sanctuary foreshadows the need for a perfect High Priest, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who restores the true worship and sanctity of God's presence (<a

From this it has been argued, by Wellhausen, Smend, Driver, and others, that the "strangers" above mentioned had been not only allowed access to the outer court as spectators or as worshippers while the priests were offering sacrifice, but admitted to the inner court as assistants to the priests in their altar duties, that this, the employment of these heathen hierodules, had been the special wickedness of which Israel had been guilty, and that henceforward these "foreign ministers" were to be thrust out from their offices, and their places supplied by the about-to-be-degraded Levites. It is, however, doubtful if the phrase, <span class="accented">keepers of my charge in the sanctuary</span>, can be made to signify more than has already been expressed by the clause, "to be in my sanctuary... when ye offer my bread" (ver. 7), by which, as Kliefoth and Keil explain, Israel had practically made these strangers "keepers of Jehovah's charge," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> observers of the rites of worship prescribed by him, though observers in their way, not in his; if more can be extracted from the words, then the most they can be legitimately made to affirm (as there is no mention of the inner court) is that these "strangers," in addition to obtaining access to the outer court to witness the sacrifices, or perhaps offer such for themselves, had been more or less frequently employed in performing subordinate offices towards the Levites, who were the proper priests' assistants, like the Gibeonites, whom Joshua (Joshua 9:27) made "hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the Lord unto this day," and like the Nethinim, whom, according to Ezra (Ezra 8:20), David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites (see Delitzsch, Luthardt's 'Zeitschrift fur kirchliche Wissenschaft,' 1880, p. 283). (On the phrase, "to keep the charge of Jehovah," as signifying to follow his directions or comply with his prescriptions, see <a href="/numbers/9-23.htm">Numbers 9:23</a>.) "In the sanctuary" explains that the prescriptions alluded to were those pertaining to the sanctuary or to the worship of Jehovah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/44-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And you have not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
