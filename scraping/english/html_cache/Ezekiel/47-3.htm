The direction "eastward" is significant in biblical symbolism, often representing the direction of God's glory and presence, as seen in the Garden of Eden and the entrance to the tabernacle. The "measuring line" indicates precision and order, suggesting God's meticulous plan for restoration and blessing. This imagery is reminiscent of other prophetic visions, such as Zechariah's vision of a man with a measuring line, symbolizing God's intention to rebuild and restore.<p><b>he measured off a thousand cubits</b><br>A "cubit" is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches or 45 centimeters. The act of measuring a thousand cubits signifies a substantial distance, indicating a progressive revelation of God's plan. The repetition of measuring in increments of a thousand cubits throughout the passage suggests a structured and deliberate unfolding of God's purposes. This measurement can also symbolize completeness and divine order, as the number "thousand" often represents fullness in biblical numerology.<p><b>and led me through ankle-deep water</b><br>The "ankle-deep water" represents the initial stage of spiritual growth and blessing. Water is a common biblical symbol for life, cleansing, and the Holy Spirit. This vision of water flowing from the temple is a powerful image of God's life-giving presence and the transformative power of His Spirit. The gradual increase in depth as Ezekiel is led further into the water illustrates the progressive nature of spiritual maturity and the deepening relationship with God. This imagery can be connected to Jesus' promise of "living water" in the New Testament, symbolizing the abundant and life-giving presence of the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who receives visions and messages to deliver to the Israelites.

East is the direction from which God&#8217;s glory had departed (<a href="/ezekiel/11-23.htm">Ezekiel 11:23</a>) and then returned (<a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>). Moving east shows restoration in motion.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;man&#8221; recalls the radiant figure who first met Ezekiel with a measuring rod (<a href="/ezekiel/40-3.htm">Ezekiel 40:3</a>), much like the angelic measurer in <a href="/revelation/21-15.htm">Revelation 21:15</a>. His presence signals divine authority: what follows is God&#8217;s design, not human imagination.<p>&#8226; A &#8220;measuring line&#8221; speaks of order, purpose, and certainty (<a href="/jeremiah/31-39.htm">Jeremiah 31:39</a>; <a href="/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1-2</a>). God is not guessing; He is marking out an exact, sovereign plan for blessing, just as He measured Noah&#8217;s ark (<a href="/genesis/6-15.htm">Genesis 6:15</a>) and the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He measured off a thousand cubits</b><p>&#8226; One thousand cubits&#8212;about 1,500 feet&#8212;is a substantial span. The careful measurement underlines that the river&#8217;s growth is deliberate, not random. In Scripture, measured distances often precede mighty acts: Israel kept &#8220;about two thousand cubits&#8221; from the ark before the Jordan miracle (<a href="/joshua/3-4.htm">Joshua 3:4</a>), and Elijah ran many miles empowered by the Lord (<a href="/1_kings/18-44.htm">1 Kings 18:44-46</a>).<p>&#8226; Repetition lies ahead: each additional thousand cubits will deepen the water (<a href="/ezekiel/47-4.htm">Ezekiel 47:4-5</a>). The pattern pictures progressive grace&#8212;step by step God leads His people into fuller life (<a href="/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And led me through ankle-deep water</b><p>&#8226; Ezekiel is not merely an observer; he is &#8220;led&#8221; into the stream.

Here it flows from the temple, showing that all true refreshment issues from God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/psalms/46-4.htm">Psalm 46:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Though shallow now, greater depths are coming. The ankle-deep phase reminds believers that God meets us where we are, then calls us deeper (<a href="/luke/5-4.htm">Luke 5:4</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/47-3.htm">Ezekiel 47:3</a> introduces a measured, eastward-flowing river that begins with accessible, ankle-deep waters. The heavenly messenger&#8217;s precise surveying reveals God&#8217;s ordered plan to restore life from His sanctuary. The verse invites each believer to step in where the water starts, confident that the same Lord who marks every cubit will also lead us into ever-increasing depths of His Spirit-given life and blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/47.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Brought me through the waters</span>.--The point from which the measurement began is not distinctly mentioned, but is to be assumed as from their source, the threshold of the house.
