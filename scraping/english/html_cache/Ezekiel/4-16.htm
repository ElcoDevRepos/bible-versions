The phrase "He told me" underscores the authority and divine origin of the prophecy. In the context of Ezekiel, God often speaks directly to the prophet, providing instructions and revelations about the future of Israel and surrounding nations.<p><b>&#8220;Son of man,</b><br>The term "Son of man" is a title used frequently in Ezekiel, highlighting the prophet's humanity and his role as a representative of the people. It is a reminder of the distinction between the divine and human, and it foreshadows the use of the same title for Jesus Christ in the New Testament, emphasizing His incarnation and identification with humanity.<p><b>I am going to cut off the supply of food in Jerusalem.</b><br>This phrase predicts a severe famine in Jerusalem, a common consequence of siege warfare in the ancient Near East. Historically, the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem led to extreme scarcity of food, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25:1-3</a>. The cutting off of food supply is a divine judgment, reflecting the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-52.htm">Deuteronomy 28:52-57</a>, where disobedience to God results in dire consequences for the nation.<p><b>They will anxiously eat bread rationed by weight,</b><br>The rationing of bread by weight signifies extreme scarcity and the anxiety that accompanies it. In ancient times, bread was a staple food, and its rationing would indicate a dire situation. This imagery is reminiscent of the curses in <a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>, where God warns of breaking the staff of bread, leading to careful weighing and rationing. The anxiety reflects the psychological impact of famine and the desperation of the people.<p><b>and in despair they will drink water by measure.</b><br>Water, like bread, is essential for survival, and its rationing indicates a severe shortage. The despair associated with drinking water by measure highlights the hopelessness and distress of the people under siege. This situation fulfills the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>, where thirst is a consequence of disobedience. The careful measuring of water also reflects the meticulous control and limitation of resources during a siege, emphasizing the severity of God's judgment on Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

Ezekiel is not reporting rumor or conjecture; he is passing along a direct word from the Lord (<a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>; 3:10-11). The phrase underscores divine authority, reminding us that prophecy carries the same weight as any other portion of Scripture (<a href="/2_peter/1-20.htm">2 Peter 1:20-21</a>). Because the message comes from God, every detail will unfold exactly as stated, just as earlier warnings in <a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-26</a> had come to pass in Israel&#8217;s history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Son of man</b><p>This familiar title, used for Ezekiel over ninety times (<a href="/ezekiel/2-1.htm">Ezekiel 2:1</a>; 3:17), stresses the prophet&#8217;s humanity in contrast to God&#8217;s sovereignty. It keeps the focus on the Lord rather than the messenger. The same contrast shows up when Isaiah says, &#8220;Here am I; send me&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>), and when John is told, &#8220;Write what you see&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/1-19.htm">Revelation 1:19</a>). God employs frail people to deliver perfect truth, highlighting His power and grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am going to cut off the supply of food in Jerusalem</b><p>&#8226; The impending siege will choke off provisions, fulfilling earlier covenant curses (<a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49-57</a>).<p>&#8226; Historically this took place when Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem; &#8220;By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city was so severe that there was no food for the people of the land&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/25-3.htm">2 Kings 25:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement shows both judgment and mercy: judgment because sin has consequences (<a href="/ezekiel/5-7.htm">Ezekiel 5:7-9</a>), and mercy because God warns before He strikes (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Christ later echoed the same pattern of warning before destruction when He foretold the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41-44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will anxiously eat bread rationed by weight</b><p>&#8226; Anxiety flows from scarcity. When bread is weighed, every crumb matters (<a href="/ezekiel/4-10.htm">Ezekiel 4:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; The picture recalls <a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>: &#8220;When I cut off your supply of bread, ten women will bake your bread in a single oven and dole it out by weight.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/lamentations/4-9.htm">Lamentations 4:9-10</a> records the horrifying reality after the prophecy came true&#8212;people desperate enough to resort to unthinkable measures.<p>&#8226; In the New Testament, Jesus teaches His disciples not to worry about food (<a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-33</a>), a promise rooted in obedience; the anxiety pictured here is sin&#8217;s fallout when a nation rejects God&#8217;s reign.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and in despair they will drink water by measure</b><p>&#8226; Water, normally abundant, becomes a measured commodity (<a href="/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>; <a href="/lamentations/5-4.htm">Lamentations 5:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Despair accompanies each swallow&#8212;an emotional as well as physical drought. <a href="/psalms/107-33.htm">Psalm 107:33-34</a> shows God turning &#8220;rivers into a desert&#8221; because of wickedness.<p>&#8226; The controlled portions anticipate even harsher sieges recorded later (<a href="/jeremiah/14-1.htm">Jeremiah 14:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet God&#8217;s ultimate plan is restoration. <a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25</a> promises, &#8220;I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean,&#8221; contrasting the measured, bitter water of judgment with the abundant, cleansing water of renewal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/4-16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16</a> delivers a sober, literal warning: Jerusalem&#8217;s rebellion will bring a siege so severe that bread and water&#8212;the staples of life&#8212;are weighed and measured with fear and despair. God speaks; Ezekiel listens; the people are called to repent. The verse underscores covenant faithfulness on God&#8217;s part: blessings for obedience, discipline for sin. Even in judgment, the Lord&#8217;s Word offers hope, foreshadowing a future restoration when scarcity and anxiety will be replaced by abundance and peace for those who return to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem.</span>--In <a href="/context/ezekiel/4-16.htm" title="Moreover he said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:">Ezekiel 4:16-17</a>, the meaning of the foregoing symbolism is declared in plain language.
