In the context of Ezekiel, God often speaks directly to His people through the prophet, underscoring the importance of the message. The use of "Lord GOD" (Adonai Yahweh) highlights both His sovereignty and covenant relationship with Israel. This phrase sets the stage for a divine intervention, indicating that what follows is not merely a human opinion but a decree from the Creator.<p><b>&#8216;Behold, I Myself will judge:</b><br>The declaration "I Myself" emphasizes God's personal involvement in the judgment process, indicating that He will not delegate this task to others. This reflects God's intimate concern for justice and righteousness among His people. In the broader biblical narrative, God is often portrayed as the ultimate judge (<a href="/psalms/50-6.htm">Psalm 50:6</a>, <a href="/james/4-12.htm">James 4:12</a>), ensuring that His standards are upheld. This personal involvement also foreshadows the coming of Christ, who will execute judgment (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>).<p><b>between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.</b><br>The imagery of "fat sheep" and "lean sheep" symbolizes the disparity between the powerful and the oppressed within the community of Israel. The "fat sheep" represent those who have exploited their position for personal gain, neglecting the needs of others, while the "lean sheep" symbolize those who have been marginalized and mistreated. This metaphor aligns with the broader biblical theme of God defending the oppressed and holding the powerful accountable (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>, <a href="/james/5.htm">James 5:1-6</a>). The judgment between these groups reflects God's commitment to justice and equity, ensuring that the wrongs are righted. This also points to the messianic role of Jesus as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), who cares for all His sheep and ensures justice within His flock.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and divine authority who speaks and acts in judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers His message to the people of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/fat_sheep.htm">Fat Sheep</a></b><br>Symbolic of the leaders and those in power who have exploited others.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lean_sheep.htm">Lean Sheep</a></b><br>Represent the oppressed and marginalized within the community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the prophecy is directed, specifically addressing their leaders and people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_is_impartial.htm">God's Justice is Impartial</a></b><br>God Himself will judge between the fat and lean sheep, emphasizing His fairness and impartiality.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_accountability.htm">Leadership Accountability</a></b><br>Those in positions of power are held accountable for their treatment of others, especially the vulnerable.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_care_for_the_oppressed.htm">God's Care for the Oppressed</a></b><br>The lean sheep symbolize those who are oppressed, and God promises to defend and vindicate them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/self-examination.htm">Self-Examination</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to examine their own lives to ensure they are not acting as "fat sheep" in their relationships and responsibilities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_for_restoration.htm">Hope for Restoration</a></b><br>God's judgment is not only punitive but also restorative, aiming to bring justice and healing to His people.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_34_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 34:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_34_20_God_s_sheep_vs_goats.htm">How does Ezekiel 34:20 illustrate God's judgment between the sheep and goats?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_34_20_on_God_s_fair_judgment.htm">What does Ezekiel 34:20 reveal about God's fairness in judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_34_20_s_role_in_church_discernment.htm">How can we apply Ezekiel 34:20 to discernment in church leadership?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/NT_passages_echo_Ezekiel_34_20_themes.htm">Which New Testament passages echo the themes found in Ezekiel 34:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Ezekiel_34_20_on_believers.htm">How should Ezekiel 34:20 influence our treatment of fellow believers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_34_20_God_s_judgment_details.htm">What does Ezekiel 34:20 reveal about God's judgment between the strong and the weak?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_34_20_s_take_on_divine_justice.htm">How does Ezekiel 34:20 challenge our understanding of divine justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Ezekiel_34_20_tackle_inequality.htm">In what ways does Ezekiel 34:20 address the issue of inequality?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ezekiel_34.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ezekiel 34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what's_anointing's_role_in_the_bible.htm">What qualities define a good shepherd in scripture?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what's_the_difference_between_a_diocese_and_an_archdiocese.htm">How do sheep survive among wolves?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_role_of_the_good_shepherd.htm">What is the role of the Good Shepherd?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_can_god_destroy_both_justly.htm">In Ezekiel 21:3-4, how can God threaten to destroy both the righteous and the wicked without contradicting other texts that portray Him as just?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Ezekiel 34:20 Mean</div><b>Therefore This Is What the Lord GOD Says to Them</b><p>&#8220;Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says to them:&#8221;<p>&#8226; God Himself breaks in, not merely a prophet&#8217;s opinion.
