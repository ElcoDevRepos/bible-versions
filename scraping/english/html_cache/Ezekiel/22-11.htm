In the Ten Commandments, <a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a> explicitly states, "You shall not commit adultery." Adultery is considered an abomination because it violates the sanctity of marriage, a covenant relationship established by God. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, marriage was not only a personal commitment but also a social contract that affected the entire community. The act of adultery was seen as a betrayal of trust and a disruption of social order. This sin is also addressed in <a href="/leviticus/18-20.htm">Leviticus 18:20</a>, which warns against lying carnally with a neighbor's wife, emphasizing the severity of such actions.<p><b>another wickedly defiles his daughter-in-law;</b><br>This phrase refers to incestuous relationships, which are strictly prohibited in Levitical law. <a href="/leviticus/18-15.htm">Leviticus 18:15 and 20</a>:12 specifically forbid sexual relations with a daughter-in-law, labeling it as a perversion. Such acts were considered detestable because they violated family boundaries and the natural order established by God. In the historical context, these laws were given to set the Israelites apart from the surrounding nations, which often engaged in such practices. The use of the word "wickedly" underscores the moral depravity and intentional rebellion against God's commandments.<p><b>and yet another violates his sister, his own father&#8217;s daughter.</b><br>This phrase addresses another form of incest, which is explicitly condemned in <a href="/leviticus/18-9.htm">Leviticus 18:9 and 20</a>:17. The act of violating one's sister is seen as a grave sin because it disrupts the familial structure and purity that God intended. In ancient Israel, family was the foundational unit of society, and maintaining its integrity was crucial. The mention of "his own father's daughter" emphasizes the close familial relationship, making the sin even more egregious. This violation is not only a personal sin but also a communal one, as it brings dishonor and impurity to the family and the nation. The broader biblical narrative consistently upholds the sanctity of family relationships, reflecting God's design for human interactions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, who are in exile due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city that is central to the Israelites' identity and worship, facing judgment for its sins.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbor's_wife.htm">Neighbor&#8217;s Wife</a></b><br>Represents the violation of the sanctity of marriage, a covenant relationship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughter-in-law_and_sister.htm">Daughter-in-law and Sister</a></b><br>Illustrate the breakdown of family relationships and moral decay within the community.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_marriage.htm">The Sanctity of Marriage</a></b><br>Marriage is a sacred covenant that should be honored and protected.

God calls it an &#8220;abomination&#8221; because it violates multiple covenants at once.<p>&#8226; It breaks the marriage covenant that God established in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a> and reaffirmed in <a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>.<p>&#8226; It steals what belongs to another (<a href="/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27-35</a>), betraying trust between neighbors and shredding community stability.<p>&#8226; It assaults the picture of Christ&#8217;s faithful love for His people (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-32</a>).<p>The prophet is listing charges against Jerusalem, and this first charge shows how far the nation has drifted from <a href="/leviticus/18-20.htm">Leviticus 18:20</a>, where God had clearly forbidden adultery. When a society normalizes such sin, <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-25</a> warns that greater corruption soon follows.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Another wickedly defiles his daughter-in-law</b><p>The list descends from adultery to incest. <a href="/leviticus/18-15.htm">Leviticus 18:15 and 20</a>:12 expressly forbid sexual relations between a man and his daughter-in-law.<p>&#8226; This act desecrates the family line, blurs roles, and destroys generational trust.<p>&#8226; It mocks God&#8217;s order for marriage and inheritance (<a href="/numbers/27-8.htm">Numbers 27:8-11</a>).<p>Judah&#8217;s lapse with Tamar (<a href="/bsb/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>) shows how such sin brings shame even upon the patriarchs, proving no one is exempt from God&#8217;s standard. First Corinthians 5:1 recalls a similar scandal in Corinth, where Paul insisted on church discipline to protect holiness. Ezekiel&#8217;s wording&#8212;&#8220;wickedly defiles&#8221;&#8212;emphasizes deliberate rebellion, not momentary weakness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Yet another violates his sister, his own father&#8217;s daughter</b><p>The charge becomes even more shocking: sexual sin with a full or half-sister. <a href="/leviticus/18-9.htm">Leviticus 18:9 and 20</a>:17 forbid it; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-22.htm">Deuteronomy 27:22</a> calls it &#8220;cursed.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Incest attacks the most basic family bond, erasing the distinction between nurturing love and sexual desire.<p>&#8226; It produces lifelong trauma, as seen in Amnon&#8217;s assault of Tamar in Second Samuel 13:1-22.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;his own father&#8217;s daughter&#8221; clarifies that this is not a distant relative but a close sibling, underscoring the depth of depravity.<p>By placing this third, Ezekiel shows the progression of sin: when a nation ignores God&#8217;s boundaries, sin grows more twisted, echoing <a href="/romans/1-26.htm">Romans 1:26-32</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/22-11.htm">Ezekiel 22:11</a> stacks three escalating violations&#8212;adultery, father-in-law with daughter-in-law, and brother with sister&#8212;to prove that Jerusalem&#8217;s moral collapse is complete. Each act disregards God&#8217;s clear commands in Leviticus and the Ten Commandments, fracturing both covenant and community. The verse means exactly what it says: God is indicting His people for literal, specific sins that invite His coming judgment (<a href="/ezekiel/22-17.htm">Ezekiel 22:17-22</a>). The passage challenges every generation to honor God&#8217;s design for sexuality, protecting marriage and family as sacred trusts under His righteous rule.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11 ,12.</span> - The list of sins follows on the lines of <a href="/leviticus/18-9.htm">Leviticus 18:9, 15</a>. (For those in Ver. 12, see notes on Ezekiel 18:12.) It is to be remarked, however, that the prophet does not confine himself to the mere enumeration of specific sins.
