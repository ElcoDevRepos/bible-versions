Famine was a common consequence of disobedience in the Old Testament, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>. Wild beasts symbolize chaos and danger, often used as instruments of divine retribution (<a href="/leviticus/26-22.htm">Leviticus 26:22</a>). In the ancient Near East, wild animals were a real threat, especially when human populations decreased due to war or famine, allowing animals to encroach on human settlements.<p><b>and they will leave you childless</b><br>The loss of children was a devastating blow in ancient cultures, where lineage and inheritance were crucial. This phrase underscores the severity of the judgment, as children were seen as a blessing from God (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>). The imagery of being left childless also connects to the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-18.htm">Deuteronomy 28:18</a>, where disobedience leads to the loss of offspring.<p><b>Plague and bloodshed will sweep through you</b><br>Plagues were often seen as direct acts of God, as in the plagues of Egypt (Exodus 7-11). Bloodshed refers to violence and war, common consequences of divine judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>). The combination of plague and bloodshed suggests a comprehensive judgment affecting both health and security, reminiscent of the covenant curses in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>and I will bring a sword against you</b><br>The sword is a frequent biblical metaphor for war and divine judgment (<a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-6</a>). In Ezekiel's context, this likely refers to the Babylonian invasion, a historical event where God used foreign nations to execute His judgment on Israel (2 Kings 25). The sword represents not just physical destruction but also the end of peace and stability.<p><b>I, the LORD, have spoken.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authority and certainty of God's pronouncement. When God speaks, His words are binding and will come to pass (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). It serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the seriousness of His covenant with Israel. The declaration underscores that these events are not random but are orchestrated by God as a response to Israel's disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who was called to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city that is the focal point of God's judgment due to the people's rebellion and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/famine_and_wild_beasts.htm">Famine and Wild Beasts</a></b><br>Instruments of God's judgment, symbolizing the severe consequences of disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/plague_and_bloodshed.htm">Plague and Bloodshed</a></b><br>Further expressions of divine judgment, indicating widespread suffering and death.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God who declares and enacts judgment, emphasizing His authority and justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin has severe consequences, and God's judgment is a response to persistent disobedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The passage underscores God's control over all events, including the instruments of judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_repentance.htm">Call to Repentance</a></b><br>The warnings serve as a call to repentance, urging individuals and nations to turn back to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_god's_justice.htm">Hope in God's Justice</a></b><br>While the passage is about judgment, it also points to the hope that comes from God's just nature, ensuring that evil will not prevail.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_obedience.htm">Living in Obedience</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to live in obedience to God's commands, recognizing the blessings that come from aligning with His will.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_5_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 5:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_5_17_God_s_judgment_impact.htm">How does Ezekiel 5:17 illustrate God's judgment and its consequences for disobedience?

By affirming that He personally &#8220;sends&#8221; the scarcity, the Lord underscores both His sovereignty and His faithfulness to His own word. We&#8217;re reminded that the bread on every table ultimately comes from His hand, and when that hand closes, no amount of human ingenuity can reopen it (see <a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-13.htm">2 Chronicles 7:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Wild Beasts and the Loss of Children</b><p>Next, the Lord adds, &#8220;and wild beasts against you, and they will leave you childless.&#8221; This sobering detail echoes <a href="/leviticus/26-22.htm">Leviticus 26:22</a>, where disobedience invites predatory animals that &#8220;bereave you of your children.&#8221; God&#8217;s covenant people were meant to live securely in the land (<a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26, 28</a>; <a href="/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6-8</a>), exercising dominion over creation. When they reverse that order through sin, creation itself turns hostile. The grief of being &#8220;childless&#8221; cuts to the core of Israel&#8217;s identity, for children represented the continuation of the covenant line (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Plague and Bloodshed Sweeping Through</b><p>&#8220;Plague and bloodshed will sweep through you&#8221; intensifies the judgment. As with the pestilences in <a href="/numbers/16-46.htm">Numbers 16:46-48</a> or <a href="/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15</a>, disease serves as a swift, inescapable tool of divine correction. Paired with &#8220;bloodshed,&#8221; the picture is of internal collapse&#8212;violence erupting within the city (<a href="/ezekiel/7-23.htm">Ezekiel 7:23-25</a>). The phrase &#8220;sweep through&#8221; paints a relentless wave, reminiscent of <a href="/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a> where God refuses to hear prayers while sword, famine, and plague advance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Sword Against the People</b><p>Finally, &#8220;I will bring a sword against you&#8221; points to invading armies (<a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1-11</a>). Throughout the prophets, the &#8220;sword&#8221; symbolizes external aggression allowed by God to chastise His people (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6-8</a>). While famine, beasts, and plague weaken from within, the sword finishes the judgment from without. The sequence shows a layered discipline: natural, biological, social, and military.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The LORD Has Spoken</b><p>The closing declaration, &#8220;I, the LORD, have spoken,&#8221; seals the verdict. Once God&#8217;s word goes forth, it stands immutable (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>; <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). For Ezekiel&#8217;s audience, this final line removes any hope that the message is merely the prophet&#8217;s opinion. It also holds out a paradoxical comfort: the same God whose word pronounces judgment is the One who will later speak restoration (<a href="/ezekiel/36-36.htm">Ezekiel 36:36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/5-17.htm">Ezekiel 5:17</a> stacks four escalating judgments&#8212;famine, wild beasts, plague with bloodshed, and the sword&#8212;to show that covenant infidelity triggers comprehensive consequences. Each calamity fulfills earlier covenant warnings, proving God&#8217;s faithfulness to His word. Yet the final oath, &#8220;I, the LORD, have spoken,&#8221; also reassures us that history remains under His direct control, and the same authoritative voice that disciplines can, in mercy, restore.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Evil beasts</span>, etc. These appear in like connection in Ezekiel's favourite textbooks (comp. <a href="/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6, 22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-24.htm">Deuteronomy 32:24</a>). They reappear in <a href="/ezekiel/14-15.htm">Ezekiel 14:15, 21</a>. Historically, we have an example of the suffering thus caused in the lions of <a href="/2_kings/17-25.htm">2 Kings 17:25</a>, when towns and villages were deserted, and the unburied carcases of those who had died by famine, or pestilence, or the sword, were everywhere to attract them from afar.
