It suggests that God is sovereign over nations and their leaders, directing their paths even when they intend evil. This concept is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, where the king's heart is described as being in the hand of the Lord, who directs it wherever He pleases.<p><b>put hooks in your jaws</b><br>The imagery of hooks in the jaws is reminiscent of how captives or animals are led against their will. This phrase suggests that Gog and his forces are being compelled by God to fulfill His purposes, even if they are unaware of it. This can be compared to how God used Assyria as the rod of His anger in <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-7</a>, where the nation was used to accomplish God's judgment despite its own intentions.<p><b>and bring you out with all your army</b><br>This indicates a large-scale mobilization of military forces. The phrase underscores the comprehensive nature of the threat against Israel, involving a full military campaign. Historically, armies were often seen as instruments of divine will, and here, God is orchestrating the movement of these forces for His ultimate plan.<p><b>your horses, your horsemen in full armor</b><br>Horses and horsemen were symbols of military strength and speed in ancient warfare. The mention of full armor suggests preparedness and the seriousness of the impending conflict. In biblical times, cavalry units were crucial for battle, and their presence here emphasizes the formidable nature of the invading force.<p><b>and a great company armed with shields and bucklers</b><br>The reference to shields and bucklers highlights the defensive capabilities of the army. Shields were essential for protection in battle, and their mention here suggests a well-equipped and organized military force. This imagery is consistent with descriptions of ancient Near Eastern armies, which relied heavily on such equipment for defense.<p><b>all brandishing their swords</b><br>The sword is a symbol of warfare and judgment throughout the Bible. The act of brandishing swords indicates readiness for battle and aggression. This phrase connects to the broader theme of divine judgment, as seen in passages like <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, where Christ is depicted with a sword coming from His mouth to strike down the nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gog.htm">Gog</a></b><br>A leader or figure representing a coalition of nations opposed to Israel.

Historically, Magog is linked to regions north of Israel, possibly representing distant, powerful nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The event described is orchestrated by God, demonstrating His control over nations and history.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_army.htm">The Army</a></b><br>A vast and formidable military force, symbolizing the might of earthly powers that oppose God's people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/divine_intervention.htm">Divine Intervention</a></b><br>The act of God putting "hooks in your jaws" signifies His direct intervention in the affairs of nations, compelling them to fulfill His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is in control of history and the rise and fall of nations.

It is better, however, to take it in the sense in which it is used in <a href="/isaiah/47-10.htm" title="For you have trusted in your wickedness: you have said, None sees me.

It is as evident that a turning back from the Holy Land cannot be intended, as it is that a turning back to the Holy Land is unsuitable, unless, with Hengstenberg and Ewald, one regards Gog as the Chaldeans, or, with Hitzig, and Schroder, as the Scythiaus, though these latter never were in Palestine, having left it unvisited in their campaign in <span class="date">B.C. 626</span>, and had not as yet formed the design of invading Israel. Smend is not wide of the mark in suggesting that the thought expressed in the verb is simply that of the superior might of Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">I will bring thee forth</span>. That the power which stirs up Gog is here represented as that of Jehovah, while in <a href="/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a> it is affirmed to be that of Satan, need occasion no more difficulty than the similar statements, in <a href="/1_samuel/24-1.htm">1 Samuel 24:1</a>, about God and in <a href="/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1</a> about Satan, stirring up David to number Israel. The enumeration of <span class="cmt_word">horses and horsemen</span> in Gog's army points to the Scythians, who, according to Herodotus (4:46, 136), were mostly equestrian tribes, although the Scythian remains discovered at Kerteh do not give an example of a Scythian horse-archer (see Rawlinson's 'Herodotus,' vol. 3. p. 34, note 6). <span class="cmt_word">All of them clothed with all sorts</span> of armor, better, <span class="accented">clothed with perfection</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> splendidly attired, <span class="accented">all of them</span>.

The Assyrian soldiery employed "the short dagger, or dirk, and the sword, which was of two kinds. The ordinary kind was long and straight, the less usual kind being curved, like a scimitar" ('Assyria, its Princes,' etc.).
