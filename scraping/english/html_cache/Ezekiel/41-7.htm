This design allowed for more storage or living space as one ascended. The widening of the rooms can symbolize the increasing glory and majesty of God as one moves closer to the divine presence, a theme consistent with the progressive revelation of God throughout Scripture.<p><b>because the structure surrounding the temple ascended by stages</b><br>The temple's ascending structure signifies a journey or progression towards holiness, reflecting the spiritual ascent believers are called to make. This architectural feature can be seen as a type of the spiritual growth and maturity that comes with a deeper relationship with God. The stages may also represent the different levels of access to God, reminiscent of the tabernacle and temple's design, where only the high priest could enter the Holy of Holies.<p><b>corresponding to the narrowing of the temple wall as it rose upward</b><br>The narrowing of the temple wall as it ascends could symbolize the increasing exclusivity and sanctity of approaching God's presence. This narrowing can be seen as a metaphor for the path to salvation, which is described as narrow in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/7-14.htm">Matthew 7:14</a>). It emphasizes the idea that as one draws closer to God, the path becomes more defined and requires greater commitment and holiness.<p><b>And so a stairway went up from the lowest story to the highest, through the middle one</b><br>The stairway represents a means of access and transition between different levels of the temple, symbolizing the spiritual journey from earthly to heavenly realms. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the way to the Father (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), providing believers with access to God. The mention of the middle story may indicate the centrality of Christ in the believer's journey, as He mediates between God and humanity. The stairway also echoes Jacob's ladder (<a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>), a connection between heaven and earth, further emphasizing the role of Christ as the bridge to divine presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the detailed vision of the temple in chapters 40-48.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.

The main facts are clear: that there was an increase in the width of each storey of the side chambers by the distance which the wall receded, as is expressly said in <a href="/1_kings/6-6.htm" title="The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.">1Kings 6:6</a>; but whether there was a corresponding recession in the thickness of the outer wall of the chambers is not stated. It is also plain that the side chambers surrounded the house; and that the two upper storeys were reached by a winding staircase (w [<a href="/context/ezekiel/40-44.htm" title="And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.">Ezekiel 40:44-49</a>]). It is impossible to enter into more detail without a careful discussion of the words in the original, the meaning of some of which is disputed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - In the side chambers <span class="cmt_word">an enlarging</span> took place as they went up, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the floorage of the second story exceeded that of the first, and the floorage of the third that of the second; though how this was effected can only be conjectured. If the chambers were built against the temple wall, then probably the wall at each story went in, say a cubit or a cubit and a half from the outside, so as to admit the beams; or, if the chambers were built against an outside wall, a similar recession of the wall from the inside may have taken place. In either ease, <span class="cmt_word">the</span> (interior) <span class="cmt_word">breadth of the house</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the side chambers, would be <span class="cmt_word">upward</span>, and would increase from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst. Plumptre, after Kliefoth, suggests that the increasing size of the chambers in the three stories may have been due to projecting galleries. Ewald, taking "house" as "the temple," supposes that it gradually became bigger. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> broader, as it rose, which could be the case only if the side chambers were built against the temple wall, and the increased width of the stories was scoured By projecting galleries or corridors. Greater obscurity attaches to the second clause, <span class="cmt_word">and a winding about still upward to the side chambers</span>, which the Authorized Version and some expositors regard as an indication that Ezekiel's temple had a spiral staircase like that in Solomon's temple (see <a href="/1_kings/6-8.htm">1 Kings 6:8</a>); and probably some such mode of passing from story to story did exist in Ezekiel's temple; yet the clause, when properly rendered, does not refer to this. The Revised Version reads, "And the side chambers were broader as they encompassed <span class="accented">the house</span> higher and higher; for the encompassing of the house went higher and higher round about the house; therefore the breadth of the house <span class="accented">continued</span> upward; and so one went up (most likely by a spiral stair) from the lowest chamber to the highest by the middle chamber." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/41-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The side rooms</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1506;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#601;&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124;
