The "wilderness" symbolizes a place of testing and purification. Historically, the wilderness was a place where God dealt with His people directly, providing for them and teaching them reliance on Him. The "wilderness of the nations" suggests a dispersion among foreign lands, indicating a period of exile or separation from the Promised Land. This reflects the Babylonian exile, where the Israelites were scattered among the nations. Theologically, it can also represent the trials and tribulations faced by believers in a world that is not their ultimate home.<p><b>where I will enter into judgment with you</b><br>This phrase indicates a divine confrontation and assessment of the people's faithfulness. In biblical context, judgment often involves both punishment for disobedience and the opportunity for repentance and restoration. The judgment here is reminiscent of the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where blessings and curses were contingent upon obedience to God's laws. This judgment is not merely punitive but serves as a means to bring the people back to righteousness. It echoes the prophetic theme found in other scriptures, such as Jeremiah and Isaiah, where God calls His people to account for their actions.<p><b>face to face</b><br>The phrase "face to face" signifies a direct and personal encounter with God. In the Old Testament, such encounters were rare and significant, as seen with Moses on Mount Sinai. This direct interaction underscores the seriousness of the judgment and the personal nature of the covenant relationship. It implies an intimate and unavoidable confrontation, where excuses and intermediaries are absent. Theologically, it points to the ultimate accountability each person has before God. In a broader sense, it foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, who provides a way for believers to have a personal relationship with God, culminating in the promise of seeing Him "face to face" in eternity (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

Does Ezekiel 20:35 Mean</div><b>And I will bring you into the wilderness of the nations</b><p>&#8226; The phrase points to a literal regathering and relocation of Israel outside her land, echoing how the Lord &#8220;scattered them among the nations&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/20-23.htm">Ezekiel 20:23</a>) and will, in the future, gather them again for refining.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Wilderness&#8221; recalls the Exodus, when God led Israel through the desert to form them as His covenant people (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>). In like manner, the nations become a modern-day desert&#8212;isolated, uncomfortable, yet purpose-built for spiritual purging.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hosea/2-14.htm">Hosea 2:14</a> shows the Lord alluring Israel into the wilderness to speak tenderly; <a href="/revelation/12-6.htm">Revelation 12:6</a> pictures a woman (Israel) sheltered in the wilderness; both underscore God&#8217;s faithful preservation during times of trial.<p>&#8226; The setting is not punishment for punishment&#8217;s sake; it is a staging ground for renewal, just as He preserved the remnant in the exile (<a href="/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>).<p>&#8226; By emphasizing &#8220;I will bring you,&#8221; the verse affirms God&#8217;s sovereign initiative. Israel is not lost at random; she is shepherded by the same hand that pledged, &#8220;I will restore you&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>where I will enter into judgment with you face to face</b><p>&#8226; Judgment here is personal and direct, mirroring the way the Lord &#8220;contended with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/20-36.htm">Ezekiel 20:36</a>). This is covenant evaluation, not annihilation.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Face to face&#8221; affirms relational accountability. As <a href="/amos/4-12.htm">Amos 4:12</a> says, &#8220;Prepare to meet your God,&#8221; highlighting the inescapability of divine encounter.<p>&#8226; <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2&#8211;3</a> depicts the Lord as a refiner of silver, sitting close to the fire until He sees His reflection; likewise He will sift Israel until the dross is removed.<p>&#8226; The same pattern extends to all humanity: &#8220;We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>). Yet for Israel, it culminates in national repentance and renewal foretold in <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a> and <a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a>.<p>&#8226; This face-to-face judgment vindicates God&#8217;s holiness and secures the remnant&#8217;s wholehearted obedience promised in <a href="/ezekiel/36-27.htm">Ezekiel 36:27</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/20-35.htm">Ezekiel 20:35</a> pictures God personally escorting Israel into a literal, refining wilderness among the nations, just as He once did in the Exodus. There He will deal with His people directly, purging rebellion and preserving a faithful remnant. The verse assures that the covenant-keeping Lord remains sovereign, purposeful, and relational, guiding His people through discipline toward ultimate restoration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">Into the wilderness of the people.</span>--As in the past there was a period of probation and discipline in the wilderness, so shall there be in the future. The similarity is insisted upon in <a href="/ezekiel/20-36.htm" title="Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 20:36</a>, and the phrase "face to face" is taken from <a href="/deuteronomy/5-4.htm" title="The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the middle of the fire,">Deuteronomy 5:4</a>, not to show that the Lord will interpose again with the same sensible manifestations, but will plead with them in ways equally adapted, in their more advanced condition, to show them His overruling hand. As this phrase is plainly to be understood according to its sense, and not according to the letter, so it is quite idle to attempt to locate <span class= "ital">"</span>the wilderness of the people" as any material wilderness, as that of Arabia, or that between Babylonia and Palestine. The phrase must mean that wilderness condition of the people, scattered among the nations, in which the Lord will plead with them as He did with their fathers. This might refer, as some commentators think, to the state of the Jews in our own time, dispersed among all nations; but there is nothing in the connection to indicate so distant a future, and it may quite as well refer to the then approaching condition of the people. Already many thousands of them had been carried captive to Babylon; others (see <a href="/jeremiah/10-12.htm" title="He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by his discretion.">Jeremiah 10:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/43-5.htm" title="But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, where they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;">Jeremiah 43:5</a>) had been scattered among all the surrounding nations; the mass of the ten tribes had long before been carried by the king of Assyria to other regions; and the large remnant still left in Judaea, influenced by their own fears, soon afterwards went down to Egypt. In Ezekiel's own life-time, Israel was scattered widely among all the prominent nations of the earth, and thus brought into the "wilderness of the people."<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/20-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And I will bring</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1461;&#1489;&#1461;&#1488;&#1514;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#234;&#183;&#7687;&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
