The imagery of horses trampling the streets signifies the thorough and overwhelming nature of the conquest. Historically, Tyre was a powerful and wealthy city-state known for its strong fortifications and strategic location on the Mediterranean coast. The prophecy highlights the inevitability of judgment against Tyre due to its pride and opposition to God&#8217;s people. The trampling of streets symbolizes the complete subjugation and humiliation of the city, as horses were often associated with military power and conquest in ancient times.<p><b>He will slaughter your people with the sword,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the violence and loss of life that would accompany the Babylonian siege. The sword is a common biblical symbol for warfare and divine judgment. In the context of Ezekiel, this prophecy serves as a warning to Tyre and a demonstration of God&#8217;s sovereignty over nations. The historical context reveals that Nebuchadnezzar's campaign against Tyre lasted for many years, reflecting the intensity and persistence of the conflict. The slaughter of the people underscores the seriousness of the consequences of defying God&#8217;s will and the fulfillment of prophetic declarations.<p><b>and your mighty pillars will fall to the ground.</b><br>The "mighty pillars" likely refer to the physical and symbolic structures that represented Tyre's strength and stability. In ancient architecture, pillars were not only structural supports but also symbols of power and permanence. The fall of these pillars signifies the collapse of Tyre&#8217;s defenses and the end of its dominance. This imagery can also be seen as a metaphor for the downfall of human pride and reliance on worldly power. Theologically, it points to the ultimate futility of opposing God&#8217;s purposes. The destruction of Tyre serves as a type of the final judgment, where all human arrogance will be brought low before the sovereignty of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered during the Babylonian exile.

God tells Ezekiel that the invader&#8217;s horses will &#8220;trample all your streets&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/26-11.htm">Ezekiel 26:11</a>). This is no vague metaphor; it announces a literal occupation, overwhelming every alley without exception. We&#8217;ve seen similar language in <a href="/jeremiah/47-3.htm">Jeremiah 47:3</a> where &#8220;the sound of the hoofbeats of his stallions&#8221; makes the Philistines tremble, and in <a href="/nahum/3-2.htm">Nahum 3:2</a> describing Nineveh&#8217;s downfall. Such passages remind us that when the Lord rises in judgment, no fortress city&#8212;or modern equivalent of wealth and security&#8212;stands firm (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>; <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s justice reaches every corner.<p>&#8226; Confidence placed in trade routes, walls, or bustling streets cannot shield a society from divine reckoning.<p>&#8226; His promises&#8212;whether blessing or judgment&#8212;always come to pass exactly as spoken.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will slaughter your people with the sword</b><p>The prophecy presses closer: &#8220;He will slaughter your people with the sword&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/26-11.htm">Ezekiel 26:11</a>). Scripture often portrays the sword as God&#8217;s appointed tool of discipline (<a href="/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-31.htm">Jeremiah 25:31</a>). In Tyre&#8217;s case, the sword belongs to Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s troops, but the authority behind it is the Lord Himself. This sober word highlights two realities:<p>&#8226; Sin has consequences. Tyre&#8217;s arrogance and exploitation (<a href="/ezekiel/28-5.htm">Ezekiel 28:5</a>) drew divine judgment.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s patience, though vast, is not limitless (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9&#8211;10</a>). Just as He preserved Noah through judgment (<a href="/bsb/genesis/7.htm">Genesis 7</a>) and Lot from Sodom (<a href="/bsb/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>), He will ultimately separate righteousness from rebellion.<p>Applying this truth today means turning from pride, humbly accepting the salvation Christ provides (<a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>). The only safe ground is under His covenant grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your mighty pillars will fall to the ground</b><p>Tyre boasted monumental columns&#8212;symbols of commerce, worship, and national pride. Yet the Lord declares, &#8220;your mighty pillars will fall to the ground&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/26-11.htm">Ezekiel 26:11</a>). <a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12&#8211;18</a> paints the same picture: every lofty structure crashes when God alone is exalted. Even the bronze pillars crafted by Tyrian artisans for Solomon&#8217;s temple (<a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15&#8211;22</a>) remind us that human craftsmanship, however splendid, relies on the Lord for permanence. When He removes His sustaining hand, the strongest architecture turns to rubble (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16&#8211;17</a>).<p>Lessons for our generation:<p>&#8226; Material grandeur is fragile.<p>&#8226; Idolatry&#8212;whether of wealth, influence, or cultural achievements&#8212;cannot survive divine scrutiny (<a href="/1_john/2-17.htm">1 John 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Lasting stability rests in the unshakable kingdom Christ will reveal at His return (<a href="/hebrews/12-25.htm">Hebrews 12:25&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/26-11.htm">Ezekiel 26:11</a> gives a threefold picture of Tyre&#8217;s fall: trampling horses, slashing swords, and toppled pillars.

For every age, the passage calls us to forsake pride, place our trust in the Lord alone, and live in the assurance that His word&#8212;every syllable&#8212;stands firm forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Thy strong garrisons.--</span>This is the only instance in the Bible in which this common word is so translated, although a word closely akin to it is rendered <span class= "ital">garrison </span>throughout the Books of Samuel.
