Groaning is a prophetic act symbolizing the impending judgment on Jerusalem. The people&#8217;s inquiry reflects their ignorance or denial of the severity of their situation. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where prophets are asked to perform symbolic acts to convey God's message, such as Hosea's marriage to an unfaithful woman (<a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>).<p><b>you are to say, &#8216;Because of the news that is coming.</b><br>The "news" refers to the impending destruction of Jerusalem and the Babylonian exile. This prophecy is consistent with the warnings given by other prophets like Jeremiah, who also foretold the fall of Jerusalem due to the people's persistent sin (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>). The certainty of this news underscores the inevitability of God's judgment when His people refuse to repent.<p><b>Every heart will melt, and every hand will go limp.</b><br>This phrase indicates a complete loss of courage and strength among the people. The imagery of melting hearts and limp hands is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe overwhelming fear and despair, such as in <a href="/joshua/2-11.htm">Joshua 2:11</a>, where the inhabitants of Jericho are terrified of the Israelites. It signifies the total helplessness and panic that will grip the people when the judgment arrives.<p><b>Every spirit will faint, and every knee will turn to water.</b><br>The fainting of spirits and knees turning to water further emphasize the terror and weakness that will overcome the people. This vivid imagery is a common biblical expression of extreme fear and helplessness, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/13-7.htm">Isaiah 13:7</a>. It highlights the psychological and physical impact of the coming calamity, leaving the people utterly defenseless.<p><b>Yes, it is coming and it will surely happen,</b><br>The repetition of the certainty of the event underscores the reliability of God's word. This assurance of fulfillment is a common prophetic theme, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's word is described as never returning void. It serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the certainty of His plans.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD.&#8221;</b><br>The declaration by the Lord GOD affirms the divine authority behind the prophecy. The use of "Lord GOD" (Adonai Yahweh) emphasizes both God's sovereign rule and His covenant relationship with Israel. This phrase assures the audience that the message is not from Ezekiel himself but from God, reinforcing the seriousness and inevitability of the prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

Like Jeremiah&#8217;s &#8220;disaster from the north&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>; 4:6), this announcement proves God keeps His covenant warnings (<a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8226; Their city, their temple, and their king will soon be overrun (<a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; God is not merely predicting calamity; He is personally sending it (<a href="/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3</a>, &#8220;I draw My sword&#8221;).<p>The groan is therefore not self-pity but prophetic compassion, echoing Jesus&#8217; later tears over Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41-44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Every heart will melt,</b><p>Internal courage disappears when God&#8217;s hand is against a people. <a href="/judges/7-21.htm">Judges 7:21</a> and <a href="/joshua/2-11.htm">Joshua 2:11</a> use the same image for enemies who realize the LORD fights for Israel; now Israel herself feels it. Spiritual rebellion drains moral fortitude. <a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a> describes the wicked fleeing though no one pursues&#8212;an exact opposite of the righteous boldness they might have known.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and every hand will go limp.</b><p>Paralysis replaces action. <a href="/isaiah/13-7.htm">Isaiah 13:7</a> applies the phrase to Babylon under divine wrath; here it strikes God&#8217;s own covenant nation, underscoring impartial justice (<a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>). Hands once lifted in worship (<a href="/psalms/63-4.htm">Psalm 63:4</a>) or battle (<a href="/exodus/17-11.htm">Exodus 17:11-12</a>) now hang useless, showing judgment touches both religious and civic life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Every spirit will faint,</b><p>The human will collapses. <a href="/ezekiel/22-14.htm">Ezekiel 22:14</a> asks, &#8220;Can your courage endure&#8230;?&#8221;&#8212;the implied answer is no. Sin saps vitality; obedience strengthens it (<a href="/nehemiah/6-9.htm">Nehemiah 6:9</a>). This fainting anticipates the exile&#8217;s crushing psychological toll (<a href="/lamentations/1-13.htm">Lamentations 1:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and every knee will turn to water.&#8217;</b><p>The vivid picture of knees &#8220;flowing with water&#8221; portrays total physical weakness. <a href="/daniel/5-6.htm">Daniel 5:6</a> records Belshazzar&#8217;s knees knocking at God&#8217;s writing on the wall; the same divine dread now visits Judah. <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a> reminds us every knee will ultimately bow&#8212;better voluntarily in worship than involuntarily in terror.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Yes, it is coming and it will surely happen,</b><p>Divine certainty rings through the repetition. What God decrees cannot be delayed or canceled by wishful thinking (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). Just as the flood came after Noah&#8217;s preaching (<a href="/matthew/24-38.htm">Matthew 24:38-39</a>), Babylon will arrive despite Judah&#8217;s denial (<a href="/ezekiel/12-22.htm">Ezekiel 12:22-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>declares the Lord GOD.</b><p>The covenant Name seals the verdict. &#8220;Lord GOD&#8221; (Adonai YHWH) combines sovereign authority with covenant faithfulness. <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a> affirms that the Lord GOD reveals His plans through prophets; here the revelation serves both as warning and vindication of His righteousness (<a href="/psalms/19-9.htm">Psalm 19:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/21-7.htm">Ezekiel 21:7</a> records God telling His prophet to dramatize the coming Babylonian judgment through groans that mirror the nation&#8217;s future agony. The verse marches from the people&#8217;s puzzled question to God&#8217;s unflinching answer: catastrophic news will drain courage, strength, and spirit, fulfilling covenant warnings with absolute certainty. The passage reminds us that when God speaks, His word is sure, His justice impartial, and His calls to repentance urgent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/21-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And when</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they ask,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;Why</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_859.htm">Strong's 859: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thou and thee, ye and you</span><br /><br /><span class="word">groaning?&#8217;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1462;&#1488;&#1457;&#1504;&#1464;&#1425;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(ne&#183;&#8217;&#277;&#183;n&#257;&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_584.htm">Strong's 584: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sigh, groan</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you are to say,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1441;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
