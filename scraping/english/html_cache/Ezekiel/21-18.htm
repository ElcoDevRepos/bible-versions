It emphasizes the divine origin of the message, underscoring the authority and authenticity of the prophecy.<br><br>*Historical and Cultural Context:* Ezekiel was a prophet during the Babylonian exile, a time when the Israelites were in captivity. This context is crucial as it reflects the dire circumstances and the need for divine guidance and intervention.<br><br>*Connections to Other Scripture:* Similar phrases are found throughout the Old Testament, such as in Jeremiah and Isaiah, highlighting the consistent manner in which God communicated with His prophets. This establishes a pattern of divine revelation that is central to the prophetic tradition.<br><br>*Prophecy:* The phrase introduces a prophetic message, often containing warnings, judgments, or promises. In <a href="/ezekiel/21.htm">Ezekiel 21</a>, the prophecy pertains to the impending judgment on Jerusalem and the nations, reflecting God's sovereignty and justice.<br><br>*Types of Jesus Christ:* While this specific phrase does not directly typify Christ, the role of the prophet as a mediator of God's word can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ, who is the ultimate revelation of God to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, called to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
