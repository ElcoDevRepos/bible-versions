This glory is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, particularly in the context of the tabernacle and the temple, where God's presence was manifest. In Ezekiel's vision, this glory is a visible representation of God's presence, emphasizing His sovereignty and holiness. The glory of God is also a reminder of His covenant with Israel, highlighting His faithfulness despite the people's unfaithfulness. This phrase connects to other instances of God's glory appearing, such as in <a href="/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16-17</a> and <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>, where the glory filled the tabernacle and the temple, respectively.<p><b>like the vision I had seen in the plain</b><br>This phrase refers back to an earlier vision Ezekiel experienced, specifically in <a href="/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1-28</a>, where he saw the glory of God by the Kebar River. The vision in the plain serves as a foundational experience for Ezekiel, establishing his prophetic authority and the divine origin of his messages. The repetition of the vision underscores the consistency and reliability of God's revelation to Ezekiel. It also highlights the continuity of God's presence with His people, even in exile. The vision in the plain included the famous imagery of the four living creatures and the wheels, symbolizing God's omnipresence and omniscience. This connection reinforces the idea that God's glory is not confined to a single location but is present wherever He chooses to reveal Himself.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of divine visions and messages, tasked with conveying God's words to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_glory_of_the_god_of_israel.htm">The Glory of the God of Israel</a></b><br>This refers to the visible manifestation of God's presence, often associated with divine holiness and majesty.

That identical splendor appearing in the defiled temple courtyard stresses the tragedy that idolatry has invaded a place meant for pure worship (compare <a href="/ezekiel/9-3.htm">Ezekiel 9:3</a>; 10:18).<p>- <a href="/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a> shows this glory ultimately illuminating the New Jerusalem&#8212;reminding us it remains the believer&#8217;s future hope.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>like the vision I had seen in the plain</b><p>- The &#8220;plain&#8221; recalls <a href="/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22-23</a>, where he fell on his face before the same glory. God replays the vision to affirm continuity: His message has not changed, and neither has His holiness.<p>- This repetition underscores that Ezekiel&#8217;s prophetic ministry is anchored in verifiable encounters, echoing Paul&#8217;s later affirmation, &#8220;I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision&#8221; (<a href="/acts/26-19.htm">Acts 26:19</a>).<p>- By linking past and present, the verse assures readers that God&#8217;s revelations are consistent, trustworthy, and purposeful&#8212;never random flashes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/8-4.htm">Ezekiel 8:4</a> records the prophet&#8217;s renewed sight of God&#8217;s majestic presence standing in the very spot where Judah&#8217;s leaders had polluted worship. The verse ties together place (&#8220;there&#8221;), Person (&#8220;the God of Israel&#8221;), and precedent (&#8220;like the vision&#8230;in the plain&#8221;) to show that the holy, covenant-keeping God sees idolatry up close, reveals Himself with unchanging glory, and calls His people to account.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">The glory of the God of Israel was there.--</span>Not the glory of the Lord filling the temple as in the days of old, but the glory "according to the vision that I saw in the plain"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the same vision which had before appeared to the prophet now in his vision--a vision within a vision--appeared to him again in the temple. The identity of the vision is again particularly mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/10-15.htm" title="And the cherubim were lifted up.

"The God of Israel" is emphatic, the God who had loved and chosen Israel, and Whom Israel should have served, in contrast with the idol which they had placed in His temple. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold,</span> etc. In appalling contrast with that "image of jealousy," Ezekiel saw what he had not seen, as he first became conscious that he was in the court of the temple - the vision of the Divine glory, such as he had seen it on the banks of Chebar (<a href="/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4-28</a>).
