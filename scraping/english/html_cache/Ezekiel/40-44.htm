The "inner gate" suggests a structure within the temple complex, indicating a separation between different areas of holiness. In the context of the temple, gates often symbolize access to God's presence, and being "outside" the inner gate may imply a preparatory or intermediary space.<p><b>within the inner court</b><br>The "inner court" is a significant area in the temple, representing a closer proximity to the Holy of Holies. This court was accessible to priests and those performing temple duties. The inner court's location highlights the sacredness of the activities conducted there, emphasizing the importance of purity and holiness in worship.<p><b>were two chambers</b><br>The mention of "two chambers" suggests designated spaces for specific functions or groups, possibly for the priests or Levites. Chambers in the temple often served practical purposes, such as storage or preparation areas for sacrifices. The duality of the chambers may symbolize order and organization in temple worship.<p><b>one beside the north gate and facing south</b><br>The positioning of the chamber "beside the north gate and facing south" indicates a deliberate architectural design. The north gate's association with judgment in biblical symbolism could imply that this chamber had a role related to justice or discernment. The southward orientation might suggest openness to the light, symbolizing enlightenment or divine guidance.<p><b>and another beside the south gate and facing north</b><br>Similarly, the chamber "beside the south gate and facing north" reflects intentional placement. The south gate often symbolizes blessing and favor, suggesting that this chamber might be associated with grace or mercy. The northward orientation could represent a readiness to receive divine instruction or correction. The symmetry of the chambers underscores balance and harmony in the temple's design.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the detailed vision of a new temple in chapters 40-48.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/inner_court.htm">Inner Court</a></b><br>Part of the temple complex described in Ezekiel's vision, representing a place of worship and sacrifice, symbolizing closeness to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/north_gate.htm">North Gate</a></b><br>One of the gates of the temple's inner court, facing south, indicating a specific orientation and purpose in the temple's design.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/south_gate.htm">South Gate</a></b><br>Another gate of the temple's inner court, facing north, mirroring the north gate and contributing to the symmetry and order of the temple.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/chambers.htm">Chambers</a></b><br>Rooms or spaces within the temple complex, possibly used for priestly functions or storage, indicating the practical and sacred functions of the temple.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_order_and_design_in_worship.htm">The Importance of Order and Design in Worship</a></b><br>God's detailed instructions for the temple's design reflect His desire for order and intentionality in worship.

But the text as it stands is supported by the ancient versions, Greek, Chaldee, and Syriac, as well as by the Masoretic punctuation. There seem to have been three or more chambers altogether, two at least at the side of the north gate opening to the south,<span class= "ital"> i.e.</span>, towards the altar, and one at the east gate opening toward the north. The purpose of the chamber at the east gate is perfectly clear; it was "for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar,"<span class= "ital"> i.e.</span>, for those priests who were on duty at the time in connection with the sacrifices. It is not mentioned on which side of the gate it was placed, nor how large it was, but it is drawn on the plan on the north (Plan II., O). The chambers at the north gate (N), however, are called (<a href="/ezekiel/40-44.htm" title="And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.">Ezekiel 40:44</a>) "chambers of the singers," and yet in <a href="/ezekiel/40-45.htm" title="And he said to me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.">Ezekiel 40:45</a> one of them is said to be for the priests "in charge of the house." The difficulty arises simply from the very common use of the plural in connection with only one of several persons or things, the other being separately specified. To make it entirely clear, we should say, "the chambers, one for the singers, and one for the priests." The <span class= "ital">singers</span> were particular families of the Levites (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/6-31.htm" title="And these are they whom David set over the service of song in the house of the LORD, after that the ark had rest.">1Chronicles 6:31-37</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/9-33.htm" title="And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, who remaining in the chambers were free: for they were employed in that work day and night.">1Chronicles 9:33</a>; 1 Chronicles 25; <a href="/2_chronicles/5-12.htm" title="Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brothers, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)">2Chronicles 5:12</a>), and were not of the priestly order. The general arrangement appears to have been as follows: the offerer brings his victim into the outer court (C) near to the north gate leading into the inner court; there the Levites slay it (at x) and prepare it for the altar upon the tables provided, and then hang its flesh upon the hooks within the porch of the gate; the priests "in charge of the house" in the chamber near the inner end of the gate (N) now notify the singers in the other chamber and also the priests on duty at the altar in the chamber at the east gate (O), that both may enter upon their functions. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 44-46.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">chambers of the ringers</span> According to ver. 44, these, of which the number is not recorded, were situated in the inner court, outside of the inner gate, at the side of the north gate, and looked towards the south, one only being located at the side of the east gate with a prospect towards the north. Interpreted in this way, they cannot have been the same as the "priests' chambers" mentioned in vers. 45, 46, though these also looked in the same direction. The language, however, seems to indicate that they were the same, and on this hypothesis it is difficult to understand how they should be called "the chambers of the singers," and at the same time be assigned to the priests, "the keepers of the charge of the house" and "the keepers of the charge of the altar." Hengstenberg. Kliefoth, Schroder, and others hold that Ezekiel purposed to suggest that in the vision-temple before him the choral service was no longer to be left exclusively in the hands of the Levites as it had been in the Solomonic temple (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33-47</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/15-17.htm">1 Chronicles 15:17</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-19.htm">2 Chronicles 20:19</a>), but that the priests were to participate therein. Dr. Currey imagines the chambers may have been occupied in common by the singers and the priests when engaged on duty at the temple. The LXX. text reads, "And he led me unto the inner court, and behold two chambers in the inner court, one at the back of the gate which looks towards the north, and bearing towards the south, and one at the back of the gate which looks towards the south, and bearing towards the north;" and in accordance with this Rosenm&uuml;ller, Hitzig, Ewald, Keil, and Smend propose sundry emendations on the Hebrew text. Since, however, it cannot be certified that the LXX. did not paraphrase or mistranslate the present rather than follow a different text, it is safer to abide by the renderings of the Authorized and Revised Versions. Yet one cannot help feeling that the LXX. translation has the merit of clearness and simplicity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/40-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Outside</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;mi&#183;&#7717;&#363;&#183;&#7779;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-m &#124;
