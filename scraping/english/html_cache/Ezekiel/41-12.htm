The temple's orientation and layout are significant, reflecting the detailed plans given by God. The westward position of this building may symbolize the direction of the setting sun, often associated with the end of a day or era, possibly indicating a place of completion or finality. In biblical symbolism, the west can also represent the direction of exile, as Israel was taken to Babylon in the east and would return from the west. This building's placement in the vision underscores the comprehensive nature of God's restoration plan for His people.<p><b>was seventy cubits wide</b><br>The measurement of seventy cubits is notable, as numbers in the Bible often carry symbolic meaning. The number seventy can represent completeness or perfection, as seen in the seventy elders of Israel (<a href="/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24:1</a>) and the seventy years of Babylonian captivity (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>). This width suggests a structure of significant size and importance, possibly indicating a place of gathering or administration within the temple complex.<p><b>and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around</b><br>The thickness of the wall at five cubits indicates a strong and fortified structure. In biblical numerology, the number five can symbolize grace or God's goodness. The substantial thickness of the wall may imply protection and security, reflecting God's provision and safeguarding of His holy place. This detail emphasizes the temple's role as a sanctuary, a place set apart for divine presence and worship.<p><b>with a length of ninety cubits</b><br>The length of ninety cubits further highlights the building's grandeur and significance. The number nine, often associated with finality or judgment, multiplied by ten (a number of completeness) could suggest a complete and final establishment of God's purposes. This measurement, combined with the width and wall thickness, portrays a structure of considerable magnitude, integral to the temple's function and symbolism.

Nothing is here said of the purposes of this other building; but it is probably "the appointed place" (<a href="/ezekiel/43-21.htm" title="You shall take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.">Ezekiel 43:21</a>) for the burning of the sin-offering, and also of any remains of other sacrifices which required to be consumed by fire, and of any other refuse from the Temple. Its total width of 80 cubits (70 cubits + 2 walls of 5 cubits each) leaves a passage-way of 10 cubits on each side; while its length (90 cubits + two walls of 5 cubits each--100 cubits) Just fills the space from "the separate place" to the wall of the court.

Behind Solomon's temple lay a similar space (<a href="/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/26-18.htm">1 Chronicles 26:18</a>), with buildings upon it and a separate way out; and as the name gizrah appears to convey the <span class="accented">notion</span> of something that required to be kept apart and removed from the sacred precincts, the opinion of Kliefoth is probably correct that "this space with its buildings was to be used for the reception of all refuse, sweepings, all kinds of rubbish - in brief, of everything that was separated or rejected when the holy service was performed in the temple, and that this was the reason why it received the name of 'the separate place.'
