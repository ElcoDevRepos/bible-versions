In the context of ancient Israel, there was a common belief that children could suffer for the sins of their parents, as seen in <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>. However, Ezekiel emphasizes personal accountability, countering this notion. The father in this scenario is depicted as righteous, having not committed the sins listed in the surrounding verses, which include idolatry and adultery. This distinction underscores the fairness of God's judgment, as each person is judged according to their own actions, not those of their ancestors.<p><b>Indeed, the son eats at the mountain</b><br>"Eats at the mountain" refers to participating in idolatrous practices, which often took place on high places or mountains. These locations were commonly used for pagan worship and sacrifices, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>. The act of eating in this context likely involves consuming food offered to idols, a practice condemned in the Law (<a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15</a>). This behavior signifies a direct rebellion against God, contrasting with the father's righteousness. The imagery of mountains as places of false worship is recurrent in the Old Testament, symbolizing the spiritual adultery of Israel.<p><b>and defiles his neighbor&#8217;s wife.</b><br>This phrase addresses the sin of adultery, explicitly prohibited in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>). Adultery was not only a personal sin but also a social one, undermining the fabric of community and family life. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, such an act was seen as a grave offense, warranting severe punishment (<a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>). The mention of the neighbor's wife emphasizes the breach of trust and covenant, both with God and within the community. This sin is used to illustrate the son's moral failure, contrasting with the father's adherence to God's laws. The theme of adultery also serves as a metaphor for Israel's unfaithfulness to God, a recurring motif in prophetic literature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.

God insists that &#8220;the soul who sins is the one who will die&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/18-4.htm">Ezekiel 18:4</a>). Each person stands or falls before the Lord on his own actions, not on inherited guilt (see <a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/25-4.htm">2 Chronicles 25:4</a>). Against that backdrop, verse 11 introduces a son whose lifestyle contrasts sharply with his righteous father.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Though the father has done none of them"</b><p>&#8226; The phrase highlights the father&#8217;s innocence. He has avoided the sins listed earlier in vv. 6&#8211;9: idolatry, adultery, oppression, robbery, and neglect of the poor.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently blesses such obedience (<a href="/psalms/112-1.htm">Psalm 112:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-7.htm">Proverbs 20:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet personal righteousness is not transferable.
