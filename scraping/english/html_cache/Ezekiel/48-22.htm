The Levites, who were set apart for religious duties, did not receive a tribal inheritance like the other tribes but were given specific cities and surrounding pasturelands (<a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>). The city property likely refers to the area designated for the city of Jerusalem, which holds significant religious and cultural importance as the center of worship and governance.<p><b>will lie in the center of the area belonging to the prince</b><br>The "prince" in Ezekiel's vision is a leader who has a special role in the restored Israel. This figure is distinct from the king and is often seen as a type of Christ, representing righteous leadership and governance. The central location of the Levitical and city properties signifies their importance and the centrality of worship and administration in the life of the nation. This central positioning also reflects the idea that spiritual and civic life should be at the heart of the community.<p><b>the area between the borders of Judah and Benjamin</b><br>Judah and Benjamin were two of the southern tribes of Israel, with Jerusalem historically located within their territories. This geographical reference underscores the historical and prophetic significance of the land. The placement between these two tribes highlights the unity and continuity of the nation, as well as the fulfillment of God's promises to restore and reunite His people. The mention of these specific tribes may also evoke the memory of the united monarchy under David and Solomon, pointing to a future hope of unity and peace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties and temple service.
