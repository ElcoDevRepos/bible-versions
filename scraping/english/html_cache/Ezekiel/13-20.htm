It is a common prophetic formula used to assert that the message is directly from God, not the prophet's own words. This underscores the seriousness and authenticity of the message, aligning with similar declarations found throughout the prophetic books, such as in Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>See, I am against the magic charms</b><br>Magic charms refer to objects or practices used for divination or manipulation, which were common in ancient Near Eastern cultures. These practices were condemned in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>) as they represented a reliance on powers other than God. The use of such charms indicates a departure from faith in God, reflecting a broader theme of idolatry and spiritual adultery prevalent in Ezekiel's time.<p><b>with which you ensnare souls like birds,</b><br>The imagery of ensnaring souls like birds suggests deception and entrapment. In the ancient world, birds were often caught using nets or traps, symbolizing how false prophets and practitioners of magic ensnare people with lies and false promises. This metaphor highlights the vulnerability of the people and the cunning of those who lead them astray, reminiscent of other biblical warnings against false prophets (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>).<p><b>and I will tear them from your arms.</b><br>This phrase indicates God's intervention to dismantle the power and influence of these false practices. The act of tearing them from the arms suggests a forceful removal, signifying God's judgment and the futility of opposing His will. It reflects God's commitment to protect His people and restore them to truth, paralleling His deliverance of Israel from Egypt.<p><b>So I will free the souls you have ensnared like birds.</b><br>God's promise to free the ensnared souls underscores His role as a redeemer and liberator. This liberation is both physical and spiritual, pointing to God's desire to restore His people to a right relationship with Him. It echoes themes of deliverance found throughout Scripture, such as the Exodus and the ultimate freedom offered through Christ (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>). This act of freeing the souls also prefigures the spiritual liberation brought by Jesus, who came to set captives free (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, called to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_prophets.htm">False Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals in Israel who claimed to speak for God but led the people astray with lies and deceit.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/magic_bands.htm">Magic Bands</a></b><br>Symbolic of the deceptive practices used by false prophets to manipulate and control the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/souls_ensnared.htm">Souls Ensnared</a></b><br>Represents the people of Israel who were misled and trapped by the false teachings and practices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who opposes deceit and promises to deliver His people from falsehood.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_spiritual_matters.htm">Discernment in Spiritual Matters</a></b><br>Believers must exercise discernment to identify and reject false teachings that contradict God's Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>God is actively opposed to deceit and will ultimately bring justice, freeing those who are spiritually oppressed.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_deception.htm">The Danger of Deception</a></b><br>False teachings can ensnare and lead people away from the truth, highlighting the importance of grounding oneself in Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_true_prophets_and_teachers.htm">The Role of True Prophets and Teachers</a></b><br>True spiritual leaders are called to faithfully represent God's truth, guiding others in righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/freedom_in_christ.htm">Freedom in Christ</a></b><br>True freedom is found in Christ, who liberates us from the bondage of sin and falsehood.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_13_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 13:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_13_20_on_false_prophets_today.htm">How does Ezekiel 13:20 warn against false prophets' deceptive practices today?
