The outer court was a significant area where the people could gather, distinct from the inner court reserved for priests. This separation emphasizes the holiness and order of worship in the temple. The chambers likely served practical purposes, such as storage or housing for temple workers, reflecting the organized structure of temple service.<p><b>were fifty cubits long</b><br>A cubit is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches or 45 centimeters. Thus, these chambers were approximately 75 feet or 22.5 meters long. The specific dimensions highlight the precision and orderliness of God's design for His dwelling place, underscoring the importance of structure and function in worship. This measurement also reflects the grandeur and scale of the temple complex, indicating its significance in the community.<p><b>while those facing the temple</b><br>The orientation of these chambers towards the temple signifies their connection to the central place of worship. This positioning underscores the idea that all aspects of temple life and service are directed towards God. It reflects the centrality of worship in the life of the Israelites and serves as a reminder of the focus on God in all activities.<p><b>were a hundred cubits long</b><br>These chambers, being twice the length of those on the outer court, suggest a greater capacity or importance. The larger size could indicate their use for more significant functions or a greater number of people involved in temple activities. This distinction in size may also symbolize the increasing holiness as one moves closer to the temple, a theme consistent throughout the temple's design, where access becomes more restricted and sacred as one approaches the Holy of Holies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.
