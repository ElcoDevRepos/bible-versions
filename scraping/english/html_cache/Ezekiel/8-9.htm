Throughout the book of Ezekiel, God frequently speaks to the prophet, providing visions and instructions. This divine communication underscores the authority and authenticity of Ezekiel's prophetic message. It is reminiscent of other instances in the Bible where God speaks directly to His prophets, such as with Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a> and Isaiah in <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>.<p><b>Go in and see</b><br>Ezekiel is commanded to enter and observe, highlighting the role of a prophet as a witness to the actions and conditions of the people. This command to "go in" suggests a deeper revelation of hidden sins, similar to how God reveals the hidden things of the heart (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>). The act of seeing is crucial for Ezekiel's role as a prophet, as he must accurately convey God's message to the people.<p><b>the wicked abominations</b><br>The term "wicked abominations" refers to the idolatrous practices and moral corruption taking place in the temple. In the context of Ezekiel, these abominations are particularly egregious because they occur in a place meant for the worship of Yahweh. The use of "abominations" is consistent with other Old Testament references to idolatry and sin, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25-26</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/7-30.htm">Jeremiah 7:30</a>. These practices are a direct violation of the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>they are committing here</b><br>The location "here" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a sacred space that has been defiled by the people's actions. This desecration of the temple is a significant theme in Ezekiel, as it represents the spiritual decline of Israel. The historical context is the period leading up to the Babylonian exile, a time of great apostasy and rebellion against God. The actions of the people in the temple are a microcosm of the broader unfaithfulness of the nation, which ultimately leads to judgment and exile, as prophesied in <a href="/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31-33</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of God's visions and messages, tasked with delivering them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who reveals the hidden abominations to Ezekiel, demonstrating His omniscience and concern for holiness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The holy place where God&#8217;s presence was meant to dwell, now defiled by idolatrous practices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision.htm">The Vision</a></b><br>A supernatural revelation given to Ezekiel, showing the spiritual corruption within the temple.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_abominations.htm">The Abominations</a></b><br>Idolatrous practices and detestable acts committed by the Israelites, which provoke God's anger.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_idolatry.htm">The Seriousness of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just a historical issue but a present danger.

<a href="/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us that prophetic insight is always initiated by God, never by human curiosity (<a href="/2_peter/1-20.htm">2 Peter 1:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go in and see</b><p>&#8226;

<a href="/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; The directive underscores that nothing remains concealed before the LORD (<a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-24.htm">Jeremiah 23:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The wicked abominations</b><p>&#8226;

Twenty-five men bowing to the rising sun (8:16).<p>&#8226; Each act violates God&#8217;s covenant, defiles His sanctuary, and mirrors earlier apostasies under kings like Manasseh (<a href="/2_kings/21-2.htm">2 Kings 21:2-7</a>;
