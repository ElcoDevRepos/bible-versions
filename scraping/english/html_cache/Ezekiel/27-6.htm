The oaks of Bashan were highly valued for their durability and strength, making them ideal for crafting oars. This reference highlights the wealth and resourcefulness of Tyre, as they sourced the best materials for their ships. Biblically, Bashan is often associated with strength and abundance (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10-11</a>). The use of Bashan's oaks signifies the high quality and craftsmanship involved in Tyre's maritime endeavors.<p><b>of wood from the coasts of Cyprus they made your deck,</b><br>Cyprus, known in ancient times as Kittim, was famous for its abundant forests, particularly its cypress and cedar trees. The wood from Cyprus was prized for shipbuilding due to its resistance to rot and decay. This indicates Tyre's extensive trade networks and their ability to procure premium materials from distant lands. The mention of Cyprus also underscores the interconnectedness of ancient Mediterranean cultures and economies. The use of such wood for the deck suggests a focus on both functionality and luxury.<p><b>inlaid with ivory.</b><br>Ivory was a luxury item in the ancient world, often associated with wealth and opulence. The inlaying of ivory on the deck of a ship would have been a display of Tyre's prosperity and status. Ivory was typically sourced from Africa and India, indicating the far-reaching trade connections of Tyre. This opulence can be seen as a reflection of Tyre's pride and eventual downfall, as prophesied in <a href="/ezekiel/28.htm">Ezekiel 28</a>. The use of ivory also has symbolic connections to purity and value, which can be seen as a type pointing to the purity and worth of Christ, who is described as precious and without blemish (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

The text is literal&#8212;real timber from a real place&#8212;yet also sets up the theme of human pride in earthly resources that cannot save (<a href="/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they made your oars</b><p>&#8226; Oars power and direct a vessel.

Each element testifies to God&#8217;s accurate record of history while illustrating a spiritual lesson: the most secure human craftsmanship and the richest resources cannot prevent judgment when a nation&#8217;s pride replaces reliance on the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>; <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">The company of the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory.</span>--The literal rendering of this clause (with two words of doubtful meaning left blank) is, <span class= "ital">they made thy . . .</span> <span class= "ital">of tooth </span>(<span class= "ital">ivory</span>)<span class= "ital">, daughter of . . . </span>The sense will depend upon the filling up of these blanks. For the first there need be no difficulty. The word is used in <a href="/exodus/26-16.htm" title="Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a half shall be the breadth of one board.">Exodus 26:16</a> of the boards of the tabernacle, and here it is undoubtedly used of some planking about the ship; but it is in the singular number. It is hardly likely, therefore, to mean "benches" (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, seats for the oarsmen), since there were usually two or three tiers of these on each side of the ship. It is now generally taken collectively of the planking of the deck. If the Hebrew text, as it stands, is quite correct, we must read the other word "daughter of Ashurites," for there is no authority for rendering "daughter" by <span class= "ital">company. </span>It is difficult or impossible to make any intelligible sense of this; but if the two Hebrew words now written separately be joined together, we shall have "in box-wood," the word being the same as in <a href="/isaiah/60-13.htm" title="The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.">Isaiah 60:13</a>. There will still be a little doubt, as there is so often in Scripture, as to the exact wood intended, whether box-wood or the sherbin-cedar; but the general sense is plain--" they have made thy deck of ivory, <span class= "ital">inlaid </span>in box-wood."<p><span class= "bld">Isles of Chittim.</span>--Chittim is the Old Testament name for Cyprus, and hence "isles of Chittim" (as in <a href="/jeremiah/2-10.htm" title="For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.">Jeremiah 2:10</a>) stands for the islands and coasts whose fleets, in coming to the East, made their rendezvous at Cyprus. Thither were brought both the ivory from the African coast and the precious woods from various quarters.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The high plateau of Bashan, the region east of the sea of Galilee and the Jordan, now known as the Hauran, was famous then, as it is now, for its oak forests and its wild cattle (<a href="/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The company of the Ashurites</span>, etc.; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">they have made thy benches of ivory inlaid in boxwood</span>. The Authorized Version follows the present Hebrew text, but the name of the nation there is not the same as that of the Assyrians, and corresponds with the Ashurites of <a href="/2_samuel/2-9.htm">2 Samuel 2:9</a> - an obscure tribe of Canaanites, possibly identical with the Geshurites. A difference of punctuation or spelling (<span class="accented">Bithasshurim</span> for <span class="accented">Bath-asshu-rim</span>) gives the meaning which the Revised Version follows; <span class="accented">thasshur</span> being used in <a href="/isaiah/41-19.htm">Isaiah 41:19</a> and Isaiah 60:13 for the box tree, or perhaps cypress, or larch, as forming part of the glory of Lebanon. The use of ivory in ship or house building seems to have been one of the arts for which Tyre was famous. So we have the ivory palace of Ahab, after he had married his Sidonian queen (<a href="/1_kings/22-39.htm">1 Kings 22:39</a>) and those of the monarch who had married a Tyrian princess in <a href="/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a> (see also <a href="/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>). For the use of such inlaid wood in later times, see Virgil, 'AEneid,' 10:137. Either the ivory or the wood is said to come from <span class="cmt_word">the isles of Chittim</span>. The word was about as wide in its use as the "Indies" in the time of Elizabeth. Josephus ('Ant.,' 1:06. 1) identifies it with Cyprus, which perhaps retains a memorial of it in Citium. The Vulgate, as in <a href="/numbers/24-24.htm">Numbers 24:24</a>, identifies it here with Italy, and in <a href="/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30</a> translates the "ships of Chittim" as <span class="accented">trieres et Romani</span>, while in 1 Macc. 1:1, it is used of Greece as including Macedonia. In <a href="/genesis/10-4.htm">Genesis 10:4</a> the Kittim appear as descended from Javan, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> are classed as Greeks or Ionians. The ivory which the Tyrians used probably came from Northern Africa, and may have been supplied through Carthage or other Phoenician colonies. A supply may have come also from Ethiopia through Egypt, or from the Red Sea ports, with which the Phoenicians carried on a trade with Arabia. Inlaid ivory-work, sometimes in wood, sometimes with enamel, is found both in Egyptian and Assyrian remains ('Dict. Bible,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>.
