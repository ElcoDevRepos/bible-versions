The Israelites are depicted as having broken their covenant with God by turning to other deities, akin to a spouse being unfaithful. The phrase "blood is on their hands" indicates guilt for acts of violence and murder, possibly referring to the shedding of innocent blood through unjust practices or sacrifices. This imagery is consistent with the prophetic literature where spiritual adultery and bloodshed are linked (e.g., <a href="/hosea/4-2.htm">Hosea 4:2</a>).<p><b>They have committed adultery with their idols.</b><br>Idolatry is equated with spiritual adultery, as the Israelites were meant to be in a covenant relationship with God alone. The worship of idols, often associated with the surrounding pagan cultures, was a direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). This phrase underscores the severity of their sin, as idols are lifeless and powerless, yet the people chose them over the living God. The prophets frequently condemned this practice, highlighting its futility and the betrayal it represented (<a href="/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11-13</a>).<p><b>They have even sacrificed their children, whom they bore to Me, in the fire as food for their idols.</b><br>Child sacrifice, particularly to deities like Molech, was a heinous practice adopted from neighboring cultures such as the Ammonites. This act was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>) and was considered an abomination. The phrase "whom they bore to Me" emphasizes that these children were gifts from God, meant to be raised in His ways, not offered to false gods. This practice not only violated God's commandments but also desecrated the sanctity of life. The imagery of fire as a means of sacrifice highlights the brutality and inhumanity of the act. This sin was one of the reasons for the severe judgment pronounced upon Israel, as it represented the ultimate rejection of God's sovereignty and love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the exiles in Babylon.

When Israel chased after foreign gods, the Lord called it &#8220;adultery.&#8221; Ezekiel is reminding Judah that spiritual unfaithfulness isn&#8217;t just a slip; it&#8217;s a willful betrayal of the One who rescued and cherished them. Like a spouse running off with another lover, the nation traded intimacy with the living God for empty rituals and promises that couldn&#8217;t satisfy (<a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and blood is on their hands</b><p>Idolatry never stays &#8220;harmlessly spiritual.&#8221; It spills over into violence and injustice. <a href="/psalms/106-37.htm">Psalm 106:37-38</a> laments, &#8220;They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons&#8230; the land was polluted with blood.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;blood on their hands&#8221; underscores guilt so obvious it can&#8217;t be washed away (<a href="/isaiah/59-3.htm">Isaiah 59:3</a>). By turning from God&#8217;s law of love, Judah opened the door to every kind of cruelty, from oppression of the poor (<a href="/ezekiel/22-6.htm">Ezekiel 22:6-7</a>) to outright murder.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They have committed adultery with their idols</b><p>Here the Lord repeats the charge for emphasis. Idolatry wasn&#8217;t occasional; it was persistent and passionate. High places dotted the land (<a href="/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10-11</a>). Incense smoke rose to Baal and Asherah while the temple of the Lord sat neglected. The repetition drives home how deeply entrenched this false worship had become&#8212;more than a fling, it was a lifestyle (<a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a> reminds believers today that friendship with the world still equals enmity with God).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They have even sacrificed their children, whom they bore to Me</b><p>This line hits like a thunderclap.

God says they &#8220;bore&#8221; these little ones to Him&#8212;proof that every life ultimately belongs to the Creator. Yet parents handed their own sons and daughters over to pagan altars (<a href="/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a>). The Lord&#8217;s shock is palpable: how could they destroy what He lovingly knit together?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the fire as food for their idols</b><p>The gruesome practice of child sacrifice to Molech or similar deities involved fire (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>). Ezekiel calls it &#8220;food,&#8221; emphasizing the monstrous appetite of false gods. Unlike the Lord, who offers Himself for His people, idols demand that people offer themselves&#8212;or their children&#8212;for the idol. The contrast foreshadows the Gospel: whereas paganism consumes life, Christ gives His own life to save ours (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/23-37.htm">Ezekiel 23:37</a> exposes the tragic spiral of unfaithfulness: spiritual adultery leads to bloodguilt, entrenched idolatry, and ultimately the unthinkable sacrifice of children. The verse is God&#8217;s indictment against a nation that traded covenant love for counterfeit worship. It warns every generation that idolatry, in any form, always costs more than we expect&#8212;ultimately demanding what is most precious&#8212;while our faithful God continually calls us back to wholehearted devotion and life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/23-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they have committed adultery,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1488;&#1461;&#1431;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(ni&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;p&#772;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5003.htm">Strong's 5003: </a> </span><span class="str2">To commit adultery, to apostatize</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and blood</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
