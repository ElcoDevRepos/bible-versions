The desert represents a place of barrenness and lifelessness, contrasting with Egypt's usual image of fertility due to the Nile. Biblically, the desert often symbolizes a place of testing or divine judgment, as seen in Israel's wilderness wanderings (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>).<p><b>you and all the fish of your streams</b><br>The fish symbolize the people and resources of Egypt, dependent on the Nile for sustenance. The Nile was central to Egyptian life, economy, and religion, often deified as a god. This imagery underscores the totality of the judgment, affecting both the ruler and his subjects. The mention of fish connects to the plagues of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/7-18.htm">Exodus 7:18</a>), where the Nile's waters turned to blood, killing the fish.<p><b>You will fall on the open field</b><br>This phrase indicates a lack of protection and vulnerability. In ancient warfare, bodies left unburied on the battlefield were considered dishonored. The open field suggests exposure to the elements and scavengers, emphasizing the completeness of the defeat. This imagery is echoed in other prophetic judgments, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/8-2.htm">Jeremiah 8:2</a>, where the dead are left unburied.<p><b>and will not be taken away or gathered for burial</b><br>Burial was a significant cultural practice in ancient Egypt, with elaborate rituals to ensure a safe passage to the afterlife. The denial of burial rites signifies utter disgrace and divine judgment. This reflects the severity of God's punishment, as seen in other biblical contexts where burial is denied as a sign of curse (<a href="/1_kings/14-11.htm">1 Kings 14:11</a>).<p><b>I have given you as food to the beasts of the earth and the birds of the air</b><br>This phrase highlights the totality of the destruction, with the dead becoming carrion for animals. It echoes the covenant curses in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-26.htm">Deuteronomy 28:26</a>, where disobedience leads to such a fate. The imagery of birds and beasts consuming the dead is also found in <a href="/revelation/19-17.htm">Revelation 19:17-18</a>, symbolizing divine retribution. This can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over evil, where the enemies of God are defeated and left for the birds, contrasting with the resurrection and eternal life promised to believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
