It reflects God's inquiry into the actions of His people, highlighting His awareness and concern over their spiritual state. This questioning style is reminiscent of God's interactions with humanity throughout Scripture, such as His questions to Adam and Eve in <a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a>, emphasizing accountability and the need for self-reflection.<p><b>&#8216;What is this high place to which you go?&#8217;</b><br>High places were elevated sites often used for worship in ancient Israel and surrounding cultures. These locations were frequently associated with idolatrous practices, contrary to the worship of Yahweh prescribed in the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-4</a>). The Israelites' use of high places signifies a departure from true worship, reflecting a syncretism with Canaanite religious practices. This question underscores God's disapproval of their idolatry and serves as a call to repentance.<p><b>(And to this day it is called Bamah.)</b><br>The term "Bamah" means "high place" in Hebrew, and its continued use indicates the lasting impact of these idolatrous practices on the culture and memory of the people. This parenthetical note suggests that the name and its associated practices persisted even after the initial rebuke, highlighting the deep-rooted nature of idolatry. The enduring name serves as a reminder of Israel's spiritual infidelity, much like other biblical names and places that carry historical and spiritual significance, such as Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>) and its association with Jacob's encounter with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites, often involving judgment and calls for repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are being addressed in this passage.

At first it was applied to the hill on which some local sanctuary stood (<a href="/1_samuel/9-12.htm">1 Samuel 9:12</a>; <a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4</a>), but was gradually extended, after the building of the temple as the one appointed sanctuary, to other places which were looked upon as sacred, and which became the scenes of an idolatrous and forbidden worship. Ezekiel emphasizes his scorn by a conjectural derivation of the word, as if derived from the two words <span class="accented">ba</span> ("go") and <span class="accented">mah</span> ("whither"); <span class="accented">or</span>, perhaps, <span class="accented">What comes?</span> (comp. <a href="/exodus/16-15.htm">Exodus 16:15</a> for a parallel derivation of the word <span class="accented">marones</span>). Taking the words in their ordinary sense, they seem to express only a slight degree of contempt. "What, then, is the place to which you go?" - what is the "whither" to which it leads? But I incline (with Ewald and Smend) to see in the word "go into" the meaning which it has in <a href="/genesis/16-2.htm">Genesis 16:2</a> and Genesis 19:31, and elsewhere, as a euphemism for sexual union. So later the word "Bamah" becomes a witness that those who worship in the high place go there (as in ver. 30) to commit whoredom literally and spiritually. Its name showed that it was what I have called "a chapel of prostitution" (ch. 16:24, 25). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/20-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So I asked them:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1465;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
