In biblical context, the "mother" represents the cultural and spiritual heritage of the people. The reference to despising husband and children suggests a rejection of covenantal relationships, which in the Old Testament often symbolize the people's relationship with God. This imagery is consistent with the prophetic tradition of using family metaphors to describe Israel's unfaithfulness (e.g., <a href="/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1-3</a>).<p><b>You are the sister of your sisters, who despised their husbands and children.</b><br>Here, the "sisters" refer to neighboring nations or cities, such as Samaria and Sodom, which are also depicted as having broken their covenantal relationships. This phrase emphasizes the shared guilt and similar behaviors among these groups. The use of "sister" highlights the close relationship and shared characteristics, suggesting that Jerusalem is no better than these other cities, which were known for their wickedness and eventual judgment by God (<a href="/ezekiel/16-46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46-56</a>).<p><b>Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.</b><br>This statement is not a literal genealogical claim but a symbolic one. The Hittites and Amorites were ancient peoples known for their idolatry and immorality, often representing pagan influences in the land of Canaan. By identifying Jerusalem's "parents" as these groups, the text underscores the city's spiritual corruption and departure from its covenant with God. This imagery serves as a stark reminder of the Israelites' call to be distinct from the surrounding nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-6</a>) and highlights the severity of their

<a href="/jeremiah/3-20.htm">Jeremiah 3:20</a>, where God pictures His people as an unfaithful wife abandoning both spouse and offspring.<p>&#8226; The mother figure is Canaan, a land steeped in idolatry and child sacrifice (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>). Israel, meant to be set apart, mirrored that same rebellion.<p>&#8226; The statement underscores accountability: lineage is no excuse&#8212;sinful patterns must be broken.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You are the sister of your sisters, who despised their husbands and children.</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;sisters&#8221; are Samaria (capital of the Northern Kingdom) and Sodom (<a href="/ezekiel/16-46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46</a>).

Sodom&#8217;s violent pride and disregard for life are infamous (<a href="/genesis/19-4.htm">Genesis 19:4-13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-49.htm">Ezekiel 16:49-50</a>).<p>&#8226; By calling Jerusalem a sister to these cities, God levels the ground&#8212;no claim to moral superiority. <a href="/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47-48</a> echoes the warning: greater light brings greater responsibility.<p>&#8226; The spousal language again highlights broken covenant, while despising &#8220;children&#8221; shows social injustice and disregard for the vulnerable (<a href="/micah/2-9.htm">Micah 2:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.</b><p>&#8226; This is not about literal genealogy; Abraham&#8217;s line is well known.

A certain difficulty arises from the statement that they, too, "lothed their husbands and their children," and this is only removed by remembering that, notwithstanding their heathenism and long course of idolatry, they are still regarded as having gone astray from primeval revelation, and proved false to the only true God whom they once had known.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - Ezekiel returns to the thought of the spiritual parentage of Jerusalem and Judah, as in ver. 3. Reading between the lines, we find something like an anticipation of St. Paul's thought that Jehovah was the God of the Gentiles as well as of the Jews (<a href="/romans/3-29.htm">Romans 3:29</a>). The Hittites and Sodom and Samaria, to whom she is compared, had all alike been guilty of unfaithfulness to their husbands. Their idolatry was therefore, like hers, an act of apostasy. Jehovah was their husband also, their children were his children (ver. 21). He claimed them as his own, had entered with them also into a relation which, though less close than that with Israel, was as that of the husband to the wife. The thought expands, as we shall see, in the sequel of the chapter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/16-45.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1428;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;at)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_859.htm">Strong's 859: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thou and thee, ye and you</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are the daughter</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1323.htm">Strong's 1323: </a> </span><span class="str2">A daughter</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of your mother,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im&#183;m&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
