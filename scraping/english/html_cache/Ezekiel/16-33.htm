This practice is referenced in various biblical texts, highlighting the transactional nature of such relationships (<a href="/genesis/38-15.htm">Genesis 38:15-18</a>). The act of giving gifts to prostitutes underscores the idea of compensation for services rendered, which was a common societal norm. This phrase sets the stage for a stark contrast with the behavior of Jerusalem, as described in the following lines.<p><b>but you gave gifts to all your lovers</b><br>Here, the behavior of Jerusalem is depicted as the opposite of what was typical. Instead of receiving payment, Jerusalem, personified as an unfaithful wife, is portrayed as giving gifts to her lovers. This inversion of roles emphasizes the depth of Jerusalem's spiritual adultery and idolatry. The city is depicted as so desperate for the attention and favor of foreign nations and their gods that it is willing to pay them, rather than being paid. This reflects the historical alliances and treaties that Israel and Judah often sought with surrounding nations, contrary to God's command to rely solely on Him (<a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-2</a>).<p><b>You bribed them to come to you from everywhere</b><br>The use of the word "bribed" indicates a deliberate and active pursuit of these illicit relationships. Jerusalem's actions are portrayed as not only unfaithful but also proactive in seeking out these alliances. The phrase "from everywhere" suggests the widespread nature of this unfaithfulness, as Jerusalem sought alliances with various nations, such as Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>). This reflects the historical context of Israel's political maneuvering and reliance on foreign powers for security, rather than trusting in God.<p><b>for your illicit favors</b><br>The term "illicit favors" refers to the idolatrous practices and alliances that Jerusalem engaged in, which were considered spiritual adultery against God. This imagery is consistent with the prophetic literature, where idolatry is often likened to unfaithfulness in marriage (<a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-10</a>). The phrase underscores the moral and spiritual corruption of Jerusalem, as it pursued relationships that were forbidden and contrary to the covenant relationship with God. This serves as a warning and a call to repentance, highlighting the need for faithfulness to God alone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
