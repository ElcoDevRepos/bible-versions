This phrase indicates a personal and direct communication with the divine, a common feature in prophetic literature. Ezekiel often uses first-person narrative to convey his messages, emphasizing his role as a mediator between God and the people of Israel.<p><b>&#8220;Ah, Lord GOD,</b><br>The expression "Ah, Lord GOD" reflects a tone of lament or distress. The Hebrew term "Adonai Yahweh" is used here, highlighting both the sovereignty and covenantal relationship of God with Israel. This phrase is often used by prophets when expressing concern or confusion about their mission or the people's response.<p><b>they are saying of me,</b><br>Ezekiel is referring to the people of Israel, specifically the exiles in Babylon, who are questioning his messages. This reflects the skepticism and resistance prophets often faced. The people&#8217;s reaction is a common theme in prophetic books, where the messenger is often met with disbelief or hostility.<p><b>&#8216;Is he not just telling parables?&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The people accuse Ezekiel of speaking in parables, suggesting that his messages are not straightforward or are difficult to understand. In the context of Ezekiel's ministry, parables were a method to convey deeper spiritual truths, often requiring interpretation. This skepticism mirrors the response Jesus faced in the New Testament when He used parables (<a href="/matthew/13-10.htm">Matthew 13:10-15</a>). The use of parables can be seen as a way to reveal truths to those willing to seek understanding while concealing them from those who are hard-hearted.

<a href="/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10</a>).<p>&#8226; His responsiveness demonstrates a living, personal relationship&#8212;he knows the message is divine and feels the weight of delivering it faithfully (<a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>).<p>&#8226; By recording his own reaction, Ezekiel invites the reader to recognize that even God&#8217;s chosen messengers wrestle with the reception of His word (<a href="/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ah, Lord GOD</b><p>The cry &#8220;Ah, Lord GOD&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/20-49.htm">Ezekiel 20:49</a>b) combines an exclamation of distress with a confession of divine sovereignty.<p>&#8226; Similar cries appear when servants of God feel overwhelmed (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-10.htm">Jeremiah 4:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The lament reveals a faithful heart that honors God&#8217;s authority while honestly expressing burden&#8212;an example of pouring out one&#8217;s heart yet remaining submissive (<a href="/psalms/62-8.htm">Psalm 62:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Ezekiel&#8217;s words remind us that acknowledging God&#8217;s lordship does not cancel real struggle; it places the struggle in the hands of the One who rules (<a href="/psalms/55-22.htm">Psalm 55:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They are saying of me</b><p>Ezekiel notes the people&#8217;s reaction: &#8220;they are saying of me&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/20-49.htm">Ezekiel 20:49</a>c).<p>&#8226; The prophet&#8217;s credibility is under attack, much like other spokesmen for God who were mocked or ignored (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16</a>; <a href="/luke/7-33.htm">Luke 7:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel had already hardened its heart, dismissing warnings as noise (<a href="/ezekiel/12-2.htm">Ezekiel 12:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-15.htm">Matthew 13:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase highlights the cost of obedience: messengers often face scorn even while standing firmly on God&#8217;s literal, accurate word (<a href="/hebrews/11-36.htm">Hebrews 11:36-38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is he not just telling parables?</b><p>The people shrug, &#8220;Is he not just telling parables?&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/20-49.htm">Ezekiel 20:49</a>d).<p>&#8226; They reduce divine revelation to mere stories&#8212;clever but non-binding (<a href="/ezekiel/17-2.htm">Ezekiel 17:2</a>; 24:3).<p>&#8226; Jesus later faced similar dismissal when crowds treated His parables as entertainment rather than truth (<a href="/matthew/13-13.htm">Matthew 13:13</a>; <a href="/mark/4-11.htm">Mark 4:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; By labeling prophecy a parable, Israel tried to dodge accountability. God quickly answers in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/21.htm">Ezekiel 21</a>, interpreting the &#8220;parable&#8221; as literal judgment soon to fall on Jerusalem.<p>&#8226; The pattern warns us not to domesticate Scripture into harmless anecdotes; God speaks plainly and His word stands (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Ezekiel&#8217;s brief plea shows a faithful servant wrestling with public cynicism. He cries to the sovereign LORD, reports the people&#8217;s sneer, and exposes their tactic of dismissing prophecy as mere storytelling. God&#8217;s response in the following chapter proves that His word&#8212;never a casual tale&#8212;carries immediate, literal consequences. Believers today can take courage: proclaim the Scriptures plainly, trust their accuracy, and leave the results in the hands of the Lord who always vindicates His truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(49) <span class= "bld">Doth he not speak parables?</span>--Or enigmas--things that we cannot understand.

It was to him a proof, as a like question was to the Christ (<a href="/matthew/15-16.htm">Matthew 15:16</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-9.htm">Matthew 16:9</a>; <a href="/mark/8-21.htm">Mark 8:21</a>) proof that those hearers were yet without understanding. The question was, for those who asked it, an excuse for hardening their hearts against remonstrances which needed no explanation. The indignation was followed by another interval of silence, during which he brooded over their stubbornness, and at last, in <a href="/ezekiel/21-1.htm">Ezekiel 21:1</a>, the word of the Lord comes to him, and he speaks "no more in proverbs," but interprets the latest parable even in its details. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/20-49.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then I said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1465;&#1502;&#1463;&#1429;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
