This scene is part of a vision where God commands the executioners to slay those who do not bear His mark of protection. The phrase highlights Ezekiel's role as a prophet, set apart to observe and convey God's message. The concept of being "left alone" underscores the isolation often experienced by prophets, who are called to witness and communicate God's will, even when it involves severe judgment. This moment reflects the seriousness of divine justice and the separation between the righteous and the wicked, reminiscent of the Passover in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, where those marked by the blood of the lamb were spared.<p><b>And I fell facedown and cried out,</b><br>Ezekiel's response of falling facedown is a common biblical expression of humility and reverence in the presence of God. It signifies submission and the recognition of God's supreme authority. This posture is seen in other biblical figures, such as Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-3.htm">Genesis 17:3</a>) and Daniel (<a href="/daniel/10-9.htm">Daniel 10:9</a>), who also fell facedown in moments of divine encounter. Ezekiel's cry is an intercessory plea, reflecting the prophet's deep concern for his people and his role as a mediator between God and Israel.<p><b>&#8220;Oh, Lord GOD, when You pour out Your wrath on Jerusalem,</b><br>The invocation "Oh, Lord GOD" is a plea to Yahweh, acknowledging His sovereignty and justice. The pouring out of wrath signifies God's righteous anger against sin and idolatry, a recurring theme in the prophetic literature. Jerusalem, the city chosen by God, had become corrupt, and this judgment is a fulfillment of the warnings given through the prophets. The imagery of pouring out wrath is also seen in <a href="/revelation/16.htm">Revelation 16</a>, where God's wrath is depicted as being poured out in the form of plagues, emphasizing the completeness and inevitability of divine judgment.<p><b>will You destroy the entire remnant of Israel?&#8221;</b><br>Ezekiel's question reveals his concern for the survival of a faithful remnant within Israel. The concept of a remnant is significant throughout Scripture, representing those who remain faithful to God despite widespread apostasy. This remnant theme is seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a> and <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>, where God preserves a faithful group for His purposes. Ezekiel's intercession reflects the tension between God's justice and mercy, highlighting the hope that even in judgment, God will preserve a people for Himself. This remnant ultimately points to the fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ, who embodies the faithful remnant and brings salvation to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the central figure in this passage, witnessing the vision of God's judgment on Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_remnant_of_israel.htm">The Remnant of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the small group of Israelites who remain faithful to God amidst widespread idolatry and sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city under divine judgment due to the people's persistent rebellion and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_executioners.htm">The Executioners</a></b><br>Angelic beings tasked with carrying out God's judgment on the city, sparing only those marked for protection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision.htm">The Vision</a></b><br>A divine revelation given to Ezekiel, depicting the severe judgment on Jerusalem for its sins.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin has severe consequences, and God's holiness demands justice.

God&#8217;s preservation of Ezekiel highlights His sovereign control: &#8220;A thousand may fall at your side&#8230; but it shall not approach you&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/91-7.htm">Psalm 91:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The prophet&#8217;s solitude underscores that judgment distinguishes between the righteous marked for protection (<a href="/ezekiel/9-4.htm">Ezekiel 9:4</a>) and the unrepentant who perish, echoing Noah&#8217;s separation from the floodwaters (<a href="/genesis/7-1.htm">Genesis 7:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Being &#8220;left alone&#8221; clarifies that God always keeps a witness to declare His purposes, just as He preserved Jeremiah amid Jerusalem&#8217;s fall (<a href="/jeremiah/15-11.htm">Jeremiah 15:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And I fell facedown</b><p>The posture of falling prostrate reveals<p>&#8226;

Honest lament is welcomed by God; Habakkuk likewise asked, &#8220;Why do You tolerate wrongdoing?&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/1-3.htm">Habakkuk 1:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When You pour out Your wrath on Jerusalem</b><p>The prophet recognizes that the devastation unfolding is divine wrath, not random violence.<p>&#8226;

Ezekiel&#8217;s awareness affirms the certainty of covenant curses outlined in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> when the nation persists in idolatry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will You destroy the entire remnant of Israel?</b><p>Here lies Ezekiel&#8217;s chief concern: the preservation of a faithful minority.<p>&#8226; Earlier, God promised, &#8220;Yet I will leave a remnant&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/6-8.htm">Ezekiel 6:8</a>), so the question seeks clarification, not contradiction.<p>&#8226; Abraham voiced a similar plea for righteous individuals within Sodom (<a href="/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23-25</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah foretold that &#8220;a remnant will return&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/10-21.htm">Isaiah 10:21-22</a>), and Paul later affirmed, &#8220;So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace&#8221; (<a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The remnant principle assures that God&#8217;s covenant promises to Abraham, David, and ultimately to Messiah remain intact despite national judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/9-8.htm">Ezekiel 9:8</a> pictures a faithful prophet spared amid sweeping judgment. Alone, he collapses in worshipful fear, interceding for survivors while acknowledging divine wrath upon unrepentant Jerusalem. His question about the remnant reflects confidence that God&#8217;s justice never nullifies His covenant faithfulness. The verse teaches that God discriminates between those marked by repentance and those hardened in sin, preserves a holy seed for His redemptive plan, and invites His people to grieve over sin even as they trust His righteous judgments.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">I was left.</span>--The words imply <span class= "ital">left alone. </span>The prophet had just before seen the courts of the sanctuary thronged with idolaters in the full glory of their heaven-defying sin. Now it is a city of the dead, and he is left standing alone in the midst of the dead. He falls upon his face in consternation, and pleads that "the residue of Israel" may not be utterly destroyed. The sternness of the Divine answer leaves no room for hope of any mitigation of the judgment. No mention is made here of those who were to be saved; they were so few among the mass as to have no effect upon the general impression of the vision.
