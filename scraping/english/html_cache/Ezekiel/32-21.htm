The "mighty chiefs" refer to powerful leaders or warriors who have died and are now in Sheol. This imagery suggests that even in death, these leaders retain a form of consciousness and can communicate. The concept of Sheol is consistent with other Old Testament references, such as in <a href="/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9-11</a>, where the dead are portrayed as aware of new arrivals. Theologically, this passage underscores the idea that earthly power and might do not prevent one from facing judgment after death.<p><b>about Egypt and her allies:</b><br>Egypt, a significant power in the ancient world, often found itself in conflict with Israel and other nations. The mention of Egypt and her allies indicates a coalition of nations that opposed God's people. Historically, Egypt was known for its alliances with various nations, including those in the Levant and Africa. This passage reflects the broader biblical theme of God's judgment against nations that oppose His will, as seen in the prophecies against Egypt in <a href="/ezekiel/29.htm">Ezekiel 29-32</a>. The alliances mentioned here could include nations like Cush, Put, and Lud, which are often associated with Egypt in biblical texts.<p><b>&#8216;They have come down and lie with the uncircumcised,</b><br>The phrase "come down" signifies descent into Sheol, emphasizing the finality of death. "Lie with the uncircumcised" is a derogatory term used in the Old Testament to describe those outside the covenant community of Israel. Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). Thus, being uncircumcised symbolized being outside of God's covenant and favor. This phrase highlights the shame and dishonor of Egypt and her allies, as they are grouped with those who are not part of God's chosen people, reflecting their spiritual and moral state.<p><b>with those slain by the sword.&#8217;</b><br>Being "slain by the sword" indicates a violent death, often seen as a form of divine judgment in the Old Testament. This phrase suggests that Egypt and her allies met their end through warfare, a common fate for nations that opposed God's purposes. The imagery of the sword is frequently used in prophetic literature to symbolize God's instrument of judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/25-31.htm">Jeremiah 25:31</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3-5</a>). This serves as a warning to all nations that defy God's authority, reinforcing the theme of divine retribution and the ultimate futility of opposing God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
