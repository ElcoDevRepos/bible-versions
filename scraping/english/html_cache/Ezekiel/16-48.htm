The expression "As surely as I live" is an oath formula, underscoring the seriousness of the message. It reflects God's eternal nature and His sovereign authority over all creation. This phrase is used throughout the Old Testament to affirm the truthfulness of God's words (e.g., <a href="/numbers/14-28.htm">Numbers 14:28</a>, <a href="/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>).<p><b>your sister Sodom and her daughters</b><br>Sodom is referenced here as a "sister" to Jerusalem, indicating a relationship of comparison. Sodom, known for its destruction due to wickedness (Genesis 19), serves as a symbol of extreme moral corruption. The "daughters" refer to the smaller towns or communities associated with Sodom. This comparison highlights the gravity of Jerusalem's sins, suggesting they are even more egregious than those of Sodom.<p><b>never did as you and your daughters have done.</b><br>This statement is a severe indictment of Jerusalem's behavior. Historically, Sodom's sins included pride, excess, and neglect of the poor (<a href="/ezekiel/16-49.htm">Ezekiel 16:49-50</a>). By stating that Jerusalem's actions surpassed those of Sodom, the text underscores the depth of Jerusalem's apostasy and moral failure. This comparison serves as a warning and a call to repentance, emphasizing the need for humility and righteousness. The phrase also reflects the broader biblical theme of accountability and the consequences of turning away from God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the exiles in Babylon.

The Lord swears by His own life to certify the charge, speaks with unchallengeable authority, and exposes the scandal of a privileged people out-sinning a city once destroyed for its evil.
