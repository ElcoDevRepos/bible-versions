It highlights the distinction between God and man, underscoring the humility and mortality of the prophet. This title is also used extensively in the New Testament for Jesus Christ, indicating His role as the representative of humanity.<p><b>speak to the elders of Israel</b><br>The elders were leaders and representatives of the people, often involved in decision-making and spiritual guidance. Their approach to Ezekiel suggests they were seeking divine insight or guidance. Historically, the elders played a crucial role in maintaining the traditions and laws of Israel, especially during times of crisis or exile.<p><b>and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says</b><br>This phrase establishes the authority of the message. It is not Ezekiel's own words but a direct communication from God. The use of "Lord GOD" (Adonai Yahweh) emphasizes God's sovereignty and covenant relationship with Israel. This formula is common in prophetic literature, affirming the divine origin of the message.<p><b>Have you come to inquire of Me?</b><br>This rhetorical question implies a rebuke. The elders' inquiry suggests a desire for guidance or approval, but their motives and sincerity are questioned. Historically, Israel often sought God's counsel, but their hearts were frequently divided, as seen in their idolatry and disobedience.<p><b>As surely as I live</b><br>This oath underscores the certainty and seriousness of God's declaration. It is a divine assurance, emphasizing God's eternal nature and the unchangeable truth of His words. This phrase is used elsewhere in Scripture to affirm the certainty of God's promises or judgments.<p><b>I will not be consulted by you</b><br>God's refusal to be consulted indicates a broken relationship due to Israel's persistent rebellion and idolatry. It reflects a period of judgment where God withholds His guidance as a consequence of their actions. This echoes other instances in Scripture where God distances Himself from those who are unrepentant.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD</b><br>The repetition of God's title at the end of the message reinforces His authority and the seriousness of the pronouncement. It serves as a reminder of God's ultimate control and the importance of obedience to His will. This declaration is a common prophetic conclusion, emphasizing the divine source and certainty of the message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders_of_israel.htm">Elders of Israel</a></b><br>Leaders and representatives of the Israelite community who approached Ezekiel to seek guidance from God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who speaks through Ezekiel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were exiled from their homeland and living in Babylon, a time of judgment and reflection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/inquiring_of_god.htm">Inquiring of God</a></b><br>The act of seeking divine guidance or answers, which the elders attempted to do through Ezekiel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sincerity_in_seeking_god.htm">Sincerity in Seeking God</a></b><br>God desires genuine hearts when we seek Him.
