In the biblical context, Moab was a nation east of Israel, often in conflict with the Israelites. Historically, Moab was known for its idolatry and opposition to Israel (Numbers 22-24). The judgments on Moab are part of a series of prophecies against nations surrounding Israel, emphasizing God's sovereignty over all nations. This reflects the broader biblical theme of divine justice, where God holds nations accountable for their actions, particularly their treatment of His people.<p><b>and they will know that I am the LORD.</b><br>This phrase underscores the purpose of God's judgments: to reveal His identity and sovereignty. The recognition of God as LORD is a recurring theme in Ezekiel, emphasizing His authority and the fulfillment of His covenant promises. The phrase "they will know that I am the LORD" appears frequently in Ezekiel, serving as a reminder that God's actions are meant to lead people to acknowledge Him. This acknowledgment is not just intellectual but involves a recognition of His power and authority. Theologically, it points to the ultimate goal of God's redemptive plan, where all nations will recognize His lordship, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>, where every knee will bow to Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
