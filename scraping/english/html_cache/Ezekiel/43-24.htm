This reflects the ancient Israelite practice of bringing sacrifices to the temple as a means of seeking God's presence and favor. The phrase underscores the importance of approaching God with reverence and obedience, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>, where offerings are brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting. This act symbolizes the worshiper's desire to be in communion with God, acknowledging His holiness and sovereignty.<p><b>the priests are to sprinkle salt on them</b><br>Salt in biblical times was a symbol of preservation and purity. In <a href="/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>, God commands that all grain offerings be seasoned with salt, referred to as the "salt of the covenant." This indicates the enduring nature of God's covenant with His people. The use of salt in offerings signifies the purification and sanctification of the sacrifice, ensuring it is acceptable to God. Salt's preservative qualities also symbolize the eternal nature of God's promises and the lasting relationship between God and His people.<p><b>and sacrifice them as a burnt offering to the LORD.</b><br>The burnt offering, or "olah" in Hebrew, was a sacrifice that was completely consumed by fire on the altar, symbolizing total dedication and surrender to God. This type of offering is detailed in <a href="/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a> and was a common practice in ancient Israelite worship. It represents the worshiper's complete devotion and submission to God's will. The burnt offering is also a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate sacrifice, as He offered Himself wholly to God for the atonement of humanity's sins, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>. This act of sacrifice highlights the necessity of atonement and the restoration of the relationship between God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book and the one receiving the vision of the new temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, to whom the offerings are presented.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The Levitical priests who are responsible for performing the temple rituals and offerings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/salt.htm">Salt</a></b><br>A symbol of purity, preservation, and covenant, used in the offerings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offering.htm">Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A type of sacrifice in the Old Testament that signifies atonement and complete surrender to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_sacrifice.htm">The Role of Sacrifice</a></b><br>Sacrifices in the Old Testament were a means of atonement and worship.
