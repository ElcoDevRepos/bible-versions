In the context of Ezekiel, the Israelites had adopted pagan customs, including the worship of foreign gods, which often involved rituals that were detestable to the Lord. The term "unclean" signifies a state of impurity that separates the people from God, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44-45</a>, where God calls His people to be holy and separate from the practices of surrounding nations. The gifts mentioned here are not just physical offerings but represent the people's hearts and intentions, which had strayed from God's commandments.<p><b>the sacrifice of every firstborn in the fire&#8212;</b><br>This phrase highlights the horrific practice of child sacrifice, which was prevalent among some of the pagan cultures surrounding Israel, such as the worship of Molech. This practice is explicitly condemned in <a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>. The sacrifice of the firstborn was a perversion of the concept of dedicating the firstborn to God, as seen in <a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>, where God commands the consecration of the firstborn to Him. Instead of dedicating their children to the Lord in a manner consistent with His laws, the Israelites were engaging in abominable practices that defiled them and provoked God's wrath.<p><b>so that I might devastate them,</b><br>This phrase indicates the consequence of the Israelites' disobedience and idolatry. God's judgment is portrayed as a means of devastation, which serves as a corrective measure. The devastation is not merely punitive but is intended to bring the people to a realization of their sin and the seriousness of turning away from God. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's discipline as a form of love and correction, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>, where the Lord disciplines those He loves.<p><b>in order that they would know that I am the LORD.</b><br>The ultimate purpose of God's actions, including His judgments, is to bring His people to the knowledge of Him as the one true God. This phrase underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where knowing the Lord is central to their identity and purpose. Throughout the book of Ezekiel, this refrain is repeated to emphasize that God's actions, whether in blessing or judgment, are designed to reveal His character and sovereignty. This knowledge is not merely intellectual but relational, calling the people to repentance and renewed faithfulness. The phrase also points forward to the New Covenant, where knowing the Lord is a promise fulfilled in Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a> and <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were in rebellion and idolatry, leading to their exile.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon as a consequence of their disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrifice_of_the_firstborn.htm">Sacrifice of the Firstborn</a></b><br>A practice that had become corrupted among the Israelites, leading to God's judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who desires His people to know Him and follow His commandments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_judgment.htm">Understanding God's Judgment</a></b><br>God's pronouncement of uncleanness is a form of judgment meant to bring awareness of sin and lead to repentance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_idolatry.htm">The Consequences of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry leads to moral and spiritual corruption, distancing people from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_desire_for_relationship.htm">God's Desire for Relationship</a></b><br>Despite judgment, God's ultimate goal is for His people to know Him and return to a right relationship with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Obedience to God's commands is crucial to maintaining a covenant relationship with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/learning_from_the_past.htm">Learning from the Past</a></b><br>Reflecting on Israel's history helps us understand the importance of faithfulness and the dangers of straying from God's ways.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_20_26_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 20:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_20_26_Disobedience_consequences.htm">How does Ezekiel 20:26 illustrate consequences of disobedience to God's commands?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_I_defiled_them_reveal.htm">What does "I defiled them through their gifts" reveal about Israel's idolatry?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_20_26_s_lesson_on_idolatry.htm">How can Ezekiel 20:26 guide us in avoiding modern-day idolatry?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_20_26_vs_Romans_1_24-25_Sin_Desires.htm">Compare Ezekiel 20:26 with Romans 1:24-25 on God allowing sinful desires.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_make_offerings_pure_to_God.htm">How can we ensure our offerings to God are pure and pleasing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_give_not_good_statutes_in_Ezekiel.htm">Why did God give statutes that were "not good" in Ezekiel 20:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_20_26_God_s_love_and_justice.htm">How does Ezekiel 20:26 align with God's nature as loving and just?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_firstborn_used_in_Ezekiel_20_26.htm">What historical context explains the "firstborn" reference in Ezekiel 20:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ezekiel_20.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ezekiel 20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_foods_are_mentioned_in_the_bible.htm">What foods are mentioned in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_is_auricular_confession.htm">What does having everything for life and godliness mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_does_ezekiel_20_25_align_with_god's_justice.htm">Ezekiel 20:25 mentions God giving Israel &#8220;statutes that were not good&#8221;; how does this align with the concept of a just and unchanging God elsewhere in Scripture?
