It is used over 90 times in the book of Ezekiel. The term "Son of Man" is also significant in the New Testament, where it is frequently used by Jesus to refer to Himself, highlighting His incarnation and messianic role.<p><b>prophesy against the prophets of Israel</b><br>Ezekiel is commanded to speak against the false prophets in Israel. These individuals claimed to speak for God but were delivering messages that were not from Him. This reflects a recurring issue in Israel's history, where false prophets led the people astray, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16-17</a>. The true prophets, like Ezekiel, were often in opposition to these false voices.<p><b>who are now prophesying</b><br>The false prophets were actively delivering their messages during Ezekiel's time. This indicates an ongoing problem that required immediate attention. The context is the period of the Babylonian exile, where many Israelites were desperate for hopeful messages, making them susceptible to deceit.<p><b>Tell those who prophesy out of their own imagination</b><br>The false prophets were not receiving divine revelation but were instead speaking from their own thoughts and desires. This is a direct violation of the prophetic office, which requires speaking only what God has revealed. This echoes warnings found in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a> about the dangers of false prophecy.<p><b>Hear the word of the LORD!</b><br>Ezekiel is instructed to deliver the true message from God, contrasting the falsehoods of the other prophets. This call to "hear" emphasizes the authority and authenticity of God's word. It is a reminder of the importance of discerning true prophecy, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>, which advises believers to test the spirits to see whether they are from God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets_of_israel.htm">Prophets of Israel</a></b><br>Individuals claiming to speak on behalf of God, but who are delivering false messages from their own imagination.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom Ezekiel is sent, specifically the exiles in Babylon, who are being misled by false prophets.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period during which the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, a time of judgment and reflection for the nation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The one true God, who speaks through His true prophets and condemns false prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_prophecy.htm">Discernment in Prophecy</a></b><br>Believers must exercise discernment and test the messages they hear against the truth of Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_god's_word.htm">Authority of God's Word</a></b><br>True prophecy aligns with the Word of God; anything contrary should be rejected.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_of_leaders.htm">Responsibility of Leaders</a></b><br>Spiritual leaders have a responsibility to speak truthfully and not lead people astray with their own imaginations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_false_prophecy.htm">Consequences of False Prophecy</a></b><br>False prophets face judgment from God, and their messages can lead people away from His truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_reflection.htm">Personal Reflection</a></b><br>Each believer should reflect on their own sources of spiritual guidance and ensure they are rooted in biblical truth.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_13_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 13:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Spotting_false_prophets_today_2.htm">How can we discern false prophets as warned in Ezekiel 13:2 today?

Though Ezekiel is a mere man, he carries God&#8217;s infallible word (<a href="/ezekiel/2-1.htm">Ezekiel 2:1&#8211;3</a>; 3:17).<p>&#8226; It reminds readers that God graciously chooses ordinary servants to bear His perfect message, just as He later did with the apostles (<a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also signals responsibility. Ezekiel must faithfully relay what God says, much like Paul&#8217;s charge to Timothy to &#8220;preach the word&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are now prophesying</b><p>God commands Ezekiel to confront other &#8220;prophets,&#8221; exposing their error.<p>&#8226; These so-called prophets delivered soothing messages that contradicted God&#8217;s looming judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16-17</a>; <a href="/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;now prophesying&#8221; shows the urgency; their deceptive words were active and influential, requiring immediate correction (<a href="/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s true spokesman must sometimes oppose popular voices, even inside the covenant community, paralleling Elijah&#8217;s stand against the prophets of Baal (<a href="/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Tell those who prophesy out of their own imagination: Hear the word of the LORD!</b><p>The heart of the verse exposes the counterfeit source of their messages&#8212;human imagination, not divine revelation.<p>&#8226; False prophecy springs from self-generated ideas, dreams, and desires (<a href="/jeremiah/23-25.htm">Jeremiah 23:25-27</a>), producing spiritual blindness (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s command, &#8220;Hear the word of the LORD,&#8221; is both invitation and warning. Submission to His authentic word is the only safeguard (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-19.htm">2 Peter 1:19-21</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast between &#8220;imagination&#8221; and &#8220;the word of the LORD&#8221; highlights the timeless test for truth: does a message align with Scripture? Compare the Bereans who examined &#8220;the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/13-2.htm">Ezekiel 13:2</a> calls out false voices in Israel, charging Ezekiel to confront them with God&#8217;s unchanging truth. The verse shows:<p>&#8226; God uses ordinary people to deliver His authoritative word.<p>&#8226; Genuine prophecy stands over against popular but deceptive messages.<p>&#8226; The ultimate test of any teaching is whether it comes from human imagination or the revealed word of the Lord.
