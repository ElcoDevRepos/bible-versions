In the historical context, the strongholds represent the fortified cities and defenses of the nation. The imagery of breaking down strongholds is often used in the Bible to describe God's judgment against nations (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>). It signifies the removal of security and protection, leading to vulnerability and defeat. This can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual strongholds being dismantled by divine intervention.<p><b>and devastated their cities.</b><br>The devastation of cities indicates a complete overthrow and ruin, often as a result of divine judgment. In the context of Ezekiel, this devastation is a consequence of the nation's disobedience and idolatry. Historically, the cities of Judah faced destruction during the Babylonian conquest, which fulfilled the prophetic warnings given by Ezekiel and other prophets. This devastation serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's commandments and the inevitable judgment that follows.<p><b>The land and everything in it shuddered</b><br>The shuddering of the land and its inhabitants conveys a sense of fear and trembling in response to the lion's actions. This phrase emphasizes the widespread impact of the devastation, affecting not only the physical land but also the people and their livelihoods. It reflects the terror and awe that accompany divine judgment. In a broader biblical context, such reactions are common when God's power and wrath are revealed (e.g., <a href="/psalms/99.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>).<p><b>at the sound of his roaring.</b><br>The roaring of the lion symbolizes the authority and power of the ruler, instilling fear and asserting dominance. In the prophetic literature, roaring often represents the voice of God or His messengers proclaiming judgment (e.g., <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>). This imagery underscores the inevitability and seriousness of the impending judgment. The roaring can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is referred to as the Lion of Judah (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>), symbolizing His ultimate authority and power over all creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

In the historical setting, this points to the final monarchs of Judah&#8212;as <a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a> notes, &#8220;all the mighty men of valor&#8221; were removed, leaving the land exposed. Strongholds that had stood since the days of Solomon fell one by one (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17</a>). The text underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness to His warnings in <a href="/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31&#8211;33</a>: if the nation persisted in rebellion, their fortifications would crumble. By highlighting &#8220;He broke down,&#8221; Ezekiel stresses that the prince personally participated in the collapse; his pride and choices directly triggered the disaster (<a href="/jeremiah/34-7.htm">Jeremiah 34:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and devastated their cities</b><p>The lion&#8217;s campaign did not stop at walls; entire population centers lay in ruins. Scripture records that Nebuchadnezzar &#8220;burned the house of the LORD, the king&#8217;s palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem; every notable building he burned&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9</a>). Ezekiel echoes that scene. &#8220;Devastated&#8221; is thorough&#8212;mirroring the prophetic pattern seen in <a href="/isaiah/6-11.htm">Isaiah 6:11&#8211;12</a> and <a href="/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a>, where emptied streets and toppled homes testify that sin always extracts its wage. The cities that once echoed with praise now echoed with collapse, a sober reminder that trust in stone rather than in God leads to inevitable ruin (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The land and everything in it shuddered</b><p>Judah&#8217;s landscape reacts almost like a living being. Jeremiah experienced the same vision: &#8220;I looked, and the mountains were quaking, and all the hills were swaying&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/4-24.htm">Jeremiah 4:24</a>). <a href="/hosea/4-3.htm">Hosea 4:3</a> predicts that the earth itself mourns when covenant life is violated. Ezekiel&#8217;s phrase assures us this is not merely political upheaval; it is cosmic disturbance brought on by transgression. <a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a> later echoes the idea&#8212;creation groans under the weight of human sin. Farms, fields, livestock, even the silence between ruined buildings all &#8220;shuddered,&#8221; amplifying how extensive the judgment truly was.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the sound of his roaring</b><p>The &#8220;roaring&#8221; links back to the prince&#8217;s earlier portrayal as a lion cub (<a href="/ezekiel/19-5.htm">Ezekiel 19:5&#8211;6</a>). Every roar&#8212;each decree and action&#8212;spread fear across the land, much like <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a> says, &#8220;The lion has roared; who will not fear?&#8221; People heard in that roar not merely a tyrant&#8217;s voice but God&#8217;s announced sentence (<a href="/jeremiah/25-30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30&#8211;31</a>). Yet the same roar that once promised protection now signals doom. It is an audible symbol of royal arrogance permitted by God for a season, until the prince himself is trapped (<a href="/ezekiel/19-8.htm">Ezekiel 19:8&#8211;9</a>). The terror stirred by his roar exposes the futility of human power set against divine authority (<a href="/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/19-7.htm">Ezekiel 19:7</a> pictures a Judean ruler as a rampaging lion whose own aggression topples fortresses, razes cities, rattles the very soil, and spreads dread with every roar. Each phrase turns up the volume on the same truth: when leaders and people reject God, judgment arrives as surely and tangibly as collapsed walls and trembling earth. The verse therefore stands as both record and warning&#8212;affirming God&#8217;s literal fulfillment of His word, highlighting the personal responsibility of those in authority, and urging every generation to seek refuge not in strongholds or rulers but in the Lord Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Knew their desolate palaces.</span>--This verse continues to describe the abominations of Jehoiachin's ways. The word "desolate palaces," although defended by some authorities, should be rendered, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">widows. </span>The mention of the king's violation of these is an unavoidable departure from the figure, such as often occurs in Ezekiel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He knew their</span> <span class="cmt_word">desolate palaces;</span> literally, <span class="accented">widows</span>; but the word is used figuratively in <a href="/isaiah/13-22.htm">Isaiah 13:22</a>, in the sense of "desolate houses" (comp. <a href="/isaiah/47-8.htm">Isaiah 47:8</a>). So the Vulgate gives <span class="accented">didicit viduas facere</span>; and Keil adopts that meaning here, "he knew, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. outraged, the widows of Israel." The Revised Version admits it in the margin. The two words for "widows" and "palaces" differ in a single letter only, and there may have been an error in transcription. On the whole, I adhere to the Authorized Version and Revised Version (text). Currey explains, "He knew (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. eyed with satisfaction) his palaces," from which he had ejected their former owners, as his father Jeboiakim had done (<a href="/jeremiah/22-15.htm">Jeremiah 22:15, 16</a>). Ewald follows the Targum in a various reading of the verb, and gets the meaning, "he destroyed its palaces." Interpreting the parable, we have Jehoiachin described as alarming Nebuchadnezzar and the neighbouring nations by his activity, and therefore carried off to Babylon as Jehoahaz lad been to Egypt. The young lion was to roar in chains, not on the "mountains of Israel." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/19-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He broke down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1433;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
