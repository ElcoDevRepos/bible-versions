The "waist up" suggests a focus on the upper part of a figure, often associated with authority and power. In biblical visions, the upper body can symbolize the heavenly or divine aspect of a being. This aligns with other biblical descriptions of God, such as in <a href="/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5-6</a>, where a heavenly figure is described with similar imagery.<p><b>I saw a gleam like amber</b><br>Amber, in ancient times, was a precious material, often associated with beauty and value. The gleam suggests a radiant, glowing appearance, indicating purity and holiness. In Ezekiel's context, this could symbolize the glory and majesty of God. The use of amber may also connect to the description of God's throne in <a href="/revelation/4-3.htm">Revelation 4:3</a>, where precious stones are used to convey divine splendor.<p><b>with what looked like fire within it all around</b><br>Fire is a common biblical symbol for God's presence, purity, and judgment. It represents the consuming and purifying nature of God, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a> with the burning bush and in <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>, where God is described as a consuming fire. The fire within suggests an inner holiness and power emanating from the divine figure.<p><b>And from what seemed to be His waist down</b><br>The focus shifts to the lower part of the figure, which can symbolize the earthly or human aspect. This duality of divine and earthly elements is seen in the incarnation of Christ, who is both fully God and fully man. The waist down imagery may also reflect the foundation and stability of God's presence.<p><b>I saw what looked like fire</b><br>Reiterating the imagery of fire emphasizes the intensity and purity of the vision. Fire as a symbol of divine presence is consistent throughout scripture, such as in the pillar of fire that guided the Israelites in <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>. It signifies God's guidance, protection, and judgment.<p><b>and brilliant light surrounded Him</b><br>Light is a powerful biblical symbol for truth, revelation, and the presence of God. In <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, Jesus refers to Himself as the "light of the world," indicating His role in bringing divine truth and salvation. The brilliant light surrounding the figure in Ezekiel's vision underscores the holiness and majesty of God, as well as His role as the source of all truth and life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book and the recipient of the visions described.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision_of_god's_glory.htm">The Vision of God&#8217;s Glory</a></b><br>This vision is part of Ezekiel's inaugural vision, where he sees the glory of God manifested in a divine chariot.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exile_in_babylon.htm">The Exile in Babylon</a></b><br>The context of Ezekiel's prophecy is the Babylonian exile, a period of great turmoil and spiritual reflection for the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_holiness_of_god.htm">The Holiness of God</a></b><br>The imagery of fire and brilliant light in <a href="/ezekiel/1-27.htm">Ezekiel 1:27</a> underscores God's holiness and purity.

The phrase &#8220;from what seemed to be His waist up&#8221; focuses our attention on the upper part of this divine Figure, underscoring both His real, personal form and His transcendent glory.<p>&#8226; Similar visions show God revealing Himself in human likeness&#8212;think of <a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>, and <a href="/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>&#8212;all affirming that the LORD personally manifests His glory while still remaining infinitely above us (<a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I saw a gleam like amber</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Amber&#8221; conveys a glowing, burnished, metallic brightness&#8212;more than simple color; it suggests blazing, living radiance.<p>&#8226; This gleam recalls Jesus&#8217; post-resurrection brilliance (<a href="/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14&#8211;15</a>) and the luminous &#8220;beryl&#8221; of the heavenly messenger in <a href="/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>.<p>&#8226; The consistent scriptural pattern: whenever God lets His servants glimpse His glory, their first impression is blazing brilliance, not vague light (<a href="/exodus/24-17.htm">Exodus 24:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with what looked like fire within it all around</b><p>&#8226; Fire in Scripture points to God&#8217;s holiness, power, and purity (<a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Ezekiel&#8217;s description of fire &#8220;within&#8221; stresses that this radiance is not a reflection but proceeds from God&#8217;s very being.<p>&#8226; The encircling flames form a protective barrier (<a href="/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a>) and underline the seriousness of approaching a holy God apart from grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And from what seemed to be His waist down</b><p>&#8226; The second directional phrase balances the vision, confirming that the fiery glory envelops the whole Person.<p>&#8226; Ezekiel the priest is trained to note such details; in the temple, holiness was graded by distance from God&#8217;s presence. Here, holiness saturates every &#8220;level&#8221; of the divine Figure&#8212;underscoring that God&#8217;s glory is not localized but total (<a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I saw what looked like fire</b><p>&#8226; Repetition intensifies the theme: from top to bottom, the LORD appears as &#8220;fire.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a> pictures &#8220;a river of fire flowing, coming out from before Him,&#8221; while <a href="/revelation/10-1.htm">Revelation 10:1</a> shows a mighty angel &#8220;with legs like pillars of fire,&#8221; echoing Ezekiel&#8217;s vision and suggesting that any heavenly emissary bears the stamp of the consuming glory of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and brilliant light surrounded Him</b><p>&#8226; The scene climaxes in an aura of splendor: &#8220;brilliant light surrounded Him.&#8221; <a href="/habakkuk/3-4.htm">Habakkuk 3:4</a> says, &#8220;His radiance was like the sunlight; rays flashed from His hand.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This surrounding brilliance is the biblical &#8220;shekinah&#8221; glory&#8212;visible, weighty, unmistakable (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34&#8211;35</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus revealed the same glory on the Mount of Transfiguration: &#8220;His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>).

The same Lord revealed to Ezekiel appears in Daniel, Habakkuk, Revelation, and at the Transfiguration, proving the harmony of Scripture and pointing us to the One who &#8220;dwells in unapproachable light&#8221; yet graciously makes Himself known.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">As the colour of amber.</span>--See on the same expression <a href="/ezekiel/1-4.htm" title="And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.">Ezekiel 1:4</a>.
