The concept of a "holy portion" reflects the biblical principle of consecration, where certain people and places are set apart for God's purposes. This is reminiscent of the Levitical cities and the special inheritance given to the tribe of Levi, who were set apart for priestly duties (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>). The idea of holiness is central to the priesthood, as they were mediators between God and the people, foreshadowing the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>It will be 25,000 cubits long on the north side,</b><br>The specific measurement of 25,000 cubits indicates a large, defined area, underscoring the significance of the space dedicated to the priests. A cubit is traditionally understood as the length from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger, approximately 18 inches or 45 centimeters. This measurement reflects the precision and orderliness of God's plans, as seen throughout the construction of the tabernacle and temple (Exodus 25-27, <a href="/1_kings/6.htm">1 Kings 6</a>). The north side's length signifies the comprehensive provision for the priestly class, ensuring they have ample space for their duties and living.<p><b>10,000 cubits wide on the west side,</b><br>The width of 10,000 cubits on the west side further defines the dimensions of this holy portion. The west side's measurement complements the overall rectangular shape of the area, symbolizing balance and symmetry in God's design. The west often holds symbolic meaning in Scripture, representing the direction of the setting sun and the end of a day, which can be seen as a metaphor for completion and fulfillment. This can be connected to the fulfillment of God's promises and the ultimate completion of His redemptive plan through Christ.<p><b>10,000 cubits wide on the east side,</b><br>Similarly, the east side's width of 10,000 cubits maintains the symmetry of the designated area. The east holds significant biblical symbolism, often associated with new beginnings and divine encounters. For instance, the Garden of Eden was planted in the east (<a href="/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>), and the glory of the LORD entered the temple from the east in Ezekiel's vision (<a href="/ezekiel/43.htm">Ezekiel 43:1-4</a>). This directional symbolism can point to the hope and renewal found in God's presence and the new covenant established through Jesus.<p><b>and 25,000 cubits long on the south side.</b><br>The south side's length of 25,000 cubits completes the rectangular boundary of the holy portion. The south, in biblical geography, often represents warmth and blessing, as it is associated with the Negev, a region known for its fertility and abundance. This can symbolize the blessings and provision that come from serving in God's presence. The precise dimensions of the area reflect God's meticulous care and provision for His people, ensuring that the priests have a dedicated space for worship and service.<p><b>In the center will be the sanctuary of the LORD.</b><br>The central location of the sanctuary highlights its importance as the focal point of worship and God's presence among His people. The sanctuary, or holy place, is where the priests perform their sacred duties, and it represents the dwelling place of God. This centrality underscores the idea that God should be at the heart of the community and the lives of His people. The sanctuary's presence in the center foreshadows the coming of Jesus, who is the true temple and the center of God's redemptive plan (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>, <a href="/revelation/21-22.htm">Revelation 21:22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priests.htm">The Priests</a></b><br>The passage refers to the portion of land allocated to the priests, who are the descendants of Zadok.

A cubit is roughly 18 inches, making this northern span about 7.1 miles.<p>&#8226; The precise measurement underscores God&#8217;s orderly plan (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>) and assures Israel that the coming temple complex will be real, not symbolic.<p>&#8226; Comparable dimensions are given in <a href="/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1&#8211;3</a> for the &#8220;holy district,&#8221; indicating continuity within the prophet&#8217;s vision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>10,000 cubits wide on the west side</b><p>&#8226; Approximately 2.8 miles wide, this western boundary mirrors the width on the east, ensuring symmetry (<a href="/ezekiel/42-15.htm">Ezekiel 42:15&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; The equal sides reflect God&#8217;s impartiality and justice (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Westward orientation reminds us of the tabernacle layout where entry faced east, keeping the Most Holy Place deepest within (<a href="/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33</a>). Here, the sanctuary remains centrally protected.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>10,000 cubits wide on the east side</b><p>&#8226; The eastern side&#8217;s identical width balances the tract, highlighting God&#8217;s perfection (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>).<p>&#8226; From the east the glory of the Lord will return (<a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>), so setting an equal eastern border frames a grand approach for that glory.<p>&#8226; This preserved width prevents encroachment by tribal lands (<a href="/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8</a>), guarding the holiness of worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>25,000 cubits long on the south side</b><p>&#8226; Mirroring the northern length keeps all sides square except the unequal widths, forming a rectangle.<p>&#8226; Such meticulous planning anticipates a future kingdom where &#8220;the law will go out from Zion&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>), aided by an uncompromised priesthood within secure borders.<p>&#8226; The southern limit separates priestly lands from the Levites&#8217; adjoining portion (<a href="/ezekiel/48-13.htm">Ezekiel 48:13</a>), reinforcing distinct roles while keeping ministry centralized.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the center will be the sanctuary of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The sanctuary sits &#8220;in the center,&#8221; just as God must reside at the heart of community life (<a href="/psalms/46-5.htm">Psalm 46:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Central placement ensures equal accessibility for all tribes who will surround this zone (<a href="/ezekiel/48-1.htm">Ezekiel 48:1-29</a>).<p>&#8226; This anticipates the Millennial Temple where Messiah rules and the nations come to worship (<a href="/zechariah/14-16.htm">Zechariah 14:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/48-10.htm">Ezekiel 48:10</a> describes a literal, precisely measured parcel of land in Israel&#8217;s future that is wholly reserved for the faithful priesthood.
