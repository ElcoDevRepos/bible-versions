Historically, Tyre was known for its strong fortifications and strategic position, making it a significant maritime power. The prophecy foretells the city's downfall, which was fulfilled through various sieges, most notably by Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon and later by Alexander the Great. The destruction of Tyre's walls symbolizes the breaking of its defenses and the end of its dominance.<p><b>and demolish her towers.</b><br>The towers of Tyre were part of its formidable defense system, representing its military strength and architectural prowess. The demolition of these towers signifies a complete overthrow of Tyre's power and security. This imagery of destruction is consistent with other biblical prophecies against cities that opposed God's people, emphasizing the theme of divine judgment against pride and idolatry.<p><b>I will scrape the soil from her</b><br>This phrase suggests a thorough and complete devastation, leaving nothing behind. The imagery of scraping soil indicates that Tyre would be stripped of its wealth, influence, and even its physical presence. Historically, this was fulfilled when Alexander the Great used the debris from the mainland city to build a causeway to the island city, effectively scraping the soil and using it for his military purposes. This act of scraping also symbolizes God's judgment and the removal of all that is unholy or opposed to His will.<p><b>and make her a bare rock.</b><br>The transformation of Tyre into a "bare rock" signifies its utter desolation and the end of its glory. This imagery is powerful, as it portrays a once-thriving city reduced to a barren, lifeless state. In biblical symbolism, a "bare rock" can also represent exposure and vulnerability, contrasting with the city's former strength and prosperity. This prophecy highlights the sovereignty of God over nations and His ability to humble the proud. The fulfillment of this prophecy serves as a testament to the accuracy of biblical predictions and the ultimate triumph of God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

History records Nebuchadnezzar battering the mainland wall (<a href="/ezekiel/26-7.htm">Ezekiel 26:7&#8211;11</a>) and Alexander the Great later breaching the island fortifications in 332 BC.<p>&#8226; Believers today see in this a sober lesson: no human security system can stand when the Lord decides to judge (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The literal fulfillment of this detail confirms the trustworthiness of every word of Scripture, echoing Jesus&#8217; statement that &#8220;not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen&#8221; will fail (<a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Demolish her towers</b><p>&#8220;They will&#8230; demolish her towers&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/26-4.htm">Ezekiel 26:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Towers symbolized power and vigilance (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-9.htm">2 Chronicles 26:9</a>). When God says they are coming down, He is stripping Tyre of both pride and defense.<p>&#8226; Alexander leveled these structures to build his causeway out to the island, fulfilling the text with startling precision.<p>&#8226; Isaiah had foretold the humbling of coastal strongholds (<a href="/isaiah/23-11.htm">Isaiah 23:11</a>). Ezekiel amplifies that theme: the loftiest human achievements crumble under God&#8217;s hand (<a href="/daniel/4-37.htm">Daniel 4:37</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, every &#8220;tower&#8221; we exalt&#8212;wealth, reputation, intellect&#8212;must bow to Him (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will scrape the soil from her</b><p>&#8220;I will scrape the soil from her&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/26-4.htm">Ezekiel 26:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The first-person &#8220;I&#8221; shifts the focus from invading armies to the ultimate Actor: the LORD Himself (cf. <a href="/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Scraping soil pictures a city reduced to bedrock, like a potter scraping clay from a wheel. Micah gives a similar image when God says He will &#8220;make Samaria a heap of rubble in an open field&#8221; (<a href="/micah/1-6.htm">Micah 1:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Alexander literally scraped the mainland ruins to fill the sea and construct his mole, fulfilling this phrase down to the dust.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, God&#8217;s judgment is thorough; He doesn&#8217;t merely bruise sin, He eradicates it (<a href="/hebrews/10-27.htm">Hebrews 10:27</a>).
