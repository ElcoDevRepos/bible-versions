Tyre's strategic location on the Mediterranean coast facilitated extensive trade networks. The city's merchants were renowned for their skill in navigation and commerce, which allowed them to export goods far and wide. This trade was crucial for the economy of Tyre and contributed to its wealth and influence. The imagery of wares going out to sea underscores the city's dependence on maritime trade and its role as a hub of economic activity.<p><b>you satisfied many nations</b><br>Tyre's trade not only benefited itself but also provided goods and resources to various nations. The city's exports included luxury items such as purple dye, glass, and fine textiles, which were highly sought after in the ancient world. This phrase suggests that Tyre's commerce met the needs and desires of many different peoples, enhancing its reputation and fostering international relationships. The satisfaction of many nations through trade reflects the interconnectedness of ancient economies and the importance of Tyre as a center of distribution.<p><b>You enriched the kings of the earth</b><br>The wealth generated by Tyre's trade extended beyond its borders, enriching the rulers of other nations. This enrichment likely came through the exchange of goods, tribute, and alliances formed through trade agreements. The phrase indicates the far-reaching impact of Tyre's economic activities, as its prosperity contributed to the wealth of other kingdoms. This can be seen as a reflection of the broader economic systems of the ancient Near East, where trade was a key factor in the accumulation of wealth and power.<p><b>with your abundant wealth and merchandise</b><br>The abundance of Tyre's wealth and merchandise is a testament to its success as a commercial powerhouse. The city's prosperity was built on its ability to produce and trade a wide variety of goods, which were in high demand across the ancient world. This abundance is indicative of the city's advanced economic infrastructure and its capacity to sustain large-scale trade operations. The mention of wealth and merchandise also serves as a reminder of the transient nature of material riches, a theme echoed throughout Scripture, where reliance on wealth is often contrasted with spiritual values.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tyre.htm">Tyre</a></b><br>An ancient Phoenician city known for its wealth and trade.

Still, the verse sits within a lament that exposes the city&#8217;s fatal error&#8212;placing ultimate confidence in commerce instead of the Lord. Prosperity is a gift meant to glorify God and bless others; when separated from Him, it becomes a trap that eventually sinks, just like Tyre&#8217;s once-proud fleet.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/27-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When your merchandise</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1463;&#1433;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;iz&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;w&#183;na&#183;yi&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
