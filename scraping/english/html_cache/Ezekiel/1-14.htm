In biblical context, cherubim are often depicted as guardians of sacred spaces, such as the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>) and the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>). Their dynamic motion may symbolize the active and living nature of God's presence and His omnipresence, as they move swiftly to fulfill His will.<p><b>as quickly as flashes of lightning.</b><br>The comparison to lightning emphasizes the speed and power of the creatures' movements. Lightning is often used in Scripture to depict divine power and majesty (<a href="/psalms/18-14.htm">Psalm 18:14</a>, <a href="/matthew/24-27.htm">Matthew 24:27</a>). This imagery conveys the awe-inspiring and overwhelming nature of God's glory, which Ezekiel is witnessing. The use of lightning also connects to other prophetic visions, such as those in Daniel and Revelation, where divine beings and events are described with similar imagery, highlighting the consistency of God's revelation throughout the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.
