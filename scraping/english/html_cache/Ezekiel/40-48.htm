The portico, or porch, of the temple is a significant architectural feature, often serving as an entrance or transitional space. In the context of Solomon's Temple, the portico was a place of gathering and worship. The temple represents God's dwelling place among His people, and the portico symbolizes the threshold between the divine and the earthly. This vision is part of a larger prophetic message about restoration and the future glory of God's people.<p><b>and measured the side pillars of the portico to be five cubits on each side.</b><br>The act of measuring signifies order, precision, and divine intention. The side pillars, being five cubits each, reflect the importance of structure and stability in the temple's design. In biblical numerology, the number five can symbolize grace and God's goodness. The pillars may also represent strength and support, both physically and spiritually, as they uphold the entrance to the sacred space. This measurement underscores the meticulous care in the construction of God's house, reflecting His holiness and perfection.<p><b>The width of the gateway was fourteen cubits</b><br>The gateway's width of fourteen cubits suggests a grand and welcoming entrance. The number fourteen, being double seven, can symbolize completeness and spiritual perfection. This measurement may also indicate the accessibility of God's presence to His people, inviting them into a relationship with Him. The gateway serves as a passage from the outer world into the sacred, emphasizing the transition from the profane to the holy.<p><b>and its sidewalls were three cubits on either side.</b><br>The sidewalls, each measuring three cubits, provide a sense of enclosure and protection for the gateway. The number three often represents divine completeness and the Trinity in Christian theology. These sidewalls may symbolize the boundaries set by God to safeguard His holiness and the sanctity of the temple. They also highlight the importance of approaching God with reverence and respect, acknowledging His divine order and the separation between the sacred and the secular.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of the vision of the new temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_portico_of_the_temple.htm">The Portico of the Temple</a></b><br>This is the entrance area of the temple, symbolizing the threshold between the secular and the sacred.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_measuring_angel.htm">The Measuring Angel</a></b><br>An angelic figure who guides Ezekiel through the vision, measuring the temple's dimensions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>Represents God's dwelling place among His people, a central theme in Ezekiel's vision.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jambs_and_gateway.htm">The Jambs and Gateway</a></b><br>Architectural elements of the temple, symbolizing strength and the entrance to divine presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_measurement.htm">Symbolism of Measurement</a></b><br>The precise measurements emphasize God's order and perfection.

The measurements in ver. 49 of the length of the porch (from east to west) twenty cubits, and the breadth (from north to south) eleven cubits, he harmonizes with this view by assuming that the pillars, which were five cubits bread in front, were only half that breadth in the inside, the side wall dividing it in two, so that, although to one entering the opening was only six cubits, the moment one stood in the interior it was 6 cubits + 2 &times; 2.5 cubits = 11 cubits. Kliefoth, however, rejects this explanation, and understands the three cubits to refer to the portion of the entrance on either side which was closed by a gate, perhaps of lattice-work, leaving for the ingress and egress of priests a passage of five cubits. In this view the whole front of the porch would he 5 cubits of passage + 6 (2 &times; 3) cubits of lattice-work + 10 (2 &times; 5) cubits of pillar, equal in all to 21 cubits. Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' includes the three cubits of door in the five cubits of post, and, supposing the temple entrance to be ten cubits, makes the whole front to have been twenty cubits. We prefer Kliefoth's opinion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/40-48.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then he brought</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1488;&#1461;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7687;i&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
