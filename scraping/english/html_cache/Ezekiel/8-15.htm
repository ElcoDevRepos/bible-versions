It emphasizes Ezekiel's humanity and his role as a representative of the people. The term underscores the prophet's position as a mediator between God and Israel, highlighting his human limitations in contrast to God's divine authority.<p><b>He said to me,</b><br>The speaker here is God, who is directly communicating with Ezekiel. This divine communication is a hallmark of prophetic literature, where God reveals His will and insights to His chosen messengers. It signifies the importance of the message and the authority behind it.<p><b>do you see this?</b><br>This question draws attention to the vision Ezekiel is witnessing. It is a rhetorical device used by God to ensure Ezekiel's full awareness and understanding of the gravity of the situation. The vision is part of a series of revelations showing the idolatry and corruption within the temple, which was meant to be a holy place dedicated to the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>Yet you will see even greater abominations than these.</b><br>This phrase indicates that the idolatry and sins Ezekiel has already witnessed are only the beginning. The "greater abominations" suggest a progressive revelation of the depth of Israel's unfaithfulness. This serves as a warning of the increasing severity of Israel's sins and the corresponding judgment. The abominations are linked to the covenant violations that led to the Babylonian exile, reflecting the historical context of Israel's spiritual decline. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and purification that will come, pointing to the need for a new covenant, which Christians believe is fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of God's visions and messages, tasked with delivering them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who reveals the abominations occurring in the temple to Ezekiel, highlighting the spiritual corruption of His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the temple is located, representing the spiritual center of Israel and the focal point of the vision.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The holy place in Jerusalem where the abominations are taking place, symbolizing the desecration of what is sacred.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/abominations.htm">Abominations</a></b><br>The idolatrous practices and detestable acts being committed by the Israelites, which provoke God's anger and judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_idolatry.htm">The Seriousness of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but anything that takes the place of God in our hearts.

Divine speech frames the entire vision of chapter 8.<p>&#8226; Scripture records that &#8220;the word of the LORD came&#8221; to His servants repeatedly (<a href="/1_kings/18-1.htm">1 Kings 18:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-4.htm">Isaiah 38:4</a>), demonstrating His commitment to communicate with clarity.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s personal address assures Ezekiel&#8212;and the exiles who will later hear his message&#8212;that the coming indictment is not human opinion but divine fact (<a href="/2_peter/1-20.htm">2 Peter 1:20&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; Through Ezekiel, the Lord extends that same certainty to us; when God speaks, His words are always true, authoritative, and life-defining (<a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do you see this?</b><p>The Lord draws Ezekiel&#8217;s attention to what was happening in the temple courts: idolatrous worship carried out by Israel&#8217;s leaders (<a href="/ezekiel/8-9.htm">Ezekiel 8:9&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; The question urges careful observation. God wants His servant to grasp the full weight of sin before He pronounces judgment, much as He invited Abraham to &#8220;look now toward heaven&#8221; before promising numerous descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Seeing wickedness through God&#8217;s eyes cultivates righteous indignation and spiritual discernment (<a href="/psalms/119-104.htm">Psalm 119:104</a>).<p>&#8226; It also exposes the deceptive nature of sin; what the people considered harmless &#8220;expressions of faith&#8221; were actually affronts to the living God (<a href="/jeremiah/7-17.htm">Jeremiah 7:17&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Yet you will see even greater abominations than these.</b><p>The unveiled idolatry was only the beginning; deeper corruption still lurked within Israel&#8217;s leadership (<a href="/ezekiel/8-6.htm">Ezekiel 8:6, 13, 17</a>).<p>&#8226; Sin seldom remains static. Like leaven, it spreads until it permeates everything (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Escalating revelation of wickedness prepares the reader for the temple&#8217;s eventual destruction and the exile&#8217;s severity, fulfilling warnings such as <a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a> and <a href="/2_kings/21-12.htm">2 Kings 21:12&#8211;15</a>.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s progressive exposure of sin mirrors His dealings with humanity in <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24&#8211;32</a>&#8212;giving people over to deeper depravity when they persistently reject truth.<p>&#8226; Yet even in judgment, He intends restoration; later chapters promise a new heart and Spirit-empowered obedience (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26&#8211;27</a>), highlighting His mercy alongside His justice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/8-15.htm">Ezekiel 8:15</a> captures a pivotal moment in the prophet&#8217;s vision. The Lord calls His &#8220;son of man&#8221; to witness the depths of Judah&#8217;s idolatry, assuring him that what he has already seen is only the beginning of the nation&#8217;s moral collapse. God&#8217;s question&#8212;&#8220;Do you see this?&#8221;&#8212;challenges every reader to view sin as He views it, while His warning of &#8220;greater abominations&#8221; underscores the progressive nature of unchecked rebellion.
