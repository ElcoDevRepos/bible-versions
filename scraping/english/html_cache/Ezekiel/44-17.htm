The inner court was a restricted area, signifying a closer proximity to God. In the context of Ezekiel's vision, this represents the holiness required of those who serve God. The inner court is a type of the heavenly sanctuary, where only those who are sanctified can enter, reflecting the New Testament teaching that believers are a royal priesthood (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>they are to wear linen garments;</b><br>Linen garments symbolize purity and righteousness. Linen, being a natural fiber, was considered clean and was used for priestly garments to prevent sweat, which was associated with impurity. This requirement underscores the need for holiness and purity in service to God. Linen garments are also mentioned in <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>, where the fine linen represents the righteous acts of the saints, drawing a parallel between the Old Testament priesthood and the New Testament believers.<p><b>they must not wear anything made of wool</b><br>Wool, in contrast to linen, was associated with warmth and comfort but also with sweat and labor. The prohibition against wool emphasizes the distinction between the sacred and the profane, and the need for the priests to be free from anything that could symbolize human effort or impurity. This can be seen as a type of the righteousness of Christ, which is not based on human works but on divine grace (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><b>when they minister at the gates of the inner court or inside the temple.</b><br>The ministry of the priests was to be conducted in a manner that reflected the holiness of God. Serving at the gates and inside the temple signifies the role of the priests as mediators between God and the people. This foreshadows the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who ministers in the heavenly sanctuary (<a href="/hebrews/8.htm">Hebrews 8:1-2</a>). The emphasis on proper attire and conduct highlights the reverence and respect required in the presence of God, a principle that applies to all believers in their spiritual service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel received visions and messages from God concerning the restoration of Israel and the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/inner_court.htm">Inner Court</a></b><br>The sacred area within the temple where priests ministered, symbolizing a place of holiness and divine presence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The Levitical priests were responsible for performing temple duties and maintaining the sanctity of worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple.htm">Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, representing God's dwelling among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/linen_garments.htm">Linen Garments</a></b><br>Specific attire prescribed for priests, symbolizing purity and separation from common or profane activities.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_in_service.htm">Holiness in Service</a></b><br>The requirement for priests to wear linen garments underscores the need for purity and holiness in serving God.

It reminds us of the call to draw near with reverence, echoed later in <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19&#8211;22</a>, where believers are urged to enter &#8220;the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus.&#8221; Access to God is always on His terms; the inner court is not a casual hangout but holy ground.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Clothed in Linen</b><p>&#8220;they are to wear linen garments&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/44-17.htm">Ezekiel 44:17</a>). Linen, light and pure, symbolizes righteousness and freedom from sweat-producing toil. <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a> links &#8220;fine linen, bright and clean&#8221; to &#8220;the righteous acts of the saints.&#8221; In the Old Testament, the high priest donned linen on the Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>), emphasizing purity as he entered the Holy of Holies. Here, every priest in the millennial temple shares that standard, illustrating God&#8217;s desire for clean, unburdened service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Not a Stitch of Wool</b><p>&#8220;they must not wear anything made of wool.&#8221; Wool traps heat and causes perspiration. In <a href="/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42&#8211;43</a> God commands linen undergarments &#8220;so that they will not incur guilt and die,&#8221; underscoring the need to avoid sweat&#8212;symbolic of the curse on Adam&#8217;s labor (<a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>). The restriction teaches that ministry is not to be tainted by fleshly effort; service must be rested, Spirit-enabled (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Serving in Sacred Space</b><p>&#8220;when they minister at the gates of the inner court or inside the temple.&#8221; Whether at the threshold or the heart of worship, the requirement is the same. Consistency matters; holiness is not situational (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). The verse also reinforces ordered worship&#8212;priests have defined roles, paralleling Paul&#8217;s call for orderly gatherings (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>). Every detail&#8212;place, attire, attitude&#8212;reflects God&#8217;s unchanging standard of holiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/44-17.htm">Ezekiel 44:17</a> teaches that approaching God&#8217;s immediate presence demands purity and rest from self-effort. Linen garments portray righteousness granted by God, while the prohibition of wool rejects sweat-stained, curse-laden labor. From the moment priests cross the inner-court gate to every act within, holy consistency is required. For believers today, the verse underscores our call to serve in Christ&#8217;s righteousness, resting in His finished work as we draw near to the holy God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/44.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Clothed with linen garments.--</span>The rest of the chapter is occupied with directions for the clothing and conduct of the priests.

That this was so is suggested by the statement that no wool, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b6;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, "perhaps so called from its being shorn off" (Gesenius), should <span class="cmt_word">come upon them whiles they ministered in the gates of the inner court</span>, or <span class="cmt_word">within</span> the court itself, or the house - the contrast being between what was of vegetable and what was of animal production. The reason for the prohibition of wool is hinted at in ver. 18 - it was apt to cause sweat, and thus entail impurity; the clean white linen, on the other hand, was designed both for hygienic reasons and as an emblem of purity (comp. <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8, 14</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/44-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When they enter</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
