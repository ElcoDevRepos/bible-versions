The north gate of the temple was significant as it was one of the main entrances, often associated with judgment and divine presence. The temple, being the house of the LORD, was the central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's dwelling among His people. The north gate's mention may also imply a strategic location for observing idolatrous practices, as it was a prominent entry point.<p><b>and I saw women sitting there</b><br>The presence of women at the temple gate is notable, as women were not typically involved in temple rituals. Their sitting posture suggests a deliberate act of worship or mourning, indicating a deviation from traditional Israelite worship practices. This scene highlights the infiltration of pagan customs into the sacred space of the temple, reflecting the spiritual decline of the nation.<p><b>weeping for Tammuz</b><br>Tammuz was a Mesopotamian deity associated with fertility and vegetation, whose death and resurrection were mourned and celebrated in annual rituals. The weeping for Tammuz represents the adoption of foreign religious practices by the Israelites, contrary to the worship of Yahweh. This idolatry was a direct violation of the first commandment and a cause of God's impending judgment. The practice of mourning for Tammuz is linked to the broader theme of Israel's unfaithfulness, as seen in other prophetic books like Jeremiah and Hosea, where idolatry is often depicted as spiritual adultery.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, Ezekiel is the one receiving the vision.

Tammuz is nowhere else mentioned in Scripture, but is identified by ancient tradition (incorporated into the Vulg.) with the Greek Adonis, the beloved of Venus. The name <span class= "ital">Adonis </span>could not well have been used, because in its Hebrew form it means <span class= "ital">Lord, </span>and is frequently used of God. His worship is first heard of in Phoenicia, and was wide-spread throughout Syria and the adjacent countries. As the creature worship before mentioned was undoubtedly connected with political reasons, while aid was being sought from Egypt, so the worship of Adonis may have been affected by the league which Zedekiah attempted to form (<a href="/context/jeremiah/27-1.htm" title="In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,">Jeremiah 27:1-11</a>) with the Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites, and Philistines against Nebuchadnezzar. The annual feast of Adonis consisted of a mourning by the women for his death, followed by a rejoicing over his return to life, and was accompanied by great abominations and licentiousness. The myth of Adonis was also closely associated with the worship of nature. This festival did not fall in the "sixth month," but the description is not necessarily of what was actually occurring at the moment; there is brought before the prophet's vision a representation of the wickedness practised at various times in Jerusalem. Women engaged in the service of idolatry near the Temple are mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/23-7.htm" title="And he broke down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.">2Kings 23:7</a>. (Comp. <a href="/jeremiah/7-18.htm" title="The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.">Jeremiah 7:18</a>.)<p>Thus far, the prophet has seen in the different courts of the Temple the general image worship of the people, then the creature worship of their elders, and now the corrupt and debasing rites of their women.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, there sat women wailing for Tammuz.</span> The point of view is probably the same as that of ver. 3, but the women were apparently in the outer porch of it, as he has to be brought to the gate in order to see them.
