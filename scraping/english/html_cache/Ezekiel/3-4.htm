In the context of the prophetic books, God often speaks directly to His prophets, providing them with specific instructions. This divine communication underscores the authority and authenticity of the message Ezekiel is to deliver. It reflects the intimate relationship between God and His chosen messengers, a theme consistent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>Son of man</b><br>The term "son of man" is used frequently in the book of Ezekiel, appearing over 90 times. It emphasizes Ezekiel's humanity and his role as a representative of the people. This title distinguishes him from God, highlighting the contrast between divine and human nature. In the New Testament, "Son of Man" is a title Jesus often uses for Himself, linking His mission to the prophetic tradition and emphasizing His role as the representative of humanity.<p><b>go now to the house of Israel</b><br>Ezekiel is specifically sent to the "house of Israel," which refers to the people of Israel, God's chosen nation. At this time, the Israelites are in exile in Babylon, having been taken captive due to their disobedience and idolatry. This mission underscores God's continued concern and covenant relationship with Israel, despite their current state of judgment and exile. The phrase also highlights the geographical and historical context of the Babylonian exile, a pivotal event in Israel's history.<p><b>and speak My words to them</b><br>Ezekiel is commanded to deliver God's words, not his own. This emphasizes the role of the prophet as a mouthpiece for God, conveying divine messages with authority and fidelity. The phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's command and the responsibility of the prophet to accurately communicate God's will. This directive also connects to the broader biblical theme of prophecy, where God's words are delivered to His people through chosen individuals, often calling them to repentance and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Israel during their Babylonian exile.

Judgement and mercy travel together in His call.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And speak My words to them</b><p>&#8226; Ezekiel is not to innovate, embellish, or dilute; his sole task is to relay divine revelation verbatim (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase places the weight of the message on God&#8217;s authority, ensuring listeners know they contend with the LORD Himself, not mere opinion (<a href="/john/12-49.htm">John 12:49</a>).<p>&#8226; When God&#8217;s words are faithfully delivered, they work powerfully&#8212;either softening or hardening hearts (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/3-4.htm">Ezekiel 3:4</a> records a fourfold commission: God initiates, a humble human messenger receives the call, the target is God&#8217;s own people, and the content is God&#8217;s unaltered word.
