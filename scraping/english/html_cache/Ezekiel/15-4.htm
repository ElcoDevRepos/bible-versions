In the context of Ezekiel, the vine represents the people of Jerusalem, who have failed to fulfill their purpose. The imagery of being cast into the fire symbolizes judgment and destruction, a common theme in prophetic literature. The fire represents God's wrath and the consequences of Israel's unfaithfulness. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where fire is used as a metaphor for divine judgment, such as in <a href="/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15-16</a> and <a href="/malachi/4.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>.<p><b>The fire devours both ends,</b><br>The phrase illustrates the totality of the destruction. The fire consuming both ends signifies that the judgment is comprehensive and inescapable. This can be seen as a reflection of the complete devastation that would come upon Jerusalem due to their persistent idolatry and rebellion against God. The imagery of fire devouring is also found in other scriptures, such as in <a href="/amos/5-6.htm">Amos 5:6</a>, where it is used to describe the consuming nature of God's judgment.<p><b>and the middle is charred.</b><br>The charring of the middle indicates that even the core, the heart of the vine, is affected by the fire. This suggests that the judgment penetrates deeply, affecting the very essence of the people. It highlights the thoroughness of God's judgment, leaving nothing untouched. This can be compared to the refining process described in <a href="/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>, where fire is used to purify and test, though in this context, it is more about destruction than purification.<p><b>Can it be useful for anything?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the uselessness of the vine wood after it has been burned. It serves as a metaphor for the spiritual state of the people of Jerusalem, who have become unproductive and worthless in their covenant relationship with God. This idea of fruitlessness is echoed in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/john/15-6.htm">John 15:6</a>, where Jesus speaks of branches that do not remain in Him being thrown away and burned. The question challenges the reader to consider the consequences of failing to live up to God's calling and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is known for his vivid visions and symbolic actions.

Once fruitless, its wood is softer than even a cedar or oak; it cannot be reshaped into a useful tool or peg (<a href="/ezekiel/15-3.htm">Ezekiel 15:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord therefore treats fruitless Israel like fuel, a sobering parallel to earlier warnings: &#8220;Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-19.htm">Matthew 7:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The literal exile by Babylon is the &#8220;fire&#8221; that will consume them, fulfilling <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49&#8211;52</a> and foreshadowing future judgment on all who remain unrepentant (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The fire devours both ends</b><p>&#8226; The phrase pictures complete judgment&#8212;destruction beginning on one side (the city), reaching the other (the land), leaving nothing untouched.<p>&#8226; Historically, Nebuchadnezzar carried off captives in waves (<a href="/2_kings/24-10.htm">2 Kings 24:10&#8211;16</a>; 25:8&#8211;11), striking both &#8220;ends&#8221; of the nation.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, judgment reaches both leaders and common people (<a href="/jeremiah/25-18.htm">Jeremiah 25:18&#8211;26</a>). No one is exempt when covenant warnings are ignored (<a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus echoes this totality: &#8220;They will come from east and west&#8230; but the sons of the kingdom will be cast into the outer darkness&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/8-11.htm">Matthew 8:11&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the middle is charred</b><p>&#8226; Whatever remains after the first assaults is already scorched&#8212;weak, brittle, and unusable.<p>&#8226; This highlights the thoroughness of divine discipline: partial repentance cannot stand; the whole must be refined (<a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; The charred center also anticipates the remnant theology of Scripture&#8212;God preserves a believing core (<a href="/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>; <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>), yet even that remnant passes through fire to emerge purified (<a href="/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; For the believer today, trials test and refine faith, burning away self-reliance so that only what is Christlike endures (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Can it be useful for anything?</b><p>&#8226; The rhetorical question expects a firm &#8220;No,&#8221; reinforcing Judah&#8217;s lost usefulness because of persistent idolatry (<a href="/ezekiel/14-6.htm">Ezekiel 14:6&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus poses a similar question about salt that has lost its savor: &#8220;It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Fruitlessness invites judgment, but God&#8217;s purpose in exposing uselessness is restoration. After the fire, He will plant &#8220;a tender sprig&#8230; and it will bear fruit&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22-24</a>), pointing forward to Messiah and the new covenant (<a href="/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-8</a>).<p>&#8226; For the church, the warning is clear: abiding in Christ is the only path to lasting fruitfulness; apart from Him we &#8220;can do nothing&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/15-4.htm">Ezekiel 15:4</a> uses the imagery of vine wood&#8212;good only for burning&#8212;to announce God&#8217;s righteous judgment on a fruitless people. The fire that devours both ends and chars the middle depicts Babylon&#8217;s comprehensive assault and God&#8217;s total dealing with sin. Yet even in this severe picture, the Lord&#8217;s goal is redemptive: He burns away the useless so that a purified remnant can display His glory. The passage urges every believer to remain in Christ, bear fruit worthy of repentance, and thus avoid the fate of wood fit only for the flames.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/15-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">No,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it is cast</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(nit&#183;tan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">into the fire</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124;
