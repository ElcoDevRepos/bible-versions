It was a significant trading center known for its caravans and commerce. The mention of Dedan highlights the extensive trade network that Tyre, the subject of <a href="/ezekiel/27.htm">Ezekiel 27</a>, had established. Dedan's involvement as a client indicates a relationship where Dedan provided goods or services in exchange for Tyre's offerings. This reflects the economic dependencies and alliances that were common in the ancient Near East. Dedan is also mentioned in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/isaiah/21-13.htm">Isaiah 21:13</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>, indicating its continued relevance in regional trade and politics.<p><b>many coastlands were your market;</b><br>The reference to "many coastlands" underscores Tyre's far-reaching influence and trade connections across the Mediterranean and beyond. Tyre was a prominent Phoenician city known for its maritime prowess, and its ships traveled to various coastal regions, establishing trade routes and markets. This phrase suggests that Tyre's economic reach extended to numerous distant lands, making it a central hub in the ancient world. The coastlands could include regions such as Cyprus, Crete, and other parts of the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas, emphasizing the city's strategic importance in international trade.<p><b>they paid you with ivory tusks and ebony.</b><br>Ivory and ebony were luxury items highly prized in the ancient world. Ivory, often sourced from elephants, was used for crafting intricate carvings, inlays, and other decorative items. Ebony, a dense black hardwood, was valued for its beauty and durability, often used in fine furniture and artistic works. The payment in such luxury goods indicates the wealth and opulence associated with Tyre's trade. This exchange of high-value items reflects the prosperity and affluence of Tyre, as well as the demand for exotic and rare materials in ancient markets. The mention of these specific goods highlights the city's role in the distribution of luxury commodities across the region.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/dedan.htm">Dedan</a></b><br>An ancient trading community, likely located in the Arabian Peninsula.

The term conveys ongoing, structured trade, not casual bartering (cf. <a href="/isaiah/21-13.htm">Isaiah 21:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>).<p>- The verse underscores Tyre&#8217;s magnetism: even distant desert traders came to her, highlighting the city&#8217;s pride that later draws divine judgment (<a href="/ezekiel/28-5.htm">Ezekiel 28:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>many coastlands were your market</b><p>- &#8220;Coastlands&#8221; stretches the scene beyond Arabia to the islands and seaports of the Mediterranean (<a href="/isaiah/42-4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/47-4.htm">Jeremiah 47:4</a>).<p>- Tyre functioned like an international marketplace, centralizing goods from Phoenicia, Greece, Cyprus, and beyond (<a href="/ezekiel/27-3.htm">Ezekiel 27:3</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s prophetic spotlight reveals the breadth of human achievement&#8212;and its vulnerability when divorced from humble dependence on Him (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they paid you with ivory tusks and ebony</b><p>- Payment in luxury goods shows Tyre dealt at the highest economic tier.

The tribe was located in Arabia, probably upon the shores of the Persian Gulf (<a href="/isaiah/21-13.htm" title="The burden on Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall you lodge, O you traveling companies of Dedanim.">Isaiah 21:13</a>). The Dedan of <a href="/ezekiel/27-20.htm" title="Dedan was your merchant in precious clothes for chariots.">Ezekiel 27:20</a>, on the other hand, is a Semitic tribe, spoken of also in <a href="/ezekiel/25-13.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out my hand on Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.">Ezekiel 25:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-8.htm" title="Flee you, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau on him, the time that I will visit him.">Jeremiah 49:8</a>. The "many isles" of this Dedan were the islands in the Persian Gulf, on the Arabian coast, and they were "merchandise" in the sense of supplying material for the commerce of Tyre. "Brought thee for a present" might seem to imply tribute, but the original rather conveys the idea of return payment. "Horns of ivory" is, literally, <span class= "ital">horns of teeth;</span> the name "horn" being simply a commercial term derived from the shape of the elephant's tusk. "Ebony" is a word used only here.

So the ships of Solomon and Hiram - ships of Tarshish (name used generically for merchant-vessels) - brought ivory among their other imports, starting from Ezion-Geber (<a href="/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>). Ebony came from Ethiopia and India. Virgil, indeed, names the latter country as the only region which produced it ('Georg.,' 2:115). Ceylon is at present one of the chief sources of supply.
