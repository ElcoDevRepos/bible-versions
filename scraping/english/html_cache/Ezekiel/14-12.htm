In the context of Ezekiel's ministry, this underscores the authority and authenticity of the message. The phrase "word of the LORD" is a common biblical expression indicating a prophetic message, often associated with judgment or instruction. This communication reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God speaks through prophets to guide, warn, or correct His people. The phrase also connects to other instances in the Bible where God speaks to prophets, such as <a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4</a> and <a href="/isaiah/38-4.htm">Isaiah 38:4</a>, highlighting the continuity of God's revelation throughout the Old Testament. The use of "LORD" in all capitals signifies the translation of the Hebrew name Yahweh, the covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature. This phrase sets the stage for the subsequent message, which often involves themes of judgment, repentance, and restoration, central to Ezekiel's prophetic role.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of God's messages, tasked with delivering them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who communicates His will and judgments through His prophets.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom Ezekiel is prophesying, currently in exile due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period during which the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, serving as a backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_revelation.htm">Prophetic Revelation</a></b><br>The event of God revealing His word to Ezekiel, emphasizing the seriousness of Israel's sin and the impending judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br><a href="/ezekiel/14-12.htm">Ezekiel 14:12</a> reminds us that sin has serious consequences, and God communicates His displeasure through His prophets.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The passage underscores God's control over nations and His right to judge them according to His righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophets.htm">The Role of Prophets</a></b><br>Prophets like Ezekiel serve as God's mouthpieces, delivering messages that call for repentance and warn of judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_need_for_repentance.htm">The Need for Repentance</a></b><br>Just as Israel was called to turn from their wicked ways, we too must examine our lives and repent of sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Despite the judgment, God's communication through Ezekiel shows His ongoing relationship with His people and His desire for their restoration.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_14_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 14:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_14_12_National_sin_s_impact.htm">How does Ezekiel 14:12 highlight the consequences of national sin?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_14_12_Personal_responsibility.htm">What role does personal responsibility play in Ezekiel 14:12's message?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_14_12_s_role_in_national_prayer.htm">How can Ezekiel 14:12 guide us in praying for our nation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_14_12_vs_2_Chron_7_14_Repentance.htm">Compare Ezekiel 14:12 with 2 Chronicles 7:14 regarding national repentance.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_14_12_s_relevance_today.htm">How can we apply Ezekiel 14:12 to our community's spiritual health today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_14_12_historical_context.htm">What is the historical context of Ezekiel 14:12 in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_14_12_God_s_judgment_on_nations.htm">How does Ezekiel 14:12 reflect God's judgment on nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_14_12_theological_themes.htm">What theological themes are present in Ezekiel 14:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ezekiel_14.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ezekiel 14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_dictation_theory.htm">What is the Dictation Theory of biblical inspiration?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_maher-shalal-hash-baz_mean.htm">What does Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_ezekiel_24_1-2_date_the_siege.htm">How can Ezekiel 24:1-2 precisely date Nebuchadnezzar's siege of Jerusalem, and does historical evidence align with this exact day?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/honor_parents_or_not_(ex._20_12_vs._lk._14_26).htm">Should we honor our parents?

Taken together, the verse reminds us that every passage of Scripture is God&#8217;s authoritative, personal, actionable communication, calling us to listen, trust, and obey.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-14.</span> - A new section begins, implying as before an interval of silence. What follows presents a striking parallelism to <a href="/jeremiah/15.htm">Jeremiah 15</a>:l, 2. There also we have the "four sore judgments," the declaration that not even the presence of Moses and Samuel would avail to save the people. They were obviously selected by Jeremiah as examples of the power of intercession (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11, 12</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/7-9.htm">1 Samuel 7:9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/12-23.htm">1 Samuel 12:23</a>). Ezekiel's selection of names proceeds on a different footing. He chooses exceptional instances of saintliness that had been powerless to save the generation in which they lived; perhaps, also, such as were well known, not only in the records of Israel, but among other nations. Noah had not saved the evil race before the Flood; Job had not saved his sons (<a href="/job/1-18.htm">Job 1:18</a>); Daniel, though high in the king's favour, had not been able to influence Nebuchadnezzar to spare the people of Judah and Jerusalem. The mention of this last name is significant, as showing the reputation which even then Daniel had acquired. There is no shadow of evidence for the view of some commentators that an older Daniel is referred to. Had there been such a person, eminent enough to be grouped with Noah and Job, there would surely have been some mention of him in the Old Testament.
