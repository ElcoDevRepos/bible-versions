The "land of the living" refers to the world of the living as opposed to the realm of the dead. This judgment is a divine act meant to instill fear and demonstrate God's sovereignty. The terror spread by God is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where God's power is shown through acts that cause nations to tremble (<a href="/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19-21</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15-29</a>). It serves as a warning to those who oppose God's will.<p><b>so that Pharaoh and all his multitude</b><br>Pharaoh represents the epitome of earthly power and pride, often seen as a symbol of opposition to God. The multitude refers to the Egyptian army and people who followed Pharaoh. Historically, Egypt was a dominant power, and its downfall would have been a significant event. This prophecy against Pharaoh is part of a series of oracles against Egypt (Ezekiel 29-32), highlighting the futility of relying on human strength and alliances instead of God.<p><b>will be laid to rest among the uncircumcised</b><br>Being laid to rest among the uncircumcised signifies disgrace and dishonor. In the ancient Near East, circumcision was a sign of covenant and belonging to God's people (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). To be buried with the uncircumcised was to be associated with those outside the covenant, indicating judgment and separation from God's favor. This imagery underscores the ultimate humiliation and defeat of Egypt, aligning with other prophecies where nations are judged and found wanting (<a href="/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9-11</a>).<p><b>with those slain by the sword</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the violent and definitive nature of God's judgment. The sword is a common biblical symbol for divine judgment and warfare (<a href="/jeremiah/25-31.htm">Jeremiah 25:31</a>, <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>). It indicates that Pharaoh and his multitude will meet a violent end, similar to other nations and peoples who opposed God. This serves as a reminder of the consequences of defying God's authority and the certainty of His justice.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD.</b><br>This declaration affirms the authority and certainty of the prophecy. The use of "Lord GOD" (Adonai Yahweh) emphasizes God's sovereignty and covenantal relationship with His people. It assures the audience that the prophecy is not merely a human prediction but a divine decree that will surely come to pass. This phrase is a common conclusion in prophetic literature, reinforcing the reliability and seriousness of God's word (<a href="/ezekiel/17-24.htm">Ezekiel 17:24</a>, <a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
