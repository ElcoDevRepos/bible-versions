The disgrace refers to the shame and humiliation experienced due to their sins and subsequent exile. In biblical context, disgrace often results from disobedience to God (<a href="/jeremiah/3-25.htm">Jeremiah 3:25</a>). The promise of forgetting disgrace suggests a complete renewal and forgiveness, aligning with God's covenant faithfulness (<a href="/isaiah/54-4.htm">Isaiah 54:4</a>).<p><b>and all the treachery they committed against Me</b><br>Treachery against God includes idolatry and breaking the covenant, as seen throughout Israel's history (<a href="/ezekiel/20-27.htm">Ezekiel 20:27</a>). This phrase underscores the gravity of their sin, yet also highlights God's mercy in offering forgiveness. The treachery is a reminder of the need for repentance and the transformative power of God's grace (<a href="/hosea/14.htm">Hosea 14:1-4</a>).<p><b>when they dwell securely in their land</b><br>This security in the land is a fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). Historically, Israel's security was often threatened by surrounding nations. The prophetic vision here points to a time of peace and stability, possibly during the Messianic age, when Christ reigns as the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>).<p><b>with no one to frighten them</b><br>The absence of fear signifies divine protection and peace, reminiscent of the promises in <a href="/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>. This assurance of safety contrasts with Israel's past experiences of invasion and exile. It reflects the ultimate peace found in God's kingdom, where Christ's victory over sin and death ensures eternal security for His people (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The primary subject of this prophecy, representing the people of God who have experienced disgrace and treachery but are promised restoration and security.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this passage, who promises to restore Israel and remove their disgrace.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/disgrace_and_treachery.htm">Disgrace and Treachery</a></b><br>Refers to the sins and unfaithfulness of Israel against God, which led to their exile and suffering.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/security_in_the_land.htm">Security in the Land</a></b><br>The future promise of peace and safety for Israel, indicating a time of restoration and divine favor.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message, serving as a mediator of God's promises and warnings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_restoration.htm">God's Faithfulness in Restoration</a></b><br>Despite Israel's past sins, God promises restoration, highlighting His faithfulness and mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Israel's disgrace and treachery serve as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_promise_of_security.htm">The Promise of Security</a></b><br>God's promise of dwelling securely reflects His ultimate plan for peace and safety for His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/forgetting_past_disgrace.htm">Forgetting Past Disgrace</a></b><br>The assurance that past sins will be forgotten encourages believers to seek forgiveness and embrace God's grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_god's_promises.htm">Living in God's Promises</a></b><br>Believers are called to live in the security and peace that come from trusting in God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_39_26_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 39:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_39_26_Israel_s_restoration_plan.htm">How does Ezekiel 39:26 reveal God's plan for Israel's restoration and forgiveness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_39_26_God_s_assured_protection.htm">What does "dwell securely" in Ezekiel 39:26 imply about God's protection?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Using_shame_repentance_in_daily_life.htm">How can we apply the lesson of shame and repentance in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_39_26_and_God_s_covenant_link.htm">How does Ezekiel 39:26 connect with God's covenant promises in the Old Testament?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Ezekiel_39_26_inspire_trust_today.htm">In what ways does Ezekiel 39:26 encourage trust in God's faithfulness today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_39_26_on_God_s_forgiveness.htm">What does Ezekiel 39:26 reveal about God's forgiveness after Israel's shame and unfaithfulness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_39_26_in_Israel_s_restoration.htm">How does Ezekiel 39:26 fit into the broader context of Israel's restoration?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_events_does_Ezekiel_39_26_reference.htm">What historical events might Ezekiel 39:26 be referencing regarding Israel's past shame?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ezekiel_39.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ezekiel 39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_a_new_heart_from_god.htm">What does receiving a new heart from God mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/does_jer._5_10_contradict_ex._19_5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:10 -
