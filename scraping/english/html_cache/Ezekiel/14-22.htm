The concept of a remnant is seen throughout Scripture, such as in the stories of Noah's family during the flood and the Israelites who returned from Babylonian exile. This remnant serves as a sign of hope and continuity of God's covenant promises.<p><b>sons and daughters who will be brought out.</b><br>The mention of "sons and daughters" emphasizes the continuation of the community and the preservation of future generations. In the context of ancient Israel, lineage and family were crucial for maintaining tribal identity and inheritance rights. This phrase also suggests divine intervention, as God ensures the survival and deliverance of these individuals from the impending judgment.<p><b>They will come out to you,</b><br>This indicates a movement towards the prophet Ezekiel, who was in exile in Babylon. The survivors coming to Ezekiel symbolize the gathering of the faithful and the restoration of communication between God and His people. It also highlights Ezekiel's role as a mediator and a source of divine insight for the exiles.<p><b>and when you see their conduct and actions,</b><br>The conduct and actions of the survivors serve as a testimony to their faithfulness and repentance. This reflects the biblical principle that true faith is demonstrated through righteous living, as seen in <a href="/james/2-18.htm">James 2:18</a>, which emphasizes that faith without works is dead. The survivors' behavior would be a visible sign of their transformation and alignment with God's will.<p><b>you will be comforted regarding the disaster I have brought upon Jerusalem&#8212;</b><br>The comfort comes from witnessing the faithfulness and survival of the remnant, which reassures Ezekiel and the exiles of God's ongoing plan and mercy. Despite the severe judgment on Jerusalem, the presence of a remnant signifies hope and the possibility of restoration. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of redemption following judgment.<p><b>all that I have brought upon it.</b><br>This phrase underscores God's sovereignty and justice in executing judgment upon Jerusalem. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of sin and disobedience, as well as the fulfillment of prophetic warnings given by Ezekiel and other prophets.

The certainty of judgment in verses 13-21 is matched by the certainty of grace that now breaks through.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Some survivors will be left in it</b><p>- Despite the sweeping sword, famine, wild beasts, and plague (<a href="/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>), God preserves a remnant.<p>- This echoes His earlier promise: &#8220;Yet I will leave a remnant, for some of you will escape the sword&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/6-8.htm">Ezekiel 6:8</a>).<p>- The idea of a preserved remnant runs throughout Scripture&#8212;see <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>; <a href="/romans/9-27.htm">Romans 9:27</a>; 11:5. God&#8217;s holiness demands judgment, yet His covenant love ensures that judgment never wipes Israel out entirely.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Sons and daughters who will be brought out</b><p>- The survivors are described as &#8220;sons and daughters,&#8221; indicating literal descendants. God is not merely rescuing anonymous adults; He is preserving family lines.<p>- Jeremiah foresaw this, promising that God would &#8220;build them up and not tear them down&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/24-6.htm">Jeremiah 24:6</a>). Even after catastrophe, future generations remain in His plan.<p>- Their being &#8220;brought out&#8221; shows God&#8217;s direct action, just as He once brought Israel out of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-51.htm">Exodus 12:51</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will come out to you</b><p>- &#8220;You&#8221; refers to the exiles already in Babylon, including Ezekiel himself (<a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1-3</a>).<p>- Survivors of Jerusalem&#8217;s fall will eventually arrive in Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/25-11.htm">2 Kings 25:11-12</a>). Their arrival closes the gap between those already judged and those whose judgment was still pending when Ezekiel spoke.<p>- This reunion verifies every earlier prophecy and cements community identity outside the land (<a href="/ezekiel/11-16.htm">Ezekiel 11:16-17</a>; 37:21).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When you see their conduct and actions</b><p>- The exiles will observe firsthand how these newcomers live.

Their transformed lives will demonstrate the effectiveness of God&#8217;s discipline and will comfort the people who mourned the city&#8217;s destruction. The verse teaches that every act of divine judgment is purposeful, ultimately advancing both God&#8217;s justice and His mercy, and assuring His people that His plans for them remain good and certain.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Ye shall be comforted concerning the evil.</span>--In this and the following verse it is promised that a remnant shall be brought from Jerusalem; and it is clearly implied that they shall come to Babylonia. There the present exiles shall see them, and thus be comforted. But in what sense comforted? The connection absolutely decides this: "when ye see their ways and their doings, ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it." That is, when you see the wickedness, of this remnant, you will cease to mourn over the judgment, for you cannot but perceive that it was a righteous act of God. The expression "sons and daughters" is used in <a href="/ezekiel/14-22.htm" title="Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth to you, and you shall see their way and their doings: and you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought on it.">Ezekiel 14:22</a> with reference to the same phrase in <a href="/ezekiel/14-16.htm" title="Though these three men were in it, as I live, said the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.">Ezekiel 14:16</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/14-18.htm" title="Though these three men were in it, as I live, said the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.">Ezekiel 14:18</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/14-20.htm" title="Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, said the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.">Ezekiel 14:20</a>; and the form "they shall comfort you" in <a href="/ezekiel/14-23.htm" title="And they shall comfort you, when you see their ways and their doings: and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 14:23</a> is explained by what is said in <a href="/ezekiel/14-22.htm" title="Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth to you, and you shall see their way and their doings: and you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought on it.">Ezekiel 14:22</a>, not as meaning "they shall administer comfort," but "they shall be a cause of comfort" by showing you their exceeding wickedness. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - The words end with a gleam of hope shining through the judgments. For Ezekiel, as for Isaiah, there is the thought of a "remnant that shall return" (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>). It has been questioned whether "the ways and the doings" which are to bring comfort to men's minds are those of the evil past or of the subsequent repentance. I incline to the view that they include both. Men should see at once the severity and the goodness of Jehovah. His punishments had not been arbitrary nor excessive. They had also been as a discipline leading men to repentance. In each of those facts there was a ground of comfort for men who asked the question, which Abraham asked of old, "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" (<a href="/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>). In either aspect men will recognize that God has not done without cause all that he has done. In this way the prophet seeks, as others have done since, to justify the ways of God to man. Ezekiel's word for "remnant" is, it may be noted, not the same as Isaiah's, its primary significance being "these that <span class="accented">escape</span>." Ezekiel does not quote the earlier prophet, though his thoughts are in harmony with him. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/14-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Yet, behold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
