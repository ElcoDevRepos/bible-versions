These individuals claimed to receive divine revelations, but their visions were not from God. Historically, false prophets were prevalent during times of crisis, offering false hope and misleading the people. This phrase highlights the spiritual deception that was rampant in Israel, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>, where God warns against listening to the words of false prophets.<p><b>and speak lying divinations.</b><br>Lying divinations involve the practice of predicting the future or revealing hidden knowledge through means not sanctioned by God. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, divination was common, often involving rituals or omens. However, God explicitly forbade such practices in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>. The false prophets in Ezekiel's time were using these methods to deceive the people, claiming divine authority for their messages, which were actually lies.<p><b>They claim, &#8216;Thus declares the LORD,&#8217;</b><br>This phrase indicates the false prophets' audacity in using God's name to lend credibility to their messages. By claiming divine authority, they sought to manipulate and control the people. This misuse of God's name is a direct violation of the commandment in <a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>, which warns against taking the Lord's name in vain. The false prophets' claims were a serious offense, as they misrepresented God's will and led the people astray.<p><b>when the LORD did not send them;</b><br>The true test of a prophet is whether they are sent by God, as seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/14-14.htm">Jeremiah 14:14-15</a>. The false prophets in Ezekiel's time were not commissioned by God, yet they presumed to speak on His behalf. This highlights the importance of discerning true prophetic messages, as emphasized in 1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>, which instructs believers to test the spirits to see whether they are from God.<p><b>yet they wait for the fulfillment of their message.</b><br>Despite their falsehoods, the false prophets anticipated that their predictions would come true. This reflects a common human tendency to hope for validation, even when one's actions are deceitful. The fulfillment of a prophetic message is a key indicator of its divine origin, as stated in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-21.htm">Deuteronomy 18:21-22</a>. The false prophets' expectation of fulfillment underscores their delusion and the danger of self-deception.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_prophets.htm">False Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals in Israel who claimed to speak for God but delivered messages that were not from Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom Ezekiel was prophesying, particularly those in exile in Babylon.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, a significant context for Ezekiel's prophecies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God of Israel, who is being misrepresented by the false prophets.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_prophecy.htm">Discernment in Prophecy</a></b><br>Believers must exercise discernment when evaluating those who claim to speak for God.

It may be that in this case the prophets and prophetesses were untrue to their own convictions, and wilfully declared what they knew to be false; or it may be that they simply uttered as God's message that which they had persuaded themselves would be the issue. This point is not entirely clear from the passage, and is of secondary importance. What deserves to be carefully noted is the difference here made between subjective views of truth--that which conies "out of their own heart"--and those objective communications which God gave to His true prophets. This distinction has a most important bearing upon the whole subject of revelation, and establishes clearly the fact that the Scriptures look upon it as something expressly communicated to their writers, and not as a thing which could be the result of their own thought and reflection. He, therefore, who puts "Thus saith the Lord" before that which God has not in some objective way made known <span class= "ital">to</span> him, must fall under the condemnation pronounced here and elsewhere upon "the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak" (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm" title="But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.">Deuteronomy 18:20</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord saith.</span> The verb is that specially used for the utterance of prophets, and the deceivers used it without the authority of a true mission. <span class="cmt_word">For they have made others</span> (or, <span class="accented">men</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>to hope,</span> etc., as in the Authorized Version and Revised Version, read, with the margin of Revised Version, <span class="accented">they hope to confirm their word</span>, taking the verb as in <a href="/psalms/119-43.htm">Psalm 119:43, 49</a>; <a href="/job/6-11.htm">Job 6:11</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>).
