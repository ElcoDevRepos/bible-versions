An ephah is a unit of dry measure, approximately 22 liters or 0.6 bushels, indicating a substantial offering. The bull, often used in sacrifices, symbolizes strength and atonement for the community's sins. This offering reflects the importance of giving from one's resources to honor God, paralleling the sacrificial system outlined in Leviticus.<p><b>an ephah with the ram</b><br>The ram, used in various Old Testament sacrifices, represents leadership and substitutionary atonement. The consistent measure of an ephah for both the bull and the ram underscores the uniformity and fairness in offerings, emphasizing that all sacrifices, regardless of the animal, require a significant grain offering. This practice aligns with the sacrificial laws in <a href="/numbers/15.htm">Numbers 15</a>, where grain offerings accompany animal sacrifices.<p><b>and as much as he is able with the lambs</b><br>This phrase introduces flexibility, allowing the offerer to give according to their means. The lamb, often associated with innocence and purity, is a common sacrificial animal. This provision highlights God's understanding and accommodation of individual circumstances, reminiscent of the widow's mite in <a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>, where the heart and intent behind the offering are valued over the amount.<p><b>along with a hin of oil per ephah</b><br>A hin is a liquid measure, approximately 3.7 liters or 1 gallon. Oil, often symbolizing the Holy Spirit and anointing, is mixed with the grain offering, enhancing its value and significance. The combination of oil and grain in offerings is a recurring theme in Levitical law, symbolizing the blending of divine presence with human dedication. This practice points to the holistic nature of worship, involving both material and spiritual elements.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.
