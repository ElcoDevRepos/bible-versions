The prince, representing leadership, is warned against abusing power for personal gain, reflecting the biblical theme of justice and righteousness in leadership (<a href="/proverbs/29-4.htm">Proverbs 29:4</a>). Historically, this was significant in a time when rulers often seized land, leading to social injustice. Theologically, it underscores God's concern for the vulnerable and His desire for leaders to act with integrity.<p><b>He is to provide an inheritance for his sons from his own property,</b><br>This instruction ensures that the prince's family is provided for without infringing on the rights of others. It reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, where leaders are to manage their resources responsibly (<a href="/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4-5</a>). The concept of inheritance is significant in Scripture, symbolizing continuity and blessing (<a href="/genesis/48-21.htm">Genesis 48:21-22</a>). This also prefigures the eternal inheritance believers receive through Christ, who provides for His own without taking from others (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).<p><b>so that none of My people will be displaced from his property.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This final phrase highlights God's protective care over His people, ensuring their stability and security. Displacement was a serious issue in ancient times, often leading to poverty and loss of identity. The phrase echoes the Jubilee laws, which aimed to prevent permanent loss of family land (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>). It also points to the eschatological hope of a restored Israel, where God's people will dwell securely in their land (<a href="/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>). In a broader sense, it foreshadows the New Testament promise of believers' eternal home in the Kingdom of God (<a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prince.htm">The Prince</a></b><br>A leader or ruler in Israel, possibly a future messianic figure or a representative of the Davidic line, responsible for just governance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The Israelites, God's chosen people, who are to be protected from unjust loss of their inheritance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/inheritance.htm">Inheritance</a></b><br>The land and property allotted to the tribes of Israel, symbolizing God's promise and provision.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_the_prince.htm">Sons of the Prince</a></b><br>The descendants of the prince, who are to receive their inheritance from their father's property.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/property.htm">Property</a></b><br>The land and possessions that belong to the people, which should not be unjustly taken by the prince.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/justice_in_leadership.htm">Justice in Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders are called to act justly and protect the rights of the people, ensuring that their actions do not lead to the oppression or disenfranchisement of others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_inheritance.htm">Respect for Inheritance</a></b><br>The inheritance given by God is sacred and should be respected.

The Spirit insists that this ruler respect the God-given boundaries of every Israelite family. Scripture repeatedly upholds property as a sacred trust:<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-14.htm">Deuteronomy 19:14</a>; 27:17 warn against moving boundary stones.<p>&#8226; Naboth&#8217;s vineyard shows the tragedy of royal seizure (<a href="/bsb/1_kings/21.htm">1 Kings 21</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/22-28.htm">Proverbs 22:28</a> calls tampering with ancient landmarks wrong.<p>God&#8217;s intent is clear: righteous leadership must never abuse power for personal expansion. The parcel of land allotted to each tribe and clan (<a href="/bsb/joshua/13.htm">Joshua 13&#8211;21</a>) remains inviolable because &#8220;the land is Mine&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>). Any act of eviction would violate both divine ownership and covenant order.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He is to provide an inheritance for his sons from his own property</b><p>The prince may pass on wealth, but only from what is legitimately his. Scripture honors parents who store up for their children (<a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-14.htm">2 Corinthians 12:14</a>), yet always within moral bounds. King David modeled this by giving Solomon temple materials from his personal treasury (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-14.htm">1 Chronicles 22:14-16</a>). The directive in Ezekiel separates prudent provision from predatory acquisition. Practical implications:<p>&#8226; Rulers must budget and plan instead of exploiting citizens.<p>&#8226; Fathers teach responsibility by earning before bequeathing.<p>&#8226; Generational blessing flows through honest labor, not coercion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that none of My people will be displaced from his property</b><p>The closing clause reveals God&#8217;s pastoral heart. He refuses to see His covenant people uprooted. This mirrors:<p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/25-24.htm">Leviticus 25:24-28</a>&#8212;Jubilee safeguards return every parcel.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8</a>&#8212;God condemns those who &#8220;add house to house.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1-2</a>&#8212;judgment falls on land-grabbers.<p>Land, livelihood, and lineage intertwine in the biblical worldview; to displace a family is to wound their future. By commanding the prince to restrain himself, God secures social stability and displays His justice. The promise of the coming kingdom therefore includes economic peace alongside spiritual renewal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/46-18.htm">Ezekiel 46:18</a> literally instructs the future prince to honor private property, fund his heirs from his own estate, and protect every family&#8217;s inheritance. The verse affirms God&#8217;s ownership of the land, limits governmental power, and guarantees that ordinary people will dwell securely under righteous rule.
