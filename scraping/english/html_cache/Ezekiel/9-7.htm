In the context of Ezekiel, God is speaking to the executioners, often interpreted as angelic beings or agents of divine judgment. This reflects the biblical theme of God&#8217;s sovereignty and His right to judge sin.<p><b>&#8220;Defile the temple</b><br>The temple, considered the holiest place in Israel, was the center of worship and God's dwelling among His people. To defile it signifies a profound judgment, as the temple was meant to be pure and sacred. This act symbolizes the extent of Israel's sin and the resulting separation from God. Historically, the defilement of sacred spaces was a sign of divine abandonment, as seen in the destruction of the temple by the Babylonians.<p><b>and fill the courts with the slain.</b><br>The courts of the temple were areas where people gathered for worship and sacrifices. Filling them with the slain indicates a complete reversal of their intended purpose, turning a place of life and worship into one of death and judgment. This imagery underscores the severity of Israel's idolatry and moral corruption, which led to such drastic divine action.<p><b>Go forth!&#8221;</b><br>This command to "go forth" emphasizes the immediacy and inevitability of the judgment. It reflects the urgency of God's decree and the swift execution of His will. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God sending His messengers to carry out His purposes, whether in judgment or salvation.<p><b>So they went out and began killing throughout the city.</b><br>This action represents the fulfillment of God's judgment on Jerusalem, a city that had turned away from Him. The historical context is the impending Babylonian invasion, which would lead to the city's destruction. This event serves as a warning of the consequences of persistent sin and rebellion against God. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment at the end of times, as described in Revelation, where God will judge the world in righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the vision of judgment in chapter 9.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The holy place in Jerusalem, central to Jewish worship, which is defiled as part of God's judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_executioners.htm">The Executioners</a></b><br>Agents of God's judgment, tasked with carrying out the divine decree to slay those marked for destruction.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city_of_jerusalem.htm">The City of Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of the vision, representing the center of Jewish life and worship, now subject to divine judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_glory_of_the_lord.htm">The Glory of the Lord</a></b><br>The presence of God, which departs from the temple, signifying the severity of the judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin, especially within the community of believers, is taken seriously by God.

The verse underscores three truths: God&#8217;s holiness cannot coexist with unrepentant sin, His judgments are carried out exactly as spoken, and only those marked by genuine faith are spared.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Defile the house.</span>--The utmost possible pollution under the Mosaic economy was the touch of a dead body.

And Joab fled to the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.">1Kings 2:28-31</a>), but in this case the very defilement itself was a part of the judgment, since God was about to forsake His sanctuary, and give over even this to the desolations of the heathen.
