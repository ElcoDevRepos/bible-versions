In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38</a>, it is directed towards Gog, a leader of a coalition of nations. The command to "get ready" suggests a divine orchestration of events, where God is sovereignly guiding the actions of nations. This echoes other biblical instances where God prepares individuals or nations for His purposes, such as in <a href="/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10-11</a>, where the Israelites are told to prepare to meet God at Mount Sinai.<p><b>prepare yourself,</b><br>The emphasis on personal preparation highlights the responsibility of the leader, Gog, to ready himself for the role he will play in the unfolding events. This preparation is not just physical but also strategic, as Gog is to lead a coalition against Israel. The idea of preparation is a recurring biblical theme, seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>, where believers are instructed to put on the full armor of God, indicating spiritual readiness.<p><b>you and all your company gathered around you;</b><br>This phrase refers to the coalition of nations that Gog will lead. The "company" includes various peoples and nations, as detailed earlier in <a href="/ezekiel/38-5.htm">Ezekiel 38:5-6</a>, such as Persia, Cush, and Put. This gathering of a multinational force against Israel is significant in biblical prophecy, symbolizing a united opposition to God's people. The gathering of nations is reminiscent of other prophetic scriptures, such as <a href="/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2</a>, where God gathers nations for judgment in the Valley of Jehoshaphat.<p><b>you will be their guard.</b><br>Gog is appointed as the protector or leader of this coalition, indicating a position of authority and responsibility. The term "guard" suggests a military role, where Gog is to oversee and direct the forces. This mirrors the role of a shepherd or leader, a concept seen throughout scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where God is depicted as a shepherd. In a prophetic sense, Gog's role as a guard is part of God's larger plan, where even opposition to His people ultimately serves His divine purposes, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile. He is the author of the book and the one delivering God's message.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gog.htm">Gog</a></b><br>A leader or figure mentioned in the prophecy, often interpreted as a symbol of future enemies of God's people. The identity of Gog is debated, but he represents opposition to God's plans.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/magog.htm">Magog</a></b><br>A land or people associated with Gog. Historically, Magog is often linked to regions north of Israel, possibly representing distant nations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/company_gathered.htm">Company Gathered</a></b><br>Refers to the armies or nations that align with Gog.

It encourages trust in God's plan despite current circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_against_spiritual_enemies.htm">Guarding Against Spiritual Enemies</a></b><br>The role of a guard implies vigilance.

The phrase underscores the certainty of God&#8217;s timetable; Gog must align himself with what God has already decreed. Similar imperatives echo throughout Scripture, reminding nations that they cannot escape divine appointment:<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/46-14.htm">Jeremiah 46:14</a>: &#8220;Announce it in Egypt... &#8216;Take your positions and prepare, for the sword devours around you.&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/joel/3-9.htm">Joel 3:9</a>: &#8220;Proclaim this among the nations: &#8216;Prepare for war! Rouse the mighty men!&#8217;&#8221;<p>Each reference shows the Lord directing even hostile powers, proving that world events ultimately unfold under His sovereignty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>prepare yourself</b><p>The directive shifts from a general alert to a personal responsibility. Gog must marshal his own resolve, strategies, and resources, yet every step remains under God&#8217;s oversight (<a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30-31</a>). The verse drives home that human preparation never thwarts God&#8217;s will but fulfills it:<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>: &#8220;A horse is prepared for the day of battle, but victory is from the LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/8-10.htm">Isaiah 8:10</a>: &#8220;Devise a plan, but it will be thwarted; state a proposal, but it will not stand, for God is with us.&#8221;<p>Gog&#8217;s readiness, therefore, only advances the larger redemptive storyline the Lord has ordained.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you and all your company gathered around you</b><p>The prophecy widens to include the coalition listed in <a href="/ezekiel/38-5.htm">Ezekiel 38:5-6</a>&#8212;Persia, Cush, Put, Gomer, Beth-togarmah, and &#8220;many peoples.&#8221; This is not a symbolic crowd but real nations converging under Gog&#8217;s leadership. Scripture frequently pictures end-time alliances against Israel, all destined for judgment:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-2</a>: &#8220;Why do the nations rage... The kings of the earth take their stand, and the rulers gather together against the LORD and against His Anointed.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8-9</a> speaks of nations that &#8220;gather them for battle... and they marched across the broad expanse of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints.&#8221;<p>Ezekiel&#8217;s wording stresses how the invaders willingly assemble, unaware that God Himself is luring them into His final trap (<a href="/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you will be their guard</b><p>Gog is appointed commander and protector of this vast force, a mantle he embraces with pride. Yet the title &#8220;guard&#8221; hints at irony: while Gog thinks he shields his allies, the Lord alone determines their fate (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-7</a>). Key passages underscore God&#8217;s use of ambitious leaders to accomplish His purposes:<p>&#8226; <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>: &#8220;For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans...&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/micah/4-11.htm">Micah 4:11-12</a>: &#8220;Many nations have assembled against you... But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD.&#8221;<p>Gog&#8217;s guardianship ultimately becomes a snare; by leading the charge, he ushers his followers straight into divine judgment (<a href="/ezekiel/39-1.htm">Ezekiel 39:1-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/38-7.htm">Ezekiel 38:7</a> is a four-fold command from God to Gog: mobilize, brace, assemble your coalition, and assume command. Every verb highlights God&#8217;s absolute authority over global affairs. While Gog readies himself, he is unknowingly preparing for the Lord&#8217;s dramatic defense of Israel and the public display of His holiness before all nations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/38.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Be thou a guard unto them.--</span>Every preparation is to be made on the part of Gog and the nations, and then Gog himself is to be their guard, or to control and guide the assault.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/38-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Get ready;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hik&#183;k&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3559.htm">Strong's 3559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be erect</span><br /><br /><span class="word">prepare</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
