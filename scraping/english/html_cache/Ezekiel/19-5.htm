In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/19.htm">Ezekiel 19</a>, the "she" refers to the mother lioness, symbolizing the nation of Israel or specifically the royal line of Judah. The waiting in vain suggests the failed expectations of the leadership, possibly referring to the unfulfilled hopes placed in Jehoahaz, who was taken captive to Egypt. This reflects the broader theme of Israel's misplaced trust in political alliances and human leaders rather than in God.<p><b>that her hope was lost</b><br>The loss of hope signifies a turning point where the expectations for restoration or success through human means have been dashed. Historically, this can be linked to the period of the Babylonian exile, where the hopes for a return to former glory under a Davidic king seemed impossible. This loss of hope is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, emphasizing the need for reliance on God rather than earthly powers.<p><b>she took another of her cubs</b><br>The "another of her cubs" refers to another king from the line of David, likely Jehoiachin or Zedekiah, who were subsequent rulers after Jehoahaz. This action indicates the continued attempt to establish a strong leadership despite previous failures. The imagery of the lioness and her cubs is a powerful symbol of the Davidic dynasty, which was expected to be strong and dominant.<p><b>and made him a young lion</b><br>The transformation into a "young lion" suggests the preparation and empowerment of a new leader. In the biblical context, lions are often symbols of strength and royalty. This phrase indicates the hope that this new leader would embody the qualities of a strong and effective ruler. However, the historical outcome shows that these hopes were again unmet, as both Jehoiachin and Zedekiah faced defeat and exile. This reflects the prophetic message that true leadership and salvation would ultimately come through divine intervention, pointing forward to the messianic hope fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the Lion of the tribe of Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lioness.htm">The Lioness</a></b><br>Symbolic of the nation of Israel, particularly the royal line of Judah.
