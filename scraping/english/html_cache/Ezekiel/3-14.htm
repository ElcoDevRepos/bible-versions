The lifting up by the Spirit suggests a supernatural experience, similar to other prophetic experiences in the Bible, such as Elijah being taken up in a whirlwind (<a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>). The Spirit's involvement emphasizes God's control and guidance over the prophet's mission. This divine transportation is a recurring theme in Ezekiel's visions, highlighting the Spirit's role in revelation and prophecy.<p><b>and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit</b><br>Ezekiel's emotional state reflects the heavy burden of his prophetic calling. The bitterness and anger may stem from the difficult message he is tasked to deliver to a rebellious Israel (<a href="/ezekiel/2-3.htm">Ezekiel 2:3-5</a>). This emotional turmoil is reminiscent of other prophets, like Jeremiah, who also experienced deep anguish over the people's sin and impending judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7-9</a>). The prophet's personal struggle underscores the seriousness of the message and the resistance he anticipates from the people.<p><b>with the strong hand of the LORD upon me</b><br>The phrase "strong hand of the LORD" signifies God's powerful presence and support. This expression is often used to describe God's deliverance and guidance, as seen in the Exodus narrative where God's strong hand led the Israelites out of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/13-9.htm">Exodus 13:9</a>). For Ezekiel, this indicates divine empowerment and assurance, enabling him to fulfill his prophetic mission despite personal reluctance or opposition. The strong hand of the LORD ensures that Ezekiel's message will be delivered with authority and divine backing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

I writhe in pain&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Anger of my spirit&#8221; reflects holy indignation at Israel&#8217;s rebellion&#8212;similar to Jesus&#8217; &#8220;grieved at their hardness of heart&#8221; (<a href="/mark/3-5.htm">Mark 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine ministry often involves emotional weight; Ezekiel&#8217;s reaction proves he is not a detached messenger but one who shares God&#8217;s heart (<a href="/ezekiel/21-6.htm">Ezekiel 21:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with the strong hand of the LORD upon me</b><p>&#8226; Despite inner turmoil, Ezekiel is upheld: &#8220;the hand of the LORD was upon him there&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>; 37:1).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s hand both empowers and restrains&#8212;ensuring the prophet&#8217;s feelings do not derail his mission (compare <a href="/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a>, &#8220;the hand of the LORD came upon Elijah&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The phrase guarantees success: where God&#8217;s hand rests, His purpose stands (<a href="/acts/11-21.htm">Acts 11:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14</a> shows a Spirit-driven prophet carried to a hard assignment, wrestling with intense emotions, yet steadied by God&#8217;s mighty hand. The verse reassures believers that when the Spirit lifts, directs, and sustains, we can follow&#8212;even through bitterness&#8212;confident that His sovereign power will accomplish His will.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">I went in bitterness, in the heat of my </span>prophet now begins to realise the sorrow and the trial of the task laid upon him.

Compare the similar experience of Jeremiah (<a href="/context/jeremiah/20-8.htm" title="For since I spoke, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach to me, and a derision, daily.">Jeremiah 20:8-9</a>; see also <a href="/amos/3-8.htm" title="The lion has roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD has spoken, who can but prophesy?">Amos 3:8</a>), when in his discouragement he had almost resolved to refuse to declare God s message, but the word of the Lord was as a burning fire within, and he could not refrain--an experience which every faithful teacher in God's name is obliged, more or less fully, to pass through.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit lifted me up</span> (see note on ver. 12).

Elsewhere it is rendered as "wrath" (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>; <a href="/job/21-20.htm">Job 21:20</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-11.htm">Proverbs 15:11</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>), "fury" (<a href="/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>). Here probably it points to the conflict of emotions - indignation against the sins of his people, the dread of failure, the consciousness of unfitness. <span class="cmt_word">The hand of the Lord,</span> etc. The word for "strong" is the same as that which enters into Ezekiel's name. Taking this and ver. 9 into account, there seems sufficient reason for translating as the Vulgate does, <span class="accented">confortans</span> (so Luther, "held me firm"), at least for thinking of that meaning as implied (comp. <a href="/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a>; <a href="/ezra/8-18.htm">Ezra 8:18</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Nehemiah 2:8</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-18.htm">Daniel 10:18</a>). There was a sustaining power in spite of the "bitterness" and the "heat." In a more general sense, as in <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>, it is used as implying a special intensity of prophetic inspiration, as in the case of Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/3-15.htm">2 Kings 3:15</a>);
