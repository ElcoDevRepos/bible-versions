Prophets in the Old Testament were often given difficult tasks, yet their role was to faithfully deliver God's message. This obedience is reminiscent of other prophets like Jeremiah and Isaiah, who also spoke God's words despite personal cost. The act of prophesying as commanded underscores the importance of divine authority and the prophet's role as a mouthpiece for God. This obedience is a model for believers, emphasizing the importance of following God's directives even when the outcome is uncertain.<p><b>And as I prophesied, there was suddenly a noise, a rattling,</b><br>The noise and rattling signify the beginning of God's miraculous work. In the context of the vision, this represents the initial stages of restoration and revival. The suddenness of the noise highlights the power and immediacy of God's intervention. This can be connected to other biblical instances where God's presence is accompanied by sound, such as the thunder at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>) or the rushing wind at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-2.htm">Acts 2:2</a>). The rattling may symbolize the shaking of the current order, preparing for a new creation, much like the shaking of the earth in prophetic literature (<a href="/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6-7</a>).<p><b>and the bones came together, bone to bone.</b><br>This phrase illustrates the process of restoration and reassembly, symbolizing the reunification of the people of Israel. The imagery of bones coming together can be seen as a metaphor for the reconstitution of the nation, which had been scattered and lifeless. This vision is a powerful depiction of hope and renewal, promising that God can bring life to what was once dead. Theologically, it points to the resurrection power of God, foreshadowing the ultimate resurrection through Jesus Christ. The meticulous joining of bone to bone suggests a divine order and purpose, reflecting the intricate design of God's plan for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, Ezekiel is the central figure in this passage.

The sudden noise, the rattling, and the orderly rejoining of bones assure us that no situation is beyond His reach. He still shakes what is dry and hopeless, realigns it &#8220;bone to bone,&#8221; and prepares it for the breath of His Spirit, proving that His promises to Israel&#8212;and to every believer&#8212;stand unbreakably secure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So I prophesied as I was commanded</span>. The words uttered were without doubt those of vers. 4-6. The effect produced is depicted in its various steps. First, there resulted a noise - literally, a <span class="accented">voice</span> - which the Revisers take to have been "a thundering;" and Havernick, Keil, Smend, and others, "a sound" in general; but which Ewald, Hengstenberg, and Schroder, with more propriety, regard as having been an audible voice, if not, as Kliefoth supposes, the trumpet-blast or "voice of God," which, according to certain New Testament passages, shall precede the resurrection and awaken the dead (<a href="/john/5-25.htm">John 5:25, 28</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>); perhaps, as Plumptre suggests, the "counterpart" thereof. <span class="cmt_word">Next, a shaking</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.); which the Revisers, following Klie-foth, understand to have been an earthquake, as in <a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>; <a href="/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>; <a href="/zechariah/1-1.htm">Zechariah 1:1</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a> (comp. <a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>), and Ewald explains as "a peal of thunder running through the entire announcement," as in <a href="/ezekiel/3-12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12, 13</a> and Ezekiel 38:19, 20; but which is better interpreted by Keil, Smend, and others as a rustling proceeding from a movement among the bones. Thirdly, <span class="cmt_word">the bones came together</span> in the body as a whole, and in particular bone to his bone; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> each <span class="cmt_word">bone to the bone</span> with which it was designed to be united, as e.g. "the upper to the lower part of the arm" (Schroder). <span class="cmt_word">Lastly, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above</span>; or, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">there were sinews upon them</span>, <span class="accented">and flesh came up and skin covered them above</span>; precisely as Jehovah had announced to the prophet would take place (ver. 6). Yet, though the external framework of the bodies was finished, there was <span class="cmt_word">no breath in them</span> - <span class="accented">ruach</span> having still the same import as in ver. 5. With this the preliminary stage in the reanimating process terminated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/37-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So I prophesied</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1488;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;nib&#183;b&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Nifal - Conjunctive perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5012.htm">Strong's 5012: </a> </span><span class="str2">To prophesy, speak, by inspiration</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I had been commanded.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1467;&#1493;&#1468;&#1461;&#1425;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;uw&#183;w&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Pual - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6680.htm">Strong's 6680: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lay charge (upon), give charge (to), command, order</span><br /><br /><span class="word">And as I prophesied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1489;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Verb - Nifal - Infinitive construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5012.htm">Strong's 5012: </a> </span><span class="str2">To prophesy, speak, by inspiration</span><br /><br /><span class="word">there was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">suddenly</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
