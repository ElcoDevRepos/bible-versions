This prophecy against Mount Seir symbolizes God's judgment against Edom for its longstanding enmity with Israel. The desolation signifies complete destruction, reflecting the divine retribution for Edom's actions. The imagery of desolation is consistent with other biblical prophecies where God judges nations for their sins (<a href="/isaiah/34-9.htm">Isaiah 34:9-11</a>). The desolation of Mount Seir serves as a warning to all nations about the consequences of opposing God's chosen people.<p><b>and will cut off from it those who come and go</b><br>This phrase indicates the cessation of all activity and life in the region, emphasizing the totality of the judgment. The cutting off of those who "come and go" suggests the end of trade, travel, and communication, which were vital for the survival and prosperity of ancient cities. This reflects the broader biblical theme of divine judgment leading to isolation and ruin, as seen in the fall of other cities like Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/51-37.htm">Jeremiah 51:37</a>). The phrase also underscores the finality of God's judgment, leaving no room for recovery or restoration, which is a common motif in prophetic literature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_seir.htm">Mount Seir</a></b><br>A mountainous region inhabited by the Edomites, descendants of Esau.

These passages establish a pattern of divine action that underscores the certainty of what Ezekiel announces here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a desolate waste</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Desolate&#8221; stresses emptiness and devastation. God is not talking about a temporary setback but a condition so severe that the land would be rendered uninhabitable, mirroring language used for Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/jeremiah/49-18.htm">Jeremiah 49:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Historically, the once&#8211;strategic trade routes through Seir were eventually abandoned, fulfilling the imagery of a barren landscape (compare <a href="/jeremiah/49-17.htm">Jeremiah 49:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The same phrase appears in <a href="/ezekiel/6-14.htm">Ezekiel 6:14</a>, where Judah faced judgment; now Edom receives identical treatment, proving that God&#8217;s standards are consistent regardless of national identity.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/34-9.htm">Isaiah 34:9&#8211;15</a> describes ruined Edom as a haunt for desert creatures, reinforcing the literal reality of the desolation Ezekiel foretells.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and will cut off from it those who come and go</b><p>&#8226; The expression points to the elimination of daily life&#8212;no residents, no travelers, no caravans.

The verse highlights divine sovereignty, the certainty of judgment for persistent sin, and the completeness of God&#8217;s sentence. History confirms that Edom faded into obscurity, validating the literal fulfillment of the prophecy and reminding believers that God&#8217;s word stands firm.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/35.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Him that passeth out</span>.--The cutting off of the traveller is a striking feature in the doom of Edom, for her nomadic tribes had been the great carriers between India and the East and Egypt, and she had grown rich by this commerce.
