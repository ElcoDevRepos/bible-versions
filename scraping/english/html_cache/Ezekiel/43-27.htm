The context is the vision of the new temple, which Ezekiel receives while in exile. The "days" mentioned are part of a seven-day period of purification and dedication for the altar, reminiscent of the consecration of the tabernacle in <a href="/exodus/29-35.htm">Exodus 29:35-37</a>. This period signifies a transition from preparation to active worship.<p><b>from the eighth day on</b><br>The eighth day marks a new beginning, a theme consistent throughout Scripture. The number eight often symbolizes new creation or a new order, as seen in the resurrection of Jesus, which occurred on the first day of the week, the day after the Sabbath (the seventh day). This new beginning signifies the start of regular worship practices in the temple, emphasizing renewal and restoration.<p><b>the priests are to present your burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar</b><br>Burnt offerings and peace offerings were central to Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and fellowship with God, respectively. The priests, as mediators between God and the people, play a crucial role in maintaining the covenant relationship. The altar, a focal point of the temple, represents God's presence and the place where sacrifices are made. This practice connects to <a href="/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1 and 3</a>, where the regulations for these offerings are detailed, highlighting the continuity of worship practices.<p><b>Then I will accept you</b><br>Acceptance by God is contingent upon obedience to His commands and the proper execution of sacrificial rituals. This phrase underscores the importance of following divine instructions to maintain a right relationship with God. It echoes the covenantal language found throughout the Old Testament, where God's acceptance is linked to Israel's faithfulness (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>).<p><b>declares the Lord GOD</b><br>This authoritative declaration emphasizes the divine origin of the message. The use of "Lord GOD" (YHWH Elohim) underscores God's sovereignty and covenantal faithfulness. It assures the exiles that despite their current circumstances, God remains committed to His promises and will restore proper worship in the future temple. This assurance is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, offering hope and a vision of restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book that bears his name.

God Himself guarantees, &#8220;Then I will accept you,&#8221; affirming restored relationship and foreshadowing the perfect acceptance secured through Christ&#8217;s sacrifice for all who believe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The eighth day, and so forward</span>. Omit "so." With this day the regular sacrificial service should commence. Thenceforward the priests should offer upon the altar <span class="cmt_word">the burnt offerings and peace offerings</span> of the people. The omission of sin offerings is explained by Keil, on the principle that "burnt offerings" and "peace offerings" were "the principal and most frequent sacrifices, whilst sin offerings and meat offerings were implied therein;" Kliefoth adding that <a href="/ezekiel/44-27.htm">Ezekiel 44:27, 29</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/45-17.htm">Ezekiel 45:17, 19, 22, 23, 25</a>; and Ezekiel 46:20 show it cannot be inferred that sin offerings were no more to be offered on this altar. At the same time, the prominence given to "burnt" and "peace" as distinguished from "sin offerings" may, as Schroder suggests, have pointed to the fact that the sacrificers who should use this altar would be "a people in a state of grace," to whom Jehovah was prepared to say, <span class="cmt_word">I will accept you</span>, not your offerings alone, but your persons as well; and not these because of those, but contrariwise, these on account of these. Kliefoth's idea, that the first day symbolized the future day of Christ's sacrifice, that the seven intermediate days (on his hypothesis) pointed to the period of the Christian Church, and that the eighth day looked forward to the time of the end, while not without elements of truth, is open to this objection, that in the period of the Christian Church there should have been "no more sacrifice for sin;" and yet, as Kliefoth admits, "sin offerings" were afterwards to be made upon this altar. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/43-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At the end</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#238;&#183;&#7733;al&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
