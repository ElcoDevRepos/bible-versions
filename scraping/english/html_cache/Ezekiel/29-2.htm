It underscores the distinction between God and man, highlighting the divine authority behind Ezekiel's messages. The term is also used in the New Testament, notably by Jesus, to refer to Himself, indicating His role as the representative of humanity.<p><b>set your face against</b><br>This phrase indicates a determined opposition and a resolute stance. It signifies God's judgment and the seriousness of the prophetic message. The imagery of setting one's face suggests unwavering focus and intent, often used in prophetic literature to denote divine displeasure.<p><b>Pharaoh king of Egypt</b><br>Pharaoh represents the political and spiritual leadership of Egypt, a nation historically opposed to Israel. Egypt was a powerful empire known for its wealth and military might. The specific Pharaoh is likely Hophra (Apries), who reigned during Ezekiel's time. Egypt's reliance on its own strength and idolatry made it a target of God's judgment.<p><b>and prophesy against him</b><br>This command to prophesy against Pharaoh indicates a direct message from God, revealing His sovereignty over nations. Prophecy serves as both a warning and a declaration of divine will. It underscores the accountability of rulers and nations to God's standards.<p><b>and against all Egypt</b><br>The inclusion of "all Egypt" broadens the scope of the prophecy to encompass the entire nation, not just its leader. This reflects the comprehensive nature of God's judgment, affecting every aspect of Egyptian society. Egypt's historical role as a refuge and adversary to Israel is significant, and this prophecy aligns with other biblical judgments against Egypt, such as those found in Isaiah and Jeremiah.<div

man&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/29-2.htm">Ezekiel 29:2</a>) is God&#8217;s favored way of addressing Ezekiel, reminding him&#8212;and us&#8212;of his humanity in contrast to the Lord&#8217;s sovereign majesty. &#8226; God repeatedly uses this title for Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/2-1.htm">Ezekiel 2:1</a>; 3:1, 17), emphasizing the prophet&#8217;s role as a faithful but humble messenger. &#8226; The phrase underscores that the message comes from God, not from human imagination (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/33-7.htm">Ezekiel 33:7</a>). &#8226; By calling attention to Ezekiel&#8217;s earthly frailty, the Lord highlights His own glory and reliability, inviting readers to trust the prophetic word just as surely as Israel was called to trust it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>set your face</b><p>To &#8220;set your face&#8221; is to stand with fixed resolve (<a href="/ezekiel/13-17.htm">Ezekiel 13:17</a>; 20:46). &#8226; The wording pictures steadfast obedience, like the determined posture Jesus would later model when He &#8220;set His face&#8221; toward Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>)&#8212;a reminder that God&#8217;s servants never shrink from difficult assignments. &#8226; Ezekiel&#8217;s stance also conveys God&#8217;s unflinching purpose: His warnings are never idle (<a href="/isaiah/50-7.htm">Isaiah 50:7</a>). &#8226; The prophet&#8217;s focused gaze becomes a visible sermon, signaling that divine judgment is already in motion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against Pharaoh king of Egypt</b><p>God directs Ezekiel&#8217;s attention to &#8220;Pharaoh king of Egypt,&#8221; highlighting an actual historical ruler whom He will confront. &#8226; Egypt&#8217;s might seemed unassailable, yet the Lord treats Pharaoh as any other mortal leader subject to His throne (<a href="/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-25.htm">Jeremiah 46:25</a>). &#8226; Pharaoh represents prideful self-reliance; earlier, Egypt boasted of the Nile as its own creation (<a href="/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>). &#8226; This confrontation recalls earlier clashes with Egypt in Exodus, proving God&#8217;s consistency in opposing oppression and idolatry (<a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and prophesy against him and against all Egypt</b><p>The scope broadens: the word is &#8220;against him and against all Egypt.&#8221; &#8226; Judgment extends from the throne room to every corner of the land (<a href="/ezekiel/30-1.htm">Ezekiel 30:1&#8211;4</a>). &#8226; God&#8217;s aim is corrective as well as punitive: &#8220;Then they will know that I am the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/29-6.htm">Ezekiel 29:6</a>). &#8226; The prophecy warns Judah not to rely on Egypt for help (<a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1&#8211;3</a>); alliances without God are shaky reeds that pierce the hand (<a href="/ezekiel/29-7.htm">Ezekiel 29:7</a>). &#8226; Yet the Lord&#8217;s justice remains tempered with future mercy, promising eventual restoration for Egypt after forty years (<a href="/ezekiel/29-13.htm">Ezekiel 29:13&#8211;14</a>), demonstrating both His severity and kindness (<a href="/romans/11-22.htm">Romans 11:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/29-2.htm">Ezekiel 29:2</a> shows God commissioning His servant to deliver a specific, resolute word of judgment. The verse reminds us that:<p>&#8226; God speaks through chosen messengers, even when the message is hard.<p>&#8226; His purposes are unwavering; human power cannot withstand Him.<p>&#8226; Nations and individuals who exalt themselves above God will face certain reckoning, yet divine discipline always holds out the goal of acknowledging the Lord.<p>In every era, He alone is the dependable refuge; all other sources of security eventually fail.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/29-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of man,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1429;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">set</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7760.htm">Strong's 7760: </a> </span><span class="str2">Put -- to put, place, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your face</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1462;&#1428;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#257;&#183;ne&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural construct &#124;
