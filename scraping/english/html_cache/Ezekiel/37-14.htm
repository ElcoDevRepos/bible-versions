The Spirit of God is often associated with life and empowerment throughout the Bible. In <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, God breathes life into Adam, and similarly, the Spirit is seen as the source of life in Ezekiel's vision of the dry bones. This promise foreshadows the New Covenant, where the Holy Spirit indwells believers, as seen in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a> during Pentecost. The indwelling of the Spirit is a key aspect of Christian theology, emphasizing the personal relationship between God and His people.<p><b>and you will live</b><br>This phrase highlights the theme of resurrection and restoration. In the immediate context, it refers to the revival of the nation of Israel, which had been in exile and spiritually dead. Theologically, it points to the ultimate resurrection of the dead and eternal life promised to believers. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the resurrection and the life.<p><b>and I will settle you in your own land</b><br>This promise of restoration to the land is significant in the context of the Babylonian exile. Historically, the Israelites were taken from their homeland, and this promise assures them of a return. The land is a central theme in the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>), and its restoration signifies God's faithfulness. This also has eschatological implications, pointing to the future restoration of Israel and the establishment of God's kingdom.<p><b>Then you will know that I, the LORD, have spoken</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the certainty and authority of God's word. Throughout the Bible, God's spoken word is powerful and effective, as seen in the creation narrative (Genesis 1) and the prophetic declarations. The fulfillment of God's promises serves as a testament to His sovereignty and reliability. This assurance is meant to strengthen the faith of the Israelites and, by extension, all believers.<p><b>and I will do it, declares the LORD.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This final declaration underscores God's commitment to His promises. It reflects the divine initiative and power in bringing about His plans. The repetition of "declares the LORD" serves to affirm the certainty of the prophecy. This assurance is mirrored in the New Testament, where God's promises are fulfilled in Christ, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>, which states that all God's promises are "Yes" in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's

The former was at once the necessary condition of the latter, and would also be its consequence in a still higher development. Compare a similar association of the spiritual with the literal resurrection in <a href="/context/john/5-21.htm" title="For as the Father raises up the dead, and vivifies them; even so the Son vivifies whom he will.">John 5:21-29</a>.<p><a href="/context/ezekiel/37-15.htm" title="The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,">Ezekiel 37:15-28</a> constitute another prophecy, which probably was given very soon after the former, since there is a close connection between the two. In the former, under the figure of the revival of the dry bones, God had set forth His power to accomplish the promise He made of the spiritual resurrection of Israel; in the latter. He adds to this the specific declaration of what had been before only implied, that the two long-severed nations of Israel shall be re-united and prosperous under the rule of the future David, while He Himself will dwell among them, and they shall be obedient to Him. These promises prepare the way for the prophecy of the great and final attack of the enemies of the Church (Ezekiel 38, 39) and their overthrow by the power of God. The promise of this prophecy is first set forth by a symbolic action (<a href="/context/ezekiel/37-15.htm" title="The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,">Ezekiel 37:15-17</a>), which is then to be explained to the people (<a href="/context/ezekiel/37-18.htm" title="And when the children of your people shall speak to you, saying, Will you not show us what you mean by these?">Ezekiel 37:18-20</a>), as in the case of the vision (<a href="/ezekiel/37-11.htm" title="Then he said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.">Ezekiel 37:11</a>), and then the promises of blessing follow.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/37-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will put</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7791;at&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
