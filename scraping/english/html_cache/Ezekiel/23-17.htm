The Babylonians, under King Nebuchadnezzar, were a dominant power in the ancient Near East during the 6th century BC. This period saw the Babylonian exile, a significant event in Jewish history. The "coming" of the Babylonians symbolizes political alliances and the subsequent subjugation of Judah, which is metaphorically depicted as a woman in this passage. The Babylonians are often seen as instruments of God's judgment against Israel for their idolatry and unfaithfulness.<p><b>to the bed of love</b><br>The "bed of love" is a metaphor for the alliances and treaties that Judah sought with foreign nations, including Babylon, instead of relying on God. In the prophetic literature, such alliances are often depicted as acts of spiritual adultery. This imagery is consistent with the prophetic tradition of using marriage as a metaphor for the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The "bed" signifies intimacy and covenant, which Judah misused by turning to pagan nations.<p><b>and in their lust they defiled her</b><br>The defilement here represents the spiritual and moral corruption that resulted from Judah's alliances with pagan nations. The "lust" of the Babylonians can be seen as their desire for power and control, which led to the exploitation and degradation of Judah. This defilement is not just physical but also spiritual, as it led Judah away from their covenant with God. The prophets often warned against such alliances, as they led to idolatry and the adoption of foreign customs.<p><b>But after she had been defiled by them</b><br>This phrase indicates a turning point where the consequences of Judah's actions become apparent. The defilement is complete, and the reality of their unfaithfulness is undeniable. Historically, this reflects the period after the initial Babylonian invasions, where the people of Judah experienced the repercussions of their political and spiritual decisions. The defilement also signifies the loss of purity and the breaking of the covenant relationship with God.<p><b>she turned away in disgust</b><br>The turning away in disgust suggests a realization and rejection of the consequences of their actions. This can be seen as a moment of repentance or at least an acknowledgment of the futility of their alliances. In the broader biblical narrative, this turning away can be linked to the prophetic calls for repentance and return to God. It highlights the theme of God's people recognizing their sin and the emptiness of relying on anything other than God. This moment of disgust can be seen as a precursor to the eventual restoration and renewal that God promises to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonians.htm">Babylonians</a></b><br>A powerful empire known for its conquest of Judah and Jerusalem.

When Babylon&#8217;s domination became bitter, Judah felt revulsion&#8212;yet not the heart-level repentance God desired. The verse warns that any trust placed in worldly powers rather than in the Lord leads to defilement, disappointment, and eventual judgment, while still holding out the hope of restoration for those who truly return to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Her mind was alienated.</span>--The original implies the disgust of satiety. Josiah had been the devoted friend of Babylon, and perished in his zeal on its behalf. Judah was then made a dependency of Egypt, and turned for aid to Babylon. Then receiving in turn the yoke of Babylon, she became impatient, and sought the aid of Egypt. This vacillating policy is described in <a href="/context/ezekiel/23-17.htm" title="And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their prostitution, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.">Ezekiel 23:17-19</a>, and at either, turn was so entirely wanting in sole reliance upon God as to produce the effect of <a href="/ezekiel/23-18.htm" title="So she discovered her prostitutions, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.">Ezekiel 23:18</a> : "My mind was alienated from her."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - The words paint the intimate alliance, the political prostitution, as it were, involved in the alliance with Babylon. <span class="cmt_word">Her mind was alienated from them.</span> Interpreted by the history, the words point to the fact that Judah soon found out how hollow was the help gained by the alliance with Babylon, and turned, after Josiah's death, to Egypt as a counterpoise. As in the history of Amnon (<a href="/2_samuel/13-15.htm">2 Samuel 13:15</a>), lust, when it had wrought its will, passed into loathing and disgust. Jehoiakim and Zedekiah were examples of what we may well call this distracted policy. But, as it was, this alienation did but increase her guilt. As things were, it would have been better, as Jeremiah all along counseled, to accept the rule of the Chaldeans. The mind of Jehovah was alienated from Jerusalem as hers had been from the Chaldeans. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/23-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the Babylonians</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
