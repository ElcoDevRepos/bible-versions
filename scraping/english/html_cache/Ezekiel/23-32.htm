In the prophetic books, this introduction underscores that the message is not from the prophet himself but from God. It reflects the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces, as seen throughout the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4</a>).<p><b>&#8216;You will drink your sister&#8217;s cup,</b><br>The imagery of drinking a cup is often used in the Bible to symbolize experiencing God's judgment or wrath (<a href="/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a>, <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>). The "sister" refers to Samaria, representing the Northern Kingdom of Israel, which had already faced judgment and exile. This indicates that Jerusalem (the Southern Kingdom) will undergo a similar fate due to its idolatry and unfaithfulness.<p><b>a cup deep and wide.</b><br>The description of the cup as "deep and wide" suggests the magnitude and severity of the judgment. It implies that the consequences will be extensive and overwhelming. This can be connected to the comprehensive nature of God's judgment as seen in other prophetic warnings (<a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15-29</a>).<p><b>It will bring scorn and derision,</b><br>The result of drinking the cup is public shame and humiliation. This reflects the cultural context where defeat and suffering were often accompanied by mockery from surrounding nations. The theme of scorn is prevalent in the prophetic literature, highlighting the disgrace that comes with turning away from God (<a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15-16</a>).<p><b>for it holds so much.</b><br>The phrase underscores the abundance of judgment contained within the cup. It suggests that the punishment is not only severe but also justified due to the extent of the people's sins. This aligns with the biblical principle of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>) and serves as a warning of the consequences of persistent disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the exiles in Babylon.
