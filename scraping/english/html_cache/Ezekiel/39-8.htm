In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/39.htm">Ezekiel 39</a>, it refers to the prophesied defeat of Gog and the forces that come against Israel. The assurance of fulfillment is a common theme in biblical prophecy, underscoring God's sovereignty and faithfulness. This certainty is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, where God declares the end from the beginning, and in <a href="/matthew/24-35.htm">Matthew 24:35</a>, where Jesus affirms that His words will never pass away.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD.</b><br>The use of "declares the Lord GOD" signifies divine authority and the ultimate source of the prophecy. In the Hebrew text, the term "Adonai Yahweh" is used, highlighting both the lordship and covenantal relationship of God with His people. This declaration is a reminder of God's unchanging nature and His control over history, as seen throughout the Old Testament, including in the prophetic books like Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>This is the day of which I have spoken.</b><br>The "day" mentioned here refers to a specific time of divine intervention and judgment. In the broader context of Ezekiel, this day is part of the eschatological vision concerning the end times and the restoration of Israel. It connects to the "Day of the Lord," a theme found in other prophetic books such as Joel and Zephaniah, which describes a time of both judgment and salvation. This day also foreshadows the ultimate victory of God over evil, a theme that culminates in the New Testament with the return of Christ, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Every prophecy in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38&#8211;39</a> marches toward this fixed point.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>declares the Lord GOD</b><p>The authority behind the promise matters as much as the promise itself.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Lord GOD&#8221; (Adonai YHWH) appears throughout Ezekiel to underline dominion and covenant faithfulness (<a href="/ezekiel/17-24.htm">Ezekiel 17:24</a>; 21:32).<p>&#8226; When the Sovereign speaks, the issue is settled; debate ends, obedience begins (<a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The same voice once said, &#8220;Let there be light,&#8221; and light flooded the void (<a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>). That voice now pledges to intervene in history again, visibly and powerfully.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is the day of which I have spoken</b><p>The long-anticipated climax arrives.<p>&#8226; Earlier prophets foretold this day: <a href="/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1</a>, <a href="/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14</a>, and Ezekiel himself in 38:17&#8212;&#8220;Are you not the one I spoke of in former times?&#8221;<p>&#8226; It is the hinge point when God vindicates His holy name before the watching nations (<a href="/ezekiel/39-7.htm">Ezekiel 39:7</a>).<p>&#8226; For Israel, the day ushers in restoration and renewed intimacy with the Lord (<a href="/ezekiel/39-25.htm">Ezekiel 39:25&#8211;29</a>).
