In the ancient Near East, horses were symbols of military strength and speed. The imagery of dust suggests a vast number of horses, indicating a formidable and unstoppable force. Historically, this prophecy is directed against Tyre, a wealthy and fortified city-state known for its maritime prowess. The reference to horses highlights the contrast between Tyre's naval strength and the land-based military might of its conquerors. This imagery is reminiscent of other biblical passages where God uses foreign nations as instruments of judgment (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/5-26.htm">Isaiah 5:26-30</a>).<p><b>When he enters your gates as an army entering a breached city,</b><br>The breached city imagery signifies vulnerability and impending defeat. Gates were critical for a city's defense, and their breach symbolized the collapse of security. This phrase underscores the inevitability of Tyre's downfall, despite its strong fortifications. Historically, Tyre was besieged by Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon, fulfilling this prophecy. The breach of gates is a common biblical motif for divine judgment (e.g., <a href="/nahum/3-13.htm">Nahum 3:13</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ, who will enter the gates of the New Jerusalem as the conquering King (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>).<p><b>your walls will shake from the noise of cavalry, wagons, and chariots.</b><br>The shaking walls convey the terror and chaos accompanying the invasion. Walls were the primary defense mechanism for ancient cities, and their shaking indicates the overwhelming force of the attackers. Cavalry, wagons, and chariots represent the full spectrum of military technology of the time, emphasizing the comprehensive nature of the assault. This imagery is consistent with other biblical descriptions of divine judgment through military conquest (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>). The shaking of walls can also be seen as a type of the final shaking of the heavens and the earth at the return of Christ (<a href="/hebrews/12-26.htm">Hebrews 12:26-27</a>), where all that is not of God's kingdom will be removed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Scripture often uses dust to convey overwhelming force&#8212;<a href="/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a> compares Babylon&#8217;s chargers to &#8220;clouds&#8221; that darken the sky, and <a href="/joel/2-4.htm">Joel 2:4-5</a> describes horses that &#8220;run like chariots, leaping on the mountaintops.&#8221; Here, the dust signals sheer numbers and unstoppable momentum. Tyre prided itself on wealth and walls, yet God foretells that the invader&#8217;s horses will blanket the city, blotting out every illusion of safety (<a href="/isaiah/5-26.htm">Isaiah 5:26-28</a>). What looks like chaos to human eyes is actually the Lord carrying out His precise judgment announced earlier in <a href="/ezekiel/26-7.htm">Ezekiel 26:7-8</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When he enters your gates as an army entering a breached city</b><p>The phrase shifts from approach to penetration. Gates once symbolized civic pride; now they gape like wounds. Babylon doesn&#8217;t negotiate&#8212;it breaks through, just as Assyria once did to Samaria (<a href="/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5-6</a>). <a href="/ezekiel/30-10.htm">Ezekiel 30:10</a> echoes the pattern: &#8220;Nebuchadnezzar&#8230; will put an end to the pride of Egypt.&#8221; Every empire that defies God&#8217;s supremacy meets the same end. The breached-city image also recalls <a href="/jeremiah/39-2.htm">Jeremiah 39:2-3</a>, where Babylon tears into Jerusalem. For Tyre, whose island stronghold seemed impregnable, God reveals that a breach is only a matter of His timing (<a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your walls will shake from the noise of cavalry, wagons, and chariots</b><p>What the horses begin, the full war machine completes. <a href="/nahum/2-4.htm">Nahum 2:4</a> paints chariots flashing like torches; <a href="/jeremiah/47-3.htm">Jeremiah 47:3</a> describes pounding hooves that cause fathers to &#8220;not turn back for their children.&#8221; The shaking walls illustrate terror spreading through the very stones (<a href="/ezekiel/26-15.htm">Ezekiel 26:15</a>). Cavernous rumbling makes clear that human engineering cannot withstand God-directed judgment. <a href="/habakkuk/3-6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6</a> reminds us that when the Lord rises, &#8220;the eternal mountains were scattered.&#8221; In Tyre&#8217;s case, the vibration of invading hardware announces that the city&#8217;s proud fortifications will soon be rubble, exactly as foretold in <a href="/ezekiel/26-12.htm">Ezekiel 26:12</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/26-10.htm">Ezekiel 26:10</a> unfolds like a slow-motion replay of divine judgment: first the blinding dust of countless horses, then breached gates that nullify civic pride, and finally trembling walls that broadcast inevitable ruin. Each stage reinforces the same lesson found throughout Scripture&#8212;nations that exalt themselves against the Lord will fall, yet every detail of their fall remains under His sovereign control (<a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30-31</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Shall enter into thy gates.</span>--The whole description of this verse again implies that Nebuchadnezzar had contrived some way by which his armies, with horsemen and chariots, could march into the city, and the prophet gives a glowing poetic description of the effect of their entrance.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/26-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">His multitude</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;&#353;ip&#772;&#183;&#8216;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
