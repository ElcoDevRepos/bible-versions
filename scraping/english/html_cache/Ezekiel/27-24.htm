Tyre's economy was heavily reliant on trade, and its merchants were skilled in negotiating and exchanging goods. This trade network extended across the ancient Near East and beyond, making Tyre a key player in the economic landscape of the time.<p><b>fine garments of blue</b><br>Blue garments were highly valued in the ancient world, often associated with wealth and nobility. The color blue was typically derived from the murex snail, found along the Phoenician coast, making it a luxury item. This trade in blue garments underscores Tyre's access to rare and valuable resources, enhancing its reputation as a center of opulence.<p><b>embroidered work</b><br>Embroidery was a skilled craft, indicating the high quality and artistic value of the goods traded in Tyre. Such work required expertise and was often used for decorative purposes in clothing and textiles. The mention of embroidered work suggests the cultural sophistication and aesthetic appreciation present in Tyrian society.<p><b>and multicolored rugs</b><br>Rugs with multiple colors were another luxury item, reflecting the advanced dyeing techniques and artistic skills of the time. These rugs were likely used for both practical and decorative purposes, adding to the allure of Tyre's marketplace. The trade in such items points to the city's ability to cater to the tastes and demands of wealthy clients.<p><b>with cords tightly twisted and knotted</b><br>This detail emphasizes the craftsmanship and durability of the products traded in Tyre. The tightly twisted and knotted cords suggest a high level of skill in textile production, ensuring the longevity and quality of the goods.

God acknowledges the literal existence of this trading hub and its prosperity, yet He also exposes how wealth can foster pride (<a href="/isaiah/23-8.htm">Isaiah 23:8&#8211;9</a>; <a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they traded with you</b><p>Tyre did not merely display goods; surrounding nations &#8220;traded with you.&#8221; This phrase underscores the web of international commerce detailed earlier in the chapter (<a href="/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12&#8211;23</a>).
