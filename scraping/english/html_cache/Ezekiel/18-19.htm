However, <a href="/ezekiel/18.htm">Ezekiel 18</a> challenges this notion, emphasizing individual responsibility. The cultural context of the time often involved collective family or tribal identity, where actions of one member could affect the whole group. This question reflects a shift towards personal accountability, a theme that is consistent with the broader message of the prophets who called for personal repentance and righteousness.<p><b>Since the son has done what is just and right,</b><br>This phrase highlights the importance of personal righteousness and justice. In the context of Ezekiel, doing what is "just and right" involves adhering to God's laws and commandments, which were given to guide the Israelites in living a life pleasing to God. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where obedience leads to blessings. The emphasis on individual actions aligns with the teachings found in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in the wisdom literature, where personal integrity and righteousness are highly valued.<p><b>carefully observing all My statutes,</b><br>The phrase underscores the necessity of obedience to God's statutes, which are detailed in the Mosaic Law. This includes moral, ceremonial, and civil laws that governed the life of Israel. The call to "carefully observe" suggests a diligent and intentional effort to live according to God's standards. This is reminiscent of <a href="/deuteronomy/6-17.htm">Deuteronomy 6:17</a>, which instructs the Israelites to diligently keep the commandments. The emphasis on careful observance points to a heart fully committed to God, a theme that is echoed in the teachings of Jesus, who fulfilled the Law and called His followers to a higher standard of righteousness.<p><b>he will surely live.</b><br>This promise of life is both physical and spiritual. In the immediate context, it refers to the preservation of life and blessing in the land of Israel. However, it also points to the deeper spiritual truth of eternal life, which is a consistent theme throughout Scripture. The assurance of life for those who are righteous is seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a> and <a href="/proverbs/12-28.htm">Proverbs 12:28</a>. In the New Testament, this concept is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who offers eternal life to those who believe in Him, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>. The promise of life is a central tenet of the Christian faith, emphasizing the hope and assurance found in a relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, emphasizing personal responsibility and repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience of Ezekiel's prophecy, who were in exile due to their collective disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, serving as a backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_statutes.htm">God's Statutes</a></b><br>The laws and commandments given by God, which the Israelites were expected to follow.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son.htm">The Son</a></b><br>Represents individuals who choose to live righteously, despite their familial or generational background.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_responsibility.htm">Personal Responsibility</a></b><br>Each individual is accountable for their own actions and choices.

Doth not the son bear?</span>--It would be clearer to read this as a single question, "Why doth not the son, &c?<span class= "ital">" </span>It is the question proposed by the people in objection to what has been declared. To them it seemed the law of nature, the necessity of the case, the teaching of history, that the son should bear the iniquity of his father. Their ideas had not risen to the conception of man's individual responsibility to God; to them the individual was still but a part of the nation or the family. They ask, therefore, why this universal law should now be reversed. It was not true that any law was reversed, it was only that the superior prevailed over the inferior law; but, as usual in such cases, the Divine word does not reason with the human objection, but in this and the following verse only reiterates most emphatically the law of individual responsibility.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why? doth not the son,</span> etc.? The words are better taken, with the LXX., Vulgate, Revised Version, and most critics, as a single question, <span class="accented">Why doth not the son bear</span>, etc.? What is the explanation of a fact which seemingly contradicts the teaching of the Law? The answer to the question seems at first only an iteration of what had been stated before. The son repents, and therefore does not bear his father's iniquity. A man is responsible for his own sins, and for those only. To think otherwise is to think of God as less righteous than man. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/18-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Yet you may ask,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1429;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;mar&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
