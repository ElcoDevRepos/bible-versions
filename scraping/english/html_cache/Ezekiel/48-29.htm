The concept of land as an inheritance is deeply rooted in the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised Abraham that his descendants would inherit the land of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The allotment of land signifies God's faithfulness to His promises and His desire for each tribe to have a specific portion. This division is reminiscent of the earlier distribution of land under Joshua (Joshua 13-19), emphasizing continuity in God's plan for Israel. The land is not just a physical territory but a symbol of God's covenant relationship with His people.<p><b>and these will be their portions,&#8221;</b><br>The term "portions" indicates the specific areas designated for each tribe. This distribution is detailed in <a href="/ezekiel/48.htm">Ezekiel 48</a>, where each tribe receives a portion of land. The use of "portions" underscores the fairness and orderliness of God's provision, ensuring that each tribe has a rightful place in the land. This reflects the biblical principle of justice and equity, as seen in the Jubilee laws (Leviticus 25), where land was to be returned to its original family owners every fifty years. The concept of portions also points to the spiritual inheritance believers have in Christ, as each believer receives a unique role and place in the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>declares the Lord GOD.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authority and sovereignty of God in the distribution of the land. The use of "declares" signifies a divine decree, underscoring that the allotment is not a human decision but a fulfillment of God's will. The title "Lord GOD" (YHWH Elohim) highlights God's covenantal name, reminding the Israelites of His eternal nature and His role as the supreme ruler. This declaration assures the Israelites of the certainty and unchangeability of God's promises. It also points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's kingdom, where Christ, as the King of kings, will reign over a restored creation (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile who received visions and messages from God concerning the future of Israel and the restoration of the land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribes_of_israel.htm">Tribes of Israel</a></b><br>The twelve tribes descended from the sons of Jacob, each receiving a portion of the Promised Land as their inheritance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Promised Land, which God had promised to Abraham and his descendants, symbolizing God's faithfulness and covenant with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/inheritance.htm">Inheritance</a></b><br>The division of the land among the tribes, representing God's provision and the fulfillment of His promises.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and covenant-keeping God who declares and ensures the fulfillment of His promises to His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God's promises are sure and steadfast.

The verse stitches together the ancient promise to Abraham, the historical allotment under Joshua, and the prophetic hope of national restoration. By commanding Israel to allot the land, God entrusts His people with stewardship; by calling it an inheritance, He underscores grace; by listing the tribes, He highlights covenant continuity; and by declaring it Himself, He guarantees that every square mile will be delivered exactly as promised.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/48-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2063.htm">Strong's 2063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hereby in it, likewise, the one other, same, she, so much, such deed, that, </span><br /><br /><span class="word">is the land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1435;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
