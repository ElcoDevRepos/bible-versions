The "far off" refers to those Israelites who were exiled or had fled from the immediate vicinity of Jerusalem. The plague is often seen as a divine instrument of judgment, as seen in other parts of the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/numbers/16-46.htm">Numbers 16:46-50</a>). This reflects the comprehensive reach of God's wrath, emphasizing that distance from the epicenter of judgment does not equate to safety. Historically, plagues were common in ancient times and often viewed as acts of divine retribution.<p><b>he who is near will fall by the sword</b><br>The "near" refers to those who remained in or around Jerusalem. The sword symbolizes warfare and violence, a common method of judgment in the Old Testament. This phrase highlights the immediate and violent nature of the judgment for those who stayed close to the center of rebellion against God. The Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BC is a historical fulfillment of this prophecy, where many inhabitants were killed by the sword.<p><b>and he who remains will die by famine</b><br>Famine is a recurring theme in biblical judgment narratives, often resulting from siege warfare, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/25-3.htm">2 Kings 25:3</a>. Those who survived the initial onslaught of the sword would face starvation, a slow and agonizing form of judgment. This reflects the totality of God's judgment, leaving no means of escape for the unrepentant. The siege of Jerusalem by the Babylonians led to severe famine, fulfilling this prophecy.<p><b>So I will vent My fury upon them</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine origin of the judgment. God's fury is a response to the persistent idolatry and rebellion of the Israelites. The use of "vent" suggests an outpouring of righteous anger, aligning with the prophetic theme of divine retribution found throughout the book of Ezekiel. This judgment serves as a warning and a call to repentance, emphasizing God's holiness and justice. Theologically, it points to the seriousness of sin and the necessity of atonement, which Christians believe is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, who are the primary audience of Ezekiel's prophecies, facing judgment due to their idolatry and disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, a significant backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/plague,_sword,_famine.htm">Plague, Sword, Famine</a></b><br>Instruments of God's judgment mentioned in this verse, symbolizing comprehensive destruction and divine retribution.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_fury.htm">God's Fury</a></b><br>Represents God's righteous anger and judgment against the sin and idolatry of His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_god's_judgment.htm">The Certainty of God's Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is inevitable for those who persist in sin.
