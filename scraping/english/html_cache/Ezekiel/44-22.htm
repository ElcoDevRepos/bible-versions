In the ancient Near Eastern context, marriage was not only a personal union but also a reflection of one's social and religious status. Widows and divorced women, while not inherently impure, could have been seen as having complex social ties or pasts that might complicate the priestly role. This command echoes <a href="/leviticus/21-7.htm">Leviticus 21:7</a>, where priests are similarly instructed regarding marriage, highlighting the continuity of priestly standards across the Old Testament.<p><b>but must marry a virgin of the descendants of the house of Israel</b><br>The requirement for priests to marry virgins from among the Israelites underscores the importance of purity and covenant faithfulness. Virgins symbolize purity and a fresh start, aligning with the priestly duty to represent holiness before God. This stipulation also ensures that the priestly lineage remains within the covenant community, preserving the distinct identity of Israel. The emphasis on marrying within the house of Israel reflects the broader biblical theme of maintaining the sanctity and distinctiveness of God's chosen people, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>.<p><b>or a widow of a priest</b><br>Allowing marriage to a widow of a priest provides a compassionate exception, recognizing the unique status of a priest's widow who would have shared in the priestly life and its demands. This provision respects the widow's previous role and experience within the priestly community, acknowledging her understanding of the responsibilities and lifestyle required. It also maintains the integrity of the priestly line, as she would have been part of the same covenantal and cultural framework. This exception highlights the balance between upholding holiness and showing grace within the community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, who received visions and messages from God concerning the restoration of Israel and the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priests.htm">The Priests</a></b><br>Specifically, the Levitical priests, who were given specific instructions regarding their conduct and duties in the temple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_israel.htm">The House of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the descendants of Jacob, the chosen people of God, who were to maintain purity and holiness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/marriage_regulations.htm">Marriage Regulations</a></b><br>Specific guidelines given to the priests regarding whom they could marry, emphasizing purity and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_in_leadership.htm">Holiness in Leadership</a></b><br>The priests were held to a higher standard of holiness, reflecting their role as mediators between God and the people.

Just as <a href="/leviticus/21-13.htm">Leviticus 21:13-14</a> required Aaronic priests to marry in a way that protected the purity of the priesthood, so here the same principle is reaffirmed. The prohibition against marrying a widow is not a judgment on widows themselves&#8212;Scripture highly esteems and protects them (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>; <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>)&#8212;but it safeguards the priestly line from any question about lineage. Holiness in leadership is always protected by clear boundaries (<a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or a divorced woman</b><p>Divorce was permitted under certain circumstances (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1-4</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-8.htm">Matthew 19:8</a>), yet the priestly requirement is stricter. Because priests symbolized God&#8217;s own covenant faithfulness, they could not marry someone whose previous covenant had ended in divorce. <a href="/malachi/2-15.htm">Malachi 2:15-16</a> presses the same issue: God hates divorce because it mars the picture of His unbreakable covenant with His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but must marry a virgin</b><p>The Hebrew word &#8220;virgin&#8221; emphasizes untouched purity. <a href="/leviticus/21-13.htm">Leviticus 21:13</a> says, &#8220;He shall take a wife in her virginity&#8221;. A virgin bride underscored the priest&#8217;s call to represent God&#8217;s holiness. In the New Testament the Church is pictured as &#8220;a pure virgin to Christ&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>), showing that the physical requirement for priests foreshadows the spiritual purity God desires for all His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the descendants of the house of Israel</b><p>The bride had to be an Israelite so the priesthood remained tied to the covenant community (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>).

The requirement also anticipates the full inclusion of Israel in future worship (<a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or a widow of a priest</b><p>Unlike <a href="/leviticus/21-14.htm">Leviticus 21:14</a>, Ezekiel allows one exception: a widow of a priest. Because her marriage and life were already aligned with priestly holiness, there would be no ambiguity about lineage or covenant faithfulness. This gracious concession honors a faithful widow while still guarding purity. It illustrates how God balances compassion with holiness (<a href="/psalms/85-10.htm">Psalm 85:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/44-22.htm">Ezekiel 44:22</a> reinforces God&#8217;s unwavering call for purity among those who lead in worship. By restricting priestly marriages to virgins from Israel or widows already proven within the priestly family, the Lord preserves the integrity of the priesthood, mirrors His own covenant faithfulness, and foreshadows the spotless bride Christ is preparing for Himself. Holiness matters to God, especially in those who represent Him, and His standards provide both protection and a picture of the gospel&#8217;s purity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/44.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">A widow that had a priest before</span>.--In regard both to marriage and to mourning (<a href="/context/ezekiel/44-25.htm" title="And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that has had no husband, they may defile themselves.">Ezekiel 44:25-27</a>) the Levitical law made a broad distinction between the ordinary priest and the high priest. The former was only forbidden to marry a divorced woman (<a href="/leviticus/21-7.htm" title="They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy to his God.">Leviticus 21:7</a>), but was allowed to marry a widow; the latter could marry only a virgin of Israel (<span class= "ital">ib.</span> 14). So also in the law of mourning; the high priest might not be "defiled" nor make any sign of mourning even for his nearest of kin (<a href="/context/leviticus/21-11.htm" title="Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;">Leviticus 21:11-14</a>). Ezekiel does not recognise this distinction, and in fact nowhere mentions the high priest at all; but, instead, gives a general law for all priests, somewhat between the two.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - As to marriage (since the priests in Ezekiel's "house" were no more expected to be celibates than were those employed about Moses' tabernacle or Solomon's temple), they were forbidden to marry widows (which the Levitical priests were not, though the high priest was) or divorced women, and allowed to wed only virgins of the house of Israel, or (the sole exception) widows of such as had been priests (compare with the priest-code, <a href="/leviticus/21-7.htm">Leviticus 21:7, 13, 14</a>). Ezekiel's enactment discovers two variations - first, that it does not formally forbid to the priests marriage with a harlot; and, second, that it sanctions marriage with a priest's widow. But the first was implied in the prohibition of marriage with an adulteress, and the second was a sign of the higher sanctity of the priesthood belonging to Ezekiel's temple. Hence, so far from indicating the priority of Ezekiel, it rather points to the priority of Leviticus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/44-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And they shall not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">marry</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1495;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(yiq&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3947.htm">Strong's 3947: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a widow</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;al&#183;m&#257;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
