The prophet Ezekiel is commanded to deliver God's words, emphasizing the divine origin of the message. In the biblical context, prophets served as God's mouthpieces, conveying His will to the people. This underscores the seriousness of the message, as it is not merely human opinion but divine instruction.<p><b>When any Israelite sets up idols in his heart:</b><br>Idolatry is a central theme in the Old Testament, often leading to Israel's downfall. Here, the focus is on internal idolatry, suggesting that idolatry is not just about physical idols but also about misplaced priorities and affections. This internalization of idolatry reflects the broader biblical teaching that sin begins in the heart (<a href="/matthew/15-19.htm">Matthew 15:19</a>). The heart, in Hebrew thought, is the center of will and emotion, indicating that idolatry corrupts one's entire being.<p><b>and puts a wicked stumbling block before his face:</b><br>A stumbling block refers to anything that leads one into sin or away from God. In this context, it suggests that the Israelites' idolatry is not only internal but also manifests in actions that lead themselves and others astray. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are warned not to cause others to stumble (<a href="/romans/14-13.htm">Romans 14:13</a>). The imagery of a stumbling block highlights the danger and destructiveness of sin.<p><b>and then comes to the prophet:</b><br>This phrase indicates a hypocritical approach to seeking divine guidance. Despite their idolatry, the Israelites still seek a word from God through His prophet. This reflects a superficial religiosity, where individuals maintain religious practices while harboring sin. It parallels the New Testament critique of those who honor God with their lips while their hearts are far from Him (<a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>).<p><b>I the LORD will answer him according to his great idolatry:</b><br>God's response is tailored to the individual's sin, emphasizing His justice and omniscience. This phrase suggests that God will not be mocked; He sees the true state of the heart and responds accordingly. It serves as a warning that God&#8217;s answers are not always what people want to hear, especially when they are in rebellion. This principle is consistent with the biblical theme that God disciplines those He loves (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>) and that He desires repentance and genuine worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_israel.htm">House of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Israel, God's chosen nation, who are in a covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols_in_the_heart.htm">Idols in the Heart</a></b><br>Symbolizes internal idolatry, where individuals prioritize anything above God in their hearts.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet.htm">Prophet</a></b><br>A messenger of God, who in this context, is approached by those seeking divine guidance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His authority and relationship with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/internal_idolatry.htm">Internal Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just external but begins in the heart.

True worship requires removing every rival to His throne, both inward and outward, before seeking His guidance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Will answer him that cometh.</span>--The words <span class= "ital">that cometh, </span>not being in the original, should be omitted. The verb <span class= "ital">answer </span>in the original is in the passive, and has a reflexive sense="I will show myself answering," a softer form than the English. The principle that when man persists in going counter to God's known will He will allow him to misunderstand that will, is abundantly established by such instances as that of Balaam (<a href="/numbers/22-20.htm" title="And God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men come to call you, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say to you, that shall you do.">Numbers 22:20</a>) and of Micaiah (<a href="/1_kings/22-15.htm" title="So he came to the king. And the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.">1Kings 22:15</a>). No man can hope to know what God would have him to do unless his own heart is truly submissive to the Divine will. The threat here is, that the man coming to inquire of God with a heart full of idolatry, shall receive no true answer from that Omniscience which he does not respect; but will rather find himself deceived by the illusions of his own heart. This idea is more fully developed in the following verse. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/44-20.htm" title="He feeds on ashes: a deceived heart has turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?">Isaiah 44:20</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will answer him that cometh,</span> etc. The two last words represent the K'ri, or marginal reading of the Hebrew; the "therein" of the Revised Version, the Kh'-tib, or written text.
