These faces are traditionally understood to represent a lion, an ox, a man, and an eagle, each symbolizing different aspects of God's majesty and authority. The lion represents strength and royalty, the ox symbolizes service and power, the man denotes intelligence and reason, and the eagle signifies swiftness and vision. This imagery is consistent with the vision in <a href="/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a> and is echoed in <a href="/revelation/4-7.htm">Revelation 4:7</a>, where similar creatures surround the throne of God, emphasizing the continuity of God's revelation.<p><b>and four wings</b><br>The four wings of the cherubim indicate their readiness to act on God's behalf and their ability to move swiftly in any direction, signifying divine omnipresence and omnipotence. Wings in biblical literature often symbolize protection and deliverance, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>, where God covers His people with His wings. The number four is often associated with universality in the Bible, suggesting that God's presence and power extend to the four corners of the earth.<p><b>with what looked like human hands under their wings</b><br>The presence of human hands under the wings of the cherubim suggests the capability for action and interaction with the physical world. Hands are a symbol of work, skill, and power, indicating that these heavenly beings are not only messengers but also active participants in carrying out God's will. This detail highlights the connection between the divine and the human, as hands are a distinctly human feature, suggesting that God's heavenly agents are equipped to engage with His creation. The imagery of hands also points to the incarnation of Christ, who, as God in human form, worked among humanity with His own hands, performing miracles and acts of compassion.<div

Ezekiel repeats the detail first given in 1:6, confirming these are the same cherubim who support the glory-throne of God.<p>&#8211; The four distinct faces (10:14) display the fullness of God&#8217;s character simultaneously:<p>&#8226; Lion &#8211; royal power and courage (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Ox &#8211; strength in servanthood (<a href="/numbers/7-3.htm">Numbers 7:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Man &#8211; intelligence and relational capacity (<a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Eagle &#8211; sovereign oversight and swiftness (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-11.htm">Deuteronomy 32:11</a>).<p>&#8211; Because each creature carries all four faces, nothing of God&#8217;s nature is ever out of view. The vision stresses that His rule is perfectly balanced&#8212;never one-dimensional.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and four wings</b><p>&#8211; As in 1:6, the wings spread upward and downward, touching one another and covering the bodies (1:11), illustrating both unity and humility in service.<p>&#8211; Wings in Scripture picture swiftness (<a href="/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>) and shelter (<a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>). These cherubim can move &#8220;wherever the Spirit would go&#8221; (10:17), ready to obey instantly, while also providing a covering for the blazing glory above them (<a href="/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>).<p>&#8211; The number four again points to universality&#8212;God&#8217;s presence reaches the four corners of the earth (<a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with what looked like human hands under their wings</b><p>&#8211; Ezekiel first noticed the hands in 1:8; here they are highlighted to show that God&#8217;s heavenly agents carry out His work with skill and purpose.<p>&#8211; Hands signify ability to act (<a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>) and tenderness to care (<a href="/isaiah/41-13.htm">Isaiah 41:13</a>). Hidden under the wings, they remind us that divine activity often moves invisibly yet effectively.<p>&#8211; The fact that the hands appear &#8220;human&#8221; bridges heaven and earth: the Almighty chooses to work through means we recognize and understand, without surrendering a shred of His transcendence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/10-21.htm">Ezekiel 10:21</a> presents literal, awe-inspiring beings who uphold God&#8217;s throne. Their four faces proclaim every facet of His nature, their four wings embody His swift and sheltering presence, and their human-like hands reveal His intimate, purposeful activity. Together they assure us that the Lord who reigns over all is powerful, balanced, near, and always at work for His glory and our good.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/10-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Each</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1428;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
