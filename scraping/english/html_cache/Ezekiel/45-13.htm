In the context of Ezekiel, these instructions are part of the vision for a restored Israel, emphasizing the need for proper worship and dedication to God. The term "contribution" suggests a portion set aside for sacred purposes, reflecting the principle of giving back to God from what He has provided.<p><b>a sixth of an ephah from each homer of wheat,</b><br>An ephah is a unit of dry measure used in ancient Israel, approximately equivalent to 22 liters or about 5.8 gallons. A homer is a larger unit, about 220 liters or 58 gallons. The requirement of a sixth of an ephah from each homer indicates a specific and measurable portion, underscoring the precision and care expected in offerings. Wheat, a staple grain, symbolizes sustenance and provision, and its offering represents gratitude and reliance on God for daily needs. This precise measurement reflects the structured and orderly nature of worship in the temple.<p><b>and a sixth of an ephah from each homer of barley.</b><br>Barley, another essential grain, was often considered less valuable than wheat but was still a significant part of the diet in ancient Israel. The inclusion of barley in the offering requirements demonstrates that all aspects of provision, whether considered great or small, are to be acknowledged and dedicated to God. This reflects the biblical principle that God values the heart behind the offering more than the material value. The equal measure for both wheat and barley signifies fairness and consistency in worship practices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is known for his visions and messages concerning the restoration of Israel and the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom Ezekiel is prophesying, particularly focusing on their future restoration and the establishment of just practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The context of this passage is the future temple and the offerings that are to be made there, symbolizing worship and dedication to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/offerings.htm">Offerings</a></b><br>The specific offerings mentioned in this verse are part of the larger system of sacrifices and offerings that were to be made in the temple.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exile.htm">The Exile</a></b><br>The historical backdrop of Ezekiel's prophecies, where the Israelites were in Babylonian captivity, longing for restoration and return to their homeland.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_giving.htm">Faithfulness in Giving</a></b><br>The specific measurements of offerings highlight the importance of precision and faithfulness in our giving to God.

He does not leave giving to guesswork.<p>&#8226; In Ezekiel&#8217;s restored&#8208;temple vision, the Lord outlines a specific &#8220;contribution&#8221; (terumah) the people must set aside.<p>&#8226; Such clarity echoes earlier commands: &#8220;All the tithe of the land&#8230;is holy to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming the contribution first, the text reminds us that giving is a priority, not an afterthought (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Whether under Moses, David, or Ezekiel, the pattern is consistent&#8212;God provides everything, then asks for a portion back (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-14.htm">1 Chronicles 29:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you are to offer</b><p>The verb moves from definition to personal responsibility.<p>&#8226; Offer means action: gathering, measuring, and delivering the portion.<p>&#8226; Obedience is communal; the pronoun &#8220;you&#8221; is plural, binding every Israelite household (cf. <a href="/numbers/18-26.htm">Numbers 18:26&#8211;29</a>).<p>&#8226; The principle carries into the New Covenant: &#8220;Each one should give as he has decided in his heart&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>). Voluntary cheerfulness never cancels commanded faithfulness.<p>&#8226; The offering tangibly supported temple worship and the priests, ensuring uninterrupted ministry (<a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a sixth of an ephah from each homer of wheat</b><p>Now the Lord specifies the exact figure&#8212;one-sixth of an ephah (roughly 3.7 liters) for every homer (about 220 liters).<p>&#8226; The ratio is small&#8212;about 1.67 percent&#8212;showing God&#8217;s fairness. He does not burden His people; He trains them to honor Him first (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-22.htm">Deuteronomy 14:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; Uniform measurement prevents both stinginess and overreach. Ezekiel later condemns dishonest scales (<a href="/ezekiel/45-10.htm">Ezekiel 45:10</a>). God values integrity even in the granary.<p>&#8226; Wheat, being the staple grain, represents daily provision (<a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>). Setting aside a portion declares, &#8220;My survival is in God&#8217;s hands, not my hoard.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and a sixth of an ephah from each homer of barley</b><p>Barley, the common grain of the poor (<a href="/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9</a>), receives the same proportion.<p>&#8226; Equality of rate underscores God&#8217;s equal concern for rich and poor. He requires worship from all, yet oppresses none (<a href="/exodus/23-3.htm">Exodus 23:3</a>; 23:6).<p>&#8226; Barley was the first crop harvested in spring. By offering from the firstfruits, the people proclaimed confidence that later harvests would follow (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; The matching measure for wheat and barley anticipates Paul&#8217;s words: &#8220;He who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-15.htm">2 Corinthians 8:15</a>). Balance, not competition, marks God&#8217;s economy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/45-13.htm">Ezekiel 45:13</a> sets a concrete, reasonable standard for giving: every household brings a small, consistent portion of its produce to the Lord.
