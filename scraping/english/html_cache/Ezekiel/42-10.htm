42:10</a> describes a row of priestly chambers on the temple&#8217;s south side, stretching the full length of the outer-court wall, adjoining the courtyard, and precisely facing the western temple complex. The verse highlights the literal, orderly layout of the future millennial temple and God&#8217;s meticulous provision for priestly ministry, all pointing to His holiness, generosity, and unchanging faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-12.</span> - A similar suite of chambers, corresponding in every detail, is depicted as having stood upon the south side of the temple and in front of the gizrah. The only question among interpreters is whether ver. 10 relates to the north or south suite, or to an east suite. Schroder and Currey see in ver. 10 a repetition, from another point of view, of what has already been stated about the north chambers, viz. that, viewed from the outer court, they appeared in the thickness or breadth of the wall (ver. 7) and (lengthwise) over against the separate place and the buildings, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the gizrah and the temple. Ewald, Smend, and Keil decide that ver. 10 forms part of the description of a south set of chambers only; but in order to make this good they alter the text by substituting <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, "the south," for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, "the east." Plumptre agrees with Kliefoth and Hengstenberg in holding that two similar sets of chambers are described, one on the east side and one on the south side of the inner court wall. The principal objection to this is the fact that only two suites, the north and the south, are referred to by the guide in vers. 13 and 14. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/42-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On the</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1447;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(de&#183;re&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1870.htm">Strong's 1870: </a> </span><span class="str2">A road, a course of life, mode of action</span><br /><br /><span class="word">south side</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(haq&#183;q&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
