The act of throwing them into the streets signifies a complete reversal of their perceived value. This imagery reflects the futility of material wealth in the face of divine judgment. The notion of gold seeming unclean suggests a ritual impurity, indicating that what was once treasured is now considered defiled and worthless. This echoes the prophetic theme found in <a href="/zephaniah/1-18.htm">Zephaniah 1:18</a>, where neither silver nor gold can deliver in the day of the Lord's wrath.<p><b>Their silver and gold cannot save them in the day of the wrath of the LORD.</b><br>This phrase underscores the impotence of material wealth against divine judgment. The "day of the wrath of the LORD" refers to a time of God's righteous anger and judgment, a recurring theme in prophetic literature. This is reminiscent of <a href="/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>, which states that riches do not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death. The emphasis is on the spiritual over the material, highlighting the need for repentance and righteousness.<p><b>They cannot satisfy their appetites or fill their stomachs with wealth,</b><br>Here, the focus shifts to the inability of wealth to provide true satisfaction or sustenance. This reflects a broader biblical principle that material possessions cannot fulfill spiritual needs. <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:10</a> supports this, noting that those who love money will never be satisfied with it. The imagery of unsatisfied appetites and empty stomachs serves as a metaphor for spiritual emptiness and the futility of relying on wealth for fulfillment.<p><b>for it became the stumbling block that brought their iniquity.</b><br>The term "stumbling block" indicates an obstacle that leads to sin or moral failure. In this context, wealth itself becomes a source of iniquity, leading people away from God. This is consistent with the warnings in <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, where the love of money is described as the root of all kinds of evil. The phrase suggests that the pursuit and reliance on wealth have led to moral and spiritual downfall, emphasizing the need for a heart aligned with God's will rather than material gain.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are in exile due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, serving as a backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_the_wrath_of_the_lord.htm">The Day of the Wrath of the LORD</a></b><br>A time of divine judgment against the sins of the people, emphasizing the futility of relying on material wealth.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/silver_and_gold.htm">Silver and Gold</a></b><br>Symbols of wealth and material possessions that the Israelites wrongly trusted for security and satisfaction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_material_wealth.htm">The Futility of Material Wealth</a></b><br>Material possessions cannot provide true security or salvation, especially in times of divine judgment.
