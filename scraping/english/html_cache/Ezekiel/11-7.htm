In the context of Ezekiel, God often speaks directly to the prophet, conveying messages of judgment and hope. This underscores the prophetic role of Ezekiel as a mouthpiece for God, delivering messages that are both immediate and eschatological.<p><b>The slain you have laid within this city are the meat:</b><br>The imagery of "meat" within a "pot" is a metaphor for the people of Jerusalem who have been killed. This metaphor suggests that the leaders of Jerusalem believed they were secure within the city walls, much like meat is protected within a pot. Historically, Jerusalem was under siege, and the leaders' false sense of security is being condemned. The "slain" refers to those who have died due to the leaders' actions and the impending judgment.<p><b>and the city is the pot:</b><br>The city of Jerusalem is likened to a pot, a common household item in ancient times, symbolizing containment and protection. This metaphor is used ironically, as the pot, instead of providing safety, becomes a place of death. The cultural context here is significant, as pots were used for cooking and preserving, but in this case, it becomes a symbol of entrapment and judgment.<p><b>but I will remove you from it:</b><br>This phrase indicates God's intention to bring judgment upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem. The removal signifies exile, a common theme in the prophetic literature, where God uses foreign nations to execute His judgment. This connects to the broader narrative of the Babylonian exile, where the people of Judah were taken captive. Theologically, it reflects God's control over nations and His ability to uproot and replant according to His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the mouthpiece of God, delivering messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who speaks through Ezekiel, declaring His judgment and plans for His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_inhabitants_of_jerusalem.htm">The Inhabitants of Jerusalem</a></b><br>The people of Jerusalem, particularly the leaders, who are being judged for their idolatry and rebellion against God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city that is metaphorically described as a pot, with its inhabitants as the meat, symbolizing the impending judgment and siege.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context of Ezekiel's prophecies, where the Israelites are in captivity due to their disobedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_judgment.htm">Understanding God's Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is a response to persistent sin and rebellion.

God turns their proverb on its head: the only &#8220;meat&#8221; in this &#8220;pot&#8221; is the corpses they created through injustice and idolatry (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/11-6.htm">Ezekiel 11:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The image is graphic: just as meat is prepared for cooking, Jerusalem is being readied for judgment. Innocent blood cries out, and God will not ignore it (cf. <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement exposes their callousness: they saw victims as expendable, but God sees every life (cf. <a href="/psalms/10-14.htm">Psalm 10:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the city is the pot</b><p>&#8226; The walls they trusted for safety will actually contain the heat of divine wrath, much like a pot holds meat over the fire (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/24-3.htm">Ezekiel 24:3&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; God affirms the image only to recast its meaning: the city is indeed a vessel&#8212;but a vessel of judgment, not protection (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/21-10.htm">Jeremiah 21:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Their civic pride becomes the very context of their accountability (cf. <a href="/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but I will remove you from it</b><p>&#8226; The leaders thought remaining inside Jerusalem guaranteed security; God promises the opposite.

No one escapes His reach (cf. <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/11-7.htm">Ezekiel 11:7</a> overturns false security. God, the ultimate authority, declares that the murdered inhabitants&#8212;not the smug rulers&#8212;are the &#8220;meat&#8221; in Jerusalem&#8217;s &#8220;pot.&#8221; The city itself becomes a vessel of judgment, and the leaders who trusted its walls will be forcibly removed for punishment. The verse exposes the folly of relying on human schemes and assures believers that God sees injustice, holds the guilty accountable, and always keeps His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Your slain . . . they are the flesh.</span>--They had boasted of the protection of their strong city: it should be a security only to the dead who had fallen by their own violence. The living who vainly trusted in its strength should be brought out of it, and delivered as captives to the stranger. The prophecy here takes up their own simile of <a href="/ezekiel/11-3.htm" title="Which say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is the caldron, and we be the flesh.">Ezekiel 11:3</a>, and shows that it shall not avail them.

Not they, but the carcases of their victims, were as the "flesh" in the "caldron." For themselves, there was another fate in reserve. Neither to be protected by the caldron nor to meet their doom in it, but to be brought out of it.
