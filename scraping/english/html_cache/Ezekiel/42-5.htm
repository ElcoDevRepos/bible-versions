The upper chambers being smaller may symbolize the diminishing space as one ascends, possibly indicating a hierarchy or a progression towards holiness. In ancient Near Eastern architecture, upper rooms were often used for special purposes, such as prayer or storage, suggesting a reserved or sacred function. This design could also reflect the practicalities of ancient construction techniques, where upper levels needed to be lighter and smaller to maintain structural integrity.<p><b>because the galleries took more space</b><br>The term "galleries" refers to the architectural features that provided access and possibly light to the chambers. These galleries could have been walkways or corridors that allowed movement between different parts of the temple complex. The allocation of space to galleries rather than chambers might indicate the importance of accessibility and movement within the temple, emphasizing the need for order and function in worship practices. This design choice highlights the balance between utility and sacred space in the temple's construction.<p><b>from the chambers on the lower and middle floors of the building</b><br>The mention of lower and middle floors suggests a multi-level structure, which was common in ancient temple designs. The lower and middle floors likely served different purposes, with the lower floors possibly used for more mundane or preparatory activities, and the middle floors for more sacred functions. This tiered structure can be seen as a reflection of the spiritual journey, where one moves from the earthly to the divine. The design of the temple, with its distinct levels, may also symbolize the separation between the holy and the common, a theme prevalent in the Old Testament, where access to the most sacred spaces was restricted to certain individuals, such as priests.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.

God does not waste words; each detail marks His precision and faithfulness (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the upper chambers were smaller</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The upper rooms were shorter&#8221;. The design is intentional: the higher you go, the narrower the rooms become. Solomon&#8217;s original temple followed the same pattern&#8212;&#8220;the width of each successive story increased all around, because the temple was enclosed with walkways that projected&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/6-6.htm">1 Kings 6:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, this design preserves stability in a multi-story structure. Spiritually, it hints that nearness to God&#8217;s presence involves increasing focus and decreasing distraction (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because the galleries took more space</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;galleries&#8221; are open passageways or balconies. Ezekiel had just mentioned similar walkways circling the outer court (<a href="/ezekiel/41-15.htm">Ezekiel 41:15&#8211;16</a>). As they spiral upward, they occupy floor space; the higher floors lose square footage to accommodate them.<p>&#8226; Cross reference: In Solomon&#8217;s time, &#8220;chambers were narrower&#8221; to allow &#8220;recesses&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5</a>). God&#8217;s architecture repeatedly uses galleries to grant access and circulation while still directing all movement toward the sanctuary (<a href="/psalms/84-5.htm">Psalm 84:5&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the chambers on the lower and middle floors</b><p>&#8226; The lower two levels remain full-sized because the galleries begin above them. That three-level arrangement echoes earlier holy structures: Noah&#8217;s ark had &#8220;lower, second, and third decks&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/6-16.htm">Genesis 6:16</a>), and the temple&#8217;s side rooms came in &#8220;three stories&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/6-8.htm">1 Kings 6:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Functionally, priests would store offerings and vestments on the spacious lower stories, while the narrower upper stories accommodated lighter duties (<a href="/2_chronicles/31-11.htm">2 Chronicles 31:11&#8211;12</a>). Order and hierarchy protect purity (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the building</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The building&#8221; ties every measurement back to the central purpose: this is God&#8217;s future temple, the tangible proof that He will dwell among His covenant people (<a href="/ezekiel/43-7.htm">Ezekiel 43:7</a>). The meticulous layout foreshadows the New Jerusalem, where &#8220;its length, width, and height are equal&#8221; and every dimension speaks of perfection (<a href="/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>).<p>&#8226; In Christ the ultimate temple, &#8220;the whole building is fitted together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21</a>). These blueprints remind us that God&#8217;s redeemed community, like Ezekiel&#8217;s chambers, is carefully shaped to display His glory (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/42-5.htm">Ezekiel 42:5</a> records a simple architectural note: the top-story priestly rooms are smaller because surrounding galleries occupy their floor space. Yet within that detail God reveals His character&#8212;precise, orderly, and intent on access to His presence. The stepped design mirrors earlier biblical structures and points forward to the perfect, proportioned dwelling of God with His people. Even a measurement in a visionary hallway reassures us that every promise is exact, every inch is accounted for, and every believer has a prepared place in His house.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/42.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">For the galleries were higher than these.</span>--Translate this verse, <span class= "ital">And the upper chambers</span> <span class= "ital">were shortened, because the galleries took off from them</span> (literally, <span class= "ital">eat of them</span>)<span class= "ital"> in comparison with the lower and the middle</span> [<span class= "ital">chambers</span>]<span class= "ital"> of the building.</span> The building was in three storeys (<a href="/ezekiel/42-6.htm" title="For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.">Ezekiel 42:6</a>), like the chambers round the Temple, but the gallery is mentioned only in connection with the third (<a href="/ezekiel/42-3.htm" title="Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.">Ezekiel 42:3</a>).
