Iron, a strong and impenetrable material, signifies the strength of the judgment coming upon Jerusalem. In ancient times, iron was a symbol of strength and durability, often used in warfare and construction.<p><b>and set it up as an iron wall between yourself and the city.</b><br>The iron wall represents the divine barrier that God has placed between Himself and Jerusalem. This imagery suggests that the city is cut off from divine protection and favor. The wall signifies the impending judgment and the inability of the people to escape it. Historically, walls were crucial for a city's defense, and the absence of divine protection would leave Jerusalem vulnerable.<p><b>Turn your face toward it so that it is under siege,</b><br>Ezekiel's action of turning his face toward the city symbolizes God's focus on Jerusalem for judgment. The siege represents the Babylonian attack on Jerusalem, which was a historical event that occurred in 586 BC. This act of turning one's face is often used in Scripture to denote attention or judgment, as seen in other prophetic books.<p><b>and besiege it.</b><br>Ezekiel's symbolic siege of the city illustrates the actual siege that Babylon would carry out. This prophetic act serves as a warning to the people of Israel about the seriousness of their situation. The siege is a common biblical motif representing God's judgment, as seen in other prophetic warnings throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>This will be a sign to the house of Israel.</b><br>The sign is a prophetic demonstration meant to convey God's message to the Israelites. Signs in the Bible often serve as tangible representations of spiritual truths or future events. This particular sign is a warning of the impending destruction due to the people's unfaithfulness. It calls the house of Israel to repentance and recognition of their covenantal failures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

This was to be set for a wall of iron between the prophet (representing the besiegers) and the city, doubtless as symbolical of the strength of the besiegers' lines, and of the impossibility there would be of an escape from the city by a sally. Their foes should be made too strong for them defensively as well as offensively.<p><span class= "bld">A sign to the house of Israel.</span>--As already said, the tribe of Judah, with the associated remnants of the other tribes, is considered as representing the whole nation after the Assyrian captivity, and is spoken of as "the house of Israel" except when there is occasion to distinguish especially between the two parts of the nation.

Such shields are seen, like the battering rams, in Assyrian bas-reliefs (Layard, 'Nineveh,' etc., 2:345).
