The "member of the royal family" is Zedekiah, Jehoiachin's uncle, whom Nebuchadnezzar installed as a puppet king. This action is part of the larger context of the Babylonian exile, a significant event in Israel's history where the leadership and many people of Judah were taken to Babylon. This reflects the fulfillment of God's warnings through prophets like Jeremiah about the consequences of Judah's disobedience.<p><b>and made a covenant with him</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar made a covenant with Zedekiah, which was essentially a vassal treaty. In the ancient Near East, such covenants were common when a more powerful king subdued a lesser king. This covenant was meant to ensure Zedekiah's loyalty to Babylon. Biblically, covenants are significant as they often represent agreements that have divine implications, reflecting the seriousness of Zedekiah's commitment.<p><b>putting him under oath</b><br>The oath was a solemn promise of allegiance to Nebuchadnezzar. In biblical terms, oaths were binding and sacred, often invoking God's name as a witness. Breaking an oath was considered a serious offense, both politically and spiritually. Zedekiah's eventual rebellion against Babylon was not just a political act but a violation of this sacred oath, which had severe consequences.<p><b>Then he carried away the leading men of the land</b><br>This refers to the deportation of the elite of Judah, including officials, craftsmen, and warriors, to Babylon. This strategy was used to weaken the political and military strength of a conquered nation, ensuring compliance and reducing the likelihood of rebellion. The removal of the leading men also had a profound impact on the social and religious life of Judah, as it left the land without its traditional leadership and contributed to the spiritual crisis that the exiles faced. This event is part of the larger narrative of the Babylonian exile, which is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, emphasizing themes of judgment, repentance, and eventual restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Jewish exiles in Babylon.
