The morning offering was a part of the daily sacrifices in the temple, reflecting the Israelites' commitment to God. This practice can be connected to the concept of daily prayer and devotion in the New Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18:1</a>, where Jesus encourages persistent prayer.<p><b>a grain offering of a sixth of an ephah</b><br>The grain offering, or "minchah," was a tribute to God, symbolizing the dedication of one's labor and sustenance. An ephah was a unit of dry measure used in ancient Israel, roughly equivalent to 22 liters or about 5.8 gallons. A sixth of an ephah would be a modest amount, signifying humility and the importance of offering to God from what one has, no matter the size.<p><b>with a third of a hin of oil</b><br>A hin was a unit of liquid measure, approximately 3.7 liters or about 1 gallon. A third of a hin of oil was used to moisten the flour, making the offering more pleasing and fragrant. Oil in the Bible often symbolizes the Holy Spirit, anointing, and consecration, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a> when David is anointed by Samuel.<p><b>to moisten the fine flour</b><br>Fine flour represents purity and the best of what one can offer. It was used in various offerings and symbolizes the purity and perfection required in worship. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), pure and without blemish.<p><b>a grain offering to the LORD</b><br>The offering is directed to the LORD, signifying that worship and sacrifices are to be made to God alone. This reflects the first commandment, emphasizing the exclusivity of worship to Yahweh. It also points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, who offered Himself to God on behalf of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>).<p><b>This is a permanent statute</b><br>The phrase indicates that this command was to be observed continually, underscoring the enduring nature of God's laws and the importance of consistent worship. This permanence can be seen as a foreshadowing of the eternal covenant established through Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and offers eternal life (<a href="/hebrews/13-20.htm">Hebrews 13:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book that bears his name.
