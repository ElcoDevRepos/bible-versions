It emphasizes Ezekiel's humanity and his role as a representative of the people. The term "Son of man" is also used in the New Testament, notably by Jesus to refer to Himself, highlighting His incarnation and identification with humanity (e.g., <a href="/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>).<p><b>how does the wood of the vine surpass</b><br>The vine is often used in Scripture as a symbol for Israel (e.g., <a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-16</a>, <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>). Here, the question implies a comparison of value and purpose. The wood of the vine is not known for its strength or utility like other trees, suggesting that Israel's worth is not in its inherent qualities but in its relationship with God. This can be seen as a call to humility and dependence on God.<p><b>any other branch among the trees in the forest?</b><br>This phrase contrasts the vine with other trees, which are typically more robust and useful for construction or fuel. The rhetorical question underscores the idea that Israel, like the vine, is chosen not for its own merit but for God's purposes. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1-8</a>, where Jesus describes Himself as the true vine, and His followers as branches, emphasizing the necessity of abiding in Him for spiritual fruitfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/son_of_man.htm">Son of Man</a></b><br>A term used by God to address Ezekiel, emphasizing his humanity and role as a prophet.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/vine.htm">Vine</a></b><br>Symbolically represents Israel, often used in the Bible to depict the nation&#8217;s relationship with God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/trees_of_the_forest.htm">Trees of the Forest</a></b><br>Represents the nations surrounding Israel, often seen as more robust and self-sufficient compared to the vine.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context in which Ezekiel prophesied, a time of judgment and reflection for Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_the_vine.htm">The Value of the Vine</a></b><br>The vine, representing Israel, is valuable only when it fulfills its purpose of bearing fruit.

The verse urges believers today to live out the purpose for which God redeemed us, bearing spiritual fruit that testifies to His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What is the vine tree,</span> etc.? The prophet's mind had apparently been dwelling, after the close of his previous utterance, on the imagery of earlier writers, in which Israel had appeared as the vine of Jehovah (<a href="/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/80-9.htm">Psalm 80:9</a>; <a href="/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:32</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>), and to which he himself refers again in <a href="/ezekiel/19-10.htm">Ezekiel 19:10</a>. He saw how men might pervert that image to their own destruction. And he expands the parable, as our Lord does in <a href="/john/15.htm">John 15</a>. Men might dwell, perhaps were actually dwelling, on the thought that they were branches of the true vine, and therefore could not perish. He exposes the groundlessness of that hope in tones of scornful sarcasm. If the vine did not bear fruit, or if it only brought forth wild grapes, then its special excellence was gone, and it challenged comparison with other trees only as a timber tree, and what was its worth as such? If Israel was not true to its vocation, it was poorer and weaker than the heathen nations round it. So far the general thought is clear.
