Unlike other trees, the vine's wood is not strong or durable, making it unsuitable for construction or crafting. This imagery highlights Israel's spiritual barrenness and lack of utility when they are unfaithful to God. The rhetorical question emphasizes the futility of expecting something valuable from what is inherently weak and flawed. This can be seen as a warning to the people of God to remain faithful and fruitful, as Jesus later teaches in <a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1-8</a>, where He describes Himself as the true vine and His followers as the branches.<p><b>Or can one make from it a peg on which to hang utensils?</b><br>The peg represents a simple yet essential household item in ancient Near Eastern culture, used for hanging various utensils and tools. Even for such a basic purpose, vine wood is inadequate, underscoring its lack of strength and reliability. This further illustrates the point that Israel, when not abiding in God's covenant, is unable to fulfill even the simplest of roles. The imagery of the peg can also be connected to <a href="/isaiah/22-23.htm">Isaiah 22:23-25</a>, where a peg is used metaphorically to describe a leader's reliability and the eventual downfall of those who are unfaithful. This serves as a reminder of the importance of spiritual integrity and the consequences of failing to uphold one's divine calling.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is known for his vivid visions and symbolic acts.

A vine&#8217;s great value lies in its grapes, not its wood.<p>&#8226; Here the Lord asks whether the vine&#8217;s wood could be fashioned into anything substantial&#8212;like a beam, board, or piece of furniture. The obvious answer is no. Vine wood is thin, twisted, and brittle; it cannot support weight or serve structural purposes.<p>&#8226; The question exposes Judah&#8217;s spiritual condition. Called to bear fruit for God among the nations (<a href="/isaiah/27-6.htm">Isaiah 27:6</a>), the people had instead produced &#8220;wild grapes&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>). Without fruit, they were left with only their &#8220;wood,&#8221; and even that proved useless.<p>&#8226; Jesus echoes this principle: &#8220;Apart from Me you can do nothing&#8230; such branches are thrown away and wither&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5-6</a>). Fruitlessness leads to worthlessness, and worthlessness leads to judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or can one make from it a peg on which to hang utensils?</b><p>&#8220;Or can one make from it a peg on which to hang utensils?&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/15-3.htm">Ezekiel 15:3</a>b)<p>&#8226; The Lord shifts from large projects to the simplest household need&#8212;a peg. In ancient homes even a peg had to bear weight; yet vine wood cannot safely hold a pot or cloak.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/22-23.htm">Isaiah 22:23-25</a> pictures a sturdy &#8220;peg in a firm place&#8221; that finally gives way, symbolizing leaders who fail. Ezekiel&#8217;s image is starker: the vine could never serve as a peg in the first place.<p>&#8226; Judah&#8217;s false confidence rested on temple rituals and national identity (<a href="/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>), but they lacked true righteousness and therefore could not support even the lightest spiritual duty.<p>&#8226; Within the chapter the next verse states, &#8220;It is thrown into the fire for fuel&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/15-4.htm">Ezekiel 15:4</a>). Without fruit and without structural worth, the only destiny left is burning&#8212;anticipating Jerusalem&#8217;s fall in 586 BC.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/15-3.htm">Ezekiel 15:3</a> employs two everyday questions to reveal Judah&#8217;s uselessness apart from God. Vine wood cannot become a beam, a board, or even a modest peg, so a fruitless vine has no purpose but the fire. In the same way, a people or a believer who refuses to bear the fruit of obedience offers nothing sturdy or lasting to the Lord. The literal truth of this proverb stands: God expects fruit, and when it is absent, judgment follows&#8212;yet His purpose is always to lead His people back to fruitful fellowship in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall wood be taken thereof,</span> etc.? As a timber tree, then, the vine was confessedly valueless. No carpenter would use it, even for the peg upon which men hang their cups, and which had become, as in <a href="/isaiah/22-23.htm">Isaiah 22:23</a>, the symbol of political stability (comp. also <a href="/zechariah/10-4.htm">Zechariah 10:4</a>). For the unfruitful vine branch these remained the doom of being cast into the fire (<a href="/john/15-6.htm">John 15:6</a>). What was its worth when it was half burned at either end and in the middle? What would Israel be fit for when it had been laid low by the "fire" of God's judgment? Probably the vivid picture of the charred branch points to the successive judgments which had fallen first on the ten tribes, then on Judah, and lastly on Jerusalem itself. The word "trespass" may refer either to the general guilt of the people, or to the last crowning crime of Zedekiah's rebellion. I rather incline to the latter, the noun being in the singular. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/15-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Can wood</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1461;&#1428;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#234;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6086.htm">Strong's 6086: </a> </span><span class="str2">Tree, trees, wood</span><br /><br /><span class="word">be taken</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1497;&#1467;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;yuq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - QalPass - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3947.htm">Strong's 3947: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from it</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1433;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;men&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
