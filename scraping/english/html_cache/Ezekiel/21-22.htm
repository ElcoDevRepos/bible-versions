The "right hand" symbolizes power and authority, suggesting that the decision is both significant and binding. Jerusalem, the focal point of Jewish worship and identity, is under threat, highlighting the gravity of the impending judgment. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God using foreign nations as instruments of His judgment, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>.<p><b>where he is to set up battering rams</b><br>Battering rams were crucial siege instruments in ancient warfare, used to break through city walls and gates. The mention of these rams underscores the seriousness of the siege and the determination to conquer Jerusalem. Historically, the Babylonians were known for their military prowess and use of such technology, which aligns with the historical context of the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem in 586 BC.<p><b>to call for the slaughter</b><br>This phrase indicates the violent and destructive nature of the impending attack. The term "slaughter" conveys not just military defeat but also the loss of life and the severity of the judgment. This reflects the fulfillment of prophetic warnings given by Ezekiel and other prophets about the consequences of Israel's disobedience, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9-11</a>.<p><b>to lift a battle cry</b><br>The battle cry serves as both a psychological weapon and a rallying call for troops. It signifies the commencement of the attack and the unity and resolve of the attacking forces. In biblical terms, the battle cry can also symbolize the spiritual battle between good and evil, as seen in the cries of the Israelites in <a href="/joshua/6-16.htm">Joshua 6:16</a> during the fall of Jericho.<p><b>to direct the battering rams against the gates</b><br>The gates of a city were its most vulnerable points and often the focus of an attack. Directing battering rams against the gates signifies a strategic and focused assault aimed at breaching the city's defenses. This action is symbolic of the breaking down of spiritual defenses due to sin and rebellion, as seen in the lament over Jerusalem's fall in <a href="/lamentations/2-9.htm">Lamentations 2:9</a>.<p><b>to build a ramp</b><br>Siege ramps were constructed to allow attacking forces to reach the top of city walls. This phrase indicates a methodical and determined approach to the siege, reflecting the inevitability of Jerusalem's fall. The construction of ramps is reminiscent of the Assyrian siege techniques, as seen in the reliefs from the siege of Lachish, providing archaeological insight into ancient warfare.<p><b>and to erect a siege wall</b><br>A siege wall, or circumvallation, was built to encircle a city, cutting off supplies and escape routes. This tactic ensured the complete isolation of the city, leading to eventual surrender. The erection of a siege wall symbolizes the inescapable nature of divine judgment, as seen in the comprehensive nature of God's judgment in <a href="/amos/3-11.htm">Amos 3:11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who conveyed messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, significant in biblical history as the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_siege.htm">Babylonian Siege</a></b><br>The event where the Babylonian army, led by King Nebuchadnezzar, laid siege to Jerusalem, leading to its eventual destruction.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/divination.htm">Divination</a></b><br>A practice used by the Babylonians to seek guidance or omens, often through interpreting signs or using objects like arrows.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/battering_rams_and_siege_works.htm">Battering Rams and Siege Works</a></b><br>Military tools and strategies used by ancient armies to breach city walls and fortifications during a siege.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>Despite human efforts and divination, God's plans and purposes prevail.
