Plagues were often used by God as a form of punishment or to demonstrate His power, as seen in the plagues of Egypt (Exodus 7-11). The "her" refers to the city of Tyre, a powerful and wealthy city-state known for its commerce and idolatry. The use of a plague signifies a direct intervention by God, emphasizing His sovereignty over nations.<p><b>and shed blood in her streets</b><br>The shedding of blood in the streets suggests a violent overthrow or invasion. Historically, Tyre was besieged multiple times, notably by Nebuchadnezzar and later by Alexander the Great. This imagery of bloodshed highlights the severity of the judgment and the chaos that would ensue, serving as a warning to other nations about the consequences of pride and sin.<p><b>the slain will fall within her</b><br>This phrase underscores the totality of the destruction. The "slain" refers to the inhabitants of Tyre who would perish during the judgment. It reflects the fulfillment of God's prophetic word, as seen in other instances where cities faced divine wrath, such as Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19). The internal collapse of Tyre signifies the inescapable nature of God's judgment.<p><b>while the sword is against her on every side</b><br>The sword symbolizes warfare and destruction. Being surrounded on every side indicates a comprehensive siege, leaving no escape for the inhabitants. This mirrors the historical sieges Tyre faced, particularly the prolonged siege by Nebuchadnezzar, which lasted 13 years. The imagery of being besieged on all sides also serves as a metaphor for the inescapable judgment of God.<p><b>Then they will know that I am the LORD</b><br>This concluding phrase is a recurring theme in Ezekiel, emphasizing the purpose of God's judgments: to reveal His identity and sovereignty. The recognition of God as LORD is not just for Tyre but for all nations, demonstrating that He alone is the true God. This acknowledgment is a call to repentance and faith, pointing to the ultimate revelation of God through Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
