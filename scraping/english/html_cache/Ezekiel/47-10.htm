In the context of Ezekiel's vision, it symbolizes the renewal of life and prosperity. Fishermen standing by the shore suggests a thriving ecosystem, contrasting with the desolation previously experienced by Israel. This imagery can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual revival and the spread of the Gospel, as Jesus called His disciples to be "fishers of men" (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>).<p><b>from En-gedi to En-eglaim</b><br>En-gedi and En-eglaim are locations along the western shore of the Dead Sea. En-gedi is known for its oasis and was a place of refuge for David (<a href="/1_samuel/23-29.htm">1 Samuel 23:29</a>). En-eglaim's exact location is uncertain, but it represents the extent of the area being revitalized. This geographical reference emphasizes the miraculous transformation of the Dead Sea, a body of water known for its high salinity and lack of life, into a life-sustaining environment.<p><b>they will spread their nets to catch fish of many kinds,</b><br>The act of spreading nets signifies preparation and expectation of a bountiful catch. The mention of "fish of many kinds" highlights diversity and abundance, symbolizing the inclusivity of God's kingdom. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the New Testament Church, where people from all nations are gathered (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>). It also reflects the fulfillment of God's promises to bless His people and restore their fortunes.<p><b>like the fish of the Great Sea.</b><br>The "Great Sea" refers to the Mediterranean Sea, known for its rich marine life. Comparing the fish of the transformed waters to those of the Mediterranean underscores the miraculous nature of the prophecy. It suggests a return to Edenic conditions, where creation flourishes under God's blessing. This transformation can be seen as a type of the ultimate restoration in the new heavens and new earth (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>), where life and abundance are fully realized.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/fishermen.htm">Fishermen</a></b><br>Symbolic of those who will benefit from the abundance and life-giving properties of the river flowing from the temple.

In Ezekiel&#8217;s vision, the river flowing from the new temple (<a href="/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1&#8211;9</a>) heals the waters, turning the shoreline into a bustling place of work and community. Similar scenes of restored land and active labor appear in <a href="/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1&#8211;2</a> and <a href="/amos/9-13.htm">Amos 9:13&#8211;15</a>, underscoring God&#8217;s promise of physical renewal, not merely symbolism. As Jesus later called actual fishermen beside Galilee (<a href="/matthew/4-18.htm">Matthew 4:18&#8211;19</a>), this verse anticipates a future setting where everyday vocations flourish under God&#8217;s blessing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from En-gedi to En-eglaim</b><p>En-gedi sits midway down the west side of the Dead Sea (<a href="/1_samuel/24-1.htm">1 Samuel 24:1</a>), while En-eglaim likely marks the northern end (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/20-2.htm">2 Chronicles 20:2</a>). Mentioning both points sketches the entire shoreline&#8212;&#8220;from one end to the other.&#8221; This geographical sweep highlights total transformation: every stretch formerly plagued by salt will teem with life. <a href="/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38&#8211;40</a> offers a similar &#8220;boundary-to-boundary&#8221; promise for Jerusalem&#8217;s future, showing God&#8217;s intent to redeem complete regions, not isolated spots.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they will spread their nets</b><p>Spreading nets signals confident expectation of a catch. The act conveys:<p>&#8226; Preparation&#8212;workers bring gear because they know the waters are productive.<p>&#8226; Stability&#8212;regular fishing replaces the area&#8217;s prior barrenness.<p><a href="/luke/5-1.htm">Luke 5:1&#8211;7</a> shows how obedience and faith meet divine abundance; here, the conditions themselves invite labor.

As healing waters flow from the temple, the once-dead shoreline becomes a thriving fishery stretching from En-gedi to En-eglaim. Fishermen confidently spread their nets, gathering a rich, varied catch comparable to the Mediterranean&#8217;s bounty. The verse showcases God&#8217;s ability to turn utter desolation into abundance, fulfilling His covenant promises and previewing the universal life and prosperity that will mark His coming kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/47.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">From En-gedi even unto En-eglaim.--</span>En-gedi, "the fountain of the goat," is a well-known copious spring about midway on the western coast of the Dead Sea. En-eglaim occurs only here, and has not been certainly identified. St. Jerome speaks of "Engallim" as at the junction of the Jordan with the sea, and near this point there is a fountain now known as <span class= "ital">Ain-el-Feshkhah.</span> Others consider that the dual form of the name indicates "one of the double cities of Moab," thus placing it on the eastern side of the sea, and this seems more probable, since the expression would then be equivalent to "the whole breadth of the sea." Everywhere they shall stretch their nets, and the variety and abundance of the fish shall be as great as in "the great sea," that is, the Mediterranean. This whole verse in regard to the fishermen is a striking illustration of Ezekiel's way of carrying out the most ideal description into detail.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - As another consequence of the inflowing of this river into the Dead Sea, it is stated that <span class="cmt_word">the fishers</span> (rather, <span class="accented">fishers</span>, without the article) should stand upon its banks, <span class="cmt_word">from Engedi, even unto Englaim; there shall be a place to spread forth nets.</span> The Revised Version more correctly renders, <span class="accented">fishers shall stand by it</span>; <span class="accented">from Engedi even unto Eneglaim</span>, <span class="accented">shall be a place for the spreading of nets</span>; or, more literally, a place <span class="accented">of spreading</span>, <span class="accented">out for nets</span> (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/26-5.htm">Ezekiel 26:5</a>).
