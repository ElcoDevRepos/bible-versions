Wheat and barley were common grains in ancient Israel, often used in daily sustenance. Beans and lentils were also staple foods, providing necessary protein. Millet and spelt, though less common, were known in the region. The combination of these ingredients suggests a time of scarcity, as they are mixed together rather than used separately, indicating a lack of abundance. This reflects the impending siege of Jerusalem, where food would be scarce, and people would have to make do with what was available.<p><b>put them in a single container and make them into bread for yourself.</b><br>The act of placing these ingredients in a single container symbolizes the coming together of various elements under duress. Bread, a staple of life, is here made from a mixture of grains and legumes, which would not typically be combined. This signifies the dire circumstances of the siege, where normal food preparation methods are abandoned. The personal instruction to Ezekiel to make this bread "for yourself" emphasizes the prophetic act he is performing, symbolizing the suffering and deprivation that the people of Jerusalem will experience.<p><b>This is what you are to eat during the 390 days you lie on your side.</b><br>The 390 days represent the years of iniquity of the house of Israel, as Ezekiel is commanded to lie on his side for this period to bear their sin. This prophetic action is a vivid illustration of the burden of sin and the consequences that follow. The specific duration underscores the long period of rebellion against God. The act of lying on his side while eating this bread further symbolizes the hardship and judgment that will come upon the people. This period of time also connects to the broader narrative of Israel's history, where prolonged disobedience led to exile and suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

The symbolism seems to have a twofold meaning. We can scarcely exclude a reference to the famine which accompanied the siege.

Starting with the former, the prophet is told to make bread, not of <span class="cmt_word">wheat</span>, the common food of the wealthier class (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/81-16.htm">Psalm 81:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/147-14.htm">Psalm 147:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/12-13.htm">Jeremiah 12:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/41-8.htm">Jeremiah 41:8</a>), nor of <span class="cmt_word">barley</span>, the chief food of the poor (<a href="/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a>; <a href="/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2</a>; <a href="/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9</a>), but of these mixed with <span class="cmt_word">beans</span> (<a href="/2_samuel/17-28.htm">2 Samuel 17:28</a>), <span class="cmt_word">lentils</span> (<a href="/2_samuel/17-28.htm">2 Samuel 17:28</a>; <a href="/genesis/25-34.htm">Genesis 25:34</a>) - then, as now, largely used in Egypt and other Eastern countries - <span class="cmt_word">millet</span> (the Hebrew word is not found elsewhere), and <span class="cmt_word">fitches</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> vetches (here also the Hebrew word is found only in this passage, that so translated in <a href="/isaiah/28-25.htm">Isaiah 28:25-27</a> standing, it is said, for the seed of the black cummin). The outcome of this mixture would be a coarse, unpalatable bread, not unlike that to which the population of Paris was reduced in the siege of 1870-71. This was to be the prophet's food, as it was to be that of the people of Jerusalem during the 390 days by which that siege was symbolically, though not numerically, represented. It is not improbable, looking to the prohibition against mixtures of any kind in <a href="/deuteronomy/22-9.htm">Deuteronomy 22:9</a>, that it would be regarded as in itself unclean. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/4-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But take</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1463;&#1495;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(qa&#7717;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3947.htm">Strong's 3947: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wheat,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1460;&#1496;&#1468;&#1460;&#1441;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;i&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#238;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2406.htm">Strong's 2406: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wheat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">barley,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1440;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#347;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
