It is a solemn oath, underscoring the seriousness of the message. Similar expressions are found throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a> and <a href="/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>, where God swears by His own life, highlighting His unchanging nature and the reliability of His promises.<p><b>because My flock lacks a shepherd</b><br>The imagery of a flock without a shepherd is a common biblical metaphor for people without guidance or leadership. In the historical context, this refers to the leaders of Israel who failed to care for the people. The shepherd motif is prevalent in Scripture, with God often depicted as the ultimate Shepherd (<a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>). This also foreshadows Jesus Christ, who identifies Himself as the Good Shepherd in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, providing the care and leadership that was lacking.<p><b>and has become prey and food for every wild beast,</b><br>This phrase illustrates the vulnerability and danger faced by the people of Israel due to the absence of proper leadership. Wild beasts symbolize the surrounding nations and external threats that took advantage of Israel's weakened state. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic warnings, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/50-17.htm">Jeremiah 50:17</a>, where Israel is described as scattered sheep devoured by lions.<p><b>and because My shepherds did not search for My flock</b><br>The shepherds, representing the leaders and priests of Israel, are criticized for their negligence. They failed in their duty to seek out and care for the people, leading to their dispersion and suffering. This neglect is condemned in other prophetic writings, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/23.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-2</a>, where God promises to punish the shepherds who destroy and scatter His flock.<p><b>but fed themselves instead,</b><br>This phrase highlights the selfishness and corruption of the leaders, who prioritized their own needs over the welfare of the people. This self-serving behavior is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/56-11.htm">Isaiah 56:11</a>, where the leaders are described as greedy dogs who never have enough. This contrasts with the selfless nature of Christ, who came to serve and give His life for the sheep (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and covenant-keeping God of Israel, who speaks with authority and judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flock.htm">The Flock</a></b><br>Represents the people of Israel, God's chosen people, who are in need of guidance and protection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherds.htm">Shepherds</a></b><br>Symbolic of the leaders of Israel, including kings, priests, and prophets, who were responsible for the spiritual and physical well-being of the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wild_beasts.htm">Wild Beasts</a></b><br>Metaphorically represents the enemies and oppressors of Israel who take advantage of the people's vulnerability.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message, serving as a watchman for the house of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_responsibility_of_leadership.htm">The Responsibility of Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders are accountable to God for the care and guidance of those entrusted to them.

In real time, this described Judah&#8217;s scattering among hostile nations after exile.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, wolves still threaten believers with false teaching, persecution, and temptation (<a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29&#8211;30</a>; <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<p>&#8226; God highlights the tragic consequence of absent shepherding&#8212;exposure to every destructive influence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and because My shepherds did not search for My flock</b><p>&#8226; True shepherds pursue the lost (<a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4</a>), bind up the injured, and lead the weary to rest (<a href="/ezekiel/34-4.htm">Ezekiel 34:4, 16</a>).<p>&#8226; These leaders, however, ignored their mandate. They watched the scattering without lifting a finger (<a href="/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Neglect, not mere incompetence, is the charge. Divine discipline soon follows, because God&#8217;s heart is always to seek and save (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but fed themselves instead</b><p>&#8226; Instead of laying down their lives for the sheep, they gorged on the flock&#8217;s resources (<a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Self-indulgent leadership is a perennial danger&#8212;leaders who &#8220;all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-21.htm">Philippians 2:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast with the Good Shepherd could not be sharper: Jesus &#8220;lays down His life for the sheep,&#8221; unlike the hired hand who cares only for himself (<a href="/john/10-12.htm">John 10:12&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/34-8.htm">Ezekiel 34:8</a> sets the courtroom scene: the living God swears an oath against faithless shepherds who left His flock leaderless, vulnerable, and plundered. The accusation is twofold&#8212;neglect and self-indulgence. Because shepherds failed, sheep suffered. God&#8217;s sworn response assures both judgment on corrupt leaders and, as the chapter unfolds, His own intervention as the true Shepherd. The verse calls every leader to faithful oversight and every believer to trust the Shepherd who never abandons His flock.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/34-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8216;As surely as I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1436;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">live,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;ay-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2416.htm">Strong's 2416: </a> </span><span class="str2">Alive, raw, fresh, strong, life</span><br /><br /><span class="word">declares</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1443;&#1501;
