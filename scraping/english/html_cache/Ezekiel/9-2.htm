The "six men" are often interpreted as angelic beings or agents of God's judgment. The "Upper Gate" likely refers to a gate in the temple complex in Jerusalem, emphasizing the sacredness of the location. The direction "north" is significant as it was often associated with the origin of invaders and judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>). Historically, the Babylonians, who were instruments of God's judgment on Judah, came from the north.<p><b>each with a weapon of slaughter in his hand</b><br>The "weapon of slaughter" symbolizes the impending judgment and destruction. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic literature where God uses agents to execute His judgment (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>). The presence of weapons underscores the seriousness and inevitability of the divine decree against Jerusalem due to its idolatry and sin.<p><b>With them was another man clothed in linen who had a writing kit at his side</b><br>The "man clothed in linen" is often seen as a figure of purity and holiness, possibly an angel or a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ. Linen garments were worn by priests (<a href="/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39-42</a>), indicating a role of intercession or mediation. The "writing kit" suggests a role of recording or marking, reminiscent of the Passover where the blood marked the houses of the faithful (<a href="/exodus/12-7.htm">Exodus 12:7</a>). This figure's task is to mark those who grieve over the city's sins, sparing them from judgment.<p><b>And they came in and stood beside the bronze altar</b><br>The "bronze altar" was located in the temple courtyard and used for sacrifices (<a href="/exodus/27.htm">Exodus 27:1-8</a>). Its mention here highlights the connection between sacrifice, atonement, and judgment. The altar's presence in the vision underscores the seriousness of the people's failure to uphold the covenant, as sacrifices were meant to maintain the relationship between God and Israel. The standing beside the altar may symbolize the readiness to execute judgment, as the altar was a place of both atonement and divine justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/six_men.htm">Six Men</a></b><br>These are likely angelic beings or agents of God's judgment, each carrying a weapon of destruction.

They halt at the bronze altar, highlighting that the rejected means of sacrifice now testifies against Jerusalem. The scene assures us that God&#8217;s justice is thorough, His mercy precise, and His word completely reliable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">One man among them was clothed with linen.</span>--He was <span class= "ital">among </span>them, but not of them. There were six with weapons, and this one without a weapon formed the seventh, thus making up the mystical number so often used in Scripture. He was "clothed in linen," the ordinary priestly garment, and the special garment of the high priest at the ceremonies on the great Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16); yet also used by others, and on other occasions, simply as a garment of purity and of distinction (comp. <a href="/daniel/10-5.htm" title="Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:">Daniel 10:5</a>), so that there is no need here to suppose a priestly character attached to this one. He carried in his girdle the "inkhorn," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the little case, containing pens, knife, and ink, commonly worn by the Oriental scribe. There is no occasion to understand this person either, on the one hand, as a representation of the Babylonian god Nebo, "the scribe of heaven," nor, on the other, as is done by many commentators, of our Lord. There is nothing mentioned which can give him any special identification. He is simply a necessity of the vision, an angelic messenger, to mark out those whose faithfulness to God amid the surrounding evil exempts them from the common doom (comp. <a href="/revelation/7-3.htm" title="Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.">Revelation 7:3</a>). This party are seen coming "from the way of the higher gate." The courts of the Temple were built in stages, the innermost the highest. This, then, was the gate of the inner court, and was on the north, both as the place where the prophet had been shown the idolatries, and as the quarter from which the Chaldaean destruction was poured out upon the nation. They took their station "beside the brazen altar," as the central point at once of the true worship of Israel and of the present profanation of that worship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, six men</span>, etc. The man clothed with linen brings the number up to the sacred number seven, as in <a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16, 20</a>; <a href="/revelation/15-6.htm">Revelation 15:6</a>. He is over them rather than among them, and answers to the scribe who appears so frequently in Assyrian sculptures, as the secretary who counts the prisoners that have been taken in battle. They come from the north, the region from which the vision of <a href="/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a> had come, in which, in the nearer vision of <a href="/ezekiel/8-4.htm">Ezekiel 8:4</a>, the prophet had seen the same glorious presence. They appear, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as issuing from the Divine presence to do their work of judgment. Possibly. as in <a href="/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a>, there may be an allusive reference to the fact that the Chaldeans, as the actual instruments of their judgment, came from the same region. The gate in question was built by Jotham (<a href="/2_kings/15-35.htm">2 Kings 15:35</a>). The captain of the band is arrayed in the "white linen" of the hosts of heaven and of the priests on earth (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> in the LXX.; comp. <a href="/leviticus/6-10.htm">Leviticus 6:10</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/44-17.htm">Ezekiel 44:17</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-6.htm">Daniel 12:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A writer's inkhorn.</span> Through all the changes of Eastern life this has been the outward sign of the scribe's office. Here it is obviously connected with the oft-recurring thought of the books of life and death in the chancery of heaven (<a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>; <a href="/psalms/69-28.htm">Psalm 69:28</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>). It was to be the work of this scribe (ver. 4) to mark such as were for death to death, such as were for life to life. The LXX., misunderstanding the Hebrew, or following a different text, gives, not "a writer's inkhorn," but "a girdle of sapphire." With all the precision of one who knew every inch of the temple courts, the priest-prophet sees the visitants take their station beside the brazen altar, probably, as they came from the north, on the north side of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And I saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
