The raising of voices and bitter crying is a common expression of grief in the Bible, seen in other passages such as <a href="/jeremiah/48-38.htm">Jeremiah 48:38</a> and <a href="/lamentations/2-18.htm">Lamentations 2:18</a>. The lamentation is not just a personal sorrow but a communal expression, indicating the widespread impact of Tyre's downfall. The bitterness of the cry underscores the depth of loss and the recognition of Tyre's significant role in the region's economy and culture.<p><b>They will throw dust on their heads and roll in ashes.</b><br>Throwing dust on one's head and rolling in ashes are traditional signs of mourning and repentance in ancient Near Eastern cultures, including Israel. This practice is seen in other biblical accounts, such as <a href="/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a> and <a href="/joshua/7-6.htm">Joshua 7:6</a>, symbolizing humility, grief, and a return to the earth. The imagery of dust and ashes conveys a sense of desolation and ruin, fitting for the context of Tyre's destruction. It also serves as a physical manifestation of inner sorrow and contrition, often associated with repentance and seeking divine mercy. This act connects to the broader biblical theme of recognizing human frailty and the need for God's intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tyre.htm">Tyre</a></b><br>An ancient and wealthy city-state located on the Mediterranean coast, known for its trade and commerce.
