In the prophetic books, such direct speech underscores the importance of the message being conveyed. The use of "LORD" in all caps signifies the covenant name of God, Yahweh, highlighting His relationship with Israel.<p><b>This is how the Israelites will eat their defiled bread</b><br>The "defiled bread" symbolizes the unclean and impure conditions the Israelites will face in exile. In Levitical law, food purity was crucial, and eating defiled bread would have been abhorrent to the Israelites. This phrase foreshadows the loss of religious and cultural identity due to their disobedience. It also reflects the broader theme of judgment and purification found throughout the prophetic literature.<p><b>among the nations</b><br>This indicates the dispersion of the Israelites, known as the Diaspora, which was a result of their unfaithfulness to the covenant. Being "among the nations" implies living in foreign lands with different customs and religions, which would challenge their identity and faith. This dispersion is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, seen in the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles.<p><b>to which I will banish them</b><br>The act of banishment is a direct consequence of Israel's persistent idolatry and rebellion against God. It reflects the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to exile. This phrase underscores God's sovereignty and justice, as well as His role as the ultimate judge of His people. The concept of banishment also points to the hope of eventual restoration, as seen in later prophecies of return and renewal.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

God&#8217;s consistent pattern is to speak before He strikes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is how the Israelites will eat</b><p>- The acted-out drama explains &#8220;how&#8221; exile life will look. Ezekiel had just been told to bake bread on rationed fuel (<a href="/ezekiel/4-9.htm">Ezekiel 4:9&#8211;12</a>), portraying daily survival under siege.<p>- <a href="/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a> had foretold that disobedience would reduce the people to &#8220;serve your enemies &#8230; in hunger, thirst, nakedness, and lacking everything&#8221;. Now the predicted scarcity is visualized.<p>- The statement also anticipates the sadness of <a href="/psalms/137-1.htm">Psalm 137:1</a>&#8212;exiles forced to eat, drink, and sing in a foreign land.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>their defiled bread</b><p>- &#8220;Defiled&#8221; signals ceremonial uncleanness.

Judgment is purposeful, aimed at eventual restoration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/4-13.htm">Ezekiel 4:13</a> is God&#8217;s sober declaration that His people&#8217;s sin will lead to exile, scarcity, and ritual uncleanness. Each phrase underscores a facet of that reality: the LORD speaks with final authority; the people&#8217;s daily bread becomes a picture of humiliation; defilement replaces holiness; life unfolds among foreign nations; and all of it happens under God&#8217;s sovereign hand. Even so, the verse hints at hope: the One who scatters also promises to gather, purify, and restore.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles.</span>--The Mosaic law purposely so hedged the people about with detailed precepts in regard to their food and its preparation, that it was impossible for them to share the food of the Gentiles without contracting ceremonial defilement; and the declared object of this symbolism is to teach that the Israelites should thus be forced to contract defilement. Their sins had brought them to that pass, which is so often the result of continued and obdurate sin, that it should be impossible for them to avoid further transgression. Ezekiel shows by his reply, in <a href="/ezekiel/4-14.htm" title="Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul has not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.">Ezekiel 4:14</a>, that like St. Peter, in <a href="/acts/10-14.htm" title="But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.">Acts 10:14</a>, he had ever been a scrupulous observer of the law. To St. Peter, however, it was made known that in the breadth of the Christian dispensation this ceremonial law was now done away, while to Ezekiel it still remained in full force.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even thus shall the children of Israel</span>, etc. The strange command takes a wider range. It symbolizes, not the literal horrors of the siege, but the "defiled bread" which even the exiles would be reduced to eat. So taken, the words remind us of the risk of eating unclean, food, which almost inevitably attended the position of the exiles (<a href="/hosea/9-3.htm">Hosea 9:3</a>; <a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a>), and which, it may be, Ezekiel had already tell keenly. There is obviously something more than can be explained by a reference to "the bitter bread of banishment," or to Dante's "Come sa di sale... " ('Par.,' 17:58). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/4-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
