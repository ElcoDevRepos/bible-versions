In ancient Near Eastern architecture, entrances often symbolized access to the divine presence. The number ten can also represent completeness or divine order in biblical numerology, suggesting the perfection of God's design.<p><b>and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on each side</b><br>The sides of the entrance being five cubits (approximately 7.5 feet) on each side indicate a balanced and symmetrical design, which is a common feature in sacred architecture. The number five can symbolize grace or God's goodness, possibly highlighting the grace extended to those entering the temple. This symmetry may also reflect the order and harmony of God's creation.<p><b>He also measured the length of the outer sanctuary to be forty cubits</b><br>The outer sanctuary's length of forty cubits (approximately 60 feet) is significant, as the number forty often represents a period of testing, trial, or preparation in the Bible, such as the forty years in the wilderness or Jesus' forty days of fasting. This measurement may symbolize the preparation required to enter into God's presence or the journey of faith.<p><b>and the width to be twenty cubits</b><br>The width of twenty cubits (approximately 30 feet) complements the length, creating a rectangular space that is conducive to worship and reverence. The number twenty can symbolize a period of waiting or expectation, possibly indicating the anticipation of God's presence.
