The Israelites were explicitly forbidden from such practices (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>). The act of sacrificing children to idols like Molech was a grave sin, demonstrating the depth of Israel's apostasy. This practice was not only a violation of God's commandments but also a profound moral corruption, showing the extent to which the Israelites had adopted pagan customs. The timing, "on the very day," underscores the immediacy and audacity of their sin, indicating a complete disregard for the sanctity of life and God's law.<p><b>they entered My sanctuary to profane it</b><br>Entering the sanctuary after committing such abominations was a direct defilement of God's holy place. The sanctuary, or temple, was where God's presence dwelled among His people (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>). By entering it in a state of spiritual impurity, the Israelites were desecrating what was meant to be a place of worship and holiness. This act of entering the sanctuary after engaging in idolatry and child sacrifice was a blatant act of hypocrisy and disrespect. It reflects a misunderstanding or disregard for the holiness required to approach God, as outlined in the laws of purity and worship (<a href="/leviticus/19-30.htm">Leviticus 19:30</a>, <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>).<p><b>Yes, they did this inside My house</b><br>The repetition and emphasis in this phrase highlight the severity of the offense. "My house" refers to the temple, which was considered the dwelling place of God on earth (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-13</a>). The temple was central to Israelite worship and identity, symbolizing God's covenant relationship with His people. By committing such acts within the temple, the Israelites were not only violating the physical space but also the spiritual covenant with God. This act of profanation is reminiscent of other instances in scripture where the temple was defiled, such as in the time of King Manasseh (<a href="/2_kings/21-4.htm">2 Kings 21:4-7</a>). It serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of turning away from God and the importance of maintaining the sanctity of worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who was called to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/oholah_and_oholibah.htm">Oholah and Oholibah</a></b><br>Symbolic names for Samaria and Jerusalem, representing the Northern and Southern Kingdoms of Israel, respectively.

Hypocrisy in the church or in personal devotion repeats the sin Ezekiel decried.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/23-39.htm">Ezekiel 23:39</a> exposes a brazen double life&#8212;child sacrifice to idols in the morning, temple attendance in the afternoon. God calls this timing, behavior, and place an unholy mixture that profanes His name. Genuine worship requires wholehearted devotion; any attempt to blend unrepentant sin with acts of piety insults the God who is both loving and holy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/23-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On the very</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(bay&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they slaughtered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1469;&#1489;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1496;&#1464;&#1444;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#353;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;&#7789;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7819.htm">Strong's 7819: </a> </span><span class="str2">To slaughter, beat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their children</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for their idols,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1490;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7713;il&#183;l&#363;&#183;l&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1544.htm">Strong's 1544: </a> </span><span class="str2">A log, an idol</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they entered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1447;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">My sanctuary</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(miq&#183;d&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4720.htm">Strong's 4720: </a> </span><span class="str2">A consecrated thing, place, a palace, sanctuary, asylum</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to profane it.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7717;al&#183;l&#601;&#183;l&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Piel - Infinitive construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2490.htm">Strong's 2490: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bore, to wound, to dissolve, to profane, to break, to begin, to play</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Yes,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
