In biblical context, the "choicest" often refers to offerings that are pure and without blemish, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>. This selection underscores the severity of the judgment coming upon Jerusalem, as even the most esteemed will not be spared. Historically, the leaders and influential figures were often the first to face consequences during times of national crisis.<p><b>and pile the fuel beneath it.</b><br>The act of piling fuel suggests intensifying the heat, symbolizing the intensification of God's judgment. In ancient Near Eastern practices, fuel was often wood or dried dung, used to sustain a strong fire. This imagery is consistent with the prophetic theme of purification through fire, as seen in <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>, where fire refines and purifies. The piling of fuel indicates a deliberate and thorough process, emphasizing the completeness of the impending judgment.<p><b>Bring it to a boil</b><br>Boiling represents the process of judgment reaching its peak. In the cultural context, boiling was a method used to prepare sacrifices, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/2-13.htm">1 Samuel 2:13-14</a>. This imagery suggests that the judgment is not only thorough but also transformative, as boiling changes the state of the contents. The boiling pot is a recurring symbol in Ezekiel, representing Jerusalem under siege (<a href="/ezekiel/11-3.htm">Ezekiel 11:3-12</a>), indicating the city's impending destruction and the purging of its impurities.<p><b>and cook the bones in it.</b><br>Cooking the bones signifies the totality of the judgment, leaving nothing untouched. In ancient practices, bones were often used to make broth, extracting every bit of nourishment, symbolizing the exhaustive nature of God's judgment. This phrase connects to the idea of complete consumption, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/19-11.htm">Jeremiah 19:11</a>, where the breaking of a pot signifies irreversible destruction. The bones, often seen as the last remnants, being cooked, indicate that no part of the community will escape the purifying judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, called to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city symbolized by the cooking pot, representing the impending judgment and destruction due to the people's unfaithfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flock.htm">The Flock</a></b><br>Represents the people of Israel, particularly the leaders and those considered the best among them, who are subject to God's judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cooking_pot.htm">The Cooking Pot</a></b><br>A metaphor for Jerusalem, where the people are being "cooked" or judged for their sins.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_siege.htm">Babylonian Siege</a></b><br>The historical event during which Jerusalem was besieged and eventually destroyed by the Babylonians, fulfilling the prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_judgment.htm">Understanding God's Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is not arbitrary but a response to persistent sin and rebellion.

The word for "burn" means, as is shown in the margin, <span class= "ital">heap, </span>and is a noun. This is taken by many with a verb implied, in the sense of "make a heap of wood to burn the bones." On the other hand, the sense of the text is that given in most of the ancient versions, and it is certain that bones, before the fat is extracted, may be used for fuel. It is better, therefore, to translate quite literally, <span class= "ital">heap the bones under it, </span>leaving the same ambiguity as in the original as to whether the bones are to be burned upon the fuel or themselves used for fuel. In either case, the bones are those which are left after <span class= "ital">"</span>the good pieces" have been put into the cauldron.
