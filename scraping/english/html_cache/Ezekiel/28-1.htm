The phrase "the word of the LORD" is a common expression in the prophetic books, indicating that the message originates from God Himself, emphasizing its authority and truth. In the context of Ezekiel, this phrase underscores the prophet's role as a mouthpiece for God, delivering messages of judgment and hope to the people of Israel during their Babylonian exile. The phrase "came to me" highlights the personal nature of the revelation, suggesting that God communicates directly with His chosen prophets. This direct communication is a hallmark of the prophetic tradition, seen throughout the Old Testament, where God speaks to individuals like Moses, Isaiah, and Jeremiah. The phrase "saying" introduces the specific content of the message, which in this chapter, addresses the pride and impending judgment of the prince of Tyre. This sets the stage for a broader discussion on themes of human pride, divine sovereignty, and the ultimate accountability of nations and leaders before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of God's word.

The story isn&#8217;t random; it&#8217;s part of a continuous narrative that reveals God&#8217;s orderly plan (see <a href="/exodus/1-1.htm">Exodus 1:1</a>, where &#8220;And&#8221; likewise links into a larger account).<p>- &#8220;And&#8221; reminds us that God&#8217;s revelation unfolds step-by-step. Each new word builds on what has already been spoken, echoing <a href="/isaiah/28-10.htm">Isaiah 28:10</a>&#8212;&#8220;precept upon precept&#8230; line upon line.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the word of the LORD</b><p>- Not Ezekiel&#8217;s ideas, but God&#8217;s own utterance. This underscores divine authorship and absolute authority (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16&#8211;17</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>).<p>- Because it is the LORD&#8217;s word, it carries the same weight today as when first spoken. Compare with <a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>, &#8220;Your word, O LORD, is everlasting.&#8221;<p>- Throughout Scripture, whenever &#8220;the word of the LORD&#8221; appears, judgment or hope invariably follows (e.g., <a href="/jonah/1-1.htm">Jonah 1:1</a>; <a href="/1_kings/17-8.htm">1 Kings 17:8</a>). Here it signals a forthcoming oracle against pride.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>came to me</b><p>- God initiates; Ezekiel receives. Prophets are messengers, not originators (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4&#8211;9</a>).<p>- The phrase underscores personal responsibility. Ezekiel must steward what he hears, just as Paul later affirms, &#8220;Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-16.htm">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>).<p>- It also highlights intimacy: the Creator approaches a human servant, reflecting the pattern seen in <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>&#8212;&#8220;Surely the Lord GOD does nothing without revealing His plan to His servants the prophets.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying</b><p>- God speaks with clarity and purpose, not in vague impressions (<a href="/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>).<p>- The participle cues the reader to listen carefully; what follows is weighty and specific (see <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God promises His word &#8220;will accomplish what I please&#8221;).<p>- It anticipates a direct confrontation with the prince of Tyre, mirroring earlier prophetic addresses to earthly rulers such as Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/5-1.htm">Exodus 5:1</a>) and Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/28-1.htm">Ezekiel 28:1</a> may appear to be merely an introductory line, yet every phrase carries rich meaning. The connecting &#8220;And&#8221; roots the verse in God&#8217;s unfolding narrative. &#8220;The word of the LORD&#8221; grounds it in divine authority, &#8220;came to me&#8221; highlights God&#8217;s initiative toward a chosen messenger, and &#8220;saying&#8221; prepares us for a clear, purposeful declaration. Together they assure us that what follows is God&#8217;s infallible verdict, reinforcing our confidence in Scripture&#8217;s reliability and inviting us to receive His message with humble, obedient hearts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - From the city the prophet passes to its ruler, who concentrated in himself whatever was most arrogant and boastful in the temper of his people. He is described here as a" prince," in Ver. 12 as "king," and the combination of the two words points probably to some peculiarity of the Tyrian constitution. "Prince" it will be remembered, is constantly used by Ezekiel of Zedekiah (<a href="/ezekiel/7-27.htm">Ezekiel 7:27</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/12-20.htm">Ezekiel 12:20</a>, <span class="accented">el al</span>.). The King of Tyro at the time was Ithobal or Ethbaal III. (Josephus, 'Contra Apion,' 1:21), who had taken part with Pharaoh-Hophra and Zedekiah in the league against Nebuchadnezzar, Ezekiel's description of what one may call his self-apotheosis may probably have rested on a personal knowledge of the man or of official documents. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/28-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the word</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#601;&#183;&#7687;ar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to me,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1463;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;lay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saying,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;&#1502;&#1465;&#1469;&#1512;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#183;m&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/28-1.htm">Ezekiel 28:1 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/28-1.htm">Ezekiel 28:1 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/28-1.htm">Ezekiel 28:1 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/28-1.htm">Ezekiel 28:1 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/28-1.htm">Ezekiel 28:1 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/28-1.htm">Ezekiel 28:1  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/28-1.htm">Ezekiel 28:1 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/28-1.htm">Ezekiel 28:1 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/28-1.htm">Ezekiel 28:1 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/28-1.htm">Ezekiel 28:1 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/28-1.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 28:1 The word of Yahweh came again (Ezek.
