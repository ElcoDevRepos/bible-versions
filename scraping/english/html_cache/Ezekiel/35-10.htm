In biblical context, words often reveal the heart's intentions (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>). The Edomites, descendants of Esau, harbored animosity towards Israel, descendants of Jacob, reflecting the ancient sibling rivalry (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>).<p><b>&#8216;These two nations and countries will be ours, and we will possess them,&#8217;</b><br>The "two nations" refer to Israel and Judah, which were divided after Solomon's reign (1 Kings 12). Edom's desire to possess these lands indicates opportunistic aggression, taking advantage of Israel's weakened state post-exile. Historically, Edom sought to expand its territory during Judah's Babylonian captivity, reflecting a common practice of seizing land during times of vulnerability.<p><b>even though the LORD was there,</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine presence in Israel, despite their exile. Theologically, it affirms God's covenantal promise to dwell with His people (<a href="/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45</a>). The presence of the LORD signifies protection and ownership, making Edom's claim not just against Israel, but against God Himself. This echoes the theme of God's sovereignty and His ultimate plan for restoration, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/ezekiel/37.htm">Ezekiel 37</a>, where God promises to reunite and restore Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother.

It is not necessary, with the LXX. and Kliefoth, to read "is there," to guard against the supposition that Ezekiel designed to suggest that, though Jehovah had formerly been in the land, he was there no longer. But, in point of fact, Jehovah had for a time withdrawn his visible presence from the temple and the city (see <a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/11-22.htm">Ezekiel 11:22, 23</a>), though he had by no means renounced his right to the land; and Edom's error lay in not regarding this, but in acting as if Jehovah had departed from Israel for ever (Havernick); or (better, "and") in thinking he could appropriate to himself what really belonged to Jehovah, viz. the territory out of which Israel and Judah had been cast (Hengstenberg). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/35-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3282.htm">Strong's 3282: </a> </span><span class="str2">Heed, purpose, to indicate the reason, cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you have said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1440;&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;m&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct &#124;
