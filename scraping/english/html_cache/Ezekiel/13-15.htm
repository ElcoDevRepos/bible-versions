The "wall" symbolizes the false sense of security that these prophets provided to the people of Israel. In ancient times, walls were crucial for a city's defense, and a poorly constructed or deceitfully maintained wall would lead to disaster. The act of "whitewashing" represents covering up flaws or presenting something as secure when it is not. This imagery is used to criticize the false prophets who assured the people of peace and safety when destruction was imminent. The wrath of God here is a response to the betrayal of trust and the misleading of His people, similar to the judgment pronounced in <a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16-17</a> against those who speak visions from their own minds.<p><b>I will say to you: &#8216;The wall is gone, and so are those who whitewashed it&#8212;</b><br>This statement signifies the complete destruction of both the false security and those who propagated it. The removal of the wall indicates the exposure of the falsehood and the vulnerability of the people without God's true protection. The phrase "so are those who whitewashed it" underscores the accountability of the false prophets. Historically, this reflects the fall of Jerusalem and the failure of its leaders to heed true prophetic warnings, as seen in the events leading to the Babylonian exile. Theologically, it serves as a warning against false teachings and the importance of discerning truth, echoing the New Testament warnings in <a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a> about false prophets. This passage also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and the establishment of truth through Christ, who is the cornerstone of a spiritual house built on truth and righteousness (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.
