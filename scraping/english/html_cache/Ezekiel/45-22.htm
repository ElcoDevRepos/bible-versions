In the context of Ezekiel's vision, it points to the future restoration of Israel and the establishment of a new temple system. The phrase "on that day" often signifies a prophetic or eschatological event in the Bible, indicating a time when God's plans are fulfilled.<p><b>the prince shall provide</b><br>The "prince" in Ezekiel's vision is a leader or ruler, distinct from the high priest or king. This figure is often seen as a type of Christ, representing a leader who is both political and spiritual. The prince's role in providing offerings suggests a responsibility for the spiritual welfare of the people, similar to the role of a shepherd. This can be connected to the Messianic prophecies where Jesus is depicted as both king and priest.<p><b>a bull as a sin offering</b><br>The bull as a sin offering is significant in the Levitical sacrificial system, representing atonement for sin. In Leviticus, a bull was used for the sin offering of the high priest or the whole congregation, indicating its importance and the gravity of sin. This offering symbolizes the need for purification and reconciliation with God. The use of a bull here underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for a substantial sacrifice.<p><b>for himself</b><br>The inclusion of the prince offering a sacrifice for himself highlights the human nature and fallibility of the prince, distinguishing him from the sinless Christ. It reflects the Old Testament practice where even leaders and priests needed atonement for their sins. This act of humility and acknowledgment of personal sin is crucial for leadership in a biblical context.<p><b>and for all the people of the land</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the communal aspect of atonement and the collective responsibility for sin. It reflects the biblical principle that leaders intercede on behalf of their people, similar to the role of Moses or the high priest. The offering for "all the people" signifies the inclusivity of God's covenant and the need for national repentance and restoration. This communal aspect is echoed in the New Testament, where Christ's sacrifice is for all humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prince.htm">The Prince</a></b><br>In the context of Ezekiel, the prince is a leader or ruler who has responsibilities in the restored temple worship.

Other prophetic passages use the same wording to point to a real, future moment when the LORD acts decisively (cf. <a href="/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Here it anchors the ordinance to the millennial worship system <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40&#8211;48</a> describes&#8212;a literal future temple and priesthood after Christ&#8217;s return (compare <a href="/ezekiel/43-7.htm">Ezekiel 43:7</a>, &#8220;This is the place of My throne&#8230;&#8221;).<p>&#8226; By marking &#8220;that day,&#8221; God underlines that His redemptive plan moves toward a definite fulfillment, giving certainty and hope to His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the prince shall provide</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The prince&#8221; is a human leader, distinct from both Messiah and the priests, repeatedly mentioned in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/44.htm">Ezekiel 44&#8211;48</a> (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/44-3.htm">Ezekiel 44:3</a>; 46:16).<p>&#8226; He functions as Israel&#8217;s civil head during the Millennium, a Davidic ruler under Messiah&#8217;s ultimate kingship (see <a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23&#8211;24</a>; 37:24&#8211;25).<p>&#8226; His obligation to &#8220;provide&#8221; reveals servant leadership: he supplies what worshipers need rather than demanding it from them&#8212;foreshadowing the Christ-like model of authority (cf. <a href="/matthew/20-25.htm">Matthew 20:25-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a bull as a sin offering</b><p>&#8226; A literal animal sacrifice is envisioned, consistent with the detailed sacrificial system in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40&#8211;46</a>.<p>&#8226; These offerings will not compete with Christ&#8217;s once-for-all atonement (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>); rather, they will memorialize it, just as the Lord&#8217;s Supper presently looks back to the cross.<p>&#8226; The bull&#8212;a costly animal&#8212;underscores the gravity of sin and the richness of God&#8217;s provision, echoing earlier patterns (<a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for himself</b><p>&#8226; Even this exalted prince needs cleansing. <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a> reminds us, &#8220;all have sinned.&#8221;<p>&#8226; His personal participation guards against any notion that human leaders stand above the need for forgiveness (cf. <a href="/leviticus/9-7.htm">Leviticus 9:7</a>, where Aaron also offered first for himself).<p>&#8226; By taking the lead in repentance, he models humility and accountability for the nation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and for all the people of the land</b><p>&#8226; The offering covers the entire covenant community, reflecting God&#8217;s heart to forgive collectively as well as individually (<a href="/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24-28</a>).<p>&#8226; It fulfills the mediatorial role civil rulers were always meant to play&#8212;protecting, representing, and blessing the people (<a href="/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; This shared sacrifice bonds prince and people together in unity under God, anticipating the universal worship pictured in <a href="/zechariah/14-16.htm">Zechariah 14:16-19</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/45-22.htm">Ezekiel 45:22</a> points to a real future day when Israel&#8217;s prince will personally furnish a costly sin offering, acknowledging his own need and that of the entire nation.

But the sacrifices are in many respects quite different. Nothing is said of the Paschal lamb itself: but this may be because it was understood as a matter of course. The sin offering by the Mosaic law (<a href="/numbers/28-17.htm" title="And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.">Numbers 28:17</a>; <a href="/numbers/28-22.htm" title="And one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you.">Numbers 28:22</a>) was to be a he-goat for each day; here, a bullock for the first day, and a he-goat for the other days (<a href="/ezekiel/45-23.htm" title="And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering.">Ezekiel 45:23</a>). The burnt offering by the law was to be two bullocks, a ram, and seven yearling lambs for each day; here, seven bullocks and seven rams. The meat offering was to be three-tenths of an ephah of meal, mixed with oil, for each bullock, two-tenths for each ram, and one-tenth for each lamb, or one and a half ephahs in all daily; here, a whole ephah for each victim, making in all fourteen ephahs daily and as many hins of oil (<a href="/ezekiel/45-24.htm" title="And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah.">Ezekiel 45:24</a>). The offerings required here therefore are much richer than under the law.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - The first day of the feast proper, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the fourteenth, should be distinguished by the prince's presenting, <span class="cmt_word">for himself and for all the people of the land, a bullock for a sin offering.</span> That this was a deviation from the earlier Mosaic legislation in three particulars is apparent. In, the first place, the "sin offering" here prescribed was manifestly to take precedence of the Paschal feast proper, whereas in the Paschal festival of the so-called priest-code the daffy sacrifices were appointed to begin on the fifteenth after the Paschal lamb had been slain and eaten (<a href="/leviticus/23-8.htm">Leviticus 23:8</a>). In the second place, the sin offering was to consist of a bullock instead of a he-goat as formerly (<a href="/numbers/28-22.htm">Numbers 28:22</a>). In the third place, it was not intended to be renewed on each of the seven following days of the feast, but was designed, by repeating the sacrifice of the first and seventh days, to connect these with the fourteenth, on which the feast proper opened. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/45-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
