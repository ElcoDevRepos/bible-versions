In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/18.htm">Ezekiel 18</a>, the focus is on individual accountability rather than inherited guilt. This reflects a shift from the collective punishment seen in earlier parts of the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, where the sins of the fathers affect the children. The emphasis here is on personal responsibility, aligning with <a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>, which states that children are not to be put to death for their fathers' sins.<p><b>who sees all the sins his father has committed</b><br>The son is aware of his father's sins, indicating a conscious recognition and understanding of wrongdoing. This awareness is crucial for the decision-making process. In the ancient Near Eastern context, family and community played significant roles in shaping one's identity and actions. However, the text underscores the importance of individual discernment and moral judgment. This awareness is akin to the wisdom literature in Proverbs, which often contrasts the paths of the wise and the foolish.<p><b>considers them</b><br>The act of considering implies a thoughtful and deliberate reflection on the father's actions. This suggests a process of evaluation and moral reasoning. In biblical terms, this aligns with the call to meditate on God's law, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>. The ability to consider and choose wisely is a theme throughout Scripture, highlighting the role of free will and the importance of aligning one's actions with God's commandments.<p><b>and does not do likewise</b><br>The decision not to follow in the father's sinful footsteps demonstrates the son's exercise of free will and personal responsibility. This choice reflects the biblical principle that each person is accountable for their own actions, as seen in <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>. It also echoes the call to repentance and transformation found in the New Testament, where believers are urged to turn away from sin and live righteously. This decision can be seen as a type of Christ, who, though aware of humanity's sin, chose a path of righteousness and obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.

The first generation was righteous (<a href="/ezekiel/18-5.htm">Ezekiel 18:5-9</a>), the second was wicked (18:10-13), and now a grandson enters the picture. Scripture consistently teaches that each soul stands personally before God&#8212;&#8220;Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor children for their fathers; each is to die for his own sin&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>). God&#8217;s justice is perfectly individual, yet His mercy spans generations for those who love Him (<a href="/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>).<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; Family history influences but does not imprison.<p>&#8226; God always keeps a door open for a fresh start (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who sees all the sins his father has committed</b><p>The grandson is not ignorant; he &#8220;sees&#8221; the pattern of violence, idolatry, and exploitation spelled out in verses 10-13. Exposure to sin can harden the heart (<a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a>), yet it can also awaken a holy revulsion. The Spirit often uses painful observation to stir repentance, much like when Josiah &#8220;heard the words of the Law&#8221; and tore his robes (<a href="/2_kings/22-11.htm">2 Kings 22:11</a>).<p>Helpful reflections:<p>&#8226; Sin is never private; it always educates the next generation (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Witnessing evil creates a decisive moment&#8212;imitate or reject (<a href="/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>considers them</b><p>The Hebrew idea is thoughtful, deliberate evaluation. <a href="/psalms/119-59.htm">Psalm 119:59</a> puts it this way: &#8220;I considered my ways and turned my steps to Your testimonies&#8221;. The grandson weighs the consequences he has watched unfold&#8212;broken relationships, divine judgment&#8212;and he lets that sober reality reshape his path.

Ezekiel later describes his choices&#8212;he avoids idolatry, oppression, and violence, and instead practices justice and mercy (18:15-17). God affirms, &#8220;He will not die for his father&#8217;s iniquity; he will surely live&#8221; (18:17). Personal repentance cancels inherited guilt, echoing <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>: &#8220;If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.&#8221;<p>Practical encouragement:<p>&#8226; Biblical obedience is possible even in a corrupt environment (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The fruit of the Spirit replaces the works of the flesh (<a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-23</a>).<p>&#8226; God delights to honor those who break generational chains (<a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/18-14.htm">Ezekiel 18:14</a> showcases God&#8217;s unwavering commitment to individual accountability and His generous readiness to bless fresh obedience.

The general principle is the same, that each man is to be judged according to his own individual character. The son of the righteous man has advantages, and the son of the wicked has hindrances in the way of righteousness which are not specified here, although elsewhere we are abundantly taught that responsibility is directly proportioned to privilege; but here the object is only to set forth in the clearest way, and apart from any other issues, the single fact of individual responsibility. In each case the particular examples of sin are somewhat varied, to show that they are mentioned only as examples, in order to set forth more clearly the general principle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now, lo!</span> etc. The law of personal responsibility had been pressed on its darker side.
