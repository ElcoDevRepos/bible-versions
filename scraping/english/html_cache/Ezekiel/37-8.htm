It emphasizes the role of the prophet as a witness to God's miraculous work. Ezekiel's visions often involve him being an observer of divine actions, highlighting the importance of prophetic revelation in understanding God's plans.<p><b>tendons appeared on them</b><br>The appearance of tendons signifies the beginning of the reassembly and restoration process. In the context of the vision of the dry bones, tendons represent the initial stage of bringing life and structure back to what was once dead. This can be seen as a metaphor for the restoration of Israel, as God begins to reestablish the nation after its spiritual and physical desolation.<p><b>flesh grew</b><br>The growth of flesh on the bones symbolizes further progress in the restoration process. Flesh represents the physical substance and vitality necessary for life. This imagery can be connected to the promise of renewal and revival for the people of Israel, as God promises to restore them not only spiritually but also physically and nationally.<p><b>and skin covered them</b><br>The covering of skin completes the physical restoration of the bodies, making them whole. Skin serves as a protective layer and signifies the completion of the physical form. This can be seen as a type of the completeness and protection that God offers to His people, ensuring their full restoration and future security.<p><b>but there was no breath in them</b><br>Despite the physical restoration, the absence of breath indicates that true life has not yet been restored. In biblical terms, breath often symbolizes the Spirit of God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a> where God breathes life into Adam. This highlights the necessity of the Holy Spirit for true life and spiritual revival. The prophecy points to the future outpouring of the Spirit, which is essential for the complete restoration and renewal of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, Ezekiel is the one receiving the vision of the valley of dry bones.

(<a href="/ezekiel/37-8.htm">Ezekiel 37:8</a>) reminds us that Ezekiel is an eyewitness to God&#8217;s supernatural work.<p>&#8226; The prophet does nothing but observe; all the action is God-initiated, echoing <a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13&#8211;14</a> where Israel must &#8220;stand firm and see the salvation of the LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Like <a href="/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5</a>, Ezekiel is called to &#8220;look&#8221; and be astonished at the Lord&#8217;s power over impossible situations&#8212;dry bones in Babylonian exile are no match for the Creator.<p>Application: Our role often begins with watching in faith while God moves.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Tendons appeared on them</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;tendons appeared on them&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; God reconnects what was hopelessly scattered. <a href="/job/10-11.htm">Job 10:11</a> describes how the Lord &#8220;clothed me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews,&#8221; confirming His intimate knowledge of the body.<p>&#8226; The literal regathering of Israel is pictured here; <a href="/jeremiah/31-8.htm">Jeremiah 31:8&#8211;9</a> foretells the Lord bringing His people &#8220;from the land of the north,&#8221; binding them into one nation again.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, <a href="/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a> speaks of the body &#8220;supported and knit together by its joints and ligaments, growing with a growth that is from God.&#8221; Only divine power supplies the connective tissue of life and unity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Flesh grew</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;flesh grew&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Structure alone is not enough; God now adds substance. <a href="/isaiah/49-14.htm">Isaiah 49:14&#8211;17</a> counters Zion&#8217;s fear of being forgotten by portraying the LORD as a mother who will never forsake her child&#8212;He will give real, tangible restoration.<p>&#8226; This stage hints at national renewal: <a href="/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1&#8211;2</a> promises that after two days He will revive Israel, &#8220;on the third day He will raise us up.&#8221; The flesh points to vitality returning to a once-dead people.<p>&#8226; Personally, <a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4&#8211;5</a> declares that while we were &#8220;dead in trespasses,&#8221; God made us alive together with Christ, giving us spiritual &#8220;flesh&#8221;

and seeing my &#8220;unformed substance,&#8221; affirming His detailed craftsmanship here in the valley.<p>&#8226; Nationally, this pictures Israel gaining protective identity once more, matching <a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a>, where God calls His people &#8220;the apple of His eye.&#8221;<p>&#8226; For every believer, <a href="/revelation/3-18.htm">Revelation 3:18</a> urges us to receive &#8220;white garments&#8221; from Christ so that our shame is covered&#8212;a vivid parallel to the Lord clothing these bodies.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But there was no breath in them</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;but there was no breath in them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The vision deliberately pauses; bodies without breath are still lifeless. <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a> shows that when God formed Adam, life only began when He &#8220;breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.&#8221; The same pattern is set here.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/37-9.htm">Ezekiel 37:9&#8211;10</a> follows with the command, &#8220;Come, O breath,&#8221; proving that physical restoration is only part one; spiritual revival is essential.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/20-22.htm">John 20:22</a> illustrates this truth in the New Covenant when Jesus breathed on His disciples and said, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Without the Spirit, form has no function.<p>Takeaway: Organization, culture, even religion may exist, but without the Holy Spirit there is no true life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/37-8.htm">Ezekiel 37:8</a> portrays a step-by-step miracle: God lets His prophet watch as scattered bones gain tendons, flesh, and skin&#8212;yet remain breathless. The verse underscores three truths: the LORD alone initiates restoration, He rebuilds both structure and substance, and ultimate life arrives only when His Spirit enters. Literally, the passage guarantees Israel&#8217;s future resurrection and return; personally, it urges every believer to seek more than outward form&#8212;to welcome the breath of God that brings authentic, Spirit-empowered life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/37.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">No breath in them.--</span>The restoration of the dry bones to life is described as taking place in two stages, with evident reference to the record of the creation of man in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm" title="And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.">Genesis 2:7</a>.
