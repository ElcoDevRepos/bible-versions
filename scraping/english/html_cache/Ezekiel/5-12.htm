The division into thirds symbolizes a complete and thorough judgment. Plague and famine were common consequences of siege warfare in the ancient Near East, as seen in the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem. This judgment echoes the curses outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25-26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-21.htm">Deuteronomy 28:21-24</a>, where disobedience to God's covenant results in such calamities. The use of "within you" indicates that these events will occur inside the city, emphasizing the inescapability of God's judgment.<p><b>a third will fall by the sword outside your walls</b><br>This part of the prophecy foretells the fate of those who attempt to escape the city during the siege. Historically, the Babylonian army, led by King Nebuchadnezzar, was known for its military prowess and ruthlessness, as documented in <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25:1-7</a>. The "sword" symbolizes warfare and death, a common biblical motif for divine judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>). The phrase "outside your walls" suggests that even those who flee will not find safety, highlighting the totality of the impending destruction.<p><b>and a third I will scatter to every wind and unleash a sword behind them</b><br>This final portion of the prophecy indicates the dispersion of the remaining population, a common practice by conquering empires to prevent rebellion. The scattering "to every wind" signifies exile and loss of homeland, as seen in the Babylonian captivity (<a href="/2_kings/25-11.htm">2 Kings 25:11</a>). The "sword behind them" suggests ongoing pursuit and danger, even in exile, underscoring the relentless nature of divine judgment. This scattering fulfills earlier warnings given by prophets like Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>) and foreshadows the eventual return and restoration, a theme later explored in <a href="/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24</a>. The scattering also prefigures the dispersion of the Jewish people throughout history, yet with a promise of eventual regathering, as seen in the New Testament's spiritual gathering of believers in Christ (<a href="/john/11-52.htm">John 11:52</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, called to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city under judgment, representing the center of Israel's spiritual and political life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are facing divine judgment due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/plague,_famine,_and_sword.htm">Plague, Famine, and Sword</a></b><br>Instruments of God's judgment, symbolizing the comprehensive nature of the punishment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/scattering.htm">Scattering</a></b><br>The dispersion of the Israelites among the nations, indicating both punishment and the potential for future restoration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin has severe consequences, and God's judgment is a response to persistent disobedience.

Each calamity literally occurred during Babylon&#8217;s conquest, proving the reliability of Scripture and underscoring that sin&#8217;s wages are real.
