In the context of ancient Near Eastern architecture, gateways were significant as they served both functional and symbolic purposes. They were points of entry and exit, but also represented transition from the secular to the sacred. The flanking structures could have been guardrooms or chambers for temple personnel, emphasizing the importance of order and sanctity in approaching God's presence. This imagery can be connected to the idea of Jesus as the "gate" or "door" in <a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>, symbolizing the way to salvation and access to God.<p><b>and corresponded to the length of the gates;</b><br>The phrase indicates a precise architectural measurement, suggesting that the design of the temple was intentional and divinely inspired. The correspondence in length highlights the symmetry and orderliness of God's dwelling place, reflecting His nature. This meticulous design can be seen as a foreshadowing of the New Jerusalem described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>, where the city is measured and perfectly proportioned, symbolizing God's perfect plan and the harmony of His kingdom.<p><b>this was the lower pavement.</b><br>The lower pavement refers to a specific level or area within the temple complex. Pavements in ancient temples were often made of stone and served as foundational elements, providing stability and structure. The mention of a "lower" pavement suggests a tiered or hierarchical design, which could symbolize the different levels of access to God's presence, much like the outer and inner courts of the temple. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are described as living stones being built into a spiritual house (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>), indicating the foundational role of Christ and His followers in God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the detailed vision of a new temple in chapters 40-48.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_vision.htm">The Temple Vision</a></b><br>This vision, given to Ezekiel, describes a future temple with precise measurements and structures, symbolizing God's presence and order.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pavement.htm">The Pavement</a></b><br>In the vision, the pavement is part of the temple's outer court, indicating a place of approach and preparation for worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gateways.htm">The Gateways</a></b><br>These are the entrances to the temple complex, symbolizing access to God's presence and the orderliness of His design.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lower_pavement.htm">The Lower Pavement</a></b><br>This specific area of the temple court, mentioned in the verse, highlights the detailed and structured nature of God's plans.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_order_and_precision.htm">God's Order and Precision</a></b><br>The detailed description of the temple, including the pavement, reflects God's nature as a God of order.

These flanks remind us that service happens right at the threshold (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/44-11.htm">Ezekiel 44:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Corresponded to the length of the gates</b><p>&#8226; The pavement areas match the gate length exactly.
