Historically, the Israelites were exiled to Assyria and Babylon, fulfilling prophecies of judgment. This dispersion is significant as it sets the stage for the eventual gathering and restoration of Israel, a recurring theme in prophetic literature.<p><b>they profaned My holy name,</b><br>The Israelites' actions among the nations brought dishonor to God's name. In biblical culture, a name represents one's character and reputation. By failing to live according to God's laws, the Israelites misrepresented Him to the surrounding nations. This profaning of God's name is a serious offense, as it contradicts the purpose of Israel being a light to the Gentiles (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<p><b>because it was said of them,</b><br>This phrase highlights the perception of the surrounding nations. The actions of the Israelites led to a negative testimony about God. The nations observed Israel's defeat and exile and questioned the power and faithfulness of their God, which was contrary to the intended witness of God's people.<p><b>&#8216;These are the people of the LORD,</b><br>This statement acknowledges the unique covenant relationship between God and Israel. Despite their unfaithfulness, they were still recognized as belonging to the LORD. This identity was meant to reflect God's holiness and sovereignty, but their actions led to a contradiction of this identity.<p><b>yet they had to leave His land.&#8217;</b><br>The land of Israel was a significant part of God's covenant with His people, symbolizing His promise and blessing. Being forced to leave the land was a direct consequence of their disobedience and a fulfillment of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.

Yet the very shame that seemed to disprove God&#8217;s faithfulness became the backdrop for His greater vindication, as He later promised to gather, cleanse, and renew His people so &#8220;the nations will know that I am the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/36-23.htm">Ezekiel 36:23, 24</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">When they said to them</span>.--We are not here to understand that the Israelites profaned God's name among the heathen in the way spoken of in <a href="/romans/2-24.htm" title="For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.">Romans 2:24</a>, though this also may have been done; but they profaned it by the very fact of their captivity, the consequence of their former sins. The heathen regarded Jehovah as merely the national God of the Israelites, and seeing them dispersed, in distress, and in captivity, concluded that He was unable to protect them. Hence, for the vindication of His name (<a href="/context/ezekiel/36-21.htm" title="But I had pity for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, where they went.">Ezekiel 36:21-24</a>) God would restore His people to their land.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They profaned my holy Name</span>; or, <span class="accented">the name of my holiness</span>. According to Kliefoth, the subject of the verb is "the heathen," but expositors generally regard it as "the house of Israel" of ver. 17. Plumptre thinks that "while grammatically the words may refer to either the heathen or the exiles of Israel, possibly the sentence was purposely left vague, so as to describe the fact in which both were sharers," and cites in support of this view similar constructions in <a href="/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a> and <a href="/romans/2-24.htm">Romans 2:24</a>. What led to the profanation of Jehovah's Name by the heathen was the arrival among them, not of the news of the calamity which had befallen Israel (Kliefoth, Hengstenberg), but of the house of Israel itself; and the actual profanation lay in this, that, having beheld the exiles, they said, <span class="cmt_word">These are the people of the Lord, and they are gone forth out of his land.</span> As the heathen recognized only local divinities, they concluded Jehovah had either behaved capriciously towards his people and east them off (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/23-40.htm">Jeremiah 23:40</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Jeremiah 29:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-24.htm">Jeremiah 33:24</a>), or had proved unequal to the task of protecting them so that they had been driven off (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/20-5.htm">Ezekiel 20:5</a>, etc.; <a href="/numbers/14-16.htm">Numbers 14:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-9.htm">Jeremiah 14:9</a>). In either case, the honor of Jehovah had been lessened in the minds and tarnished by the words of the heathen, and inasmuch as this result had been brought about by Israel's sin, on Israel properly the blame lay. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And wherever</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">among the nations</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#333;&#183;w&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
