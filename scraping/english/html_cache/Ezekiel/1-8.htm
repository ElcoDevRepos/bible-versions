In biblical symbolism, hands often represent power and action (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). The four sides suggest completeness and universality, indicating that God's reach and influence extend in all directions. This imagery aligns with the vision's overall theme of God's omnipresence and omnipotence. The combination of wings and hands suggests both the swiftness of divine action and the careful, deliberate nature of God's work.<p><b>All four living creatures had faces and wings,</b><br>The four living creatures, each with faces and wings, are reminiscent of the cherubim described in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-8</a> and <a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>. These beings serve as guardians of God's holiness and are often associated with His throne, emphasizing His majesty and sovereignty. The multiple faces may symbolize the multifaceted nature of God's creation and His dominion over all aspects of life. The wings indicate mobility and the ability to swiftly carry out God's will, reinforcing the theme of divine authority and presence. The number four often represents universality in the Bible, suggesting that these creatures embody the entirety of creation serving and worshiping God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book and the recipient of the visions described.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>These are the living creatures described in Ezekiel's vision, often associated with the presence and glory of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The place of exile for the Israelites, where Ezekiel received his visions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision_of_god's_glory.htm">The Vision of God&#8217;s Glory</a></b><br>This is the broader context of <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>, where Ezekiel sees a vision of God's glory and the heavenly beings that accompany it.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_multifaceted_nature_of_god's_servants.htm">The Multifaceted Nature of God&#8217;s Servants</a></b><br>The presence of human hands under the wings of the cherubim suggests that God's servants are equipped for action and service.

These hands were "under their wings on their four sides." Hence the wings must have been attached at the shoulder.
