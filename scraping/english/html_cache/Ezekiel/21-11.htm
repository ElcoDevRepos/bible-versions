In biblical context, a sword often symbolizes judgment or warfare. The appointment suggests that God has ordained this action, reflecting His sovereignty over nations and events. The polishing of the sword implies readiness and precision, emphasizing the thoroughness of God's judgment. Historically, swords were polished to remove impurities and enhance their effectiveness, symbolizing the purity and inevitability of divine justice.<p><b>to be grasped in the hand</b><br>The imagery of the sword being grasped in the hand signifies action and execution. In ancient warfare, a sword in hand was a sign of imminent battle or judgment. This phrase underscores the immediacy and certainty of the coming judgment. It also reflects the personal responsibility of the one wielding the sword, often seen as a king or leader acting under divine mandate. This can be connected to the role of leaders in executing God's will, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>, where authorities are described as God's servants to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.<p><b>It is sharpened and polished</b><br>The repetition of "sharpened and polished" emphasizes the readiness and lethal nature of the sword. Sharpening a sword makes it more effective in battle, symbolizing the thoroughness and inevitability of God's judgment. This preparation reflects the seriousness of the impending action and the meticulous nature of divine justice. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a warning to those who oppose God's will, urging repentance and alignment with His purposes.<p><b>to be placed in the hand of the slayer</b><br>This phrase identifies the intended use of the sword and the role of the slayer. The "slayer" is often interpreted as an agent of God's judgment, whether a foreign nation, a leader, or a divine messenger. In Ezekiel's context, this likely refers to Babylon as the instrument of God's judgment against Israel. The placement of the sword in the slayer's hand signifies the transfer of authority and the execution of divine justice. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who, in <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, is depicted with a sharp sword coming from His mouth to strike down the nations, symbolizing His ultimate authority and judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, Ezekiel is delivering a message of judgment to the people of Israel.
