The turban, or "mitre," was part of the priestly garments described in <a href="/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39-40</a>, symbolizing the priest's consecration and dedication to God. The head covering also represents submission to divine authority and the covering of human pride, aligning with the broader biblical theme of humility before God.<p><b>and linen undergarments around their waists</b><br>Linen undergarments were prescribed for the priests to maintain modesty and purity, as seen in <a href="/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42</a>. This requirement underscores the importance of holiness in the service of God, as the priests were to be set apart from the common people. The use of linen, a breathable and lightweight fabric, also reflects the practical need for comfort and ease of movement during their duties. This attire can be seen as a type of the righteousness of Christ, which covers believers, as referenced in <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>.<p><b>They must not wear anything that makes them perspire</b><br>This command highlights the principle of serving God without undue physical strain or discomfort, emphasizing the spiritual nature of worship over physical exertion. The avoidance of perspiration symbolizes the absence of human effort in achieving righteousness, pointing to the grace of God rather than works. This can be connected to the New Testament teaching in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, where salvation is described as a gift from God, not a result of human effort. The focus on maintaining a state of rest and peace in God's presence is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, reflecting the ultimate rest found in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.
