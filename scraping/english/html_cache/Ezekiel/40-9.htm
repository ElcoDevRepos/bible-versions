A cubit, generally considered to be about 18 inches, makes this depth approximately 12 feet. This specific measurement underscores the grandeur and significance of the temple structure, which is a central theme in Ezekiel's vision. The temple's dimensions symbolize God's holiness and the separation between the sacred and the profane, a recurring theme in the Old Testament.<p><b>and its jambs were two cubits thick</b><br>The jambs, or side posts, being two cubits thick (approximately 3 feet) indicate the strength and stability of the temple's construction. This thickness suggests a robust and enduring structure, symbolizing the permanence of God's covenant with His people. The use of the number two can also be seen as a symbol of witness or testimony, as seen in other biblical contexts, such as the two tablets of the Law or the two witnesses in Revelation.<p><b>And the portico of the gateway faced the temple</b><br>The orientation of the portico facing the temple signifies the direct approach to God's presence. This alignment highlights the centrality of worship and the importance of approaching God with reverence. The portico, or porch, serves as a transitional space between the outer court and the inner sanctum, symbolizing the journey of faith and the progression towards holiness. This architectural feature can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the way to the Father, as He provides access to the divine presence. The temple's orientation and design reflect the eschatological hope of a restored relationship between God and His people, as prophesied throughout Ezekiel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who was among the exiles in Babylon.

The angelic guide measures a depth of eight cubits&#8212;about twelve feet&#8212;from the outer threshold to the inner end of the gatehouse.<p>&#8226; A precise measurement shows God&#8217;s attention to detail (cf. <a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/28-19.htm">1 Chronicles 28:19</a>). Nothing in His house is left to guesswork.<p>&#8226; The number eight often signals new beginnings&#8212;Noah left the ark with seven others (<a href="/genesis/8-18.htm">Genesis 8:18</a>), and circumcision happens on the eighth day (<a href="/leviticus/12-3.htm">Leviticus 12:3</a>).
