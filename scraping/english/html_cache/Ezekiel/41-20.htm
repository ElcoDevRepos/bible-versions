In the context of the temple, they symbolize divine protection and the holiness of the space. The presence of cherubim in the temple's design echoes their role in the Garden of Eden, where they guarded the way to the Tree of Life (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>). Palm trees, on the other hand, are symbols of victory, peace, and eternal life. Their inclusion in the temple's design may reflect the prosperity and peace that come from God's presence. The combination of cherubim and palm trees suggests a sanctuary that is both protected by divine beings and flourishing with life.<p><b>from the floor to the space above the entrance</b><br>The detailed carvings from the floor to the space above the entrance indicate the comprehensive nature of the temple's decoration, emphasizing the sacredness of the entire structure. This vertical span of decoration signifies that every part of the temple, from the foundation to the highest point, is dedicated to God's glory. The thoroughness of the design reflects the meticulous care and reverence required in worship and the construction of a place where God dwells. This attention to detail can be seen as a call to believers to dedicate every aspect of their lives to God, from the most mundane to the most exalted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the detailed vision of the new temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings often associated with the presence and glory of God, symbolizing divine protection and holiness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/palm_trees.htm">Palm Trees</a></b><br>Symbolic of victory, peace, and eternal life, often used in the Bible to represent prosperity and blessing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_main_hall.htm">The Main Hall</a></b><br>Part of the visionary temple described by Ezekiel, representing the place of worship and the presence of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision_of_the_temple.htm">The Vision of the Temple</a></b><br>A prophetic vision given to Ezekiel, symbolizing God's future restoration and the establishment of His presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_divine_presence.htm">Symbolism of Divine Presence</a></b><br>The cherubim represent God's holiness and His protective presence.

Palm trees picture righteousness, victory, and flourishing life (<a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>; <a href="/john/12-13.htm">John 12:13</a>). By pairing the two, the vision merges holiness with life-giving fruitfulness&#8212;exactly what God intends for His dwelling. Ezekiel had already seen living cherubim in chapter 1, and Solomon&#8217;s temple likewise combined cherubim and palms on its walls (<a href="/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>), confirming continuity in God&#8217;s design.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were carved</b><p>These images are not painted on temporarily; they are cut into the very structure. Carving signifies permanence, craftsmanship, and intentionality (<a href="/exodus/31-1.htm">Exodus 31:1-5</a>). God&#8217;s holiness and the life that flows from Him are meant to be lasting realities, not passing decorations. What He builds, He builds to endure (<a href="/revelation/21-14.htm">Revelation 21:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the wall</b><p>Walls both protect and declare identity. By placing the carvings here, the Lord broadcasts His character to everyone who approaches. The Holy Place in Moses&#8217; tabernacle used fabric curtains, but in this future temple the stone walls themselves proclaim God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the outer sanctuary</b><p>This is the Holy Place&#8212;accessible to priests but outside the Most Holy Place (<a href="/ezekiel/41-1.htm">Ezekiel 41:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-2.htm">Hebrews 9:2</a>). Even in this &#8220;outer&#8221; room, God fills the space with reminders of who He is. Holiness is not restricted to the innermost chamber; it spills outward, inviting all who minister to live in reverent awe.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the floor</b><p>The carvings begin where human feet stand (<a href="/1_kings/6-15.htm">1 Kings 6:15</a>). Every step a priest takes is met by images that call him to righteous, victorious service. Holiness starts at ground level&#8212;where life is walked out&#8212;not merely in lofty theory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the space above the entrance</b><p>The pictures rise all the way to eye-level and beyond, covering the span &#8220;above the entrance.&#8221; Nothing interrupts the testimony: from footing to threshold, God&#8217;s glory is on display (<a href="/psalms/24-7.htm">Psalm 24:7-10</a>). Anyone entering the sanctuary must pass beneath this continuous witness, reminded that access to God is both a privilege and a call to purity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/41-20.htm">Ezekiel 41:20</a> shows a sanctuary saturated with carved cherubim and palm trees&#8212;permanent, public declarations that God is perfectly holy and the source of victorious life. The images stretch from floor to entrance, enveloping every priestly step and every upward glance. In this coming temple, holiness is not hidden away; it is etched into the very walls, inviting all who draw near to worship in awe and to flourish under the guardianship of the living God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/41.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Unto above the</span> <span class= "bld">door.</span>--The height of the door is nowhere mentioned, and therefore there is nothing to determine how high up the carving was carried;
