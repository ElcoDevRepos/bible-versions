The imagery of adultery is frequently used in the Old Testament to describe Israel's unfaithfulness to God (e.g., <a href="/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1-3</a>). The idea of "growing old" in adulteries suggests a long history of infidelity, indicating that Israel's idolatry was not a recent development but a persistent pattern. This reflects the historical context of Israel's repeated alliances with pagan nations and their gods, which led to moral and spiritual decay.<p><b>&#8216;Now let them use her as a prostitute,</b><br>This part of the verse indicates a judgment from God, allowing Israel to face the consequences of her actions. The metaphor of prostitution is used to describe Israel's alliances with foreign nations and their gods, which were often politically and religiously motivated. In the ancient Near Eastern context, prostitution was not only a moral failing but also a symbol of degradation and loss of status. This judgment implies that Israel will be treated with contempt by the very nations she sought after, highlighting the futility and shame of her idolatry.<p><b>for that is all she is!&#8217;</b><br>This concluding phrase underscores the totality of Israel's spiritual degradation. It suggests that Israel's identity has become synonymous with her unfaithfulness, as she has fully embraced the role of a spiritual harlot. This reflects the prophetic theme of identity and consequence, where persistent sin leads to a redefined identity in the eyes of God. Theologically, it serves as a warning about the dangers of persistent sin and the loss of one's intended purpose and calling. This theme is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to remain faithful to Christ, avoiding spiritual adultery (<a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the exiles in Babylon.
