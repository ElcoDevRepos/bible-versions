This title is used frequently in Ezekiel, highlighting his humanity in contrast to the divine messages he delivers. It also foreshadows the use of "Son of Man" as a title for Jesus in the New Testament, emphasizing His role as the representative human.<p><b>mark out two roads for the sword of the king of Babylon to take</b><br>The "sword" symbolizes impending judgment and destruction, often used in prophetic literature to denote war or divine retribution. The king of Babylon, likely Nebuchadnezzar, was a significant figure in the Near Eastern world, known for his military campaigns and the eventual destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. The two roads represent choices or paths of conquest, indicating a decision point for the Babylonian army.<p><b>both starting from the same land</b><br>This suggests a common origin for the paths, likely referring to Babylon or a nearby region. It underscores the idea that the impending judgment is divinely orchestrated, with both paths leading to different outcomes but originating from the same divine purpose. This reflects the sovereignty of God over nations and their leaders, as seen throughout the prophetic books.<p><b>And make a signpost where the road branches off to each city</b><br>The signpost serves as a metaphor for guidance and decision-making, indicating a point of divergence. In ancient times, signposts were crucial for travelers, especially in desert regions where paths were not always clear. The cities likely refer to Jerusalem and Rabbah of the Ammonites, both significant targets for Babylonian campaigns. This imagery of branching paths can also be seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>, where choices lead to life or death, blessing or curse.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

God&#8217;s Word is literal and sure; heed it before the sword arrives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Appoint thee two ways.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">set before thee. </span>The prophet is directed to represent Nebuchadnezzar as about to go forth with his armies, and hesitating whether he should take first the road to Jerusalem or to the capital of the Ammonites. His choice of the former is determined, as he supposes, by his divinations, but really by the overruling hand of the Lord, who thus shows beforehand what it shall be. The whole is set forth in the vivid and concrete imagery so characteristic of Ezekiel; but it is impossible that the scene in real life was to be thus determined by the prophet's open interference. The whole is a vision, in which life and action is conveyed by this manner of describing the course of future events as actually taking place before the eyes of his hearers. The two ways "come forth out of one land;" their starting-point is the same. Babylon, and they diverge towards different destinations.<p><span class= "bld">Choose thou a place.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">make a hand </span>or, as we say, <span class= "ital">a finger-post. </span>The verb here used never means "choose," nor does the noun ever mean "place" but the verb is often used both in the sense of <span class= "ital">to make </span>and <span class= "ital">to engrave, </span>and "hand" frequently occurs in the sense of a pillar, and occasionally in that of a guide post. (See <a href="/1_samuel/15-12.htm" title="And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.">1Samuel 15:12</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/18-18.htm" title="Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called to this day, Absalom's place.">2Samuel 18:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-5.htm" title="Even to them will I give in my house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.">Isaiah 56:5</a>.) The prophet in vision sets up this guide-post to direct the king on his march. The roads to Rabbah and to Jerusalem from Babylon would be the same for many hundred miles. It is impossible, therefore, to suppose that Ezekiel actually stood at their parting.<p><span class= "bld">Head of the way, </span>called more poetically in <a href="/ezekiel/21-21.htm" title="For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.">Ezekiel 21:21</a> "mother of the way," is the point where the road forks. From this point the road to Jerusalem would lie on the right, that to Rabbah, the capital of the Ammonites, on the left.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/21-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Now you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
