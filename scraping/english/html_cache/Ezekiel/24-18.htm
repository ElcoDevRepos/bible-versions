Speaking in the morning suggests a time of new beginnings or revelations. Morning was a common time for public gatherings, making it an ideal time for Ezekiel to address the people. This phrase indicates the urgency and importance of the message he was delivering, as mornings were typically associated with the start of daily activities and communal life.<p><b>and in the evening my wife died</b><br>The death of Ezekiel's wife is a significant personal tragedy, yet it serves as a symbolic act within his prophetic ministry. In the cultural context, the evening was a time of rest and reflection, contrasting with the morning's activity. The suddenness of her death underscores the abruptness of God's impending judgment on Jerusalem. This event parallels the destruction of the temple, which was deeply cherished by the Israelites, much like Ezekiel's wife was to him. The personal loss reflects the communal loss that the Israelites would experience.<p><b>And the next morning I did as I had been commanded</b><br>Ezekiel's obedience to God's command, despite his personal grief, highlights his role as a faithful prophet. This act of compliance serves as a powerful testimony to the Israelites, demonstrating the importance of prioritizing God's will over personal desires. The command likely involved refraining from traditional mourning practices, which would have been a shocking deviation from cultural norms. This obedience is reminiscent of other biblical figures who followed God's commands despite personal cost, such as Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac. It also prefigures Christ's obedience to the Father, even unto death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, called to deliver messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Accordingly, on the following morning the strange conduct which had been commanded him was observed by the people; their curiosity is awakened, and, rightly surmising that there must be some especial significance in the strange doings of their prophet, they come to inquire the meaning of his actions. In reply (<a href="/context/ezekiel/24-20.htm" title="Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 24:20-24</a>), he announces again the destruction of the Temple, and that in the depth of sorrow and trouble at its fall there shall be no outward show of mourning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So I spake unto the people in the morning</span>, etc. In yet another way the calling of the prophet superseded the natural impulses of the man. He knew that his wife's hours were numbered, yet the day was spent, not in ministering at her deathbed, but in one last effort to impress the teachings of the time upon the seared consciences and hardened hearts of his countrymen and neighbors.
