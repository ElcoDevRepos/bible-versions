The expanse is reminiscent of the firmament described in <a href="/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6-8</a>, which separates the waters above from the waters below. In Ezekiel's vision, it serves as a boundary between the earthly realm and the divine presence, emphasizing the transcendence and holiness of God.<p><b>was the likeness of a throne</b><br>The throne symbolizes authority, sovereignty, and divine rule. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, thrones were often associated with kingship and divine judgment. This imagery is consistent with other biblical visions of God's throne, such as in <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a> and <a href="/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2</a>, where God's majesty and authority are central themes.<p><b>with the appearance of sapphire</b><br>Sapphire, a precious stone, is often associated with beauty, purity, and heavenly glory. In <a href="/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>, the pavement under God's feet is described as being like sapphire, indicating a connection to divine presence and holiness. The use of sapphire here underscores the splendor and majesty of God's throne.<p><b>and on the throne high above</b><br>The phrase "high above" emphasizes the exalted position of the throne, signifying God's supreme authority and the separation between the divine and human realms. This elevation is a common biblical motif, highlighting God's transcendence and the reverence due to Him.<p><b>was a figure like that of a man</b><br>This figure is often interpreted as a theophany, a visible manifestation of God. The human-like appearance suggests a connection to the incarnation of Christ, who is both fully God and fully man.

The constant repetition of the words "likeness" and "appearance" is very striking throughout this vision. They occur five times in this verse, and four times in each of the two following. The prophet thus labours to make it plain that what he saw was not the realities of existing things, but certain symbolic representations given for the purpose of producing their fitting impression upon the mind. It is especially important to remember this in connection with "the <span class= "ital">likeness </span>as the <span class= "ital">appearance </span>of a man" "upon the <span class= "ital">likeness </span>of the throne." It was not the Divine Being Himself whom Ezekiel saw, but certain appearances to impress upon him the character and attributes of Him whom "no man hath seen, nor can see."<p><span class= "bld">The appearance of a man</span>--As in the case of the cherubim the form of a man, as the highest known in nature, was made the groundwork to which all their peculiarities were attached, so here, in rising to something still higher, the same basis must be retained in the impossibility of anything better; only that which is added is more vague, as being incapable of any definite description, Yet possibly there may be even her a hint at the great truth of the incarnation.

In the visions of St John (<a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>, and <span class="accented">passim</span>) it is the dominant, central object throughout. <span class="cmt_word">As the appearance of a sapphire stone.</span> The intense blue of the sapphire has made it in all ages the natural symbol of a heavenly purity. Ezekiel's vision reproduces that of <a href="/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>. It appears among the gems of the high priest's breastplate (<a href="/exodus/28-18.htm">Exodus 28:18</a>; <a href="/exodus/39-11.htm">Exodus 39:11</a>) and in the "foundations" of <a href="/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19</a>. The description of the sapphire given by Pliny ('Hist. Nat.,' 37:9), as "never transparent, and refulgent with spots of gold," suggests lapis lazuli. As used in the Old Testament, however, the word probably means the sapphire of modern jewellery (Braun, 'De Vest. Sacerd.,' p. 630, edit. 1680). <span class="cmt_word">A likeness as of the appearance of a man.</span> The throne, the symbol of the sovereignty of God over the "living creatures" and the "wheels," over the forces and the laws which they represented, is not empty. There was "a likeness as of the appearance" (we note again the accumulation of words intended to guard against the thought that what was seen was more than an approximate symbolism) "of a man." In that likeness there was the witness that we can only think of God by reasoning upward from all that is highest in our conceptions of human greatness and goodness, and thinking of them as free from their present limitations. Man's highest thought of God is that it is "a face like his face that receives him." He finds a humanity in the Godhead. It is noticeable that this preluding anticipation of the thought of the Incarnation, not recognized in the vision of Moses (<a href="/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>) or Isaiah (Isaiah 6:1), appears prominently in the two prophets of the exile - here and in the memorable Messianic vision of "One like unto the ['a,' Revised Version] Son of man" in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>. What might have been perilously anthropomorphic in the early stages of the growth of Israel, when men tended to identify the symbol with the thing symbolized, was now made subservient to the truth which underlies even anthropomorphic thought (comp. <a href="/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>). Irenaeus ('Adv. Haer.,' 4:20. 10), it may be noted, dwells on the fact that Ezekiel uses the words, "'haec visio similitudmis gloriae Domini,' ne quis putaret forte eum in his proprie vidisse Deum." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Above</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1431;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;mim&#183;ma&#183;&#8216;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-m &#124;
