The prophet Ezekiel is instructed to communicate God's words directly to the Israelites. This reflects the role of prophets as God's messengers, a common theme throughout the Old Testament. The phrase "Lord GOD" emphasizes the sovereignty and ultimate authority of God, a reminder of His covenant relationship with Israel.<p><b>It is not for your sake that I will act, O house of Israel:</b><br>Here, God clarifies His motivation for action. The Israelites, in exile due to their disobedience, might expect divine intervention for their benefit. However, God makes it clear that His actions are not primarily for their sake. This underscores the concept of grace, where God's actions are not based on human merit but on His own purposes and character.<p><b>but for My holy name:</b><br>God's primary concern is the sanctity and reputation of His name. In biblical times, a name represented one's character and reputation. God's name is holy, set apart, and His actions aim to uphold His holiness. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's desire for His name to be revered and honored among all nations.<p><b>which you profaned among the nations to which you went:</b><br>The Israelites' behavior in exile had brought dishonor to God's name. "Profaned" indicates that they had treated what was sacred as common, failing to live according to God's standards. This phrase highlights the impact of Israel's disobedience not only on themselves but also on God's reputation among the surrounding nations.

Exod. xxxii; Numbers 14; Deuteronomy 9. This is the constant burden of God's teaching to His people throughout their history. Hence it is an idle objection to the Scripture narrative that it represents Israel as the favourite of heaven, and is thus just like the human legends of every other ancient nation. In fact, this narrative is unlike any other. It speaks of God as having chosen one nation as the means of accomplishing His purpose for the salvation of the whole world, but continually chastising them for their sins, again and again setting aside the mass of them, and restoring and purifying and blessing a remnant, not for their own sake, but for the accomplishment of His own holy purpose and promise, thus sanctifying His name.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Not for your sakes... but for mine holy Name's sake</span>. Thus Jehovah repudiates the claim of merit on Israel's part (comp. ver. 32); and if Israel had no claim on Jehovah for deliverance from the Babylonish exile any more than she had at first to be put in possession of Canaan (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6</a>), much less has fallen man a claim on God for salvation from the condemnation and dominion of sin (<a href="/romans/11-6.htm">Romans 11:6</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-10</a>). As the essential holiness and righteousness of God were the real reason of Israel's exile and dispersion among the nations, so were these qualities in God the ultimate grounds to which Israel's recovery and restoration should be traced. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1438;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3651.htm">Strong's 3651: </a> </span><span class="str2">So -- thus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1502;&#1465;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;m&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the house</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#234;&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
