The "entrance at the side of the gate" suggests a specific, perhaps less conspicuous, access point, emphasizing the sacredness and restricted access to the temple areas. This reflects the holiness and order of God's design, as seen in the detailed temple visions throughout Ezekiel.<p><b>into the holy chambers facing north</b><br>The "holy chambers" are designated areas for the priests, indicating their role in maintaining the sanctity of the temple. The direction "facing north" may have practical implications for temple activities, as well as symbolic meanings, such as judgment or divine presence, as the north is often associated with God's throne (<a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>). The chambers' orientation underscores the organized structure of temple worship and priestly duties.<p><b>which belonged to the priests</b><br>This phrase highlights the exclusive nature of the priestly role in temple service. The priests were set apart for sacred duties, maintaining the temple's holiness and performing sacrifices. This separation underscores the concept of holiness and the need for mediation between God and His people, prefiguring Christ as the ultimate High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>and he showed me a place there at the far western end</b><br>The "far western end" of the chambers may indicate a specific area reserved for particular functions or storage, possibly related to the temple's sacrificial system. The western orientation could symbolize the end or completion, as the sun sets in the west, suggesting fulfillment or finality.

The latter could partake only of the peace offerings, but the priests, in addition to their portion of these, were required to consume the flesh of the sin and trespass offerings, and the greater part of the "meat offerings." The prophet is first shown the rooms for the priests' cooking.
