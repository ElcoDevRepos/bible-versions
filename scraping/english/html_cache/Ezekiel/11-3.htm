In the context of Ezekiel, these individuals are spreading deceptive messages, claiming peace and security when destruction is imminent. This reflects a recurring theme in the Old Testament where false prophets contradict God's true messengers (<a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>, <a href="/1_kings/22-13.htm">1 Kings 22:13-23</a>).<p><b>&#8216;Is not the time near to build houses?</b><br>This rhetorical question suggests a false sense of security and prosperity. The leaders are encouraging the people to settle and build, implying that there is no immediate threat. This is in stark contrast to the warnings given by true prophets like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, who foretold the impending judgment and exile (<a href="/jeremiah/29-5.htm">Jeremiah 29:5-7</a>). The phrase also echoes the false optimism seen in other parts of scripture, where people ignore prophetic warnings (<a href="/isaiah/56-12.htm">Isaiah 56:12</a>).<p><b>The city is the cooking pot,</b><br>This metaphor suggests a sense of protection and containment. The leaders believe that Jerusalem, like a pot, will keep them safe from harm. However, God uses this imagery to convey the opposite message: the city will be a place of judgment where the people will be "cooked" or punished for their sins (<a href="/ezekiel/24-3.htm">Ezekiel 24:3-5</a>). This metaphor is a vivid illustration of the coming siege and destruction.<p><b>and we are the meat.&#8217;</b><br>In this context, the "meat" represents the people of Jerusalem who are complacent and unaware of the impending danger. The leaders' claim that they are the "meat" suggests a sense of privilege and importance, believing they are the choice parts protected within the pot. However, this is a false assurance, as God reveals that they will face judgment. This imagery is later expanded in <a href="/ezekiel/24.htm">Ezekiel 24</a>, where the boiling pot signifies the city's destruction. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the need for true repentance and reliance on God, rather than false security.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the one receiving and conveying God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_elders_of_israel.htm">The Elders of Israel</a></b><br>Leaders among the exiles who are being addressed in this passage.

Yet Jeremiah, writing from Jerusalem, had already told the exiles in Babylon, &#8220;Build houses and settle down&#8221; there, not in Judah (<a href="/jeremiah/29-4.htm">Jeremiah 29:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; By claiming the right time is &#8220;near,&#8221; the leaders contradict Jeremiah&#8217;s prophecy of a seventy-year captivity (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>) and echo the short-lived lies of Hananiah, who promised restoration within two years (<a href="/jeremiah/28-2.htm">Jeremiah 28:2-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Their timing also mocks God&#8217;s warnings, resembling later scoffers who ask, &#8220;Where is the promise of His coming?&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/3-4.htm">2 Peter 3:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The city is the cooking pot, and we are the meat</b><p>&#8226; A cooking pot keeps meat inside; the leaders assume Jerusalem&#8217;s walls will keep them safe while enemies stay outside. In their proverb, the &#8220;meat&#8221; is prized fare, suggesting they view themselves as the protected, choice people of the city.<p>&#8226; God flips the image: &#8220;Set on the pot&#8230; Bring in the pieces of meat&#8230; and pile wood beneath it&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/24-3.htm">Ezekiel 24:3-11</a>).

The very walls they trust will turn into a cauldron for divine wrath.<p>&#8226; Micah had condemned rulers who &#8220;tear the skin from My people&#8221; and &#8220;break their bones&#8230; like meat in a pot&#8221; (<a href="/micah/3-2.htm">Micah 3:2-3</a>). Ezekiel&#8217;s vision shows that same corruption now meeting its reckoning.<p>&#8226; Far from enjoying privilege, these leaders will be &#8220;brought out of the city&#8221; and fall by the sword (<a href="/ezekiel/11-7.htm">Ezekiel 11:7-10</a>), proving that the only true refuge is obedience, not geography or position (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/11-3.htm">Ezekiel 11:3</a> records arrogant leaders persuading Jerusalem to ignore God&#8217;s prophets.

God exposes the lie: the &#8220;pot&#8221; will boil, and the so-called &#8220;choice meat&#8221; will face judgment. The passage reminds us that genuine security rests in trusting the Lord and submitting to His Word, never in self-made assurances or outward fortresses.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">It is not near; let us build houses. </span>-Neither the text nor the marginal reading of the Authorised Version quite accurately represent the original. The expression is literally <span class= "ital">not near to build houses; </span>and it is to be explained by the prophecy and narrative of Jeremiah 29. After the 10,000 (among whom was Ezekiel) had been carried captive--and apparently shortly after--Jeremiah had sent word to the captives to build houses and make themselves comfortable. because the captivity would be long (<a href="/context/ezekiel/11-5.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD fell on me, and said to me, Speak; Thus said the LORD; Thus have you said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.">Ezekiel 11:5-10</a>). This greatly offended the captives; and Shemaiah, a false prophet among them, had consequently sent letters to Jerusalem asking that Jeremiah might be punished for thus prophesying (<a href="/context/ezekiel/11-24.htm" title="Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.">Ezekiel 11:24-25</a>). The princes of the people now appear in Ezekiel's vision as taking up this prophecy of Jeremiah's and contradicting it: "this need of building houses for a long captivity is not near!" In <a href="/context/ezekiel/7-2.htm" title="Also, you son of man, thus said the Lord GOD to the land of Israel; An end, the end is come on the four corners of the land.">Ezekiel 7:2-3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/7-12.htm" title="The time is come, the day draws near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is on all the multitude thereof.">Ezekiel 7:12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/12-23.htm" title="Tell them therefore, Thus said the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say to them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.">Ezekiel 12:23</a>, Ezekiel expressly declares that it is very near. The princes further confirmed the people in their fancied security by comparing the city to a caldron, the strong walls of which should protect the flesh within it, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the people, from the fire of all hostile attack. In the prophecy of <a href="/ezekiel/24-6.htm" title="Why thus said the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall on it.">Ezekiel 24:6</a> this figure is taken up, and a very different application given to it; it is also turned against them immediately in <a href="/ezekiel/11-7.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Your slain whom you have laid in the middle of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the middle of it.">Ezekiel 11:7</a>. In consequence of this attitude and these sayings of the princes, the prophecy of <a href="/context/ezekiel/11-5.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD fell on me, and said to me, Speak; Thus said the LORD; Thus have you said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.">Ezekiel 11:5-12</a> is now directed against them. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is not near,</span> etc. The words take their place among the popular, half-proverbial sayings of which we have other examples in <a href="/ezekiel/8-12.htm">Ezekiel 8:12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/9-9.htm">Ezekiel 9:9</a>; and Ezekiel 18:2. As in most proverbs of this kind, the thought is condensed to the very verge of obscurity, and the words have received very different interpretations. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That suggested by the Authorized Version. "It (the judgment of which the true prophets spoke) is not near. Let us build houses, not, as Jeremiah bids (Jeremiah 39:5), in the land of exile, but here in Jerusalem, where we shall remain in safety. Are we threatened with the imagery of the 'seething pot' (<a href="/jeremiah/1-13.htm">Jeremiah 1:13</a>)? Let us remember that the caldron protects the meat in it from the fire. The walls of the city will protect us from the army of the Chaldeans." The temper which clothed itself in this language was that of the self-confident boastful security of <a href="/jeremiah/28-3.htm">Jeremiah 28:3</a>; and the death of Hananiah, the son of Azur, in that history presents a parallel to that of Pelatiah in this. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Grammatically, however, the rendering of the Revised Version is preferable: <span class="accented">The time is not near for building houses</span>; probably, as before, with a reference to Jeremiah's advice. "We," they seem to say, "are not come to that plaint yet. We will trust, as in (1), in our interpretation of the caldron." <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> On the whole, I incline, while adopting the Revised Version rendering, to interpret the words, as Smend takes them, as the defiant utterance of despair: "It is no time for building houses, here or elsewhere. We are doomed. We are destined (I borrow the nearest analogue of modern proverbial speech) 'to stew in our own juice.' Well, let us meet it as we best may."
