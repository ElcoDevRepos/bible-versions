The prophet Ezekiel is acting as a mouthpiece for God, underscoring the importance of the message. This is a common prophetic formula found throughout the Old Testament, indicating that the words are not of human origin but are divinely inspired.<p><b>Although I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries:</b><br>This refers to the Babylonian exile, a pivotal event in Israel's history where the people of Judah were taken captive and dispersed. This scattering was a result of their disobedience and idolatry, fulfilling warnings given by earlier prophets. The dispersion among the nations is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, seen as both punishment and a means of purification.<p><b>yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries to which they have gone:</b><br>Despite the physical destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, God promises to be a spiritual sanctuary for His people even in exile. This reflects the idea that God's presence is not confined to a physical location. The concept of God as a sanctuary foreshadows the New Testament understanding of believers' bodies as temples of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>). It also points to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who provides a spiritual sanctuary for believers. The phrase "for a little while" suggests a temporary situation, hinting at future restoration and return to the land, aligning with prophecies of return and renewal found in other parts of Ezekiel and the prophetic books.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites, often involving visions and symbolic acts.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exiles.htm">The Exiles</a></b><br>The Israelites who have been taken captive and scattered among various nations due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The primary location of the Israelite exile, representing both a place of punishment and a place where God continues to work with His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign deity who speaks through Ezekiel, emphasizing His control over the events and His continued presence with His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanctuary.htm">Sanctuary</a></b><br>A term used to describe God's presence and protection, even when the physical temple in Jerusalem is inaccessible to the exiles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_exile.htm">God's Sovereignty in Exile</a></b><br>Even in judgment, God remains in control.

The verse invites every believer&#8212;wherever scattered&#8212;to trust the Lord&#8217;s sovereign discipline, lean into His intimate presence, and anticipate the promised gathering when exile gives way to home.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Therefore say.</span>--These words, again repeated in <a href="/ezekiel/11-17.htm" title="Therefore say, Thus said the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.">Ezekiel 11:17</a>, refer to what the people of Jerusalem had said in <a href="/ezekiel/11-15.htm" title="Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, the men of your kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: to us is this land given in possession.">Ezekiel 11:15</a>.

The connection points to the former as the true sense; for a little while, during the term of their captivity, God's presence with them spiritually would be instead of the outward symbolical presence in His Temple. The contrast is striking. God has already said that he would abandon the Temple, and give up Jerusalem to destruction, and cast out its people; but now to the exiles, scattered among the heathen, He would Himself be for a sanctuary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet will</span> <span class="cmt_word">I be unto them as a little sanctuary</span>; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">a little while</span>, as marking that the state described was transient and provisional. For a time, Ezekiel and the exiles were to find the presence of Jehovah manifested as in the vision of Chebar (<a href="/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4-28</a>), or felt spiritually, and this would make the spot where they found themselves as fully a holy place as the temple had been. There also they would have a "house of God." But this was not to be their permanent lot. There was to be a restoration to "the land of Israel" (ver. 17; <a href="/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21</a>), to the visible sanctuary, to a second temple no longer desecrated by the pollutions that had defiled the first. As with all such prophecies, the words had "springing and germinant accomplishments." In <a href="/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a>, we have Ezekiel's ideal vision of their fulfilment. A literal but incomplete fulfilment is formed in the work of restoration achieved by Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, and the hopes then cherished by Haggai and Zechariah. A more complete but less literal fulfilment appears in the Church of Christ as the true Israel of God (<a href="/galatians/6-16.htm">Galatians 6:16</a>), and in the Jerusalem which is above (<a href="/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26</a>). In the fact that in the seer's vision of that heavenly city there is no temple, but the presence of "the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb" <a href="/revelation/21-22.htm">Revelation 21:22</a>), we find the crowning development of Ezekiel's thought. Intermediate expansions are found <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in the gradual substitution of the synagogue for the temple in the religious life of Israel; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in our Lord's words to the woman of Samaria (<a href="/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21-24</a>); and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in his promise that where two or three are gathered together in his Name, there he would be in the midst of them (<a href="/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>). The thought that it is the presence of Jehovah that makes the sanctuary, not the sanctuary that secures the presence, Ezekiel may have learnt from the fate of Shiloh (<a href="/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/11-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3651.htm">Strong's 3651: </a> </span><span class="str2">So -- thus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">declare</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1502;&#1465;&#1431;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;m&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that this is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1469;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_136.htm">Strong's 136: </a> </span><span class="str2">The Lord</span><br /><br /><span class="word">GOD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1460;&#1492;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3069.htm">Strong's 3069: </a> </span><span class="str2">YHWH</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;Although</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I sent them far away</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1511;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hir&#183;&#7717;aq&#183;t&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - first person common singular &#124;
