The "mountain heights" often symbolize places of divine revelation and authority, such as Mount Sinai or Mount Zion. In biblical prophecy, mountains can represent kingdoms or significant spiritual truths. The planting indicates a deliberate act of God to restore and establish His people, reminiscent of the promises of restoration found in <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a> and <a href="/micah/4.htm">Micah 4:1-2</a>. This imagery also foreshadows the coming of the Messiah, who would be established in Israel as a spiritual leader and king.<p><b>so that it will bear branches;</b><br>The bearing of branches suggests growth, expansion, and vitality. In biblical symbolism, branches often represent descendants or followers, as seen in the metaphor of the vine and branches in <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>. This growth is indicative of the flourishing of God's kingdom and the spread of His influence. The imagery of branches also connects to the prophecy of the "Branch" in <a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, a messianic title referring to Jesus Christ, who would come from the line of David.<p><b>it will yield fruit</b><br>Yielding fruit is a common biblical metaphor for producing good works, righteousness, and the results of a life aligned with God's will. In the context of Israel, it signifies the nation's return to faithfulness and the blessings that follow obedience to God. This phrase echoes the fruitfulness promised to those who abide in Christ, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>, where the fruit of the Spirit is described.<p><b>and become a majestic cedar.</b><br>The cedar tree is a symbol of strength, durability, and grandeur. In the ancient Near East, cedars were highly valued for their quality and longevity, often used in temple construction, such as Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-9.htm">1 Kings 6:9-10</a>). The majestic cedar represents the establishment of a strong and enduring kingdom, pointing to the eternal reign of Christ. This imagery aligns with the prophetic vision of the kingdom of God, which will stand forever, as described in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>.<p><b>Birds of every kind will nest under it,</b><br>This phrase suggests inclusivity and protection, indicating that people from all nations will find refuge and community within God's kingdom. The imagery of birds nesting is reminiscent of the parable of the mustard seed in <a href="/matthew/13-31.htm">Matthew 13:31-32</a>, where the kingdom of heaven is likened to a tree that provides shelter for the birds. It underscores the universal reach of the gospel and the gathering of diverse peoples into the family of God.<p><b>taking shelter in the shade of its branches.</b><br>The shade provides comfort, protection, and rest, symbolizing the peace and security found in God's kingdom. This imagery reflects the messianic hope of a time when God's people will live in safety and prosperity, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/32.htm">Isaiah 32:1-2</a>. The sheltering branches also point to Christ, who offers rest to the weary and protection to those who seek refuge in Him, as seen in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Similar prophecies are also to be found in <a href="/context/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>; <a href="/context/micah/4-1.htm" title="But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow to it.">Micah 4:1-3</a>; <a href="/psalms/2-6.htm" title="Yet have I set my king on my holy hill of Zion.">Psalm 2:6</a>. No point is made more clear in the prophecies of the Christian dispensation than that it is to have its roots in the Jewish, that the "law shall go forth from Zion," and that the new covenant shall yet be a covenant with God's people of old. This mountain is to be understood as the representative of the centre and seat of the kingdom of Israel, and not to be confined too literally to the actual hill of Zion itself.<p><span class= "bld">Be a goodly cedar.</span>--Not like the vine of low stature; this shall grow into a strong and great tree, under whose shadow all the inhabitants of the earth shall find sustenance and protection. A similar figure is used by the contemporary prophet Daniel (<a href="/context/daniel/4-20.htm" title="The tree that you saw, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached to the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;">Daniel 4:20-21</a>), and by our Lord Himself in the parable (<a href="/matthew/13-32.htm" title="Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.">Matthew 13:32</a>). The universality of the blessings of the Christian dispensation, in contrast with the narrowness of the Jewish, is one of its features most frequently dwelt upon both in prophecy and in the New Testament, and shall still enter into the burden of the songs of the redeemed (<a href="/revelation/5-9.htm" title="And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;">Revelation 5:9</a>). The last clause of the verse repeats and emphasises the permanence of the connection of the believer with Christ. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/17-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will plant it</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1459;&#1500;&#1462;&#1428;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#353;&#183;to&#183;len&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common singular &#124;
