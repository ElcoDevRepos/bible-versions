In ancient Israel, these mounds or high places were typically used for pagan rituals and sacrifices, directly violating the commandment to worship Yahweh alone. The head of every street signifies the widespread nature of this idolatry, indicating that it was not confined to hidden or private areas but was a public and pervasive practice. This reflects the spiritual adultery of Israel, as they turned away from God to worship other deities.<p><b>and made your lofty shrines in every public square</b><br>Lofty shrines in public squares suggest the elevation and prominence given to idol worship within the community. Public squares were central places of gathering, commerce, and social interaction, making them strategic locations for influencing the populace. The use of lofty shrines indicates a deliberate and visible rebellion against God, as these structures would have been seen by all, further emphasizing the extent of Israel's unfaithfulness. This public display of idolatry contrasts with the private and personal nature of true worship of God, which was meant to be centered in the temple in Jerusalem.<p><b>you were not even like a prostitute, because you scorned payment</b><br>This phrase uses the metaphor of prostitution to describe Israel's spiritual unfaithfulness. However, it goes further by stating that Israel was worse than a prostitute because they scorned payment. In the ancient Near East, a prostitute would receive payment for her services, but Israel engaged in idolatry without seeking any benefit, highlighting the senselessness and depth of their apostasy. This imagery underscores the irrationality of their actions, as they abandoned the covenant relationship with God, which promised blessings and protection, for worthless idols that offered nothing in return. This metaphor is a powerful indictment of Israel's spiritual state, showing their complete disregard for the covenant and the blessings associated with it.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Sin was no longer hidden but advertised, inviting anyone who passed by.<p>&#8226; The verse sets up a contrast: the Lord had placed His temple in one chosen spot (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>), yet His people scattered rival altars everywhere.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and made your lofty shrines in every public square</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Lofty shrines&#8221; heighten the offense&#8212;literally elevated structures, reaching upward as if to compete with the true sanctuary on Mount Zion (<a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;every public square&#8221; tells us idolatry had moved from private compromise to civic celebration. The marketplace itself became a worship center&#8212;for false gods.<p>&#8226; Ezekiel earlier saw similar &#8220;abominations&#8221; creeping even into the temple courts (<a href="/ezekiel/8-5.htm">Ezekiel 8:5&#8211;16</a>). Here they spill into the streets, confirming total cultural saturation of sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you were not even like a prostitute</b><p>&#8226; Scripture often likens spiritual unfaithfulness to sexual immorality (<a href="/jeremiah/3-1.htm">Jeremiah 3:1&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>). Yet God sharpens the metaphor: Jerusalem&#8217;s behavior outstrips ordinary prostitution.<p>&#8226; A prostitute at least acknowledges a transaction. She knows what she is and receives wages (<a href="/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1&#8211;2</a> pictures Babylon that way).

The people built conspicuous mounds and lofty shrines at every intersection, flaunting sin that once might have been hidden. Their unfaithfulness surpassed common immorality; they gave themselves away freely, even funding their own degradation. The verse exposes a heart that has traded the honor of belonging to the Lord for the humiliation of self-imposed bondage, reminding us how urgently we need to cling to the One true God who alone satisfies.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">Eminent place.</span>--See note on <a href="/ezekiel/16-24.htm" title="That you have also built to you an eminent place, and have made you an high place in every street.">Ezekiel 16:24</a>.<p><span class= "bld">In that thou scornest him.</span>--It was characteristic of both the kingdoms of Israel after the division, that the interference of foreign nations in their affairs was generally sought first by Israel itself and purchased at a heavy price. The people were so situated on the great highway between the rival nations of Egypt and Assyria, that their friendship ought to have been of value to either of them, and to have been sought with great inducements. But Israel, in its weakness and wickedness, more than threw itself away and purchased its own ruin. The particulars mentioned in this verse belong to the past rather than to the present, and all the tenses should be so translated.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that</span>, etc. It is better to take the words as beginning a fresh sentence: "when thou didst build," etc. The historical survey of the harlot's progress is brought to a close, and the prophet points with bitter scorn to what aggravated its degradation. Other nations, like Tyre and Zidon, had risen to prosperity and eminence through their intercourse with foreigners. To Judah it had brought only subjection and the payment of tribute. She had given gifts to all her lovers, instead of receiving from them the rewards of her shame. She was as the adulterous wife who forsakes her husband, and gives what belonged to him to strangers. The conduct of Ahaz in stripping the Temple of its gold and silver to pay tribute to Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/16-8.htm">2 Kings 16:8</a>), gives an apt illustration of what the prophet means (comp. <a href="/hosea/12-1.htm">Hosea 12:1</a>;
