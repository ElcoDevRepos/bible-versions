These statutes were part of the covenant relationship between God and His people, intended to set them apart as a holy nation. The giving of the law is a central theme in the Pentateuch, particularly in <a href="/exodus/20.htm">Exodus 20-23</a> and Deuteronomy. The statutes were not merely legal requirements but were meant to guide the Israelites in living a life that reflected God's holiness and righteousness.<p><b>and made known to them My ordinances</b><br>Ordinances refer to specific decrees or regulations that were part of the broader legal framework given to Israel. These included ceremonial laws, civil laws, and moral laws. The purpose of these ordinances was to instruct the Israelites in how to worship God properly and how to live in community with one another. The revelation of these ordinances was an act of divine grace, as it provided clear guidance on how to maintain a relationship with God and with others.<p><b>for the man who does these things will live by them</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the life-giving nature of obedience to God's laws. In the context of the Old Testament, "living" by the statutes and ordinances meant experiencing the fullness of life that God intended, including blessings, prosperity, and peace. This concept is echoed in <a href="/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a>, where it is stated that keeping God's decrees leads to life. In the New Testament, the Apostle Paul references this idea in <a href="/romans/10-5.htm">Romans 10:5</a> and <a href="/galatians/3-12.htm">Galatians 3:12</a>, contrasting the law with the righteousness that comes by faith in Christ.

It becomes plain, on a careful perusal of this passage, that what was required was not a mere outward, technical, and perfunctory keeping of certain definite precepts, but a living and loving obedience to God's will from the heart. The same fundamental principle of life underlies the Old Testament as the New; yet the former is justly regarded, and frequently spoken of in the New Testament, as a covenant of works, because the people were not yet sufficiently educated spiritually to be able to receive the principle of faith, and were therefore placed under a law of many definite precepts, that by keeping these with glad alacrity they might show their readiness and desire to do the Lord's will. It is in this sense that a man should live by doing the statutes of the law, and not on the ground of his thereby earning for himself salvation. But even thus, they failed miserably under the test.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I gave them my statutes,</span> etc. Ezekiel recognizes, almost in the very language of <a href="/deuteronomy/30-16.htm">Deuteronomy 30:16-20</a>, as fully as the writers of <a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19</a>. and 119. recognized, the excellence of the Law.
