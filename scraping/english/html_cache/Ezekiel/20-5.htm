The use of "Lord GOD" underscores the sovereignty and covenantal relationship God has with Israel. This introduction is common in prophetic literature, indicating that the message is not from the prophet himself but from God.<p><b>On the day I chose Israel:</b><br>This refers to God's sovereign election of Israel as His chosen people. The concept of divine election is central to the identity of Israel, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>. This choice is rooted in God's love and faithfulness, not in any merit of Israel.<p><b>I swore an oath to the descendants of the house of Jacob:</b><br>The oath signifies a binding promise, reflecting the covenantal nature of God's relationship with Israel. The "house of Jacob" refers to the patriarch Jacob, whose descendants became the twelve tribes of Israel. This oath is reminiscent of the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a> and <a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>.<p><b>and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt:</b><br>God's self-revelation in Egypt is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, marking the beginning of their deliverance from slavery. This revelation is associated with the plagues and the Exodus, demonstrating God's power and faithfulness. It also foreshadows the greater deliverance through Christ, as seen in the New Testament.<p><b>With an uplifted hand I said to them:</b><br>The "uplifted hand" is a symbol of God's power and authority, often associated with making a solemn oath or promise. This imagery is used throughout Scripture to convey God's active involvement and commitment to His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/6-8.htm">Exodus 6:8</a>.<p><b>&#8216;I am the LORD your God.&#8217;</b><br>This declaration establishes the covenant relationship between God and Israel. It is a reaffirmation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2-3</a>), emphasizing exclusive worship and allegiance to God. This phrase also points to the identity of God as the covenant-keeping deity, which is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who establishes a new covenant with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign God who chose Israel and made a covenant with them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of the house of Jacob, whom God delivered from Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_jacob.htm">House of Jacob</a></b><br>Refers to the descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, emphasizing their patriarchal lineage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved and from which God delivered them.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_choosing.htm">The Day of Choosing</a></b><br>The specific time when God chose Israel as His people and revealed Himself to them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_choice.htm">God's Sovereign Choice</a></b><br>God chose Israel not because of their merit but because of His sovereign will and purpose.

The record of that period, as it has come to us in the Pentateuch, does not contain either any commands against idolatry, or any notice of the rebellion of the people against such command; but both are clearly implied. The very mission of Moses to deliver them rested upon a covenant by which they were to be the peculiar people of Jehovah (<a href="/context/exodus/6-2.htm" title="And God spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am the LORD:">Exodus 6:2-4</a>); the command to go into the wilderness to sacrifice to the Lord implies that this was a duty neglected in Egypt; and their previous habitual idolatries may be certainly inferred from <a href="/leviticus/17-7.htm" title="And they shall no more offer their sacrifices to devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever to them throughout their generations.">Leviticus 17:7</a>, while the disposition of their hearts is seen in their prompt relapse into the idolatry of the golden calf in Exodus 32. Their whole murmurings and rebellions were but the manifestation of their resistance to having the Lord for their God, and His will for their guide.<p><span class= "bld">Lifted up mine hand</span>--As the form of taking an oath (see <a href="/ezekiel/20-23.htm" title="I lifted up my hand to them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;">Ezekiel 20:23</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/47-14.htm" title="And you shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning the which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers: and this land shall fall to you for inheritance.">Ezekiel 47:14</a>). The reference is to such passages as <a href="/context/genesis/15-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.">Genesis 15:17-21</a>; <a href="/exodus/6-8.htm" title="And I will bring you in to the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.">Exodus 6:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-40.htm" title="For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>, &c.
