The term "gallery" refers to a covered walkway or corridor, often used in ancient Near Eastern architecture. The three levels suggest a structured and hierarchical design, symbolizing order and the divine perfection of God's dwelling place. This architectural detail reflects the meticulous planning and divine inspiration behind the temple's construction, emphasizing the holiness and separation of God's space from the mundane world.<p><b>opposite the twenty cubits that belonged to the inner court</b><br>The "twenty cubits" refers to a specific measurement within the temple complex, indicating the width of a particular section. The inner court was a sacred area reserved for priests and certain sacrificial activities, highlighting the separation between the holy and the common. This measurement underscores the precision and orderliness of God's instructions for worship, as seen in other biblical passages like <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-31</a>, where God provides detailed instructions for the tabernacle.<p><b>and opposite the pavement that belonged to the outer court</b><br>The "pavement" in the outer court signifies a more accessible area for the general populace, contrasting with the restricted inner court. This distinction between the inner and outer courts reflects the broader biblical theme of access to God, where the outer court represents the initial approach to holiness. The outer court's accessibility foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Christ as the mediator who grants believers direct access to God, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>. The pavement's presence also suggests a place of gathering and worship, emphasizing communal aspects of faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.

The language highlights symmetry and order&#8212;features that echo Solomon&#8217;s temple, where &#8220;chambers were all around&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5</a>) and &#8220;everything was finished exactly according to the pattern&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; These facing galleries illustrate how God designs His dwelling with balance, harmony, and purposeful space for priestly service (<a href="/ezekiel/40-44.htm">Ezekiel 40:44-46</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In three levels</b><p>&#8226; The verse continues, noting that the galleries were &#8220;in three levels.&#8221; Similar three-story arrangements appear in Solomon&#8217;s temple: &#8220;The lowest chamber was five cubits wide, the middle six, and the third seven&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/6-6.htm">1 Kings 6:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Three tiers maximize vertical space while preserving the temple&#8217;s footprint&#8212;practical architecture for housing priests, utensils, and offerings (<a href="/ezekiel/41-6.htm">Ezekiel 41:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The number three often points to completeness (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>), reinforcing the fullness of God&#8217;s provision within His house.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Opposite the twenty cubits</b><p>&#8226; Ezekiel specifies that these rooms stood &#8220;opposite the twenty cubits.&#8221; Earlier he measured a 20-cubit span alongside the temple proper (<a href="/ezekiel/41-2.htm">Ezekiel 41:2-4</a>), marking an inner corridor reserved for holy use.<p>&#8226; Placing the galleries across this sacred width keeps priestly activities close to the sanctuary, just as the &#8220;priests drew near to the holy place&#8221; in earlier worship (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-16.htm">2 Chronicles 29:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That belonged to the inner court</b><p>&#8226; The 20-cubit area is tied to &#8220;the inner court,&#8221; the zone of greatest sanctity short of the Most Holy Place (<a href="/ezekiel/40-47.htm">Ezekiel 40:47</a>).<p>&#8226; By situating the priests&#8217; chambers here, God ensures a clear separation between holy and most holy tasks, mirroring the principle, &#8220;You shall distinguish between the holy and the common&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And opposite the pavement</b><p>&#8226; Ezekiel also notes the galleries stood &#8220;opposite the pavement.&#8221; Earlier he described a paved terrace ringing the outer court: &#8220;There were thirty rooms facing the pavement&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; This pavement functioned like a courtyard hallway, guiding worshippers and priests alike&#8212;comparable to the stone courts where Solomon&#8217;s worshipers gathered (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-3.htm">2 Chronicles 7:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That belonged to the outer court</b><p>&#8226; Finally, the verse links the pavement to &#8220;the outer court,&#8221; the larger public area of the temple complex (<a href="/ezekiel/40-14.htm">Ezekiel 40:14-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Positioning priestly galleries between inner and outer courts creates a buffer: priests can move efficiently from the outer ministry of sacrifice to the inner ministry before the LORD (<a href="/ezekiel/44-17.htm">Ezekiel 44:17-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/42-3.htm">Ezekiel 42:3</a> sketches a set of three-story priestly chambers precisely positioned between the sacred 20-cubit inner corridor and the broad paved walkway of the outer court. &#8220;Gallery faced gallery&#8221; underscores symmetrical order; &#8220;three levels&#8221; shows completeness and efficient use of space; the reference to inner and outer courts highlights God-ordained boundaries that guard holiness while enabling service.

"Against" is literally, <span class= "ital">unto the face of,</span> or <span class= "ital">in front of,</span> and <span class= "ital">stories</span> is altogether wanting. The meaning seems to be that in each chamber building, on the north and on the south, there was a gallery in the third storey, so placed on the south side of the north building and the north side of the south building that they faced each other.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Considerable difficulty attaches to the words of this verse. <span class="cmt_word">The twenty cubits which were for the inner court</span> (better, <span class="accented">the twenty which belonged to the inner court</span>) have been taken by Kliefoth to signify the watchers' coils in the inner court, west of the north door (<a href="/ezekiel/40-40.htm">Ezekiel 40:40-46</a>), and by Plumptre to indicate an inner area of twenty cubits square, round which the galleries in three stories ran. Both of these views, however, have this against them, that they are purely conjectural, the text in <a href="/ezekiel/40-40.htm">Ezekiel 40:40-46</a> saying nothing about twenty cubits in connection with the priests' chambers, and the text under review making no suggestion of an inner area of twenty cubits, but only of the already well-known "inner court." Hence the opinion of Ewald, Hengstenberg, Keil, Schroder, and Currey has most in its favor, that the "twenty" alongside of which the chamber now alluded to lay, meant the twenty cubits clear space which surrounded the temple on the south, west, and north sides (see <a href="/ezekiel/41-12.htm">Ezekiel 41:12-14</a>), and which could properly be spoken of as "for the inner court," rather as "belonging to the inner court," since it was practically a continuation of the same. <span class="cmt_word">The pavement which was for</span> (or, <span class="accented">belonged to</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the outer court</span>, was manifestly that already described as running along the inside of the outer wall (see <a href="/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17</a>). If, as is likely, this pavement was continued along the north side of the inner court wall, then the priests' chambers must have stood upon it, and been over against it on the east side, as Currey explains; but the easier and more natural supposition is that adopted by Keil, that the second "over against" points to that which faced the chambers on the north, viz. the pavement, as the first marked their boundary on the south. <span class="cmt_word">Gallery against gallery</span> (see on Ezekiel 41:15).
