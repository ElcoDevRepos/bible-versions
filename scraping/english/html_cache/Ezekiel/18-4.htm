In the biblical context, it reflects the monotheistic belief that God is the creator and sustainer of all souls, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where God breathes life into man. This ownership implies accountability to God, aligning with the covenant relationship established with Israel. The use of "behold" serves as a call to attention, underscoring the importance of the statement.<p><b>both father and son are Mine.</b><br>This highlights the individual responsibility of each person before God, regardless of familial relationships. In ancient Israel, family lineage and heritage were significant, often determining one's social and religious standing. However, this phrase asserts that each person, whether father or son, is directly accountable to God. This challenges the prevailing cultural notion of collective punishment or blessing based on ancestry, as seen in <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5-6</a>, and emphasizes personal responsibility.<p><b>The soul who sins is the one who will die.</b><br>This statement introduces the principle of individual moral responsibility, a key theme in Ezekiel's prophecy. It counters the belief that children bear the punishment for their parents' sins, as suggested in the proverb mentioned earlier in <a href="/ezekiel/18-2.htm">Ezekiel 18:2</a>. The concept of death here can be understood both physically and spiritually, reflecting the consequences of sin as outlined in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>. This principle foreshadows the New Testament teaching of personal repentance and salvation through Jesus Christ, who offers life to those who turn from sin, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, emphasizing personal responsibility and the need for repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience of Ezekiel's prophecy, they were in exile due to their collective disobedience and idolatry, struggling with understanding God's justice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, serving as a backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies and teachings on individual accountability.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_responsibility.htm">Personal Responsibility</a></b><br>Each individual is accountable to God for their own actions.

Ownership means authority.<p>&#8211; Because the Creator owns every soul, He alone sets the rules for life and judgment (<a href="/romans/14-11.htm">Romans 14:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Both father and son are Mine</b><p>&#8211; The repetition zooms in on family lines, a hot topic in Ezekiel&#8217;s day. People blamed their hardships on their ancestors&#8217; sins (<a href="/jeremiah/31-29.htm">Jeremiah 31:29-30</a>).<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s double mention&#8212;father and son&#8212;levels the playing field: shared lineage does not equal shared guilt (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-6.htm">2 Kings 14:6</a>).<p>&#8211; By asserting equal ownership, the Lord dismantles fatalism and invites each generation to seek Him personally.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The soul who sins is the one who will die</b><p>&#8211; The statement is straightforward: personal sin brings personal judgment.

Later in the chapter God pleads, &#8220;Repent and live!&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/18-4.htm">Ezekiel 18:4</a> dismantles generational blame by affirming God&#8217;s universal ownership and each person&#8217;s direct accountability to Him. Fathers and sons alike belong to the Lord; therefore, every individual must reckon with personal sin and its wages. Yet the same individual focus that brings sober warning also opens the door to personal repentance and life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">All souls are mine.</span>--This is the basis of the subsequent teaching. Since all alike belong to God and are absolutely in His power. He has no occasion to punish one lest another should escape; and again, since all are His, He loves and would save them all, and inflicts punishment only when it is deserved and His grace is rejected. Four cases are now discussed separately: (1) That of the righteous man who honestly seeks to follow the ways of the Lord (<a href="/context/ezekiel/18-5.htm" title="But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,">Ezekiel 18:5-9</a>); (2) that of his wicked son (<a href="/context/ezekiel/18-10.htm" title="If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that does the like to any one of these things,">Ezekiel 18:10-13</a>); (3) that of the righteous son of the wicked (<a href="/context/ezekiel/18-14.htm" title="Now, see, if he beget a son, that sees all his father's sins which he has done, and considers, and does not such like,">Ezekiel 18:14-20</a>); (4) that of a change of character in the individual, whether from sin to righteousness or the reverse (<a href="/context/ezekiel/18-21.htm" title="But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he has committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.">Ezekiel 18:21-29</a>). The word "soul" throughout the chapter does not mean exclusively the immortal part of our nature, but, as so often in Scripture, is equivalent to <span class= "ital">man, </span>or <span class= "ital">person, </span>or <span class= "ital">self; </span>and the word "die" is used, as often elsewhere, in the broad sense of <span class= "ital">suffer punishment.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, all souls are mine</span>, etc. The words imply, not only creation, ownership, absolute authority, on the part of God, but, as even Calvin could recognize (<span class="accented">in loc.</span>), "a paternal affection towards the whole human race which he created and formed." Ezekiel anticipates here, and yet more fully in ver. 32. the teaching of St. Paul, that "God willeth that all men should be saved" (<a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The soul that sinneth, it shall die.</span> The sentence, though taken from the Law, which ordered capital punishment for the offences named, cannot be limited to that punishment. "Death" and "life" are both used in their highest and widest meaning - "life" as including all that makes it worth living, "death" for the loss of that only true life which is found in knowing God (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/18-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Behold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1444;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2005.htm">Strong's 2005: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">every</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">soul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;n&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
