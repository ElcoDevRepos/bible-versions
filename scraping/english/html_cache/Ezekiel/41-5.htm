In ancient Near Eastern architecture, thick walls were common in significant buildings, symbolizing protection and stability. The cubit, a standard unit of measurement in biblical times, was approximately 18 inches, making the wall about 9 feet thick. This thickness underscores the temple's importance and the divine protection it represents. The temple's design reflects God's holiness and the separation between the sacred and the profane, as seen in other biblical structures like Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-2.htm">1 Kings 6:2-6</a>). The temple's walls also serve as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate sanctuary and protector of His people (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<p><b>and the width of each side room around the temple was four cubits</b><br>The side rooms, each four cubits wide, were likely used for storage or as chambers for the priests. These rooms surrounded the temple, indicating a functional aspect of the temple complex, supporting the activities and rituals conducted there. The number four often symbolizes completeness in the Bible, suggesting that these rooms were integral to the temple's operation. The arrangement of these side rooms can be compared to the chambers in Solomon's Temple, which also had side rooms for various purposes (<a href="/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5-6</a>). This architectural detail highlights the continuity of temple worship and the meticulous planning involved in creating a space suitable for divine worship. The side rooms' presence around the temple signifies the comprehensive provision God makes for His people, ensuring that all aspects of worship and service are accommodated.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the detailed vision of a new temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The vision of the temple in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a> represents a future idealized temple, symbolizing God's presence and holiness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/side_rooms.htm">Side Rooms</a></b><br>These are chambers surrounding the temple, possibly used for storage or other temple-related activities.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_god's_design.htm">The Importance of God's Design</a></b><br>The precise measurements of the temple highlight God's attention to detail and the importance of following His design.
