The term "profane" indicates a desecration of what is holy, suggesting that Zedekiah's actions were not only politically unwise but also spiritually corrupt. The word "wicked" underscores his moral failings, aligning with the biblical narrative that portrays him as a king who did evil in the sight of the Lord (<a href="/2_kings/24-19.htm">2 Kings 24:19</a>). This phrase sets the tone for divine judgment, reflecting the broader biblical theme of God holding leaders accountable for their actions.<p><b>the day has come</b><br>This phrase signifies the imminence of judgment. In the prophetic literature, "the day" often refers to a specific time of divine intervention or reckoning. Here, it indicates that the period of warning has ended, and the time for action has arrived. This aligns with the prophetic tradition where God&#8217;s patience has limits, and a time comes when He must act to uphold justice (<a href="/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18-20</a>).<p><b>for your final punishment.</b><br>The term "final punishment" suggests a conclusive and irreversible judgment. In the context of Ezekiel, this refers to the fall of Jerusalem and the end of Zedekiah's reign, which occurred in 586 BC when the Babylonians captured the city. This punishment is not just a political downfall but a divine decree, fulfilling earlier prophecies about the consequences of Israel's unfaithfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a>). Theologically, it serves as a type of the ultimate judgment that will come at the end of the age, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, Ezekiel was called to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

The representation of iniquity as being allowed to run a certain course through the Divine forbearance, and arrested and punished when it has reached its culmination, is a common one in Scripture. (See <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm" title="But in the fourth generation they shall come here again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.">Genesis 15:16</a>; <a href="/daniel/8-23.htm" title="And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.">Daniel 8:23</a>; <a href="/context/matthew/23-34.htm" title="Why, behold, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them you shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall you whip in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:">Matthew 23:34-36</a>, &c.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou, profane wicked prince of Judah</span>, etc.; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">O</span> <span class="accented">deadly wounded</span>, etc., as in ver. 29, where the same word is translated in the Authorized Version as "slain" The Authorized Version follows the LXX. and Vulgate, apparently in order to make the word fit in with the fact that Zedekiah was not slain, but carried into exile. The word "deadly wounded," or "sorely smitten," may rightly be applied to one who fell, as Zedekiah did, from his high estate.
