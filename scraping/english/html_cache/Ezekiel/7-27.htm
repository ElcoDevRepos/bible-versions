Historically, kings were seen as the embodiment of the nation's strength and stability. In the context of Ezekiel, this mourning reflects the impending judgment and destruction of Jerusalem, as the Babylonian exile looms. The king's mourning is a fulfillment of the warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah, who spoke of the downfall of Judah due to their disobedience (<a href="/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10-12</a>).<p><b>The prince will be clothed with despair</b><br>The prince, likely referring to the royal family or leaders under the king, will be overwhelmed with despair. This imagery of being "clothed" suggests a complete and inescapable state of hopelessness. In ancient Near Eastern culture, clothing often symbolized one's status or condition. The despair of the prince indicates the total loss of power and the inability to avert the coming disaster, as prophesied in earlier chapters of Ezekiel.<p><b>And the hands of the people of the land will tremble</b><br>The trembling hands of the people symbolize fear and helplessness. This phrase captures the widespread panic and anxiety among the populace as they face the consequences of their collective sin. The "people of the land" refers to the general population of Judah, who are now experiencing the fulfillment of prophetic warnings. This trembling is reminiscent of the fear described in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-65.htm">Deuteronomy 28:65-67</a>, where disobedience leads to a life of dread and uncertainty.<p><b>I will deal with them according to their conduct</b><br>God's judgment is portrayed as just and deserved, based on the conduct of the people. This reflects the principle of divine retribution found throughout the Old Testament, where actions have corresponding consequences (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). The conduct of the Israelites, characterized by idolatry and injustice, has brought about this divine response. This phrase underscores the righteousness of God's judgment, as He holds them accountable for their actions.<p><b>And I will judge them by their own standards</b><br>Judging by their own standards suggests that the people will face the consequences of the very measures they used against others. This principle is echoed in Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/7-2.htm">Matthew 7:2</a>, where the measure used to judge others will be used against oneself. The Israelites' failure to uphold God's standards and their reliance on human wisdom and justice systems have led to their downfall.<p><b>Then they will know that I am the LORD.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The ultimate purpose of God's judgment is to bring recognition of His sovereignty and holiness. This phrase is a recurring theme in Ezekiel, emphasizing that through judgment, the people will come to acknowledge the LORD's authority and power. It serves as both a warning and a hope, pointing to a future where God's identity and glory are fully realized by His people. This acknowledgment is not just intellectual but relational, calling the people back to a covenant relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Represents the leadership of Israel, who will experience mourning due to the impending judgment and destruction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prince.htm">The Prince</a></b><br>Symbolizes the ruling class or nobility, who will be overwhelmed with despair as they face the consequences of their actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_the_land.htm">The People of the Land</a></b><br>Refers to the general populace of Israel, who will be gripped with fear and trembling as judgment unfolds.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The divine retribution that God promises to bring upon Israel for their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His sovereignty and justice in dealing with His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_divine_judgment.htm">The Reality of Divine Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is real and inevitable for those who persist in disobedience.

Whether through blessing or judgment, God&#8217;s goal is revelation of His identity.<p>&#8226; Recognition comes when every false refuge collapses. <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a> looks ahead to universal acknowledgment: every knee will bow.<p>&#8226; Judgment strips away illusions so that the Lord alone is seen as sovereign, holy, and true (<a href="/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/7-27.htm">Ezekiel 7:27</a> paints a cascading scene of judgment: the king laments, the prince despairs, the people quake. No rank is spared, because God repays each life with perfect justice measured by its own deeds. The end purpose is unmistakable: that all will finally recognize, without dispute or rival, &#8220;I am the LORD.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king shall mourn,</span> etc. The picture reminds us of Jehoram in <a href="/2_kings/6-30.htm">2 Kings 6:30</a>. The action of Zedekiah in <a href="/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1</a> and Jeremiah 34:8 makes it probable enough that it was actually reproduced. A solemn litany procession like that of <a href="/joel/1-13.htm">Joel 1:13, 14</a> and Joel 2:15-17 would have been quite in keeping with his character. <span class="cmt_word">The prince shall clothe himself,</span> etc. The noun is specially characteristic of Ezekiel, who uses it thirty-four times. In ch. 12:12 the "prince" seems identified with the "king." Here it may mean either the heir to the throne, or the chief ruler under the king. <span class="cmt_word">The people of the land,</span> etc. The phrase is perhaps used, as the Jewish rabbis afterwards used it, with a certain touch of scorn, for the labouring class. All the upper class had been carried away captive with Jehoiachin (<a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a>). Compare Ezekiel's use of it in <a href="/ezekiel/33-2.htm">Ezekiel 33:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/46-3.htm">Ezekiel 46:3, 9</a>. I will do unto them, etc. The chapter, or rather the whole section from <a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a> onwards, ends with an iterated assertion of the equity of the Divine judgments. Then also they shall know that I am the Lord, Almighty and all-righteous. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/7-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
