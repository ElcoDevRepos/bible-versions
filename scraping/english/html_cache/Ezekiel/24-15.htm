Throughout the book of Ezekiel, the phrase "the word of the LORD came to me" is a recurring formula that signifies the beginning of a divine message. It underscores the authority and divine origin of the prophecy that follows.<br><br>*Prophetic Role:* Ezekiel, a priest and prophet during the Babylonian exile, often received messages from God that were both symbolic and direct. His role was to convey God's messages to the Israelites, who were in a state of rebellion and idolatry.<br><br>*Historical Context:* This message comes during a time when Jerusalem was under siege by Babylon, around 588-586 BC. The Israelites were experiencing the consequences of their disobedience to God, and Ezekiel's prophecies often addressed their need for repentance and the impending judgment.<br><br>*Connection to Other Scripture:* Similar phrases are found throughout the prophetic books, such as in Jeremiah and Isaiah, indicating a common method of divine communication. This phrase emphasizes the consistency of God's communication with His prophets.<br><br>*Types of Jesus Christ:* While this specific phrase does not directly typify Christ, the role of a prophet as a mediator of God's word can be seen as a precursor to Christ, who is the ultimate revelation of God to humanity (<a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>).<br><br>*Theological Insight:* The phrase highlights the concept of divine revelation, where God chooses to reveal His will and purposes to humanity through chosen individuals. It underscores the importance of listening to and heeding God's word as delivered through His prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, Ezekiel was called to deliver God's messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

No pause, no delay&#8212;just as Jesus moved &#8220;then&#8221; from teaching to healing (<a href="/matthew/8-13.htm">Matthew 8:13-14</a>), the Lord presses Ezekiel into the next prophetic act without hesitation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the word of the LORD</b><p>Here is the heart of the verse: what follows is not Ezekiel&#8217;s idea but God&#8217;s own speech.<p>&#8226; The phrase carries absolute authority, exactly as in <a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a> and <a href="/isaiah/38-4.htm">Isaiah 38:4</a>.<p>&#8226; Scripture never speaks of &#8220;a&#8221; word but &#8220;the&#8221; word; it is singular, definitive, and inerrant (<a href="/psalms/18-30.htm">Psalm 18:30</a>; <a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Every time Ezekiel uses it (more than fifty times), the reader is reminded that God&#8217;s words, once spoken, cannot fail (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>came to me</b><p>God&#8217;s word travels, so to speak, to a specific person.<p>&#8226; This underscores God&#8217;s gracious initiative: Ezekiel does not climb to heaven; heaven stoops to him (<a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>; cf. <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>).<p>&#8226; It personalizes the message. The Lord entrusts His prophet with news that will shatter Ezekiel&#8217;s own life (vv. 16-18), just as Hosea was called into a painful marriage for the sake of God&#8217;s people (<a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminds us that revelation is relational; God speaks to people so they can speak to others (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>; <a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying,</b><p>The comma hints that the sentence is only beginning; verse 15 is a doorway into the dramatic sign-act that follows.<p>&#8226; What God will &#8220;say&#8221; next involves the sudden death of Ezekiel&#8217;s wife, making the prophet a living lesson (vv. 16-24).<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;saying&#8221; points to content and purpose, just as in <a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>&#8212;when God speaks, something happens.<p>&#8226; Every divine &#8220;saying&#8221; demands a human response: belief, obedience, or, tragically, rebellion (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>; <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/24-15.htm">Ezekiel 24:15</a> may look like a simple introductory line, yet every part is loaded with meaning. &#8220;Then&#8221; roots the verse in real time; &#8220;the word of the LORD&#8221; declares infallible authority; &#8220;came to me&#8221; shows God&#8217;s personal, gracious initiative; and &#8220;saying,&#8221; prepares us for a weighty message.

Ezekiel is warned of the sudden death of his wife, who is described as deeply beloved, and yet he is forbidden to make any sign of mourning for her.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I take away from thee</span>, etc. The next word of the Lord, coming after an interval, is of an altogether exceptional character, as giving one solitary glimpse into the personal home life of the prophet. The lesson which the history teaches is, in substance, the same as that of <a href="/jeremiah/16-5.htm">Jeremiah 16:5</a>. The calamity that falls on the nation will swallow up all personal sorrow, but it is brought home to Ezekiel, who may have read those words with wonder, by a new and terrible experience. We are left to conjecture whether anything in the prophet's home life furnished a starting-point for the terrible message that was now borne in upon his soul. Had his wife been ill before? or, as the words, <span class="cmt_word">with a stroke</span>, suggest, did it fall on him, as a thunderbolt "out of the blue"? I mention, only to reject, the view that the wife's death belongs as much to the category of symbolic visions as the boiling cauldron. To me such a view seems to indicate an incapacity for entering into a prophet's life and calling as great as that which sees nothing but an allegory in the history of Gomer in <a href="/hosea/2.htm">Hosea 2, 3</a>. We, who accept the Scripture record as we find it, may believe that Ezekiel was taught, as the earlier prophet, to interpret his work by his own personal experience. To Ezekiel himself the loss of one who is thus described as <span class="cmt_word">the desire</span> (or, <span class="accented">delight</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of his eyes</span> (the word is used of things in <a href="/1_kings/20-6.htm">1 Kings 20:6</a>, of young warriors in <a href="/lamentations/2-4.htm">Lamentations 2:4</a>, of sons and daughters in Ver. 25), must have been, at first, as the crowning sorrow of his life; but the feelings of the patriot-prophet were stronger even than those of the husband, and his personal bereavement seemed as a small thing compared with the desolation of his country. He was to refrain from all conventional signs of mourning, from weeping and wailing, from the loud sighing (for <span class="cmt_word">forbear to cry</span>, read, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">sigh, but not aloud</span>), from the head covered or sprinkled with ashes (<a href="/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>), and from the bare feet (<a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2</a>), from the covered lips (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>; <a href="/micah/3-7.htm">Micah 3:7</a>), which were "the trappings and the garb of woe" in such a case. <span class="cmt_word">Eat not the bread of men</span>. The words point to the custom, more or less common in all nations and at all times, of a funeral feast, like the <span class="accented">parentalia</span> of the Romans. Wine also was commonly part of such a feast (<a href="/jeremiah/16-7.htm">Jeremiah 16:7</a>). The primary idea of the custom seems to have been that the mourner's friends sent the materials for the feast as a token of their sympathy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/24-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the word</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#601;&#183;&#7687;ar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to me,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1463;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;lay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saying,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;&#1502;&#1465;&#1469;&#1512;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#183;m&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/24-15.htm">Ezekiel 24:15 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/24-15.htm">Ezekiel 24:15 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/24-15.htm">Ezekiel 24:15 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/24-15.htm">Ezekiel 24:15 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/24-15.htm">Ezekiel 24:15 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/24-15.htm">Ezekiel 24:15  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/24-15.htm">Ezekiel 24:15 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/24-15.htm">Ezekiel 24:15 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/24-15.htm">Ezekiel 24:15 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/24-15.htm">Ezekiel 24:15 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/24-15.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 24:15 Also the word of Yahweh came (Ezek.
