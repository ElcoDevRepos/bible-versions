The act of profaning God indicates a severe disrespect and misuse of His name and authority. In ancient Israel, barley and bread were basic food items, symbolizing the trivial and insignificant rewards for which these false prophets were willing to compromise their integrity and divine truth. This reflects a broader biblical theme where material gain is often pursued at the expense of spiritual fidelity (e.g., <a href="/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>, where prophets lead people astray for food). The historical context suggests that during times of scarcity, such as the Babylonian siege, even small amounts of food could be tempting bribes. This phrase underscores the gravity of valuing material gain over spiritual truth, a theme echoed in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>, where Jesus teaches about serving God versus wealth).<p><b>By lying to My people who would listen,</b><br>The false prophets are accused of deceit, exploiting the willingness of the people to listen to messages they desired rather than the truth. This reflects a recurring biblical issue where people prefer comforting lies over hard truths (<a href="/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>). The cultural context of ancient Israel involved a strong oral tradition, where prophets played a crucial role in guiding the people. The false prophets' lies led the people away from God's true message, similar to the warnings in <a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a> about listening to false visions. This phrase also connects to the New Testament warnings against false teachers (<a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>), emphasizing the importance of discernment in spiritual matters.<p><b>you have killed those who should not have died</b><br>This part of the verse indicates the severe consequences of the false prophets' actions. Their lies led to the death of the innocent, possibly through misleading them into actions that resulted in physical or spiritual death. In the context of Ezekiel, this could refer to those who were led astray and faced God's judgment as a result. Theologically, this reflects the biblical principle that false teachings can lead to spiritual death (<a href="/james/1-15.htm">James 1:15</a>). The phrase also echoes the broader biblical narrative of innocent suffering due to the sins of others, a theme that finds its ultimate resolution in the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, the innocent Lamb of God (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>and spared those who should not have lived.</b><br>Conversely, the false prophets allowed the wicked to continue in their ways without facing the consequences they deserved. This reflects a perversion of justice, where the guilty are not held accountable. In the biblical context, this could mean that the false prophets assured the wicked of peace and safety, contrary to God's true warnings of judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>). This phrase highlights the importance of true justice, a central theme in the Bible, where God is portrayed as the ultimate judge who will right all wrongs (<a href="/psalms/9-7.htm">Psalm 9:7-8</a>). The sparing of the wicked also contrasts with the New Testament message of repentance and transformation through Christ, who offers life to those who turn from their sins (<a href="/luke/5-32.htm">Luke 5:32</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

God was "polluted" by attaching His name and authority to that which was not true, and would not come to pass, thus "making Him a liar" like themselves. Like all falsehood, their lies tended both ways--to entice the upright to their ruin, and to give false security to the wicked. It is always impossible that a perversion of the truth, especially in regard to the Divine judgments, can be harmless.<p><span class= "bld">Hear your lies.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">hearken to a lie. </span>The words imply a willingness to listen to the pleasing falsehood, and the state of things is that described by <a href="/jeremiah/5-31.htm" title="The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will you do in the end thereof?">Jeremiah 5:31</a>. "The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means, and my people love to have it so."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Will ye pollute me</span>, etc.? rather, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">ye have profaned</span>, the interrogative form not being continued in the Hebrew. The prophet dwells with scorn on the miserable pay for which the prophetesses were guilty of so great a sin. Not for rewards of divination, like those of Balsam (<a href="/numbers/22-7.htm">Numbers 22:7</a>), but for gifts like those bestowed on the harlot or the beggar (l <a href="/1_samuel/2-36.htm">1 Samuel 2:36</a>; <a href="/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">for handfuls of barley and pieces of bread</span> - they plied their wretched trade. For examples of the lower gifts in kind offered to prophets, compare those of Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/9-8.htm">1 Samuel 9:8</a>), of Jeroboam's wife (<a href="/1_kings/14-3.htm">1 Kings 14:3</a>), the false prophets in <a href="/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>. And they did this in direct opposition to the will of Jehovah. They "slew," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> drew on to destruction, the souls that were meant for life. They "saved the souls alive," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "their own, which were worthy of death." That was the outcome of their "lying" divinations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You have profaned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1448;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#8234;&#8236;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#601;&#183;&#7717;al&#183;lel&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
