This period is crucial as it situates the prophecy within the historical context of the Babylonian captivity. The ninth year corresponds to approximately 588 BC, a time when Jerusalem was under severe threat from Babylon. This timing is essential for understanding the urgency and gravity of the prophetic message.<p><b>on the tenth day of the tenth month</b><br>The specific date is significant as it marks the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. This event is also recorded in <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25:1</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/39.htm">Jeremiah 39:1</a>, highlighting its importance in biblical history. The precision of the date underscores the fulfillment of prophecy and God's sovereign control over historical events. The tenth month, known as Tevet in the Hebrew calendar, is a time of fasting and mourning in Jewish tradition, commemorating this very siege.<p><b>the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine origin of the message Ezekiel is about to deliver. The phrase "the word of the LORD" is a common prophetic formula indicating that the message is not from human origin but from God Himself. This underscores the authority and reliability of the prophecy. The personal nature of "came to me" highlights Ezekiel's role as a chosen prophet, a mediator between God and His people. This divine communication is consistent with other prophetic experiences, such as those of Isaiah and Jeremiah, and points to the continuity of God's revelation throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of God's message.
