The whole region is described by Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 2:596) as one of extreme desolation - a character which belonged to it in ancient times (Josephus, 'Wars,' 3:10. 7; 4:8. 2). The part of this Arabah into which the waters flowed was situated north of <span class="cmt_word">the sea</span>, clearly not the Mediterranean, but the Dead Sea, "the sea of the Arabah," as above stated, and the "eastern sea" as afterwards named (ver. 18), into which they ultimately flowed. The clause, which being <span class="cmt_word">brought forth into the sea</span>, may either be connected with the proceeding words or formed into an independent sentence. Among those who adopt the former construction a variety of renderings prevails. The LXX. reads, "(And the water) comes to the sea (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>), to the sea of the pouring out," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Dead Sea, into which the river debouches. With this Havernick agrees, rendering, "to the sea of that outflow." Ewald reads, "into the sea of muddy waters," meaning the Dead Sea. Kimchi, "into the sea where the waters are brought forth," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the ocean (the Mediterranean), whoso waters go forth to encompass the world. Hengstenberg, Kliefoth, Keil, and Currey, who adopt the latter construction, borrow <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> from the antecedent clause, and translate, "To the sea (come or go) the waters that have been brought forth;" with which accords the Revised Version. The last words record the effect which should be produced by their entering into the sea. <span class="cmt_word">The waters shall be healed</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> rendered salubrious, from being hurtful (comp. <a href="/exodus/15-23.htm">Exodus 15:23, 25</a>; <a href="/2_kings/2-22.htm">2 Kings 2:22</a>). The translation of the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, is inaccurate. The unwholesome character of the Dead Sea is described by Tacitus: "Lucius <span class="accented">immenso ambitu</span>, <span class="accented">specie maris sapore corruptior</span>, <span class="accented">gravitate odoris accolis pestifer</span>, <span class="accented">neque vento impellitar neque pisces ant suetas aquis volucres patitur"</span> ('Hist.,' 5:6). Yon Raumer (p. 61) writes, "The sea is celled Dead, because there is in it no green plant, no water-fowl in it, no fish, no shell. If the Jordan carry fish into it, they die." "According to the testimony of all antiquity and of most modern travelers," says Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 2:226), "there exists within the waters of the Dead Sea no living thing, no trace, indeed, of animal or vegetable life. Our own experience goes to confirm the truth of this testimony. We perceived no sign of life within the waters." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/47-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And he said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
