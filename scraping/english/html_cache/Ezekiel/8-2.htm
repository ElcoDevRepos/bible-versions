This aligns with other biblical instances where God or His messengers appear in human form, such as in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a> with Abraham's visitors. The human-like appearance suggests relatability and accessibility, emphasizing God's desire to communicate with His people. This vision occurs during the Babylonian exile, a time when Israel needed reassurance of God's presence despite their circumstances.<p><b>From His waist down His appearance was like fire,</b><br>Fire in biblical symbolism often represents God's holiness, judgment, and purifying presence. This imagery recalls the burning bush in <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a>, where God revealed Himself to Moses. The fire from the waist down may signify judgment, as Ezekiel's visions often include themes of divine judgment against Israel's idolatry and sin. The fire also suggests power and might, characteristics of God's nature.<p><b>and from His waist up He was as bright as the gleam of amber.</b><br>Amber, or electrum, is a precious substance known for its bright, golden appearance. This brightness symbolizes God's glory and majesty, reminiscent of the descriptions of God's throne in <a href="/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a> and <a href="/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4</a>. The contrast between fire and amber highlights both judgment and glory, suggesting a dual message of warning and hope. The brightness signifies divine revelation, illuminating truth and righteousness. This vision foreshadows the ultimate revelation of God's glory in Jesus Christ, who embodies both judgment and grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of divine visions and messages, tasked with conveying God's words to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_figure.htm">The Figure</a></b><br>This figure is often interpreted as a theophany, a visible manifestation of God, or possibly an angelic being.

That vision bursts again on the prophet after he has been carried in the spirit to the Temple at Jerusalem (<a href="/ezekiel/8-4.htm" title="And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.">Ezekiel 8:4</a>). This is not expressly described as a human form, but from the mention of the loins, and of "the form of an hand," in <a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm" title="And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looks toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.">Ezekiel 8:3</a> it is implied that it was so. No further description is given, except that it was something bright and glorious like fire; and by the repetition of the words "likeness," "appearance," and "form of an hand," the prophet here, as in Ezekiel 1, takes pains to show that it was only a vision, not an outward reality. It is also to be remembered that this and the subsequent vision occurred while the elders were sitting before the prophet. They saw nothing themselves, but must have witnessed his ecstasy, and thus have been prepared for his telling them at its close (<a href="/ezekiel/11-25.htm" title="Then I spoke to them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had showed me.">Ezekiel 11:25</a>) "all the things that the Lord had showed" him. "The colour of amber" is the same as in <a href="/ezekiel/1-4.htm" title="And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.">Ezekiel 1:4</a>, where see Note.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I beheld, and lo a likeness,</span> etc. The vision opens with a theophany like that of ch. 1; but here, as there, Ezekiel uses the word which emphasizes the fact that what he had seen was but a "likeness" of the ineffable glory, an image of the Unseen. (For "amber," see <a href="/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4, 27</a>.) In this case we note the absence of the cherubic figures. It is simply the "appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah," seen now in the glow of fire, without the milder, more hopeful brightness of the rainbow (<a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/8-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then I looked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;er&#183;&#8217;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
