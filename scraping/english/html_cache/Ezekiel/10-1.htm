Ezekiel is often referred to as a "watchman" (<a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>), emphasizing his role in observing and conveying God's messages to the people of Israel. His visions are a crucial part of his prophetic ministry, providing insight into divine realities.<p><b>and saw above the expanse</b><br>The "expanse" refers to the firmament or sky, reminiscent of the creation account in <a href="/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6-8</a>. In Ezekiel's vision, the expanse signifies a separation between the earthly realm and the divine, highlighting the transcendence of God. This imagery is consistent with other biblical visions, such as in <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9-10</a>, where the heavenly court is depicted.<p><b>above the heads of the cherubim</b><br>Cherubim are angelic beings associated with the presence and glory of God. They are first mentioned in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>, guarding the way to the Tree of Life. In the context of the temple, cherubim are depicted as guardians of the divine presence (<a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>). Ezekiel's vision emphasizes the cherubim's role in supporting the divine throne, symbolizing God's majesty and holiness.<p><b>the likeness of a throne</b><br>The throne represents God's sovereign rule and authority. In biblical visions, the throne is a central element, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a> and <a href="/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2</a>. The "likeness" suggests that Ezekiel is witnessing a representation of divine reality, emphasizing the mystery and majesty of God's presence.<p><b>of sapphire</b><br>Sapphire is a precious stone often associated with divine beauty and purity. In <a href="/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>, the pavement under God's feet is described as being like sapphire, indicating the glory and holiness of God's presence. The use of sapphire in Ezekiel's vision underscores the splendor and transcendence of the divine throne, pointing to the incomparable nature of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>The prophet and priest who is the author of the book.

Each time, the gaze signals readiness and obedience. Ezekiel, standing firmly on the reliability of God&#8217;s Word, reminds us that divine visions are factual, not fanciful.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and saw above the expanse</b><p>&#8211; The &#8220;expanse&#8221; (firmament) recalls <a href="/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6&#8211;8</a>, the solid canopy God formed to separate waters. Ezekiel tells us this same firmament is present in the heavenly realm, anchoring the vision in the literal structure of creation.<p>&#8211; John likewise sees an expanse &#8220;like crystal&#8221; before God&#8217;s throne (<a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>). Both men describe the same reality from two vantage points, affirming the consistency of Scripture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>above the heads of the cherubim</b><p>&#8211; Cherubim appear first guarding Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>) and later carved upon the mercy seat (<a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18&#8211;22</a>). In every scene they serve, guard, and uphold God&#8217;s holiness.<p>&#8211; Here, their heads lie beneath the expanse, which in turn supports a higher glory. This order stresses that even mighty cherubim are subordinate to the Sovereign enthroned above (<a href="/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the likeness of a throne</b><p>&#8211; A &#8220;likeness&#8221; indicates that the throne, while real, transcends human vocabulary.

By placing a throne at the center, God declares His unchallenged dominion over Israel&#8217;s circumstances&#8212;especially vital as Jerusalem nears judgment (<a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of sapphire</b><p>&#8211; Sapphire, a deep, brilliant blue, evokes heaven&#8217;s purity and majesty (<a href="/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>).

The form of <span class="cmt_word">the man</span> who is the manifestation of Jehovah is implied, though not named. It is he who speaks to the captain of the six ministers of vengeance, himself the seventh, and bids him go in beneath the "whirling wheels" that are beneath the cherub (collective singular, as in <a href="/ezekiel/9-9.htm">Ezekiel 9:9</a>), and fill his hands with <span class="cmt_word">coals of fire</span> (<a href="/ezekiel/1-13.htm">Ezekiel 1:13</a>), and scatter them over the city, as the symbol of its doom. We are reminded of Isaiah's vision (<a href="/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6</a>); but there the work of the fire was to purify, here simply to destroy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Vers 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the cherubim stood,</span> etc. The position of the cherubim is defined, with a vivid distinctness of detail, which once more reminds us of Dante.
