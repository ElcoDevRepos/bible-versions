This reflects the historical reality of Assyria's fall, which occurred in 612 BC with the destruction of Nineveh. The "whole company" suggests the entirety of Assyria's might and people, emphasizing the totality of their defeat. This serves as a reminder of the transient nature of earthly power and the ultimate sovereignty of God over nations. Assyria's presence in this context is a fulfillment of prophetic warnings given by prophets like Isaiah and Nahum, who foretold its downfall due to its pride and cruelty.<p><b>her graves are all around her.</b><br>The imagery of graves surrounding Assyria underscores the completeness of its destruction. In ancient Near Eastern culture, burial practices were significant, and being surrounded by graves could symbolize dishonor and defeat. This phrase highlights the finality of Assyria's judgment, as they are not only defeated but also buried in disgrace. The graves serve as a testament to the consequences of defying God and oppressing His people, as Assyria did during its campaigns against Israel and Judah.<p><b>All of them are slain,</b><br>The phrase "all of them are slain" emphasizes the totality of the judgment against Assyria. It reflects the historical reality of the Assyrian army's defeat and the subsequent collapse of their empire. This serves as a warning to other nations and leaders about the dangers of pride and reliance on military strength. Biblically, it echoes the fate of other nations that opposed God's will, such as Egypt and Babylon, reinforcing the theme of divine justice.<p><b>fallen by the sword.</b><br>The sword is a common biblical symbol of warfare and divine judgment. The Assyrians, known for their brutal military tactics, meet their end through the very means they often employed against others. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative where God uses nations as instruments of judgment but also holds them accountable for their actions. The fall of Assyria by the sword serves as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, where He conquers not through violence but through sacrificial love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>A powerful ancient empire known for its military might and conquests.
