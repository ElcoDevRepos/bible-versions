Tyre's wealth was largely due to its strategic location along the Mediterranean Sea, which facilitated trade with various nations. The city's prosperity is a recurring theme in Ezekiel, emphasizing the material wealth that often led to pride and eventual downfall. This wealth is reminiscent of other biblical warnings against the dangers of relying on material riches, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a> and <a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9-10</a>.<p><b>Damascus traded with you</b><br>Damascus, the capital of Aram (modern-day Syria), was a significant trading partner with Tyre. This relationship underscores the interconnectedness of ancient Near Eastern economies. Damascus was known for its own wealth and strategic location on trade routes, which made it a valuable partner for Tyre. The mention of Damascus also reflects the broader geopolitical landscape of the time, where alliances and trade agreements were crucial for maintaining power and influence.<p><b>wine from Helbon</b><br>Helbon, identified with modern-day Aleppo, was renowned for its high-quality wine. This wine was a luxury item, indicating the level of affluence and the demand for fine goods in Tyre. The reference to Helbon's wine highlights the cultural appreciation for luxury and the role of such goods in trade. Wine in the Bible often symbolizes joy and celebration, as seen in <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>, but it can also represent excess and indulgence, as warned in <a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>.<p><b>wool from Zahar</b><br>Zahar is less well-known, but it is believed to be a region famous for its fine wool. Wool was a valuable commodity in the ancient world, used for clothing and trade. The mention of wool from Zahar indicates the diversity of goods that Tyre imported, showcasing its role as a hub of commerce. Wool's significance in biblical times is also seen in its use in temple garments and offerings, as described in <a href="/exodus/35-6.htm">Exodus 35:6</a> and <a href="/leviticus/13-47.htm">Leviticus 13:47-59</a>.

In the flow of the chapter (<a href="/ezekiel/27-3.htm">Ezekiel 27:3-13</a>), the prophet has already listed metals from Tarshish, slaves and bronze from Javan, horses from Togarmah, and ivory from Cush. The point is clear:<p>&#8226; God had blessed Tyre with abundant opportunities for commerce (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/8-18.htm">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The city used that blessing to exalt itself instead of exalting the Giver (<a href="/isaiah/23-9.htm">Isaiah 23:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Just as the merchants of <a href="/revelation/18-11.htm">Revelation 18:11</a> - 17 weep over fallen Babylon, Tyre&#8217;s downfall will cause economic shockwaves.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and your great wealth of goods</b><p>The accumulation of wealth is not condemned in itself&#8212;Abraham and Job were wealthy&#8212;but trusting in wealth invites judgment. Ezekiel later repeats the charge: &#8220;By your wisdom and understanding you have gained wealth for yourself&#8230; but your heart has grown proud because of your wealth&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/28-4.htm">Ezekiel 28:4-5</a>). Notice the pattern:<p>&#8226; Provision &#8594; Pride (<a href="/proverbs/18-11.htm">Proverbs 18:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Pride &#8594; Presumption (<a href="/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Presumption &#8594; Peril (<a href="/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>).<p>Tyre illustrates the danger Jesus warned of: &#8220;What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world yet forfeits his soul?&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Damascus traded with you</b><p>Damascus, a key city on the overland caravan routes, willingly entered Tyre&#8217;s orbit because the profits were irresistible. Alliances built purely on commerce, however, prove fragile. <a href="/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a> foretells that &#8220;Damascus will cease to be a city,&#8221; showing that no earthly market partner can shield itself from divine judgment. Likewise, <a href="/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a> hints that Damascus was still a bustling hub centuries later, yet spiritual need remained its greatest deficit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>wine from Helbon, wool from Zahar</b><p>Helbon, located north of Damascus, produced a vintage prized by kings (cf. Song of Songs 1:2 for the symbolism of fine wine). Zahar&#8217;s wool was equally luxurious, likely dyed in striking colors (compare &#8220;crimson wool&#8221; in <a href="/hebrews/9-19.htm">Hebrews 9:19</a>). These items highlight three truths:<p>&#8226; Tyre specialized in luxury, not necessities&#8212;echoing <a href="/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4-6</a>, where indulgence dulls concern for righteousness.<p>&#8226; Even high-quality goods cannot avert God&#8217;s decree; when judgment comes, &#8220;their silver and their gold will not be able to deliver them&#8221; (<a href="/zephaniah/1-18.htm">Zephaniah 1:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord notices every detail of our commerce; He records not only the wine and the wool but also the motives behind the trade (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/27-18.htm">Ezekiel 27:18</a> shows Tyre at the height of its commercial glory: diverse products, staggering wealth, strategic partnerships, and luxury commodities. Yet the verse also exposes the city&#8217;s true vulnerability&#8212;trust in riches rather than in the righteous God. The literal record of Tyre&#8217;s trade routes becomes a lasting warning: any society that prizes profit above obedience will eventually face the Judge who weighs both merchandise and hearts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Wine of Helbon.--</span>Helbon is identified with a village of the same name, three and a half hours north of Damascus, rich in ruins, and still devoted to the culture of the vine, from which the costliest wine of the country was made. It was probably the same with the wine of Chalybon, so much prized in Persia.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Damascus</span>. The chief expert of the great capital of Syria was the wine of Helbon. The name occurs only here in the Old Testament. The LXX. gives <span class="accented">Chel-ben</span>; the Vulgate, as if it described the quality of the wine, <span class="accented">vinum pingue</span>. It has been identified with Aleppo and with Chaly-ben, but both of these places are too remote from Damascus, and Mr. J. R. Porter ('Dict. Bible,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>.) finds it in a place a few miles from Damascus, still bearing the name, and famous as producing the finest grapes in Syria. Strabo (<a href="/ezekiel/15.htm">Ezekiel 15</a>. p. 735) names the wine of Chalybon as the favorite drink of the Persian kings, and Athenaeus (1:22) says the same of the wine of Damascus. The name appears in Egyptian monuments in conjunction with Kedes, as a Hittite city, and Brugsch ('Geogr. <span class="accented">AEgypt</span>.<span class="accented"></span>,' 2:45) agrees with Porter as to its position. <span class="cmt_word">White wool.</span> The adjective has been taken as a proper name (Smend) "wool of <span class="accented">Zachar</span>,' the region being identified with Nabatheaea, which was famous for its sheep.
