The phrase "as surely as I live" is an oath, underscoring the seriousness of the message. It reflects God's eternal nature and His sovereign authority over all creation. This type of divine oath is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>, where God swears by His own life, indicating the unchangeable nature of His decrees.<p><b>because you have defiled My sanctuary</b><br>The defilement of the sanctuary refers to the Israelites' idolatry and sinful practices within the temple, which was meant to be a holy place dedicated to the worship of Yahweh. The temple in Jerusalem was central to Jewish worship and identity, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The defilement of the sanctuary is a grave sin, as it represents a direct violation of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This echoes the warnings given in <a href="/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31-32</a>, where God warns of desolation if His sanctuary is defiled.<p><b>with all your detestable idols and abominations,</b><br>Idolatry was a persistent issue for Israel, often leading them away from the worship of the one true God. The term "detestable idols" highlights the severity of their sin, as these idols were often associated with pagan practices that were abhorrent to God. Abominations refer to practices that are morally and ritually repugnant, such as those condemned in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25-26</a>. The presence of idols in the temple was a direct affront to God's holiness and a breach of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>).<p><b>I Myself will withdraw My favor;</b><br>God's withdrawal of favor signifies the removal of His protective presence and blessings. This is a direct consequence of Israel's unfaithfulness and mirrors the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The withdrawal of divine favor often leads to vulnerability and exposure to enemy nations, as seen in the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem.<p><b>I will not look upon you with pity,</b><br>The absence of pity indicates a period of judgment where God allows the consequences of sin to unfold without intervention. This reflects the justice of God, who, despite His mercy, must uphold righteousness. The lack of pity is a fulfillment of the warnings given through the prophets, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/13-14.htm">Jeremiah 13:14</a>, where God speaks of not sparing or having compassion.<p><b>nor will I spare you.</b><br>The phrase underscores the inevitability of judgment due to persistent rebellion. God's decision not to spare is consistent with His character as a just judge who must address sin. This is reminiscent of the judgment upon Sodom and Gomorrah, where God did not spare the cities due to their wickedness (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>). It serves as a sobering reminder of the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

The verse reveals His unchanging character: He is alive, holy, and true to His word. Idolatry still provokes Him, and unchecked sin still forfeits His favor. But His goal remains redemptive&#8212;purging what defiles so that His people may once again dwell in wholehearted fellowship with Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Because thou . . . therefore will I.</span>--The parallel between Israel's conduct and God's judgments is here, as everywhere, brought into strong light.

The word properly means to <span class= "ital">withdraw, </span>and is to be taken either as reflective, "withdraw myself," or as having for its object "mine eye" of the following clause, the sense being the same in either case: the Lord will withdraw from them His presence and His compassion.<p><a href="/context/ezekiel/5-12.htm" title="A third part of you shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the middle of you: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about you; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.">Ezekiel 5:12-17</a> follow in plain language the symbolical prophecies of <a href="/context/ezekiel/5-1.htm" title="And you, son of man, take you a sharp knife, take you a barber's razor, and cause it to pass on your head and on your beard: then take you balances to weigh, and divide the hair.">Ezekiel 5:1-4</a>, and give the inspired interpretation of their meaning. They bring out very distinctly the fact that the judgments should not end with the destruction of Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because thou hast defiled my sanctuary,</span> etc. For the full account of the nature of the abominations which are thus spoken of, see notes on ch. 8. This was, after all, the root evil of all other evils. Pollution of worship, the degradation of the highest element in man's nature, passed into pollution and degradation of his whole life. Even in our Lord's acted teaching, in <a href="/john/2-15.htm">John 2:15, 16</a> and <a href="/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>, we have the same principle implied. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore will I also diminish thee,</span> etc. The italics show that the last word is not in the Hebrew. The Revised Version margin suggests two other renderings. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">Therefore will I also withdraw mine eye that it shall not spare</span>; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">Therefore will I hew thee down.</span> To these we may add the LXX. <span class="accented">I will reject</span>, and the Vulgate <span class="accented">I will break in pieces</span>, which apparently, like (2), imply a different reading. Most recent critics suggest conjectural emendations of the text. I incline to rest satisfied with the Authorized Version, and to explain it by <a href="/ezekiel/16-27.htm">Ezekiel 16:27</a>. The word implies not only the decrease, but the entire withdrawal of Jehovah's favour. Possibly there is an implied reference to the command of <a href="/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-32.htm">Deuteronomy 12:32</a>. Jerusalem had "diminished" from the Law of God, had, as it were, erased the commandments which were of supreme obligation, and therefore, as by a <span class="accented">lex talionis</span>, God would diminish her. <span class="cmt_word">Neither will I</span> <span class="cmt_word">have any pity</span>. The words are, of course, anthropomorphic, and have therefore to be received with the necessary limitations. As the earthly minister of justice must not yield to a weak pity which would be incompatible with the assertion of the eternal law of righteousness, so neither will the Supreme Judge. There is a time for all things, and justice must do its work first, in order that there may be room for pity afterwards.
