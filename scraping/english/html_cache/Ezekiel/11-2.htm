In the context of Ezekiel's prophetic ministry, God frequently speaks to him, providing visions and messages for the people of Israel. This divine communication underscores the authority and authenticity of Ezekiel's message. The phrase "the LORD said" is a common biblical expression denoting a revelation from God, emphasizing the importance of the message that follows.<p><b>Son of man</b><br>This title, used frequently in the book of Ezekiel, highlights the humanity of the prophet in contrast to the divine nature of God. It serves to remind Ezekiel of his role as a representative of humanity, tasked with delivering God's messages. The term "Son of man" is also significant in the New Testament, where it is used by Jesus to refer to Himself, linking the prophetic role of Ezekiel to the messianic mission of Christ.<p><b>these are the men who plot evil</b><br>The men referred to here are leaders in Jerusalem who are devising plans contrary to God's will. This phrase highlights the moral and spiritual corruption among the city's leadership. In the broader biblical narrative, plotting evil is often associated with rebellion against God, as seen in other instances such as the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11) and the actions of various kings of Israel and Judah.<p><b>and give wicked counsel in this city</b><br>The counsel given by these men is described as wicked, indicating that it leads the people away from God's commandments and towards sin. This reflects a broader theme in the Bible where leaders are held accountable for guiding their people, as seen in the warnings given to shepherds of Israel in <a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>. The city, Jerusalem, is significant as the center of religious and political life for the Israelites, making the impact of such counsel even more profound. The failure of leadership here foreshadows the eventual judgment and exile that the city will face.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of God's visions and messages, tasked with delivering them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who communicates directly with Ezekiel, revealing the spiritual and moral state of the people and their leaders.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_men.htm">The Men</a></b><br>These are the leaders or elders of Israel who are accused of plotting evil and giving wicked counsel, leading the people astray.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>Refers to Jerusalem, the center of Jewish worship and identity, which is under threat due to the people's disobedience and the leaders' corruption.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/plotting_evil_and_giving_wicked_counsel.htm">Plotting Evil and Giving Wicked Counsel</a></b><br>This describes the actions of the leaders who are steering the people away from God's commandments, contributing to the city's impending judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_responsibility_of_leadership.htm">The Responsibility of Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders are accountable to God for their influence and guidance.
