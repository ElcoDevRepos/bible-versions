This area symbolizes the presence of God and is set apart from the common areas. The priests entering this space signifies their role as mediators between God and the people, highlighting the sanctity and reverence required in their duties. This separation underscores the holiness of God and the need for purity in worship, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>, where God emphasizes His holiness among those who approach Him.<p><b>they must not go out into the outer court</b><br>The outer court is accessible to the general population, contrasting with the inner court's exclusivity. The instruction for priests not to enter the outer court in their holy garments underscores the distinction between the sacred and the common. This separation is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, emphasizing the need for holiness and the avoidance of defilement, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/15-31.htm">Leviticus 15:31</a>, where the Israelites are warned against defiling the tabernacle.<p><b>until they have left behind the garments in which they minister</b><br>The garments worn by the priests are consecrated for service in the temple, symbolizing their set-apart status for God's work. These garments, described in detail in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>, are imbued with spiritual significance, representing righteousness and purity. The act of leaving these garments behind before entering the outer court signifies the transition from sacred service to ordinary life, maintaining the sanctity of the priestly role.<p><b>for these are holy</b><br>The holiness of the garments reflects the holiness of God and the sacred nature of the priestly duties. This concept is rooted in the broader biblical theme of holiness, where objects, people, and places dedicated to God are set apart for His purposes. The garments' holiness is a reminder of the priests' responsibility to uphold God's standards, as seen in <a href="/exodus/29-29.htm">Exodus 29:29</a>, where the garments are consecrated for Aaron and his sons.<p><b>They are to put on other clothes</b><br>The instruction to change clothes before entering the outer court highlights the distinction between sacred and secular activities. This practice ensures that the holiness associated with the priestly garments is not profaned by contact with the common world. It reflects the broader biblical principle of maintaining purity and separation from sin, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>, where believers are called to be separate from the world.<p><b>before they approach the places that are for the people</b><br>The places for the people refer to the areas of the temple accessible to the general population, emphasizing the need for a clear boundary between the sacred and the common.

The verse affirms the literal, enduring principle that holiness is never self-defined; it is God-defined and God-protected (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>).<p>&#8226; By respecting these garments, priests model reverence that every believer is called to imitate (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They are to put on other clothes</b><p>&#8220;They are to put on other clothes&#8230;&#8221;

Practically, it maintains order and teaches Israel that access to God requires proper mediation&#8212;ultimately fulfilled in Jesus, the one Mediator (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/42-14.htm">Ezekiel 42:14</a> gives precise, literal instructions for future priests, highlighting God&#8217;s unwavering insistence on the separation of the holy from the common. Priests must stay in the inner court until they remove their consecrated garments, then don ordinary clothes before mingling with the people. The protocol safeguards reverence, protects the congregation, and illustrates the broader biblical truth that sinful humanity needs a mediator clothed in holiness&#8212;perfectly realized in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/42.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">There they shall lay their garments.</span>--It was apparently the requirement of the law that the priests should wear their official garments only when engaged in priestly duties within the tabernacle; this is not expressly stated in general terms, but it is said that they were to wear them when engaged in such duty (<a href="/exodus/28-43.htm" title="And they shall be on Aaron, and on his sons, when they come in to the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near to the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a statute for ever to him and his seed after him.">Exodus 28:43</a>), and in some particular cases that they were to put them off when they went out of the tabernacle (<a href="/context/leviticus/6-10.htm" title="And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put on his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire has consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.">Leviticus 6:10-11</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-23.htm" title="And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:">Leviticus 16:23</a>).
