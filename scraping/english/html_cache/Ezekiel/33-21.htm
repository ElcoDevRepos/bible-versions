The exile was a fulfillment of prophetic warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah and Isaiah, who had cautioned Israel about the consequences of their disobedience to God.<p><b>on the fifth day of the tenth month</b><br>The specific dating highlights the precision with which events were recorded, underscoring their historical significance.

This reflects the dire circumstances in Jerusalem, where the city was under siege by the Babylonians.

The fall of the city was a pivotal moment in Jewish history, signifying God's judgment on Judah for their idolatry and rebellion. It also serves as a backdrop for the hope of restoration and the promise of a new covenant, themes that Ezekiel would later explore. Theologically, this event foreshadows the ultimate judgment and redemption found in Jesus Christ, who offers restoration and hope to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who was among the exiles in Babylon.

It was now a year and five months since the final destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple, and this seems to be a long time to be occupied in carrying the news to Chaldea. The news itself must have reached Babylon long since, but Ezekiel was to receive the tidings, doubtless with full and circumstantial details, from the mouth of a fugitive, and there are reasons why this could not well have occurred earlier. After the capture of the city, the general, Nebuzaradan, took the mass of the people and the abundant spoil to carry them to Babylon (<a href="/context/jeremiah/52-15.htm" title="Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.">Jeremiah 52:15-27</a>). He first took them to Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah, where a few were executed, and some time must have been occupied in settling the affairs of the desolated land. After this, the journey of the captives, carrying along with them the weighty spoil, was a slow one, and perhaps with frequent halts. We know from <a href="/ezra/7-9.htm" title="For on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God on him.">Ezra 7:9</a> that the returning captives, not thus hindered, occupied exactly four months in the journey from Babylon to Jerusalem. It is not surprising, therefore, that it should have been four times as long from the capture of Jerusalem to the arrival of the captives in Chaldea. This prophecy was nearly two months before that recorded in Ezekiel 32.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the twelfth year</span>, etc. The capture of Jerusalem took place in the fourth month of the eleventh year (<a href="/jeremiah/39-2.htm">Jeremiah 39:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-6.htm">Jeremiah 52:6</a>) from the captivity of Jehoiachin and the beginning of Zedekiah's reign. Are we to assume some error of transcription? or is it within the limits of probability that eighteen months would pass without any direct communication from Jerusalem of what had passed there? There is, I conceive, nothing improbable in what is stated. The exiles of Tel-Ahib were not on the high-roads of commerce or of war. All previous communications were cut off by the presence of the Chaldean armies. In the words, <span class="cmt_word">one that had escaped</span>, the prophet clearly referred to the intimation given him at the time of his wife's death (<a href="/ezekiel/24-26.htm">Ezekiel 24:26</a>). When the fugitive entered he saw that the hour had at last come. One would give much to know who the fugitive was, but we can only conjecture. Had Baruch been sent by Jeremiah to bear the tidings to his brother prophet? Such a mission would have been a fulfillment of <a href="/jeremiah/45-5.htm">Jeremiah 45:5</a>.
