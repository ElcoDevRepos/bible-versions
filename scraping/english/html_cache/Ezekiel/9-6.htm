In the context of Ezekiel, this judgment is a divine response to the pervasive idolatry and sin in Jerusalem. The severity of the judgment reflects the seriousness of the people's rebellion against God. Historically, such judgments were not uncommon in the ancient Near East, where entire populations could be subject to conquest and destruction. This also echoes the judgment seen in the flood narrative (Genesis 6-9) and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19), where entire communities faced divine wrath due to their sinfulness.<p><b>but do not go near anyone who has the mark.</b><br>The mark serves as a sign of divine protection, reminiscent of the blood on the doorposts during the Passover in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-7.htm">Exodus 12:7, 13</a>). This mark distinguishes those who grieve over the abominations committed in the city, showing a remnant faithful to God amidst widespread apostasy. It prefigures the sealing of the 144,000 in <a href="/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3-4</a>, where God's servants are marked for protection during tribulation. This concept of marking for protection underscores God's justice and mercy, ensuring that the righteous are spared even in times of widespread judgment.<p><b>Now begin at My sanctuary.&#8221;</b><br>Judgment starting at the sanctuary highlights the principle that God's house and His people are held to a higher standard (<a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>). The temple, meant to be a place of worship and holiness, had become defiled by idolatry and corruption. This reflects the broader biblical theme that those closest to God, who have received His revelation and blessings, are accountable for their response to Him. The sanctuary's defilement necessitated a cleansing, similar to Jesus' cleansing of the temple (<a href="/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12-13</a>), emphasizing the need for purity in worship.<p><b>So they began with the elders who were before the temple.</b><br>The elders, as leaders and representatives of the people, were held accountable first. Their position before the temple signifies their role in leading the community in worship and governance. Their judgment underscores the biblical principle that leaders bear greater responsibility (<a href="/james/3.htm">James 3:1</a>). This also serves as a warning to spiritual leaders to maintain integrity and faithfulness, as their influence can lead others either toward or away from God. The elders' judgment is a sobering reminder of the consequences of leading others into sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_marked_individuals.htm">The Marked Individuals</a></b><br>Those who are spared from judgment because they have received a mark, signifying their faithfulness and lamentation over the sins of Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_executioners.htm">The Executioners</a></b><br>Angelic beings or agents of God's judgment, tasked with carrying out the divine decree.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctuary.htm">The Sanctuary</a></b><br>The temple in Jerusalem, representing the starting point of God's judgment, emphasizing the principle that judgment begins with the house of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_elders.htm">The Elders</a></b><br>Leaders of the people, who are the first to face judgment, highlighting the accountability of those in positions of spiritual leadership.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin has severe consequences, and God's judgment is a response to persistent disobedience and rebellion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_lamentation.htm">The Importance of Lamentation</a></b><br>Those who mourn over sin and seek righteousness are marked for protection, emphasizing the value of a contrite heart.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_begins_at_the_house_of_god.htm">Judgment Begins at the House of God</a></b><br>Believers are held to a higher standard, and spiritual leaders bear significant responsibility for guiding their communities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God is just and sovereign, executing judgment according to His perfect wisdom and timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_assurance_of_divine_protection.htm">The Assurance of Divine Protection</a></b><br>Those who are faithful to God and bear His mark are assured of His protection, even amidst widespread judgment.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_9_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 9:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_9_6_Judgment_starts_at_sanctuary.htm">How does Ezekiel 9:6 emphasize God's judgment starting with His sanctuary?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_begin_at_My_sanctuary_mean.htm">What does "begin at My sanctuary" reveal about God's expectations for His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_9_6_Church_holiness_guide.htm">How can Ezekiel 9:6 guide us in maintaining holiness within the church?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_do_Ezekiel_9_6_and_1_Peter_4_17_relate.htm">In what ways does Ezekiel 9:6 connect to 1 Peter 4:17 about judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_9_6_s_impact_on_accountability.htm">How should Ezekiel 9:6 influence our personal accountability before God today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_Ezekiel_9_6_command_killing.htm">Why does Ezekiel 9:6 command the killing of innocents, including children and the elderly?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_9_6_and_God_s_love_align.htm">How does Ezekiel 9:6 align with the concept of a loving and merciful God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_harsh_judgment_in_Ezekiel_9_6.htm">What historical context explains the harsh judgment in Ezekiel 9:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ezekiel_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ezekiel 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_ezekiel_9_6_show_god's_love.htm">How does Ezekiel 9:6 reconcile a loving God with the command to kill everyone, including children and the elderly?
