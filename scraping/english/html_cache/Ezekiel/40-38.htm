The "chamber" refers to a room or space designated for a particular function, likely related to temple rituals. The "doorway" indicates access and transition, suggesting that this chamber was an integral part of the temple's operational structure. The "portico" is a covered entrance or porch, which in ancient Near Eastern architecture often served as a transitional space between the sacred and the secular. The "inner gateways" refer to the entrances leading into the inner court of the temple, emphasizing the sacredness and restricted access of this area. This setup reflects the meticulous organization of temple activities and the importance of maintaining purity and order in worship practices.<p><b>There the burnt offering was to be washed.</b><br>The washing of the burnt offering signifies the ritual purification necessary before sacrifices could be presented to God. This practice underscores the holiness required in approaching God, as seen in Levitical laws (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). The act of washing symbolizes cleansing from impurity, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament. This purification process prefigures the ultimate cleansing from sin through Jesus Christ, the perfect sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>). The location of this washing near the inner gateways highlights the transition from the outer to the inner courts, symbolizing the movement from the profane to the holy. This ritual act serves as a reminder of the need for spiritual cleanliness and preparation in worship, a principle that remains relevant in Christian theology.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the detailed vision of a new temple in chapters 40-48.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The vision of the temple in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40</a> is a prophetic and symbolic representation of God's presence and future restoration for Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/inner_gateways.htm">Inner Gateways</a></b><br>These are part of the temple's structure, symbolizing access to the sacred areas where worship and sacrifices occur.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/chamber.htm">Chamber</a></b><br>A specific room mentioned in the vision, used for preparing burnt offerings, indicating the importance of ritual purity and preparation in worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offerings.htm">Burnt Offerings</a></b><br>Sacrifices made to God, symbolizing atonement and dedication, which were washed in the chamber to ensure ceremonial cleanliness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/ritual_purity_and_worship.htm">Ritual Purity and Worship</a></b><br>The washing of burnt offerings highlights the importance of purity in worship.

He sees an actual room&#8212;four walls, a roof, and a defined purpose. The text does not present a symbol but a literal space, just as earlier temples had real storage and priestly rooms (<a href="/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/42-13.htm">Ezekiel 42:13</a>). By including a chamber, God confirms that worship in the coming age retains order and structure, reflecting His character of precision and holiness (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with a doorway</b><p>A doorway signals access. Priests could enter, but the common worshiper could not, preserving the sanctity required for sacrificial service (<a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>). Doors appear repeatedly in temple descriptions&#8212;Solomon&#8217;s temple, the restored temple of Ezra, and here&#8212;underscoring the truth that fellowship with God is available yet guarded (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>). The literal doorway foreshadows Christ, who opens the way while still requiring purity for entry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by the portico in each of the inner gateways</b><p>The portico (or vestibule) marks the transition from outer courts to holier ground (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>). Placing the chamber near every inner gate ensures that wherever a priest enters, preparation for sacrifice is immediately at hand. This mirrors the earlier bronze laver set between the altar and the tent of meeting (<a href="/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18-19</a>). The strategic location teaches that cleansing precedes deeper intimacy with God&#8212;both then and now (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>; <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There the burnt offering was to be washed</b><p>The burnt offering symbolized total consecration (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>: &#8220;The entrails and legs must be washed with water, and the priest is to burn all of it on the altar; it is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD,&#8221;). Washing removed defilement so the sacrifice could be wholly given to God. Ezekiel&#8217;s future temple preserves that ritual, affirming that God&#8217;s demand for holiness never diminishes (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>). Even in a prophetic, millennial context, cleansing remains mandatory before worship. The water points ahead to the ultimate cleansing provided by Christ&#8217;s blood and the ongoing sanctification by the Word (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/40-38.htm">Ezekiel 40:38</a> records a literal room, literal doorway, strategic placement, and a clear function: washing the burnt offering.

The verse reminds believers that access to His presence is real but never casual; cleansing and consecration are always required.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/40.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">And the chambers and the entries thereof.</span>--These words in the original are in the singular, and have no article. The word for <span class= "ital">chamber</span> is an entirely different one from that used in the former part of the chapter (<a href="/ezekiel/40-10.htm" title="And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.">Ezekiel 40:10</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/40-12.htm" title="The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the little chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.">Ezekiel 40:12-13</a>). The verse should be translated, "And a cell with its door by the posts of the gates; there they washed the burnt offering." All the arrangements for sacrificing are here described in connection with the north gate, although in <a href="/ezekiel/46-2.htm" title="And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.">Ezekiel 46:2</a> it is said that at certain festivals the prince shall enter by the east gate, and there worship while the priests prepare his offerings. In the law it was required (<a href="/leviticus/1-11.htm" title="And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about on the altar.">Leviticus 1:11</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-25.htm" title="Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is most holy.">Leviticus 6:25</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-2.htm" title="In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about on the altar.">Leviticus 7:2</a>) that all sacrifices should be slain in the court at the north side of the altar. Here the slaying is done at the north gate, but within the outer court. The reason appears to be that in the law each offerer was to slay his own victim, but here (<a href="/ezekiel/44-11.htm" title="Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.">Ezekiel 44:11</a>) the sacrifice is to be slain by the Levites, and it was therefore desirable that it should be done in the presence of the offerer and the people, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in the outer court. There was also a further reason in the convenience of disposing of the flesh of the victims. Only the whole burnt offerings and the fat and the kidneys of the others required to be taken to the altar in the inner court; while all the flesh of the sin offerings and the priests' portion of the peace offerings was to be carried to the priests' cooking place (F, Plan II.) to which a walk led from this point. The rest of the flesh of the peace offerings was taken to the people's cooking places (E) in the corners of the outer court. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38-43.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">arrangements for sacrifice</span>.

As the verse explains, these were different from the guard-rooms in the gates (vers. 7, 21) and the chambers on the pavement (ver. 17), although the same Hebrew word is employed to designate the latter. The cells under consideration were expressly designed for washing "the inwards and the legs" of the victims brought for sacrifice (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). Whether such a cell stood at each of the three gates, as the plural seems to indicate, although described only in connection with the north (Keil, Kliefoth, Plumptre), or merely at one gate, and that the north - because, according to the Law (<a href="/leviticus/1-11.htm">Leviticus 1:11</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-18.htm">Leviticus 6:18</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-2.htm">Leviticus 7:2</a>), on the north side of the altar burnt, sin, and trespass offerings were to be killed (Havernick, Hengstenberg) - or the east, which is alluded to in vet, s. 39, 40 (Hitzig, Ewald, Smend), is controverted, though the former view seems the preferable, seeing that, according to <a href="/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1, 2</a>, the priests were to prepare burnt offerings and peace offerings for the prince at the posts of the east gate.

Keil and Kliefoth place those at the south and north gates on the west side; that at the east gate Keil locates on its north side, Kliefoth placing one in the side wall at each side of the gate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/40-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">There was a chamber</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;li&#353;&#183;k&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3957.htm">Strong's 3957: </a> </span><span class="str2">Room, chamber, hall, cell</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with a doorway</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;i&#7791;&#183;&#7717;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6607.htm">Strong's 6607: </a> </span><span class="str2">An opening, door, entrance way</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by the portico</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1500;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;l&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_352.htm">Strong's 352: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strength, strong, a chief, a ram, a pilaster, an oak, strong tree</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in each of the inner gateways.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8179.htm">Strong's 8179: </a> </span><span class="str2">An opening, door, gate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">There</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8033.htm">Strong's 8033: </a> </span><span class="str2">There, then, thither</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the burnt offering</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5930.htm">Strong's 5930: </a> </span><span class="str2">Whole burnt offering</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was to be washed.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#238;&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1740.htm">Strong's 1740: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rinse, cleanse away by rinsing or washing</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/40-38.htm">Ezekiel 40:38 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/40-38.htm">Ezekiel 40:38 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/40-38.htm">Ezekiel 40:38 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/40-38.htm">Ezekiel 40:38 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/40-38.htm">Ezekiel 40:38 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/40-38.htm">Ezekiel 40:38  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/40-38.htm">Ezekiel 40:38 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/40-38.htm">Ezekiel 40:38 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/40-38.htm">Ezekiel 40:38 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/40-38.htm">Ezekiel 40:38 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/40-38.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 40:38 A chamber with its door was (Ezek.
