It underscores the distinction between God and man, highlighting Ezekiel's position as a mediator of divine messages. This title is also significant in the New Testament, where it is used by Jesus to refer to Himself, emphasizing His incarnation and role as the Messiah.<p><b>&#8220;now lift up your eyes to the north.&#8221;</b><br>The direction "north" is significant in biblical texts, often associated with judgment and invasion, as many of Israel's enemies, such as Babylon, came from the north. In this context, it indicates the location of the idolatrous practices that have provoked God's anger. The north side of the temple was traditionally associated with the entrance for the priests, making the presence of idolatry there particularly egregious.<p><b>So I lifted up my eyes to the north,</b><br>Ezekiel's obedience in lifting his eyes signifies his role as a faithful prophet, willing to confront the abominations that have infiltrated the sacred space. This act of looking symbolizes awareness and acknowledgment of the sin that has corrupted the temple, a necessary step before repentance and restoration can occur.<p><b>and in the entrance north of the Altar Gate</b><br>The "Altar Gate" refers to the gate leading to the inner court of the temple, where sacrifices were made. This location is significant because it was meant to be a place of worship and sacrifice to Yahweh, yet it has been defiled by idolatry. The presence of idols here represents a direct affront to the holiness of God and the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>I saw this idol of jealousy.</b><br>The "idol of jealousy" likely refers to an image or object that provokes God's jealousy, a term used to describe His righteous anger against idolatry. This idol represents the spiritual adultery of Israel, as they have turned from worshiping the one true God to false gods. The concept of divine jealousy is rooted in the covenant relationship, where God demands exclusive worship and loyalty, similar to the exclusivity expected in a marriage. This idolatry is a violation of the first commandment and is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, highlighting the need for repentance and return to covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of God's visions and messages, tasked with delivering them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/son_of_man.htm">Son of Man</a></b><br>A title used by God to address Ezekiel, emphasizing his humanity and role as a representative of the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_north.htm">The North</a></b><br>In this context, the direction Ezekiel is instructed to look, symbolically significant as the source of judgment and invasion in biblical prophecy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gate_of_the_altar.htm">The Gate of the Altar</a></b><br>Part of the temple complex, this location is significant as a place of worship and sacrifice, now defiled by idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_idol_of_jealousy.htm">The Idol of Jealousy</a></b><br>A representation of the idolatrous practices that provoked God's jealousy, symbolizing the spiritual adultery of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but anything that takes the place of God in our hearts.

<a href="/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a>).<p>&#8226; It also signals responsibility; the one called &#8220;son of man&#8221; must faithfully relay what he sees (<a href="/ezekiel/33-7.htm">Ezekiel 33:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;now lift up your eyes to the north.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226;

4:6) and with invading forces (<a href="/ezekiel/38-6.htm">Ezekiel 38:6, 15</a>).<p>&#8226; By focusing Ezekiel&#8217;s eyes, the Lord prepares him&#8212;and through him, the exiles&#8212;for the shocking vision that will justify the coming discipline (<a href="/ezekiel/9-5.htm">Ezekiel 9:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So I lifted up my eyes to the north</b><p>&#8226; Ezekiel&#8217;s instant obedience models the proper response to divine revelation (<a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Looking where God points positions the prophet to see truth he could never discover on his own (<a href="/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The act underlines that revelation is God-initiated; understanding begins when we heed His specific directions (<a href="/psalms/25-4.htm">Psalm 25:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the entrance north of the Altar Gate</b><p>&#8226;

The object is called &#8220;idol of jealousy&#8221; because it provokes the righteous jealousy of God, who alone deserves worship (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4-5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16</a>).<p>&#8226; It recalls Manasseh&#8217;s Asherah image set inside the temple (<a href="/2_kings/21-7.htm">2 Kings 21:7</a>) and the abominations that persisted even after Josiah&#8217;s reforms (<a href="/jeremiah/7-30.htm">Jeremiah 7:30</a>).<p>&#8226;

By calling Ezekiel &#8220;son of man,&#8221; the Lord reinforces the prophet&#8217;s role as a mortal spokesman. Commanding him to look north connects the vision to the direction from which judgment will come. Ezekiel&#8217;s swift obedience allows him&#8212;and us&#8212;to see why divine discipline is necessary: the people have placed a provocative idol at the very heart of worship. The passage underscores God&#8217;s holiness, His jealous love, and His right to judge when His covenant is brazenly violated.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">The way toward the north.</span>--This shows that Ezekiel in his vision was within the court of the priests, as otherwise he could not have looked <span class= "ital">toward </span>the north to see the idol in the north gate. He had already seen this; but now his attention is directed to it particularly. It was not enough that he should see it; it was to be especially pointed out as a part of the reason for the Divine judgments.
