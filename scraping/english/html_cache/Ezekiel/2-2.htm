In the context of Ezekiel's calling, it underscores the authority and divine origin of the message. The phrase reflects the biblical pattern where God initiates communication with His prophets (e.g., Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>, Isaiah in <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>). This divine speech is a hallmark of prophetic literature, where the prophet serves as a mouthpiece for God's words.<p><b>the Spirit entered me</b><br>The entry of the Spirit signifies empowerment and divine enablement for the task ahead. In the Old Testament, the Spirit of God often comes upon individuals to equip them for specific roles or missions (e.g., <a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). This moment marks Ezekiel's transformation from a priest to a prophet, highlighting the necessity of divine assistance in fulfilling God's purposes. The Spirit's entry is a precursor to the New Testament understanding of the Holy Spirit indwelling believers (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>).<p><b>and set me on my feet</b><br>Being set on his feet symbolizes readiness and preparation to receive and deliver God's message. It contrasts with Ezekiel's initial position of being overwhelmed and prostrate (<a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>). This act of being raised up by the Spirit indicates divine strength and support, enabling Ezekiel to stand firm in his prophetic ministry. It reflects the biblical theme of God raising His servants to fulfill their calling (e.g., <a href="/daniel/10-11.htm">Daniel 10:11</a>).<p><b>and I heard Him speaking to me</b><br>Hearing God speak directly emphasizes the clarity and authority of the divine message. It assures that the message is not of human origin but is divinely inspired. This hearing is not just physical but spiritual, indicating Ezekiel's receptivity to God's voice. It parallels other instances where prophets receive direct communication from God (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>, <a href="/habakkuk/2.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>). This phrase underscores the importance of listening to God's voice in obedience and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit.htm">The Spirit</a></b><br>Refers to the Spirit of God, who empowers and enables Ezekiel to stand and receive God's message.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker who communicates His will and message to Ezekiel through the Spirit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context in which Ezekiel receives his prophetic call, a time of judgment and hope for the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience of Ezekiel's prophecies, who are in exile due to their disobedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/empowerment_by_the_spirit.htm">Empowerment by the Spirit</a></b><br>Just as the Spirit entered Ezekiel and enabled him to stand and listen, believers today are empowered by the Holy Spirit to understand and act on God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/readiness_to_hear_god's_voice.htm">Readiness to Hear God's Voice</a></b><br>Ezekiel's experience teaches us the importance of being spiritually prepared to hear and respond to God's voice in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_commissioning.htm">Divine Commissioning</a></b><br>God calls and equips His people for specific tasks.

Ezekiel does not approach the Lord; the Lord approaches him, just as He did with Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) and Jeremiah at his calling (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4-9</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase assures us that Scripture records an actual conversation, not a vision manufactured by human imagination (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord speaks personally&#8212;He knows Ezekiel by name, just as Jesus later calls His sheep by name and they follow (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3, 27</a>).<p>&#8226; Whenever God speaks, the message carries divine authority; therefore we read Ezekiel&#8217;s words as literal truth, not allegory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Spirit entered me</b><p>&#8226; The same Spirit who hovered over the waters in creation (<a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>) now fills Ezekiel. Nothing in God&#8217;s service begins without the Spirit&#8217;s empowering (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Ezekiel experiences an internal transformation similar to later believers at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1-4</a>) and to Jesus breathing on the disciples (<a href="/john/20-22.htm">John 20:22</a>).<p>&#8226; This indwelling is personal: &#8220;entered me,&#8221; confirming that the Holy Spirit is not distant force but divine Person who literally inhabits God&#8217;s servants (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The Spirit&#8217;s presence guarantees the reliability of the prophet&#8217;s message (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and set me on my feet</b><p>&#8226; God never leaves His servants flat on their faces; He strengthens them to stand, as He did for Daniel (<a href="/daniel/10-10.htm">Daniel 10:10-11</a>) and John on Patmos (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Being &#8220;set&#8230;on my feet&#8221; shows divine initiative&#8212;Ezekiel does not muster strength; the Spirit physically raises him.<p>&#8226; Standing signifies readiness for commission. Paul was likewise told, &#8220;Stand on your feet; I have appeared to appoint you&#8221; (<a href="/acts/26-16.htm">Acts 26:16</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, the Spirit still supplies courage to stand firm (<a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I heard Him speaking to me</b><p>&#8226; Once upright, Ezekiel can pay full attention. Hearing follows empowerment; obedience follows revelation (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s speech is clear, not cryptic. Like young Samuel, Ezekiel must simply listen (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores relationship: God speaks; His servant hears. This becomes the pattern for every prophetic message that follows (<a href="/ezekiel/3-10.htm">Ezekiel 3:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine hearing implies intent to obey (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). Scripture is meant to be received and acted upon, not merely studied.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/2-2.htm">Ezekiel 2:2</a> records a literal moment when God&#8217;s spoken word, the Holy Spirit&#8217;s indwelling, supernatural strengthening, and attentive hearing converge. The verse reminds us that:<p>&#8226; God initiates contact.<p>&#8226; The Spirit empowers.<p>&#8226; The Lord enables us to stand.<p>&#8226; Obedience begins with attentive listening.<p>What God accomplished in Ezekiel He continues to do in every believer willing to hear, be filled, stand, and obey.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And the spirit entered into me.--</span>Always Divine strength is vouchsafed to the prophets when thus overcome by the glory of their visions. (Comp. <a href="/context/isaiah/6-5.htm" title="Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the middle of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 6:5-7</a>; <a href="/daniel/8-18.htm" title="Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.">Daniel 8:18</a>; <a href="/context/daniel/10-15.htm" title="And when he had spoken such words to me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.">Daniel 10:15-19</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm" title="And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead.

There can be no doubt, therefore, that <span class= "ital">the spirit </span>is here the Spirit of God, and not merely the prophet's own human vigour and courage; and this is made still more plain in <a href="/ezekiel/3-24.htm" title="Then the spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet, and spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut yourself within your house.">Ezekiel 3:24</a>. It was this which "set him upon his feet," and enabled him amid such surroundings of awe to receive the word spoken to him; for while the revelation by vision still remained before him (see <a href="/context/ezekiel/3-12.htm" title="Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.">Ezekiel 3:12-13</a>), he was now to be instructed also by the clearer revelation of the direct voice from heaven.
