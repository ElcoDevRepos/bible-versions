It underscores the distinction between God and man, highlighting Ezekiel's position as a mediator of divine messages. This title is also used in the New Testament, notably by Jesus, to emphasize His role as the Messiah and His identification with humanity.<p><b>set your face against</b><br>This phrase indicates a firm and resolute opposition. In biblical terms, setting one's face against someone or something implies a determined stance, often in judgment or confrontation. It suggests that Ezekiel is to take a clear and unwavering position against the false prophets, reflecting God's own stance against them.<p><b>the daughters of your people</b><br>The mention of "daughters" here is significant, as it highlights that women, as well as men, were involved in the false prophetic activities. In the ancient Near Eastern context, women could hold roles as prophetesses, but in this case, they were leading the people astray. This reflects a broader cultural issue where both genders were susceptible to false teachings and practices.<p><b>who prophesy out of their own imagination</b><br>This phrase condemns the false prophets for speaking from their own minds rather than delivering messages from God. It highlights the danger of self-deception and the human tendency to create messages that align with personal desires rather than divine truth. This is a recurring theme in the Bible, where true prophecy is distinguished by its divine origin, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a>.<p><b>Prophesy against them</b><br>Ezekiel is commanded to speak God's truth in opposition to the false messages being spread. This directive underscores the role of a true prophet as one who must confront falsehood and declare God's judgment. It also serves as a warning to the people to discern between true and false prophecy, a theme echoed in the New Testament, such as in 1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>, which advises believers to test the spirits.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

True prophetesses, as in the case of Miriam (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.">Exodus 15:20</a>), Deborah (<a href="/judges/4-4.htm" title="And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.">Judges 4:4</a>), and, at this very time, Huldah (<a href="/2_kings/22-14.htm" title="So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.">2Kings 22:14</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/34-22.htm" title="And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spoke to her to that effect.">2Chronicles 34:22</a>), and somewhat later, Noadiah (<a href="/nehemiah/6-14.htm" title="My God, think you on Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.">Nehemiah 6:14</a>), are frequently spoken of, and continued to exist in New Testament times, as in the case of Anna (<a href="/luke/2-36.htm" title="And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;">Luke 2:36</a>). It was naturally to be expected that as false prophets dogged the steps of the true, the same thing would happen with the other sex, and we find express mention of a false prophetess in <a href="/revelation/2-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding I have a few things against you, because you suffer that woman Jezebel, which calls herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.">Revelation 2:20</a>. Their course, in prophesying "out of their own heart" deceiving the people, was essentially the same as that of the false prophets; but they are described as doing this in ways suited to their sex. Of the general meaning of this description there can be no doubt; but it is difficult to follow it with certainty in the details, because of the occurrence of some words of uncertain meaning, found nowhere else, and of some others in an unusual sense. Without attempting a discussion of each single word, (which would be useless except with a careful examination of the original), the following is given as the most probable translation of <a href="/context/ezekiel/13-18.htm" title="And say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs on the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of my people, and will you save the souls alive that come to you?">Ezekiel 13:18-21</a>; but it is to be remembered that several of the words, like the similar ones in <a href="/context/isaiah/3-16.htm" title="Moreover the LORD said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:">Isaiah 3:16-24</a>, are so uncertain that there is a difference of opinion in regard to their exact meaning :--"Woe to those who fasten charms on every finger-joint, that place kerchiefs on heads of every height to snare souls. Will ye snare the souls of my people, and keep your own souls alive? (19) And will ye profane me with my people for handfuls of barley, and for pieces of bread, to slay souls that should not die, and to make live souls that should not live, by your lying to my people who hearken to a lie? (20) Therefore, thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I am against your charms, when ye snare the souls like birds, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, the souls that ye are snaring like birds. (21) Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be snared; and ye shall know that I am the Lord."

The section which follows (vers. 17-23) throws an interesting side light on the position of women in the religious life of Israel. For good as for evil, their influence was stronger there than in most other nations. Miriam had led the way (<a href="/exodus/15-21.htm">Exodus 15:21</a>), and had been followed by Deborah (<a href="/judges/5-4.htm">Judges 5:4</a>). Huldah had been almost as prominent in Josiah's reformation as Hilkiah the high priest (<a href="/2_kings/22-14.htm">2 Kings 22:14-20</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/34-22.htm">2 Chronicles 34:22</a>). It was but natural that there should be women on the other side also, guiding their own sex; and it is probable that Ezekiel had in his thoughts some special leaders who headed the women of Jerusalem in their opposition to Jeremiah, as afterwards at Pathros (<a href="/jeremiah/44-15.htm">Jeremiah 44:15</a>). So, later on, we have the prophetess Noadiah heading the opposition to Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/6-14.htm">Nehemiah 6:14</a>); and in the New Testament, on the one hand, Anns (<a href="/luke/2-36.htm">Luke 2:36</a>) and the daughters of Philip (<a href="/acts/21-9.htm">Acts 21:9</a>), and on the other, the ill-regulated prophetesses of Corinth (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-5.htm">1 Corinthians 11:5</a>) and the woman Jezebel, who called herself a prophetess (<a href="/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/13-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
