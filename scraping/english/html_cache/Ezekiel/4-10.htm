Twenty shekels is approximately eight ounces, indicating a meager daily allowance. This reflects the dire conditions of famine and deprivation that the inhabitants of Jerusalem would face. The act of weighing the food emphasizes the precision and severity of the judgment. In the broader biblical context, this rationing is reminiscent of the curses for disobedience outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>, where bread would be rationed by weight. The use of shekels, a unit of weight, also connects to the economic aspects of the siege, where resources would become scarce and precious.<p><b>and you are to eat it at set times</b><br>The instruction to eat at set times further underscores the discipline and control imposed during the siege. This regimented eating schedule highlights the lack of freedom and the constant reminder of the city's dire situation. It also serves as a prophetic sign to the people of Israel, illustrating the consequences of their rebellion against God. The set times for eating may also reflect the structured nature of God's judgment, as well as His sovereignty over the events unfolding. In a broader theological sense, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides spiritual sustenance at appointed times, as seen in the feeding of the 5,000 (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>), where Jesus provides for the needs of the people in an orderly manner.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

The best computations fix it at about 220 grains, and this would make the allowance of twenty shekels equal to something less than eleven ounces, scarcely enough to sustain life. "Meat" is here used, as often in Scripture, of any kind of food. The extreme scarcity of food is also denoted by its being weighed rather than measured. "From time to time" means at set intervals of time (see <a href="/1_chronicles/9-25.htm" title="And their brothers, which were in their villages, were to come after seven days from time to time with them.">1Chronicles 9:25</a>), here doubtless once a day. Only the longer period of 390 days is here mentioned, but the same command doubtless applied to both periods.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy meat</span>, etc.; better, <span class="accented">food</span>, here and elsewhere. Coarse as the food was, the people would have but scanty rations of it. Men were not, as usual, to measure the corn, but to weigh the bread (<a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>). Taking the shekel at about 220 grains, the twenty shekels would be about 10 or 12 ounces. The common allowance in England for prison or pauper dietaries gives, I believe from 24 to 32 ounces, Besides other food. And this was to be taken, not as hunger prompted, but at the appointed hour. once a day. The whole scene of the people of the besieged city coming for their daily rations is brought vividly before us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/4-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You are to weigh out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1511;&#1429;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;mi&#353;&#183;q&#333;&#183;wl)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4946.htm">Strong's 4946: </a> </span><span class="str2">Heaviness, weight</span><br /><br /><span class="word">twenty</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;e&#347;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6242.htm">Strong's 6242: </a> </span><span class="str2">Twenty, twentieth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">shekels</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1430;&#1511;&#1462;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;e&#183;qel)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8255.htm">Strong's 8255: </a> </span><span class="str2">A weight, a commercial standard</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of food</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1499;&#1464;&#1469;&#1500;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;ma&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7733;&#257;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3978.htm">Strong's 3978: </a> </span><span class="str2">An eatable</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to eat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1499;&#1458;&#1500;&#1462;&#1428;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;&#7733;a&#774;&#183;len&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_398.htm">Strong's 398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To eat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">each day,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(lay&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and you are to eat it</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1499;&#1458;&#1500;&#1462;&#1469;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;&#7733;a&#774;&#183;len&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_398.htm">Strong's 398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To eat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at set times.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1461;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6256.htm">Strong's 6256: </a> </span><span class="str2">Time, now, when</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/4-10.htm">Ezekiel 4:10 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/4-10.htm">Ezekiel 4:10 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/4-10.htm">Ezekiel 4:10 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/4-10.htm">Ezekiel 4:10 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/4-10.htm">Ezekiel 4:10 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/4-10.htm">Ezekiel 4:10  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/4-10.htm">Ezekiel 4:10 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/4-10.htm">Ezekiel 4:10 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/4-10.htm">Ezekiel 4:10 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/4-10.htm">Ezekiel 4:10 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/4-10.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 4:10 Your food which you shall eat shall (Ezek.
