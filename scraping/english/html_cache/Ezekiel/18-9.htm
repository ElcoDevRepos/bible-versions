The statutes refer to the specific decrees and commands that God provided as part of the covenant relationship with His people. In the context of Ezekiel, the Israelites were in exile due to their disobedience, and this call to follow God's statutes is a reminder of the covenantal expectations. The emphasis on following statutes is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1-2</a>, where adherence to God's commands is linked to life and prosperity.<p><b>and faithfully keeps My ordinances.</b><br>Ordinances refer to the judgments or decisions that God has established, often related to justice and moral conduct. Faithfulness in keeping these ordinances indicates a consistent and sincere commitment to living according to God's standards. This phrase highlights the necessity of not just outward compliance but an inward dedication to God's will. The concept of faithfulness is a recurring theme in the Bible, seen in figures like Daniel, who remained steadfast in his devotion despite external pressures (<a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>).<p><b>That man is righteous;</b><br>Righteousness in this context is defined by one's relationship with God and adherence to His laws. It is not merely a legal status but a reflection of one's character and actions aligning with God's will. The Hebrew concept of righteousness (tsedeq) involves justice, ethical behavior, and right relationships. This aligns with the New Testament understanding, where righteousness is also seen as a gift from God through faith in Jesus Christ (<a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>).<p><b>surely he will live,</b><br>The promise of life is both physical and spiritual. In the Old Testament, obedience to God's laws often resulted in tangible blessings, including long life and prosperity in the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>). Spiritually, it points to eternal life, a theme that is fully developed in the New Testament through the teachings of Jesus, who offers eternal life to those who believe in Him (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). This assurance of life is a central promise of the covenant relationship with God.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD.</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority and sovereignty of God. The use of "Lord GOD" (Yahweh Elohim) emphasizes His role as the covenant-keeping God who is both personal and powerful. It is a reminder that the declarations and promises made are not merely human words but are backed by the ultimate authority of the Creator. This assurance is seen throughout the prophetic books, where God's declarations are certain and trustworthy, as in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's word is said to accomplish what He desires.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, emphasizing personal responsibility and the need for repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of Ezekiel's prophecies, they were in exile due to their disobedience to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign God who speaks through Ezekiel, emphasizing His justice and mercy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context in which Ezekiel prophesied, a period of punishment and reflection for the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/righteousness.htm">Righteousness</a></b><br>A key theme in this verse, referring to living in accordance with God's laws and commands.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_responsibility.htm">Personal Responsibility</a></b><br>Each individual is accountable for their own actions and relationship with God.

This principle is consistent throughout Scripture, emphasizing that true life is found in alignment with God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/righteousness_defined.htm">Righteousness Defined</a></b><br>Righteousness involves more than external compliance; it is a faithful adherence to God's ordinances from the heart.

The man described doesn&#8217;t dabble in divine guidance; he patterns every step after it&#8212;much like <a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12-13</a> urges Israel to &#8220;walk in all His ways,&#8221; or <a href="/psalms/119-1.htm">Psalm 119:1</a> commends those &#8220;who walk in the law of the LORD.&#8221; Jesus later explains the same heart posture: &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). The text highlights a life that tracks consistently with God&#8217;s revealed path instead of carving out its own shortcuts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and faithfully keeps My ordinances</b><p>The Hebrew idea behind &#8220;faithfully&#8221; underscores persistence. This is obedience that lasts through ordinary days, not just crisis moments. <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a> says, &#8220;Be doers of the word, and not hearers only,&#8221; while <a href="/luke/11-28.htm">Luke 11:28</a> adds, &#8220;Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.&#8221; Ezekiel stresses that a covenant-member doesn&#8217;t merely acknowledge God&#8217;s expectations but guards them, revisits them, and lets them shape every decision. Such steady keeping proves authenticity (<a href="/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That man is righteous;</b><p>God Himself renders the verdict: the obedience just described equals righteousness. In Scripture, righteousness is alignment with God&#8217;s own character and standards (<a href="/proverbs/21-3.htm">Proverbs 21:3</a>). <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a> shows faith credited as righteousness; here, faith is evidenced by obedience, echoing <a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>. Ultimately, this verse foreshadows the fuller righteousness granted through Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>), yet it also affirms that genuine trust in God always produces visible conformity to His will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>surely he will live, declares the Lord GOD</b><p>&#8220;Live&#8221; carries the promise of covenant blessing in the immediate context&#8212;safety in the land, freedom from judgment&#8212;but also hints at the eternal life God delights to give (<a href="/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23, 32</a>). Jesus echoes the thought: &#8220;Whoever hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life&#8230; he has crossed over from death to life&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>). <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a> sets the contrast: sin earns death, &#8220;but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&#8221; When the LORD seals His statement with &#8220;surely,&#8221; He removes all doubt: life is the guaranteed outcome of genuine righteousness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/18-9.htm">Ezekiel 18:9</a> sketches a portrait of the righteous person: one who orders his walk by God&#8217;s statutes, guards and practices His ordinances with steady faithfulness, and thereby receives God&#8217;s own declaration of righteousness and the unbreakable promise of life. Obedience does not earn life apart from faith; rather, it reveals a heart already trusting the God who graciously gives life to all who believe and follow Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/18-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He follows</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1435;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;hal&#183;l&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">My statutes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1467;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1463;&#1447;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7717;uq&#183;q&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;ay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
