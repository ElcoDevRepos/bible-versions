The term "prostitution" is metaphorical, referring to spiritual unfaithfulness and idolatry. Jerusalem's actions are depicted as worse than those of Samaria (Oholah), indicating a deeper level of apostasy. This reflects the historical context where Jerusalem, despite witnessing the downfall of Samaria due to idolatry, continued in similar sins, showing a hardened heart against God's warnings.<p><b>She saw the men portrayed on the wall,</b><br>This phrase suggests the influence of foreign cultures and their allure. The portrayal of men on walls could refer to murals or reliefs common in ancient Near Eastern palaces and temples, symbolizing the admiration and desire for foreign powers and their ways. This visual representation indicates how the Israelites were drawn to the practices and gods of surrounding nations, leading them away from their covenant with Yahweh.<p><b>images of the Chaldeans,</b><br>The Chaldeans were a Semitic people who became dominant in Babylon. Their mention here highlights the political and cultural influence Babylon had over Judah. Historically, the Chaldeans were known for their advanced civilization and military prowess, which might have seemed attractive to the leaders of Jerusalem. This fascination with Chaldean culture and power is seen as a betrayal of trust in God, who had repeatedly warned against alliances with pagan nations.<p><b>engraved in vermilion,</b><br>Vermilion, a bright red pigment, was often used in ancient art and decoration, symbolizing wealth and prestige. The use of vermilion in the depiction of the Chaldeans suggests the allure and seductive nature of their culture. This detail emphasizes the extent to which Jerusalem was captivated by the splendor and apparent power of Babylon, leading to further spiritual adultery. The vivid imagery serves as a warning against being enticed by the superficial allure of worldly power and wealth, which can lead to spiritual compromise.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Ezekiel notes that after seeing Samaria&#8217;s downfall she &#8220;became more corrupt than her sister&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/23-11.htm">Ezekiel 23:11</a>), proving that warning alone does not change a rebellious heart.<p>&#8226; This escalation mirrors Judah&#8217;s repeated hardening in <a href="/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14-16</a>, where priests and people alike &#8220;became increasingly unfaithful.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a> reminds us that when God&#8217;s people consult idols, &#8220;the spirit of prostitution leads them astray,&#8221; a direct parallel to Oholibah&#8217;s deeper plunge.<p>&#8226; The picture is literal in its indictment: God counts every act of idolatry as adultery against Him (<a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She saw the men portrayed on the wall</b><p>The eye-gate fueled the heart&#8217;s craving.<p>&#8226; Just as Eve &#8220;saw that the tree was good&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a>), so Jerusalem&#8217;s leaders fixed their gaze on pagan power and sophistication.<p>&#8226; The wall drawings recall <a href="/numbers/33-52.htm">Numbers 33:52</a>, where Israel was commanded to destroy carved images lest they become snares.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/101-3.htm">Psalm 101:3</a> gives the righteous alternative: &#8220;I will set no worthless thing before my eyes.&#8221; Oholibah chose the opposite, feeding desire with visual temptation.<p>&#8226; The lesson is concrete: what we allow before our eyes shapes our loyalties and can draw us from exclusive devotion to the LORD (<a href="/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Images of the Chaldeans, engraved in vermilion</b><p>The specific attraction was Babylon&#8217;s military splendor painted in vivid red.<p>&#8226; Vermilion, a costly pigment (<a href="/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14</a>), highlights the seductive beauty of worldly power.<p>&#8226; These images represent real political alliances Judah pursued with Babylon after flirting first with Assyria and Egypt (<a href="/2_kings/20-12.htm">2 Kings 20:12-18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6-7</a> describes the Chaldeans as &#8220;a ruthless and impetuous people,&#8221; yet Jerusalem admired them instead of fearing God.<p>&#8226; By engraving foreign warriors on her walls, Oholibah publicly advertised her fascination, turning God&#8217;s house into a gallery of idolatrous desire (<a href="/ezekiel/8-10.htm">Ezekiel 8:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/23-14.htm">Ezekiel 23:14</a> exposes Jerusalem&#8217;s willful escalation of spiritual adultery. Ignoring her sister Samaria&#8217;s judgment, she fixed her eyes on seductive images of Babylon, allowing flashy displays of power and wealth to lure her from covenant faithfulness. The verse warns that unchecked desires, fed by what we choose to behold, will carry us further into sin and closer to inevitable discipline. Faithful obedience demands that God&#8217;s people guard their eyes, reject worldly alliances that rival His lordship, and remain wholly devoted to the One who redeemed them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Men portrayed upon the wall.</span>--Such portraitures, with evidence that they were once executed in brilliant colours, are characteristic both of Egypt and Assyria, where stone for sculpture abounded. From the close connection in race and customs between the Assyrians and Babylonians, it cannot be doubted that the same portraitures were also common upon the more perishable brick of the latter, of whom the prophet is now speaking. The monuments fully concur in representing the warriors of Assyria and Babylonia as delighting in extreme gorgeousness of apparel, but it is difficult to render into English with accuracy each particular of their dress. The exiles, whom Ezekiel immediately addressed, were familiar with these pictures, and his way of speaking of them was important in checking any disposition to fall into idolatries by means of them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - The sin of Judah went a stop further than that of Samaria. She courted the alliance of the Chaldeans. Probably the sojourn of Manasseh at Babylon (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>) led him to see in that city a possible rival to Assyria. The embassy of Merodach-Baladan to Hezekiah (<a href="/isaiah/39.htm">Isaiah 39</a>.) implies, on the other hand, that Babylon was looking to Judah for support against Assyria. The prophet represents this political coquetting, so to speak, as another act of whoredom. Aholibah saw the <span class="cmt_word">images of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion</span> (probably "red ochre:" colors seem to have been used largely both in Assyrian and Babylonian sculpture as in Egyptian, and Judah seems to have copied them, <a href="/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14</a>) and fell in love with them. As the passions of a Messalina might be roused by sensuous pictures of masculine beauty, so Judah was led on by what her envoys reported of the magnificence of the palaces, the strength of the armies, of the Chaldeans. The journey of Jonah to Nineveh, and those implied in <a href="/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>, as well as the prophecy of Nahum, all indicate a more or less intimate knowledge of the Mesopotamian monarchies. The mission of Merodach-Baladan would be naturally followed by a return embassy from Judah. A later instance under Zedekiah meets us in <a href="/jeremiah/29-3.htm">Jeremiah 29:3</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/23-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But [Oholibah] carried</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1505;&#1462;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#333;&#183;w&#183;sep&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
