The certainty of death for the wicked is a consistent theme throughout Scripture, reflecting the consequences of sin (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). The prophetic role involves conveying God's messages, often including warnings of judgment. This echoes the warnings given to Nineveh through Jonah, where the message of impending doom was meant to lead to repentance (<a href="/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4</a>).<p><b>but you do not warn him or speak out to warn him from his wicked way to save his life,</b><br>The responsibility of the prophet or believer is emphasized here. Ezekiel, as a watchman, is tasked with warning the wicked, reflecting the broader biblical principle of accountability (<a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>). The cultural context of ancient Israel placed significant importance on communal responsibility, where failing to warn someone of danger was seen as neglectful. This also parallels the New Testament call for believers to be ambassadors for Christ, urging others to be reconciled to God (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>).<p><b>that wicked man will die in his iniquity,</b><br>The inevitability of judgment for unrepentant sin is underscored. The phrase "die in his iniquity" suggests not just physical death but spiritual separation from God, a theme prevalent in both Old and New Testaments (<a href="/ezekiel/18-4.htm">Ezekiel 18:4</a>, <a href="/john/8-24.htm">John 8:24</a>). The concept of dying in one's sins is a sobering reminder of the eternal consequences of rejecting God's ways.<p><b>and I will hold you responsible for his blood.</b><br>This phrase indicates the serious responsibility placed on those who are called to warn others. The imagery of blood guilt is rooted in the ancient Near Eastern understanding of justice and responsibility (<a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>). In the New Testament, Paul reflects this principle when he declares himself innocent of the blood of all men because he did not hesitate to proclaim the whole will of God (<a href="/acts/20-26.htm">Acts 20:26-27</a>).

The verse affirms God&#8217;s just judgment, His desire to save, the grave danger of unrepentant sin, and the responsibility believers bear to speak truth faithfully.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou givest him not warning,</span> etc. The word, as in the parallels already referral to, is characteristic of Ezekiel, almost indeed, peculiar to him. <a href="/psalms/19-11.htm">Psalm 19:11</a> may be noted as another instance of its use. When the watchman saw danger coming, he was to blow the trumpet (<a href="/ezekiel/33-3.htm">Ezekiel 33:3-6</a>). The prophet was to speak his warnings. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt surely die;</span> literally, <span class="accented">dying thou shalt die</span>. Were the words of <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a> in the prophet's mind? <span class="cmt_word">To save his life;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for his life</span>, or <span class="accented">that he may live.<span class="cmt_word"></span> Shall die in his iniquity.</span> Do the words refer only to physical death coming as the punishment of iniquity? or do they point onward further to the judgment that follows death, the loss of the inheritance of eternal life which belongs to those whose names are written in the book of life? Looking to the tremendous responsibility implied in the words, we can hardly, I think, in spite of the questions which have been raised as to the belief of the Hebrews in the immortality of the soul, hesitate to accept the latter meaning. Ezekiel anticipates the teaching of <a href="/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>, if, indeed, that meaning was not already familiar to him in <a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32, 33</a>. For "in" his iniquity we may, perhaps, read "because of." The negligence of the watchman does not avail to procure a full pardon for the evil doer. The degree in which it may extenuate his guilt depends on conditions known to God, but not to us. In any case, as in our Lord's words (<a href="/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47, 48</a>), a man's knowledge and opportunities are the measure of his responsibility. But the unfaithful watchman has his responsibility. It is as though the blood of the sinner had been shed. His guilt may be described in the same words as that of Cain (<a href="/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>). Compare St. Paul's words in <a href="/acts/18-6.htm">Acts 18:6</a> and Acts 20:26 as echoes of Ezekiel's thought. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/3-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If I say</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
