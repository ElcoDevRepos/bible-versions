The "holy portion" refers to the land set apart for the priests and the temple, emphasizing the centrality of worship in the community. The "property of the city" suggests a designated area for the city itself, likely Jerusalem. The prince's land on both sides signifies his role in supporting and protecting the sacred and civic centers. This allocation reflects the balance of religious and governmental authority, with the prince serving as a steward under God's ultimate kingship.<p><b>He will own the land adjacent to the tribal portions,</b><br>The prince's land is strategically placed next to the tribal portions, indicating his role as a unifying figure among the tribes of Israel. This positioning suggests a responsibility to maintain peace and order among the tribes, acting as a mediator and leader. The tribal portions represent the inheritance of each tribe, a fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs. The prince's proximity to these portions underscores his duty to uphold the covenantal promises and ensure equitable distribution and justice.<p><b>extending eastward from the 25,000 cubits of the holy district toward the eastern border,</b><br>The measurement of 25,000 cubits highlights the precision and order in God's plan for the land. The eastward extension signifies the prince's domain reaching toward the eastern border, possibly symbolizing openness to the nations and the spread of God's influence. The eastern direction often holds eschatological significance, pointing to the coming of the Lord and the dawn of a new era. This extension may also reflect the historical expansion of Israel's territory under divine blessing.<p><b>and westward from the 25,000 cubits to the western border.</b><br>Similarly, the westward extension of the prince's land indicates a comprehensive domain that spans the breadth of the land. This suggests completeness and the prince's encompassing authority. The western border may symbolize the end of the land, representing the fullness of God's provision and the prince's role in safeguarding the inheritance. The balanced extension both eastward and westward emphasizes the prince's central position in the land's governance and spiritual oversight.<p><b>And in the center of them will be the holy portion and the sanctuary of the temple.</b><br>The centrality of the holy portion and the temple sanctuary underscores the primacy of worship and God's presence among His people. The temple serves as the focal point of the land, with the prince's territory surrounding it, highlighting the integration of spiritual and temporal leadership. This arrangement reflects the ideal of a theocratic society where God's law governs all aspects of life. The sanctuary's central position also points to Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of the temple, the true center of worship and mediator between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prince.htm">The Prince</a></b><br>A leader or ruler in the restored Israel, possibly representing a Davidic figure or a symbolic leader in the Messianic age.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_allotment.htm">Holy Allotment</a></b><br>A designated sacred area set apart for the Lord, including the temple and its surrounding land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/city_property.htm">City Property</a></b><br>The land designated for the city, distinct from the holy allotment, yet part of the overall division of the land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribal_portions.htm">Tribal Portions</a></b><br>The land divisions assigned to the tribes of Israel, reflecting the restoration and reorganization of the nation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanctuary_of_the_temple.htm">Sanctuary of the Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship and God's presence among His people, located within the holy allotment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_leadership.htm">The Role of Leadership</a></b><br>The prince's allotment signifies the importance of godly leadership in maintaining justice and order.

He is not the priests or the civil rulers of Israel&#8217;s past but a future Davidic leader under Messiah.<p>&#8226; By assigning him land &#8220;on both sides,&#8221; God secures a permanent, adequate inheritance for righteous leadership. The same concern appears in <a href="/ezekiel/46-16.htm">Ezekiel 46:16-18</a>, where the prince must not seize the people&#8217;s land.<p>&#8226; This arrangement safeguards worship and civic life: the priests oversee the temple (<a href="/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15-16</a>), the people hold their tribal allotments (<a href="/ezekiel/48-1.htm">Ezekiel 48:1-7, 23</a>-29), and the prince supports both without encroaching.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will own the land adjacent to the tribal portions, extending eastward from the 25,000 cubits of the holy district toward the eastern border</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;25,000 cubits&#8221; (about 8&#8531; miles) marks the width of the sacred band that runs north-to-south across the map (<a href="/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1-5</a>; 48:8-10).<p>&#8226; Eastward ownership reaches the Jordan, echoing the original promise in <a href="/numbers/34-10.htm">Numbers 34:10-12</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3-5</a>.<p>&#8226; Placing the prince&#8217;s land right beside each tribe ensures quick access for justice, administration, and defense, much like the judges Moses appointed &#8220;over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and westward from the 25,000 cubits to the western border</b><p>&#8226; The matching western tract forms a mirror image, showing God&#8217;s concern for balance and equity (<a href="/proverbs/16-11.htm">Proverbs 16:11</a>).<p>&#8226; From Mediterranean Sea to Jordan River, the prince&#8217;s twin parcels gird the holy district like bookends.

This allocation protects tribal inheritances, supports righteous governance, and frames the temple at the geographical and spiritual center of national life, highlighting God&#8217;s unchanging commitment to just leadership and wholehearted worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/48.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">The residue shall be for the prince.--</span>The length of the oblation from east to west is supposed to leave a strip at either end which is assigned to the prince. This strip is to extend from north to south, the whole width of the oblation. The expression "over against the portions for the prince" is somewhat obscure from its extreme brevity and want of punctuation in our version; it means that the part of the oblation <span class= "ital">over against the tribe portions shall be for the prince</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> he is to have all that is left of the oblation between it and the portions assigned to the tribes. As already said, this was geographically impossible on the estimate of the length of the cubit here adopted. Even if the cubit were reduced to eighteen inches, which is the smallest estimate that can well be made, the side of the oblation would still be 42?6? miles long, or more than the distance between the Jordan and the Mediterranean at its northern end. It is quite idle, therefore, to attempt any calculation of the prince's portion. The description is necessarily ideal, and no hint is given in the vision of how much was intended for the prince. If it be suggested that the prophet may have had in mind measures following the uneven surface of the ground and the sinuosities of the roads. it can only be replied that such a supposition at once destroys all possibility of following his measures, and is singularly opposed to the whole symmetry of his description, as well as inconsistent with the equality of the measure on the four sides.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21, 22.</span> - The prince's portion should take up <span class="cmt_word">the residue</span> of the original oblation, or terumah (see ver. 8), from which had been withdrawn the aforesaid square containing the portions of the Levites, the priests, and the city. This residue should consist of two strips of land, situated one on each side of the holy oblation (here, of the priests and Levites) and of the possession of the city, and running along the whole length of the five and twenty thousand of the oblation (here the three portions composing the square), and extending eastward to the Jordan and westward to the Mediterranean. The last two clauses of ver. 21, which should read, And the holy <span class="accented">oblation and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst of it</span>, implies that the two parts of the prince's portion, the eastern and the western, should be equal. Ver. 22 teaches that the whole intermediate territory between the border of Judah (in the north of the terumah) and the border of Benjamin (in the south of the terumah), from the possession of the Levites (the north portion of the terumah) and from (equivalent to "to") the possession of the city (the southern portion of the terumah), should belong to the prince. The mention of the possession of the Levites and the possession of the city as the extreme portions of the terumah, appears to indicate that the priests' portion lay between. Ewald translates as if the prophet meant to say the sanctuary should lie between the possession of the Levites and the possession of the city (in the first place), and between the two parts of the prince's land (in the second place), and yet again between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin (in the third place): but to read thus the text <span class="accented">must be</span> changed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/48-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The remaining area</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;han&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
