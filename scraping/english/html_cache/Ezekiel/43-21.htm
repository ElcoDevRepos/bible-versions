The bull as a sin offering signifies atonement for sin, a practice rooted in Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3-12</a>). The sin offering was essential for purification and reconciliation with God, symbolizing the removal of sin and guilt. This act prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is described as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>and burn it in the appointed part of the temple area</b><br>The burning of the sin offering in a designated area underscores the importance of following divine instructions precisely. This appointed area was likely outside the main sanctuary to maintain the holiness of the temple, as the sin offering was considered most holy (<a href="/leviticus/6-25.htm">Leviticus 6:25-30</a>). The act of burning signifies the complete consumption and removal of sin, pointing to the totality of Christ's atonement on the cross.<p><b>outside the sanctuary</b><br>This detail highlights the separation between the holy and the common, a recurring theme in the Old Testament. The sanctuary, being the most sacred part of the temple, was reserved for God's presence and the most holy activities. By burning the sin offering outside the sanctuary, it emphasizes the need for purification before entering God's presence. This separation also foreshadows the crucifixion of Jesus outside the city walls of Jerusalem (<a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11-12</a>), symbolizing the bearing of sin and shame on behalf of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.

Here it is to be burned "in the appointed place of the house," and yet "without the sanctuary," or Temple building itself; it must, therefore, have been in the building described in 41:12<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - As a further stage in the ceremony, the Bullock of the sin offering, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the carcass of the victim, was to be burned by Ezekiel or the priest acting for him in <span class="cmt_word">the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary</span>, as in the Mosaic code it was prescribed that the flesh of the bullock, with his skin and dung, should be burned without the camp (<a href="/exodus/29-14.htm">Exodus 29:14</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-12.htm">Leviticus 4:12, 21</a>; <a href="/leviticus/9-11.htm">Leviticus 9:11, 15</a>; comp. <a href="/hebrews/13-13.htm">Hebrews 13:13</a>). Ewald at first sought the place here referred to in the sacrificial kitchens (<a href="/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19</a>), which it could not be, as these belonged to the "sanctuary" in the strictest sense; he has, however, since adopted the view of Kliefoth, which is doubtless correct, that the "place of the house, without the sanctuary" meant the <span class="accented">gizrah</span>, or separate place (<a href="/ezekiel/41-12.htm">Ezekiel 41:12</a>), which was a part of the "house" in the widest sense, and yet belonged not to the "sanctuary" in the strictest sense. Smend thinks of the <span class="accented">migrash</span>, "suburbs" or "open spaces," which surrounded the temple precincts (<a href="/ezekiel/45-2.htm">Ezekiel 45:2</a>); and these were certainly without the sanctuary, while they were also appointed for the holy place, and might have been designated, as here, <span class="accented">miphkadh</span>, as being always under the inspection of the temple watchmen. The fact that in post-exilic times one of the city gates was called <span class="accented">Hammiphkadh</span> (<a href="/nehemiah/3-31.htm">Nehemiah 3:31</a>) lends countenance to this view. That in this "appointed place" the carcass of the bullock should be consumed was a deviation from the Mosaic ritual, which prescribed that the fat portions should be burned upon the altar, and the rest eaten as a sacrificial meal (<a href="/leviticus/4-10.htm">Leviticus 4:10, 26, 35</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15</a>, 81; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">Deuteronomy 12:7, 17, 18</a>).
