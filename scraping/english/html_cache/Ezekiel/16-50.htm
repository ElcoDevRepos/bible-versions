In the biblical context, pride is often seen as a root sin that leads to other transgressions. The people of Sodom, referenced here, exhibited this pride, which is condemned throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). Pride is considered a direct challenge to God's authority and sovereignty, as it places human desires and self-importance above divine will. This attitude is contrasted with the humility that God desires from His people (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><b>and committed abominations before Me.</b><br>"Abominations" in the biblical sense often refer to actions that are detestable to God, including idolatry, sexual immorality, and other forms of moral corruption. The abominations of Sodom are detailed in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, where the city's inhabitants engage in grievous sins. The phrase "before Me" emphasizes that these actions were not just socially unacceptable but were direct offenses against God Himself. This highlights the personal nature of sin against a holy God, who is deeply grieved by such actions (<a href="/leviticus/18-22.htm">Leviticus 18:22-30</a>).<p><b>Therefore I removed them,</b><br>The removal of Sodom and Gomorrah is a historical event recorded in <a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>, where God destroys the cities with fire and brimstone. This act of divine judgment serves as a warning to other nations and peoples about the consequences of persistent sin and rebellion against God. It underscores the seriousness with which God views sin and His willingness to act decisively against it. This removal is also a foreshadowing of the final judgment that will come upon the earth (<a href="/2_peter/2-6.htm">2 Peter 2:6</a>).<p><b>as you have seen.</b><br>This phrase indicates that the judgment on Sodom was a well-known event, serving as a visible and historical example of God's justice. The audience of Ezekiel, the Israelites in exile, would have been familiar with this story, using it as a point of reflection on their own actions and the consequences of turning away from God. It serves as a reminder that God's judgments are not arbitrary but are based on His righteous standards. The phrase also implies that the evidence of God's past judgments should lead to repentance and a return to faithfulness (<a href="/luke/17-28.htm">Luke 17:28-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
