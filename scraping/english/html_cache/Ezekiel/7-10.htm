In the context of Ezekiel, this refers to the impending destruction of Jerusalem and the Babylonian exile. The use of "behold" serves as a call to attention, urging the audience to recognize the seriousness of the situation. This echoes the prophetic tradition where "the day" often signifies a time of divine intervention or judgment, as seen in passages like <a href="/joel/2.htm">Joel 2:1</a> and <a href="/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14</a>.<p><b>It has come!</b><br>The repetition underscores the inevitability of the prophesied events. Historically, this reflects the period when the Babylonian forces were advancing towards Jerusalem, fulfilling the warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah and Ezekiel. The certainty of God's word is a recurring theme in scripture, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's purposes are assured to come to pass.<p><b>Doom has gone out,</b><br>"Doom" here refers to the divine judgment that is being executed. The phrase suggests an unstoppable force, much like the "sword" or "plague" that God sends as instruments of judgment in other prophetic texts. This aligns with the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to national calamity.<p><b>the rod has budded,</b><br>The "rod" symbolizes authority and discipline, often associated with correction or punishment. In this context, it signifies the rise of Babylon as an instrument of God's judgment. The imagery of budding suggests growth and fruition, indicating that the time for judgment has fully matured. This can be compared to Aaron's rod that budded in <a href="/numbers/17-8.htm">Numbers 17:8</a>, symbolizing divine selection and authority.<p><b>arrogance has bloomed.</b><br>Arrogance here refers to the pride and self-reliance of the people of Judah, which has reached its peak. This pride is often condemned in scripture, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, where pride precedes destruction. The blooming of arrogance suggests that it has reached a point where it can no longer be ignored, necessitating divine intervention. This serves as a warning against the dangers of pride and self-exaltation, themes that are echoed in the teachings of Jesus, such as in <a href="/luke/18-14.htm">Luke 18:14</a>, where humility is exalted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book and the one delivering God's message of judgment to Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The primary audience of Ezekiel's prophecy, representing the people of God who have turned away from Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context of Ezekiel's prophecy, where the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon as a result of their disobedience to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_the_lord.htm">The Day of the Lord</a></b><br>A significant theme in prophetic literature, referring to a time of divine judgment and reckoning.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rod_and_arrogance.htm">The Rod and Arrogance</a></b><br>Symbolic elements in the verse representing the judgment and pride of the people, respectively.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_god's_judgment.htm">The Certainty of God's Judgment</a></b><br>God's warnings through His prophets are not idle threats; they are certain and will come to pass.

Zephaniah echoes this urgency: &#8220;The great day of the LORD is near&#8212;near and coming quickly&#8221; (<a href="/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14</a>).<p>- This is not a vague warning but a calendar-date reality. Ezekiel had long foretold it (<a href="/ezekiel/6-11.htm">Ezekiel 6:11</a>), and now the moment stands at the door.<p>- For New-Covenant believers, the principle remains: God&#8217;s promised interventions&#8212;whether discipline or deliverance&#8212;arrive right on schedule (see <a href="/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a>, &#8220;The night is nearly over; the day has drawn near&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It has come!</b><p>&#8220;It has come!&#8221;<p>- Repetition drives home certainty. No more delays, as God said earlier: &#8220;None of My words will be delayed any longer&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/12-28.htm">Ezekiel 12:28</a>).<p>- The emphatic tone underscores divine faithfulness. What God declares, He performs (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p>- Personal takeaway: we may grow numb to warning signs, but God never forgets a deadline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Doom has gone out</b><p>&#8220;Doom has gone out&#8221;<p>- Doom (literally &#8220;violence&#8221; or &#8220;disaster&#8221;) has already set in motion, like an arrow released. Isaiah paints the same picture: &#8220;See, the Name of the LORD comes from afar, with burning anger&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>).<p>- Nothing can recall it. Judah&#8217;s covenant infidelity (<a href="/2_kings/21-10.htm">2 Kings 21:10&#8211;15</a>) has triggered the consequence Moses foretold (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49&#8211;52</a>).<p>- Key insights<p>- Judgment is both judicial (punishment for sin) and corrective (calling a remnant to repentance, <a href="/ezekiel/14-22.htm">Ezekiel 14:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>- Modern believers are reminded that sowing and reaping remain moral realities (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the rod has budded</b><p>&#8220;the rod has budded&#8221;<p>- A &#8220;rod&#8221; is an instrument of rule or discipline. Here it represents Babylon&#8212;God&#8217;s chosen tool, much as Assyria was &#8220;the rod of My anger&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>).<p>- &#8220;Budded&#8221; signals readiness. Just as Aaron&#8217;s staff miraculously &#8220;sprouted buds&#8221; to confirm God&#8217;s choice (<a href="/numbers/17-8.htm">Numbers 17:8</a>), Babylon&#8217;s rise confirms God&#8217;s decision to judge.<p>- Lessons to note<p>- God often raises up earthly powers to accomplish His purposes (<a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>).<p>- What looks like political shift is, in reality, divine orchestration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>arrogance has bloomed</b><p>&#8220;arrogance has bloomed&#8221;<p>- Judah&#8217;s pride has matured into full flower. &#8220;Pride goes before destruction&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>), and that proverb is now a historical event.<p>- Ezekiel earlier linked pride to violence and complacency (<a href="/ezekiel/16-49.htm">Ezekiel 16:49</a>). The &#8220;bloom&#8221; pictures sin reaching harvest stage (<a href="/james/1-15.htm">James 1:15</a>).<p>- Reflection points<p>- Arrogance blinds a people to warning signs (Obadiah 3).<p>- Humility before God remains the single safeguard against such ruin (<a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/7-10.htm">Ezekiel 7:10</a> piles image upon image to declare that God&#8217;s long-announced judgment has moved from prophecy to present tense. The day is no longer future; disaster is already outbound, Babylon stands ready, and Judah&#8217;s pride is in full bloom. The passage reminds every generation that God&#8217;s timelines are precise, His instruments are prepared, and unrepentant arrogance inevitably invites His rod. Those who humble themselves under His mighty hand find mercy; those who persist in pride meet the day that surely comes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">The morning is gone forth.--</span>The same word as in <a href="/ezekiel/7-7.htm" title="The morning is come to you, O you that dwell in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.">Ezekiel 7:7</a>, and in the same sense--the circle is complete, the end is reached, sin hath brought forth death. "The rod" is commonly understood of the Chaldaean conqueror; but as the word is the same for <span class= "ital">rod </span>and for <span class= "ital">tribe, </span>and is very often used in the latter sense, it will be more in accordance with the connection to understand here a play upon the word. There will be then an allusion to the rods of the tribes in <a href="/numbers/17-8.htm" title="And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.">Numbers 17:8</a>. There the rod of Aaron was made to bud and blossom by Divine power in evidence of his having been chosen of God; here the rod representing the tribe at Jerusalem in its self-will and pride has budded and blossomed to its destruction. So the description continues in the next verse, "Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness." Not a rod for the punishment of wickedness; but into a wicked people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is come</span>.

The "doom" springs out of the earth; the rod of vengeance blossoms (the word is the same as that which describes the blooming of Aaron's rod (<a href="/numbers/17-8.htm">Numbers 17:8</a>), and the phrase was probably suggested by the history); <span class="cmt_word">pride</span> (either that of the Chaldean ministers of vengeance, or of Israel as working out its own punishment; I incline to the latter) buds and bears fruit.
