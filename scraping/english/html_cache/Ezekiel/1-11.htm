These faces symbolize various attributes: humanity, royalty, strength, and swiftness. This imagery is consistent with the cherubim described in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/revelation/4-7.htm">Revelation 4:7</a>, and reflects the multifaceted nature of God's creation and His attributes.<p><b>Their wings were spread upward;</b><br>The upward spread of the wings signifies readiness to serve and the ability to swiftly carry out God's commands. In ancient Near Eastern iconography, wings often symbolize divine presence and protection. The upward position may also indicate a posture of worship and reverence towards God, aligning with the biblical theme of angels and heavenly beings being in constant service and adoration of the Almighty.<p><b>Each had two wings touching the wings of the creature on either side,</b><br>This detail emphasizes unity and coordination among the living creatures. The touching of wings suggests a harmonious and interconnected operation, reflecting the order and unity within God's creation and His heavenly court. This imagery can be compared to the cherubim on the Ark of the Covenant, whose wings also touched, symbolizing the presence and glory of God (<a href="/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>).<p><b>and two wings covering its body.</b><br>The covering of the body with wings indicates modesty and humility before God. This act of covering can be seen as a sign of reverence and awe in the presence of divine holiness. It parallels the seraphim in <a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>, who also cover themselves with their wings in the presence of God, highlighting the theme of holiness and the appropriate response of created beings to the divine majesty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book and the recipient of the visions described.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>These are the living creatures described in Ezekiel's vision.
