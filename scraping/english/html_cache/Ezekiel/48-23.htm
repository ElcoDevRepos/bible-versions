The context is the vision of the restored land of Israel, which Ezekiel receives as part of his prophetic ministry. This division is significant as it reflects God's covenant faithfulness to the twelve tribes, despite their historical unfaithfulness. The allocation of land is a fulfillment of the promises made to the patriarchs, particularly Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>Benjamin will have one portion:</b><br>The tribe of Benjamin is given a specific allotment of land. Historically, Benjamin was one of the smaller tribes, yet it held a significant position due to its location near Jerusalem. This allocation underscores the importance of Benjamin in Israel's history, as it was the tribe of King Saul and later, the Apostle Paul. The mention of Benjamin here also highlights the restoration theme, as the tribe had suffered greatly during the division of the kingdom and the subsequent exiles.<p><b>extending from the east side to the west side:</b><br>This phrase describes the geographical boundaries of Benjamin's portion, stretching from east to west. This east-west orientation is consistent with the other tribal allocations in Ezekiel's vision, symbolizing equality and order in the distribution of the land. The east-west division may also reflect the idea of completeness and wholeness, as it encompasses the entire breadth of the land. This allocation is part of the larger vision of a restored Israel, where each tribe receives its inheritance, pointing to a future hope of unity and peace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamin.htm">Benjamin</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Jacob's youngest son.

By saying, &#8220;As for the rest of the tribes,&#8221; the Lord signals that the remaining sons of Jacob are about to receive their inheritance exactly as promised (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/47-21.htm">Ezekiel 47:21-23</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness stands out: every tribe&#8212;none excluded&#8212;will obtain a share (cf. <a href="/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43-45</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also reminds us that God is orderly; no tribe is forgotten or slighted (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Benjamin will have one portion</b><p>&#8220;Benjamin will have one portion&#8221; echoes the ancient promise that each tribe receives &#8220;one portion to each&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Benjamin, Jacob&#8217;s youngest, long ago received prophetic assurance of a secure allotment (<a href="/genesis/49-27.htm">Genesis 49:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Historically, Benjamin&#8217;s territory nestled beside Judah&#8217;s (<a href="/joshua/18-11.htm">Joshua 18:11-28</a>); here it does so again, showing continuity between past settlement and future restoration (<a href="/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>).<p>&#8226; The single, undivided &#8220;portion&#8221; underlines unity&#8212;no internal fragmentation, no tribal jealousy (<a href="/ezekiel/37-22.htm">Ezekiel 37:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Extending from the east side to the west side</b><p>The boundary runs straight from the Jordan Valley in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, just as the prior tribal bands do (<a href="/ezekiel/48-1.htm">Ezekiel 48:1-8, 24</a>-28).<p>&#8226; A full east-west strip pictures completeness&#8212;the tribe enjoys the whole breadth of the land God swore to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Equality is emphasized: every tribe receives the same orientation and breadth (<a href="/ezekiel/47-14.htm">Ezekiel 47:14</a>), reflecting God&#8217;s impartial generosity (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>).<p>&#8226; The orderly, parallel borders anticipate a millennial kingdom marked by peace and stability (<a href="/isaiah/32-18.htm">Isaiah 32:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/48-23.htm">Ezekiel 48:23</a> announces that, once the special holy district is assigned, Benjamin will obtain his own equal, uninterrupted band of territory stretching from east to west, just like the other tribes.

Each tribe should receive, as those north of the terumah, one portion. The exact extent of this equal portion, though not stated, may be calculated - Latitude of entrance to Hamath 34&deg; 20' Latitude of Kadesh (say) 30&deg; 30'  3&deg; 50' 60 &times; 3 5/6 - 230 geographical miles. But the whole breadth of the terumah was 25,000 reeds = 37 geographical miles. Hence 230 - 37 - 193 miles, which, divided by 12, gives 16 miles of breadth (from north to south) for each portion. The precise length from east to west is more difficult to estimate, in consequence of the varying widths of the land. Accepting this, however, as 55 miles at Jerusalem, the breadth of the prince's portion from east to west would be only 2&frac12; miles on each side of the terumah; which, multiplied by 50 miles from north to south, would yield an area of 125 square miles on each side, or of 250 square miles in all. The disposition of the southern tribes differs from that made under the earlier division of the land - Simeon alone lying where he had been formerly placed, in the south quarter, Issachar and Zebulun being fetched from the north, Benjamin from the middle, and Gad from the west to keep him company. Upon the whole, the new arrangement has several marked peculiarities which distinguish it from the old. While agreeing with the old in this, that the three tribes, Dan, Asher, and Naphtali retain their original places in the north, and the temple is not deprived of its central position between Judah and Benjamin, it differs from the old in placing the three northern tribes side by side from west to east, but after one another from north to south, and exchanges the positions of Benjamin and Judah, transferring the former to the south and the latter to the north of the temple and the city. Then, while under the old neither priests, Levites, nor prince had a portion, all three obtain one in this. And, finally, while under the old no regard was had to the temple, in the new this forms the central point of the whole. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/48-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As for the rest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1430;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ye&#183;&#7791;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
