These creatures are described with extraordinary features, including multiple faces and wings, symbolizing their role as divine messengers and guardians of God's holiness. Their presence signifies the majesty and mystery of God's throne and His sovereign rule over creation.<p><b>I had seen beneath the God of Israel</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the creatures' position in relation to the divine presence. They are beneath the God of Israel, indicating their role as attendants to His throne. This imagery is consistent with other biblical depictions of heavenly beings serving in the presence of God, such as in <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a> and <a href="/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4</a>. The God of Israel is a title that underscores God's covenant relationship with His people, highlighting His faithfulness and authority.<p><b>by the River Kebar</b><br>The River Kebar is a significant geographical location in Ezekiel's visions. It is a canal near Babylon where the prophet and other exiles from Judah were living. This setting underscores the context of exile and God's presence with His people even in foreign lands. The mention of the River Kebar connects Ezekiel's visions to the historical reality of the Babylonian captivity, a period of judgment and hope for restoration.<p><b>and I knew that they were cherubim</b><br>Ezekiel's recognition of the creatures as cherubim links them to the broader biblical tradition of cherubim as guardians of sacred spaces. Cherubim are first mentioned in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>, where they guard the way to the Tree of Life. They are also depicted on the Ark of the Covenant in <a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>, symbolizing God's throne and presence among His people. In Ezekiel's vision, the cherubim's role as protectors and bearers of God's glory is reaffirmed, pointing to the holiness and inaccessibility of God apart from His grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book and the one who receives the vision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/living_creatures.htm">Living Creatures</a></b><br>These are the cherubim, angelic beings associated with the presence and glory of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_of_israel.htm">God of Israel</a></b><br>The one true God, Yahweh, who reveals His glory and presence through visions to Ezekiel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/river_kebar.htm">River Kebar</a></b><br>A location in Babylon where Ezekiel receives his visions, symbolizing the place of exile for the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings that serve as guardians of God's holiness and are often depicted as part of His divine throne.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_holiness.htm">Understanding God's Holiness</a></b><br>The presence of the cherubim in Ezekiel's vision underscores the holiness and majesty of God.

The phrase &#8220;living creatures&#8221; recalls the four beings with four faces, four wings, and wheels within wheels (<a href="/ezekiel/1-5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5&#8211;14</a>). By repeating the description, the prophet confirms that what he saw earlier was no dream or illusion. Similar heavenly beings appear around God&#8217;s throne in <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6&#8211;8</a>, linking the Old and New Testament testimony that such creatures really do surround the Lord. The constancy between the visions underlines the trustworthiness of Scripture and reminds us that God&#8217;s revelations never contradict themselves.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I had seen beneath the God of Israel</b><p>The creatures are &#8220;beneath&#8221; the Lord, picturing them as the bearers of His throne-chariot (<a href="/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1</a>). This fits the wider biblical portrait of God &#8220;enthroned between the cherubim&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-15.htm">2 Kings 19:15</a>). The scene proclaims His absolute sovereignty: no power in heaven or on earth is above Him. It also shows that angelic beings exist to serve and exalt their Creator, not to draw attention to themselves (<a href="/hebrews/1-7.htm">Hebrews 1:7</a>). For believers today, the placement of the cherubim under God&#8217;s throne urges us to adopt a servant posture beneath His lordship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>By the River Kebar</b><p>Mentioning the Kebar Canal brings the narrative back to the place of exile where Ezekiel first encountered the glory of God (<a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>). The Lord met His prophet far from Jerusalem, proving that His presence is not confined to a geographic temple (<a href="/jeremiah/23-23.htm">Jeremiah 23:23&#8211;24</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7&#8211;10</a>). To the exiles, this was hope-filled news: the same God who once dwelt in the Holy of Holies had come to Babylon. For us, it foreshadows the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit, who makes the believer&#8217;s body a temple wherever he or she may be (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And I knew</b><p>Recognition dawns: Ezekiel is no longer startled or puzzled as he was in chapter 1. Repeated exposure to God&#8217;s glory brings growing understanding (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>). The phrase highlights how God patiently educates His servants, moving them from wonder to comprehension. In the same way, reading Scripture again and again deepens discernment; what once seemed mysterious becomes clear (<a href="/psalms/119-18.htm">Psalm 119:18, 130</a>). The prophet&#8217;s certainty strengthens our own: what he &#8220;knew&#8221; we can trust.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That they were cherubim</b><p>Ezekiel explicitly identifies the living creatures as cherubim, grounding their nature in the established biblical record. Cherubim first appear guarding Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>), reappear over the atonement cover of the ark (<a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18&#8211;22</a>), and stand in the heavenly throne room (<a href="/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11&#8211;14</a>). They are real, personal, holy beings who attend the Almighty, emphasizing both His majesty and His separateness from sin. Their presence in the vision underscores that God&#8217;s judgments in chapters 9&#8211;10 are righteous and carried out with heavenly authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/10-20.htm">Ezekiel 10:20</a> affirms that the awe-inspiring beings supporting God&#8217;s mobile throne are the same &#8220;living creatures&#8221; first seen in exile and that they are, indeed, cherubim. The verse anchors Ezekiel&#8217;s visions in consistent, literal reality; highlights God&#8217;s sovereign, mobile presence among His people even in foreign lands; and assures us that heavenly beings exist to exalt the Lord who reigns above them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - Once more the prophet asserts, with fresh emphasis, the identity of the two visions which it had been given him to see. Now, as it were, he understands why the first vision was seen as coming from the north. He does not tell us whether the journey of which he saw the beginning was to end. For the present there was a halt, as we learn from <a href="/ezekiel/11-23.htm">Ezekiel 11:23</a>, "over the midst of the city." Even when the vision ended, it had not gone further than the Mount of Olives. We may conjecture, however, that he thought of its goal as that more sacred region of the heavens in which it had at first manifested itself (see note on Ezekiel 1:4). It was, at any rate, no longer in the temple. The banks of Chebar or any other place might become, as Bethel had been to Jacob (<a href="/genesis/28-17.htm">Genesis 28:17</a>), as "the house of God" and "the gate of heaven." <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/10-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">These</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were the living creatures</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#7717;ay&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
