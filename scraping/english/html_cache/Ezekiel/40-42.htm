The number four often symbolizes completeness in the Bible, possibly indicating the comprehensive nature of the sacrificial system. The burnt offering was a central aspect of Old Testament worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. This aligns with the sacrificial system established in Leviticus, where offerings were made to maintain a covenant relationship with God.<p><b>each a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit high</b><br>The specific dimensions reflect the precision and orderliness of God's instructions, reminiscent of the detailed measurements given for the Tabernacle and Solomon's Temple. A cubit, approximately 18 inches, was a standard unit of measure in ancient Israel, indicating these tables were of moderate size, suitable for their purpose. The uniformity in size underscores the consistency required in worship practices.<p><b>On these were placed the utensils used to slaughter the burnt offerings and the other sacrifices</b><br>The mention of utensils highlights the practical aspects of the sacrificial system, which required specific tools for the preparation and offering of sacrifices. This detail connects to the Levitical laws where priests were given specific roles and tools for conducting sacrifices. The phrase "other sacrifices" indicates the variety of offerings, such as peace offerings and sin offerings, each with its own significance in maintaining the covenant relationship with God. This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled all sacrificial requirements through His death and resurrection, as described in the New Testament, particularly in the book of Hebrews.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, who received visions from God, including the detailed vision of a new temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The vision of a future temple, symbolizing God's presence and the restoration of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offering.htm">Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A type of sacrifice in the Old Testament, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hewn_stone_tables.htm">Hewn Stone Tables</a></b><br>Specifically crafted tables for the preparation of sacrifices, indicating the order and sanctity of worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/instruments_for_sacrifice.htm">Instruments for Sacrifice</a></b><br>Tools used in the preparation and offering of sacrifices, emphasizing the detailed and sacred nature of worship practices.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_order_in_worship.htm">The Importance of Order in Worship</a></b><br>The detailed description of the temple and its furnishings underscores the importance of order and reverence in worship.
