Historically, Israel's fame was tied to its unique relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6-8</a>, where the nations are to recognize Israel's wisdom and understanding. The fame was meant to glorify God, but instead, it became a source of pride and self-reliance.<p><b>you trusted in your beauty</b><br>Israel's "beauty" symbolizes the blessings and favor bestowed by God, including the land, the temple, and the covenant relationship. This beauty was intended to reflect God's glory, but Israel misplaced its trust, valuing the gifts over the Giver. This mirrors the warning in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10-14</a>, where Israel is cautioned not to forget God in times of prosperity.<p><b>and played the harlot</b><br>The imagery of harlotry is used throughout the Old Testament to describe Israel's unfaithfulness to God, particularly in idolatry and alliances with pagan nations. This metaphor is vividly depicted in <a href="/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1-3</a>, where Israel's spiritual adultery is likened to marital unfaithfulness. The harlotry represents a breach of the covenant, as Israel sought security and identity apart from God.<p><b>You lavished your favors on everyone who passed by</b><br>This phrase indicates Israel's indiscriminate pursuit of alliances and idolatrous practices with surrounding nations. Historically, Israel often sought political and military alliances with Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon, contrary to God's command to rely solely on Him (<a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-2</a>). Spiritually, this represents the abandonment of exclusive devotion to God.<p><b>and your beauty was theirs for the asking</b><br>Israel's beauty, meant to be a testament to God's glory, was squandered and given away to foreign nations and idols. This reflects the loss of identity and purpose when God's people turn away from Him. The phrase echoes the warning in <a href="/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11-13</a>, where Israel exchanged their glory for worthless idols.

There can scarcely be a more striking instance of the working of the hand of Providence in history than the story of the kingdom of Israel during and after the reign of Solomon. Raised as a theocracy to great power and wealth by the Divine blessing, it began to trust in its own beauty. Solomon's policy was to make it a great and powerful empire among the nations of the earth, losing sight of its true character as the kingdom of God. Consequently the very means he took to aggrandise it became the instruments of its fall. His vast Oriental harem, gathered from all surrounding nations, introduced idolatry into the palace, and fostered it throughout the land. His magnificence was sustained by taxation, which gave the pretext for revolt. The doom was pronounced that the kingdom should be divided, and when this was fulfilled at Solomon's death, his empire outside the boundaries of Palestine fell apart like a rope of sand, while within, instead of one compact and united monarchy, were two petty kingdoms often in hostility to one another, and each inviting to its assistance the most powerful neighbouring monarchs, to whose rapacity the whole ultimately fell a prey.<p><span class= "bld">Playedst the harlot . . . his it would be.</span>--The political relation of the two parts of Israel just described, placed her at the mercy of every more powerful nation, and gave the impetus to every sort of idolatry which her masters chose to encourage. This apostacy from God, still keeping up the figure of the earlier part of the chapter, is represented as harlotry; and not only so, but as indiscriminate harlotry, for Israel never adopted and clung to any one false God, but worshipped the abominations of every nation which prevailed over her.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - We enter on the history of the apostasy, and the root evil was that the bride of Jehovah had been unfaithful to her Lord. She looked on her glory as her own, and did not recognize that everything in it was the gift of God (<a href="/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a>). The words obviously point to the policy which Solomon had initiated, of alliances with the heathen and the consequent adoption of their worship. This, as from the earliest days of Israel, was the "whoredom" (Revised Version) of the unfaithful with (<a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15, 16</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-7.htm">Leviticus 17:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16</a>; <a href="/judges/2-17.htm">Judges 2:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1, 2</a>). And it was, so to speak, a promiscuous whoredom. Every passer by was admitted to her embraces, every nation that offered its alliance had its worship recognized and adopted. In the closing words of extremest scorn, the prophet adds, his it was. Jerusalem was, as I have said, the Messalina of the nations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/16-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But because of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your fame,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1425;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
