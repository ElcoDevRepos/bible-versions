It underscores the divine authority of the message, as it is directly from the Lord GOD, highlighting the seriousness and divine origin of the prophecy.<p><b>Call out to every kind of bird and to every beast of the field:</b><br>This imagery of summoning birds and beasts is symbolic of a divine judgment. In ancient Near Eastern culture, birds and beasts consuming the dead was a sign of disgrace and defeat. This reflects the totality of God's judgment against the enemies of Israel, as seen in similar prophetic imagery in <a href="/revelation/19-17.htm">Revelation 19:17-18</a>.<p><b>&#8216;Assemble and come together from all around to the sacrificial feast that I am preparing for you:</b><br>The "sacrificial feast" is a metaphor for the destruction of Israel's enemies. In biblical times, sacrifices were central to worship, and this imagery conveys the idea of God's enemies being offered up as a sacrifice. This echoes the concept of divine retribution and justice, where the enemies of God are defeated and consumed.<p><b>a great feast on the mountains of Israel:</b><br>The "mountains of Israel" are significant as they represent the land promised to God's people. Historically, these mountains have been the site of many significant biblical events. The location underscores the fulfillment of God's promises and the restoration of Israel, as the enemies are defeated on the very land God has given to His people.<p><b>There you will eat flesh and drink blood:</b><br>This phrase is a vivid depiction of the aftermath of divine judgment. Eating flesh and drinking blood is a graphic representation of the total defeat and humiliation of God's enemies. It also serves as a stark contrast to the covenant meal shared by God's people, highlighting the fate of those who oppose God. This imagery is echoed in the New Testament, where the ultimate victory over evil is achieved through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers His messages.
