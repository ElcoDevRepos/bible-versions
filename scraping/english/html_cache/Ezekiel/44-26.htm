In the Levitical law, priests were held to strict standards of purity (<a href="/leviticus/21.htm">Leviticus 21:1-4</a>). The cleansing process often involved washing with water and offering sacrifices (<a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11-12</a>). This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation from impurity, which is central to the priestly role. The cleansing process symbolizes spiritual renewal and the need for purity before serving in the presence of God.<p><b>he must count off seven days for himself</b><br>The requirement to count off seven days is a period of waiting and preparation, echoing the creation week where God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31-2</a>:2). This period signifies completeness and readiness for re-entry into priestly duties. The number seven often represents perfection and completion in the Bible, seen in various contexts such as the seven feasts of Israel (Leviticus 23) and the seven churches in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>). This waiting period underscores the importance of time in the process of purification and restoration, ensuring that the priest is fully prepared to resume his sacred duties.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.
