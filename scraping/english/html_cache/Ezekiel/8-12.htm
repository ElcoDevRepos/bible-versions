It underscores the contrast between the divine and human, highlighting Ezekiel's position as a mediator between God and Israel. This title is also significant in the New Testament, where it is used by Jesus to refer to Himself, emphasizing His role as the Messiah and His identification with humanity.<p><b>&#8220;do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness,</b><br>The elders of Israel were leaders and representatives of the people, expected to guide them in righteousness. Their actions in the darkness symbolize secrecy and sin, as darkness often represents evil and concealment in biblical literature. This imagery is reminiscent of <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>, where people love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil. The elders' behavior reflects a deep spiritual corruption and a turning away from God.<p><b>each at the shrine of his own idol?</b><br>Idolatry was a persistent issue for Israel, directly violating the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). The mention of "his own idol" suggests a personal and pervasive idolatry, indicating that each elder had turned to false gods, abandoning the worship of Yahweh. This individual idolatry highlights the extent of Israel's apostasy and mirrors the broader cultural and religious syncretism of the ancient Near East, where multiple deities were often worshiped.<p><b>For they are saying, &#8216;The LORD does not see us;</b><br>This statement reveals a profound theological misunderstanding and a lack of faith in God's omniscience. It echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/psalms/94-7.htm">Psalm 94:7</a>, where the wicked believe that God does not see or care about their actions. This belief reflects a spiritual blindness and a denial of God's presence and power, which is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature.<p><b>the LORD has forsaken the land.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The perception that the LORD has forsaken the land indicates a crisis of faith and a misunderstanding of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. While the people may feel abandoned, the prophetic message often clarifies that it is their sin that has led to separation from God. This sentiment is addressed in passages like <a href="/isaiah/59.htm">Isaiah 59:1-2</a>, where it is explained that iniquities create a barrier between God and His people. The belief that God has forsaken them also foreshadows the coming judgment and exile, yet it is a call to repentance and a reminder of God's enduring faithfulness despite Israel's unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the recipient of God's visions and messages, tasked with delivering them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders_of_the_house_of_israel.htm">Elders of the House of Israel</a></b><br>These are the leaders and representatives of the Israelite community, who are depicted as engaging in idolatry and secret sins.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shrine_of_idols.htm">The Shrine of Idols</a></b><br>This refers to the hidden places where the elders worship idols, symbolizing their spiritual infidelity and rebellion against God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who sees and knows all, despite the elders' belief that He does not see their actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_darkness.htm">The Darkness</a></b><br>Symbolic of secrecy and sin, representing the hidden and corrupt practices of the elders.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_sees_all.htm">God Sees All</a></b><br>Despite human attempts to hide sin, God is omniscient and aware of all actions and thoughts.

The ordinary idolatries of Israel, as of most heathen, consisted in the worship of the true, or of a supposed spiritual Deity, by means of sensible images (comp. <a href="/exodus/32-8.htm" title="They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be your gods, O Israel, which have brought you up out of the land of Egypt.">Exodus 32:8</a>). This was open and public enough at Jerusalem at this time; but the peculiar sin here portrayed was the actual worship of the creature by means of images and paintings. This, although joined in by the chief people of the nation, was practised secretly, perhaps, not only for the purpose of concealing its Egyptian tendencies from the Chaldaeans, but also to throw over it the charm of mystery, as was so common among the heathen.<p><span class= "bld">Every man in the chambers of his imagery.--</span>By "chambers of imagery" (the same word as in <a href="/leviticus/26-1.htm" title="You shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither raise you up a standing image, neither shall you set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down to it: for I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 26:1</a>) is intended chambers painted with images like the one now shown to the prophet. This was not a solitary case; on the contrary, it was but an example of what was done everywhere. The people stifled the voice of conscience then, as in every age, by saying "The LORD seeth us n<span class= "ital">ot," </span>comp. <a href="/psalms/10-11.htm" title="He has said in his heart, God has forgotten: he hides his face; he will never see it.">Psalm 10:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/94-7.htm" title="Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.">Psalm 94:7</a>, &c. Yet, besides this, they argued, doubtless from the calamities that <span class= "ital">had </span>already fallen upon their country, "the LORD hath forsaken the earth," or. rather, the land; and therefore they must have recourse to other help. But the prophet was to see yet worse things.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every man,</span> etc. And this, after all, was but a sample of the prevalence of the Egyptian influence. Other elders had, <span class="cmt_word">in the dark</span>, a like <span class="accented">adytum</span>, a like chamber of imagery, like the Latin <span class="accented">lararium</span>, filled. with a like cloud of incense. And though the name of the leader of the band might have warned them that the Lord was listening, they boasted, in their blindness, that Jehovah did not see them; he had forsaken the temple, and had fiche elsewhere. They thought of Jehovah as of a local deity who had abdicated. They were free to do as they liked without fear. The words are worth noting further as the first of a series of popular half proverbs, in which the thoughts of the people clothed themselves (see <a href="/ezekiel/11-3.htm">Ezekiel 11:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/12-22.htm">Ezekiel 12:22</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-2.htm">Ezekiel 18:2, 19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/33-10.htm">Ezekiel 33:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/37-11.htm">Ezekiel 37:11</a>). All these imply some personal knowledge of what was passing in Jerusalem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/8-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;en-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of man,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
