This symbolic act is a prophetic gesture indicating the future reunification of the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The use of sticks or rods in biblical times often symbolized authority or identity, as seen in <a href="/numbers/17-2.htm">Numbers 17:2-3</a>, where each tribe's leader had a rod with their name on it. The act of writing on the sticks signifies a clear and deliberate message from God, emphasizing the certainty of His promise.<p><b>are in your hand</b><br>The phrase "in your hand" signifies possession and control, indicating that Ezekiel, as God's prophet, is the one through whom God is communicating His message. The hand is often a symbol of power and action in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/exodus/4-2.htm">Exodus 4:2-4</a>, where Moses' hand is used to perform signs. This imagery underscores the authority given to Ezekiel to convey God's intentions for His people. It also reflects the personal involvement of God in the restoration process, as He uses His prophet to demonstrate His plans.<p><b>and in full view of the people</b><br>The public nature of this act is crucial. By performing this symbolic gesture "in full view of the people," Ezekiel ensures that the message is not only heard but also seen, making it more impactful. This public demonstration serves as a powerful visual prophecy, reinforcing the promise of reunification and restoration. It echoes other instances in Scripture where God uses visible signs to communicate with His people, such as the rainbow in <a href="/genesis/9-13.htm">Genesis 9:13-17</a>. The visibility of the act ensures that the people understand the seriousness and the divine origin of the message, encouraging them to trust in God's future plans for their nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_israel.htm">The House of Israel</a></b><br>The divided nation of Israel, consisting of the Northern Kingdom (Israel) and the Southern Kingdom (Judah), which Ezekiel addresses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sticks.htm">The Sticks</a></b><br>Symbolic objects representing the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah, which God instructs Ezekiel to join together as a sign of future unity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period during which the Israelites were exiled from their homeland and lived in Babylon, a time of judgment and reflection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_promise_of_restoration.htm">God's Promise of Restoration</a></b><br>The overarching theme of <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/37.htm">Ezekiel 37</a>, where God promises to restore and reunite the divided kingdoms of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_unity.htm">Symbolism of Unity</a></b><br>The joining of the sticks symbolizes God's desire for unity among His people.
