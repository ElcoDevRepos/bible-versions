In the context of Ezekiel, this reflects the broader theme of personal responsibility and accountability before God. The Israelites were often reminded of the covenant relationship with God, which required ongoing faithfulness. This turning away is not merely a lapse but a deliberate choice to forsake righteousness, echoing the warnings found in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-17.htm">Deuteronomy 30:17-18</a> about turning away from God.<p><b>and practices iniquity</b><br>Practicing iniquity implies a sustained and intentional engagement in sin. This is not a momentary failure but a lifestyle choice that contradicts the righteous path. The Hebrew understanding of iniquity involves a distortion or perversion of what is right, often linked to idolatry and injustice, which were prevalent issues in Ezekiel's time. This phrase underscores the seriousness of sin and its consequences, as seen in the warnings throughout the prophetic books, such as <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>, which speaks of iniquities separating people from God.<p><b>he will die for this</b><br>The consequence of turning to iniquity is death, which in the Old Testament often refers to both physical death and spiritual separation from God. This reflects the principle of divine justice, where each person is accountable for their actions. The death mentioned here is a direct result of the individual's choices, aligning with the broader biblical theme that "the wages of sin is death" (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). This serves as a sobering reminder of the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance.<p><b>He will die because of the iniquity he has committed</b><br>This reiteration emphasizes personal responsibility and the direct link between one's actions and their consequences. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, communal and individual responsibilities were both significant, but Ezekiel stresses individual accountability. This principle is consistent with the teachings of Jesus, who called for personal repentance and transformation (<a href="/luke/13-3.htm">Luke 13:3</a>). The prophetic message here is clear: each person must choose to live righteously, and failure to do so results in dire consequences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, emphasizing personal responsibility and the consequences of sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/righteous_man.htm">Righteous Man</a></b><br>Represents individuals who live according to God's laws and standards but may choose to turn away from righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/iniquity.htm">Iniquity</a></b><br>Refers to sin or immoral behavior that goes against God's commands.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a></b><br>Symbolizes both physical death and spiritual separation from God as a consequence of sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The original audience of Ezekiel's prophecy, who were in exile and needed to understand the importance of personal accountability before God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_responsibility.htm">Personal Responsibility</a></b><br>Each individual is accountable for their own actions and choices.
