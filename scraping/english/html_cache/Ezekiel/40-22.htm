By repeating the exact measure here, the vision underlines God&#8217;s orderly design&#8212;no random variations, no human improvisation.<p>&#8226; Uniform windows allow equal light, hinting at the consistent revelation of God&#8217;s truth (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>).<p>&#8226; Light streaming through identical windows in each gate foreshadows the perfect, unchanging illumination that will flood the millennial temple (<a href="/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Portico</b><p>&#8220; &#8216;Its &#8230; portico &#8230; had the same measurements&#8230;&#8217; &#8221;<p>&#8226; A portico (porch) welcomes worshipers before they enter the court.
