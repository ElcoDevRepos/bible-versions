These creatures are often associated with the presence and glory of God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a> and <a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>. Their movement signifies the dynamic and active nature of God's presence and His readiness to act in the world. The vision reflects the mobility and omnipresence of God, suggesting that He is not confined to the temple in Jerusalem but is sovereign over all creation.<p><b>the wheels moved beside them</b><br>The wheels are a unique feature of Ezekiel's vision, symbolizing the divine chariot or throne of God. The interconnectedness of the wheels and the living creatures suggests a harmony and unity in God's creation and His purposes. The wheels' movement alongside the creatures indicates that God's plans and actions are perfectly coordinated and executed. This imagery may also reflect the idea of God's providence and His ability to direct the course of history.<p><b>and when the creatures rose from the ground</b><br>The rising of the creatures from the ground signifies a transition from the earthly realm to the heavenly. This movement can be seen as a representation of God's transcendence and His ability to operate beyond the physical limitations of the world. It also suggests the elevation of spiritual realities over earthly concerns, pointing to the ultimate sovereignty of God over all things.<p><b>the wheels also rose</b><br>The simultaneous rising of the wheels with the creatures emphasizes the unity and coherence of God's actions. It illustrates that God's purposes are not hindered by earthly constraints and that His divine will is executed with precision and authority. This imagery can be connected to the concept of God's throne being established in the heavens, as seen in <a href="/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>, and His rule being unchallenged and supreme. The rising of the wheels alongside the creatures also foreshadows the eventual restoration and elevation of God's people, as seen in the prophetic promises of redemption and renewal throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.

Their every motion is directed by the Spirit of God (<a href="/ezekiel/1-12.htm">Ezekiel 1:12, 20</a>), showing instant obedience, like the heavenly beings who &#8220;do His will&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Their movement introduces Ezekiel to a God who is never static. From <a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a> to <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-8</a>, Scripture pictures heavenly beings in constant, purposeful activity around the throne.<p>&#8226; Because the vision takes place among exiles in Babylon, the creatures&#8217; movement reassures that God&#8217;s presence is not confined to Jerusalem; He travels with His people (cf. <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The wheels moved beside them</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;the wheels moved beside them&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Ezekiel later calls these wheels &#8220;whirling wheels&#8221; full of eyes (<a href="/ezekiel/10-12.htm">Ezekiel 10:12</a>), symbolizing God&#8217;s all-seeing oversight (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Their seamless coordination with the cherubim pictures a divine chariot (similar to the imagery of <a href="/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a> and <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>) that can go anywhere, anytime.<p>&#8226; The wheels&#8217; proximity&#8212;right &#8220;beside&#8221; the creatures&#8212;underscores that God&#8217;s governance (the wheels) and God&#8217;s messengers (the cherubim) function together without friction or delay.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When the creatures rose from the ground</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and when the creatures rose from the ground&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Rising &#8220;from the ground&#8221; highlights vertical movement. God&#8217;s throne is not locked to earth; it transcends realms (<a href="/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; For exiles who felt abandoned, this upward motion echoes earlier scenes where servants are lifted heavenward&#8212;Enoch (<a href="/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>), Elijah (<a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>)&#8212;affirming that the earthly sphere can never trap God&#8217;s purposes.<p>&#8226; The phrase also foreshadows later prophetic visions in which glory departs and returns (<a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18-19</a>; 43:2-5), stressing that God&#8217;s glory is free to rise or rest as He wills.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The wheels also rose</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;the wheels also rose.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Perfect synchronization: &#8220;Wherever the Spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/1-21.htm">Ezekiel 1:21</a>). Nothing in God&#8217;s administration lags behind.<p>&#8226; The unity illustrates that God&#8217;s omnipotent rule (wheels) and His holy presence (cherubim) are inseparable. When He elevates, His rule elevates; when He moves, His oversight moves.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a> declares, &#8220;Heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool.&#8221; The rising wheels confirm that no realm lies outside His reach&#8212;He bridges the cosmic gap effortlessly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/1-19.htm">Ezekiel 1:19</a> shows a flawlessly coordinated heavenly chariot: cherubim move, wheels move; cherubim rise, wheels rise. The verse assures that God&#8217;s presence, power, and governance travel together, unhindered by geography or circumstance. For believers facing displacement or uncertainty, the scene proclaims that God is mobile, sovereign, and always in perfect control of every realm&#8212;earthly and heavenly alike.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wheels went by them;</span> better, with Revised Version, <span class="accented">beside them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> moving in parallel lines with them. <span class="cmt_word">And when the living creatures went,</span> etc. The truth embodied in the coincident movements of the "living creatures" and the "wheels," is the harmony of the forces and laws of nature with its outward manifestations of might.
