The Israelites were given fine garments by God, symbolizing His provision and blessing (<a href="/ezekiel/16-10.htm">Ezekiel 16:10</a>). By taking these garments, the Israelites were misusing the blessings and gifts God had bestowed upon them. This act represents a betrayal of the covenant relationship between God and His people, as they used what was meant for holiness for idolatry.<p><b>and made colorful high places for yourself</b><br>High places were elevated sites often used for worship, typically of pagan deities. The use of "colorful" suggests an attempt to make these places attractive and appealing, perhaps to draw in worshippers. This reflects the Israelites' syncretism, blending the worship of Yahweh with pagan practices, which was strictly forbidden (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-4</a>). The construction of these high places was a direct violation of God's command to worship Him alone and in the manner He prescribed.<p><b>and on them you prostituted yourself</b><br>The imagery of prostitution is frequently used in the Bible to describe idolatry and unfaithfulness to God (<a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>). This metaphor highlights the spiritual adultery of the Israelites, as they turned away from their covenant with God to pursue other gods. It underscores the gravity of their sin, equating their idolatry with the betrayal of a marriage covenant, which was meant to be exclusive and sacred.<p><b>Such things should not have happened; never should they have occurred!</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the severity and unnaturalness of Israel's actions. It reflects God's righteous anger and disappointment, as these actions were a complete departure from His intentions for His people. The repetition underscores the gravity of their sin and the breach of the covenant relationship. This echoes the call to repentance and the need for Israel to return to faithfulness, as seen throughout the prophetic books (<a href="/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Garments symbolize the Lord&#8217;s provision, honor, and covenant covering (cf. <a href="/genesis/3-21.htm">Genesis 3:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>).<p>&#8226; By &#8220;taking&#8221; them, Jerusalem treats divine gifts as personal property to be used at will, forgetting the Giver (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10-14</a>).<p>&#8226; The picture is of a bride stripping off the wedding dress her husband provided so she can pursue other lovers&#8212;an act of betrayal against the very One who clothed her (<a href="/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and made colorful high places for yourself</b><p>Instead of wearing the garments for God&#8217;s glory, Jerusalem re-fashions them into vibrant decorations for pagan shrines.<p>&#8226; &#8220;High places&#8221; were elevated sites of worship that God explicitly forbade (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The adjective &#8220;colorful&#8221; hints at creativity and enthusiasm poured into idolatry, echoing <a href="/2_kings/17-9.htm">2 Kings 17:9-11</a> where Israel &#8220;built for themselves high places in all their towns.&#8221;<p>&#8226; What was dedicated to holiness becomes a platform for sin&#8212;just as <a href="/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a> warns of exchanging &#8220;the truth of God for a lie.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and on them you prostituted yourself</b><p>The prophet switches from misused fabric to misused body, asserting that idol worship equals spiritual prostitution.<p>&#8226;

leads nations astray.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Such things should not have happened; never should they have occurred!</b><p>God&#8217;s double denial underscores the utter incompatibility of sin with His covenant.<p>&#8226;

The very gifts meant to display covenant love become stages for spiritual prostitution. God&#8217;s emphatic verdict&#8212;&#8220;Such things should not have happened&#8221;&#8212;calls every believer to guard the Lord&#8217;s provisions, refuse compromise, and keep covenant devotion pure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Deckedst thy high places with divers colours.</span>--The use of colours, and especially of tapestry in colours, in the adornment of places of worship, was universal throughout the religions of antiquity. It formed a striking feature of the adornment of the Tabernacle, and what is censured here is the perversion of this, which should have been for the glory of God, to the honour of idols. Translate the last clause of the verse, as in apposition with what goes before, "Things which should not come, and that which should not take place."<p>The three following verses emphasise the apostacy of Israel by taking up various particulars of the symbolical good gifts which God had given her, and showing how she had perverted them to idolatry. It was a chief feature of the charge against her that these gifts were from God, and that she had given them to another--a charge which must for ever remain true of the perversion of the talents God has given to any other than His own service.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - (For <span class="cmt_word">high places</span>, see note on Ezekiel 6:6.) The words imply that the shrines upon them were decked with hangings of many coloured tapestry, presenting an appearance like that of a Persian carpet, as in <a href="/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>, of the image of the Asherah. Those hangings were, as in <a href="/proverbs/7-16.htm">Proverbs 7:16</a>, the ornaments of the adulterous bed. The "high places" are named first, as the earliest form of idolatry. The like things <span class="cmt_word">shall not come</span>. The words are obscure, and the text probably corrupt. As they stand, they seem to say that the world would never again witness so shameful an apostasy. The Vulgate, <span class="accented">Sicut non est factum neque futurum est</span>; extends the comparison to the past. Possibly, though it is a strain upon the grammar, the words may be rendered, "such things should not come, should not be." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/16-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;tiq&#183;&#7717;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
