Gog is often identified with a leader or nation opposing Israel, possibly representing a coalition of nations. This reflects God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to orchestrate events for His purposes. The summoning of a sword is reminiscent of God's judgment in other scriptures, such as in <a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-6</a>, where God wields a sword against Edom.<p><b>on all My mountains</b><br>The mountains of Israel are significant both geographically and theologically. They are often seen as places of divine revelation and encounter, such as Mount Sinai and Mount Zion. The phrase "My mountains" emphasizes God's ownership and authority over the land of Israel. This setting underscores the idea that the battle is not just physical but spiritual, taking place on God's chosen land. The mountains also serve as a strategic location, often used in warfare for defense and advantage.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD</b><br>This declaration asserts the authority and certainty of the prophecy. The use of "Lord GOD" (YHWH Elohim) highlights both the covenantal and sovereign aspects of God's character. It assures the reader that the events are not random but are part of God's divine plan. This phrase is a common prophetic formula, reinforcing the authenticity and seriousness of the message.<p><b>and every man&#8217;s sword will be against his brother</b><br>This phrase suggests internal conflict and chaos among Gog's forces, reminiscent of other biblical instances where God causes confusion among enemy ranks, such as in <a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a> with Gideon's army. It highlights the futility of opposing God's will, as even allies turn against each other. This internal strife can be seen as a form of divine judgment, where God uses the enemies' own strength against them, fulfilling prophecies of self-destruction among the wicked.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gog.htm">Gog</a></b><br>A leader or nation symbolizing opposition to God and His people.
