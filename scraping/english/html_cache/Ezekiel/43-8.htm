In ancient Near Eastern culture, thresholds were significant as they marked the entrance to a dwelling, symbolizing the boundary between the sacred and the profane. The Israelites' actions of placing their threshold next to God's indicate a blatant disregard for the holiness of God's temple. This reflects a broader theme in Scripture where God's people are called to be separate from idolatry and sin (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16-17</a>).<p><b>and their doorposts beside My doorposts</b><br>Doorposts in biblical times were often inscribed with symbols or texts, such as the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-9.htm">Deuteronomy 6:9</a>, to signify dedication to God. By placing their doorposts beside God's, the Israelites were effectively equating their idolatrous practices with the worship of Yahweh. This act of syncretism is condemned throughout the Old Testament, as seen in the warnings against mixing worship of God with pagan practices (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>).<p><b>with only a wall between Me and them</b><br>The wall symbolizes a barrier that the Israelites erected between themselves and God, both physically and spiritually. In the temple, walls served to separate the holy from the common, but here it represents the separation caused by sin. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>, where sin is described as creating a separation between God and His people. The wall signifies the loss of intimacy and fellowship with God due to their abominations.<p><b>they defiled My holy name by the abominations they committed</b><br>Defiling God's holy name refers to actions that dishonor or profane His character and reputation. In the context of Ezekiel, the abominations likely include idol worship and other practices contrary to God's law. The holiness of God's name is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing His unique and set-apart nature (<a href="/leviticus/22-32.htm">Leviticus 22:32</a>). The Israelites' actions not only violated the covenant but also misrepresented God to the nations.<p><b>Therefore I have consumed them in My anger</b><br>This phrase indicates God's righteous judgment in response to the Israelites' persistent sin. The concept of divine anger is consistent with God's holiness and justice, as seen throughout the prophetic books. God's consumption of the people can be understood as both a literal and metaphorical expression of His judgment, as seen in the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple. This judgment serves as a warning and a call to repentance, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of God's desire for His people to return to Him (<a href="/jeremiah/25-4.htm">Jeremiah 25:4-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The holy place where God's presence dwelt among His people, central to Israelite worship and identity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who were in exile due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_holy_name.htm">God's Holy Name</a></b><br>Represents God's character and reputation, which the Israelites defiled through their actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/abominations.htm">Abominations</a></b><br>Refers to the idolatrous practices and sins that the Israelites committed, which were detestable to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_of_god's_dwelling.htm">Holiness of God's Dwelling</a></b><br>God's presence demands holiness.

Yet the broader context of Ezekiel assures that once sin is judged and boundaries are rightly honored, the glory of the Lord will return to dwell among a purified people forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/43.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And the wall between.--</span>The sense is given in the margin: there was <span class= "ital">only</span> a wall between me and them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds</span> etc. The first "their" can only refer to "the house of Israel and their kings;" the second "their" may also allude to these, but is best taken as pointing to the "idols," whose thresholds or temples, according to the view adopted of the preceding verse, were set up in the court of Jehovah's temple, and so close to the latter that nothing stood between them except the temple wall Smend, who favors the second view of the preceding verse, considers this verse as a complaint against the kings for having erected their royal residence on Mount Zion, in the immediate vicinity of the temple; but as David's palace was older than the temple, it is not likely Ezekiel was guilty of perverting history in the manner this hypothesis would imply. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/43-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When they placed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7791;it&#183;t&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
