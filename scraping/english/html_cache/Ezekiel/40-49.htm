A cubit, approximately 18 inches, makes the portico about 30 feet wide and 18 feet deep. This size indicates a significant entrance, symbolizing the majesty and holiness of God's dwelling place. The portico serves as a transitional space, preparing worshippers to enter the sacred area, reminiscent of Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>), which also had a prominent portico. The detailed measurements emphasize God's order and the importance of worship.<p><b>and ten steps led up to it</b><br>The ten steps leading up to the portico signify elevation and ascension, a common biblical motif representing drawing closer to God. Ascending steps can symbolize spiritual ascent and preparation for entering a holy place. In ancient Near Eastern architecture, elevated structures were often associated with divine presence. The number ten may also have symbolic significance, representing completeness or divine order, as seen in the Ten Commandments.<p><b>There were columns by the side pillars, one on each side</b><br>Columns in ancient architecture often symbolized strength and stability. In the context of the temple, they may represent God's enduring presence and support. The presence of columns on each side of the portico echoes the design of Solomon's Temple, which featured two prominent pillars named Jachin and Boaz (<a href="/1_kings/7-21.htm">1 Kings 7:21</a>). These pillars were not only structural but also symbolic, representing God's establishment and strength.

Literally, that is about thirty-five feet&#8212;wide enough for a steady stream of worshipers.<p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s temple matched this width: &#8220;The portico in front of the temple&#8217;s main hall was twenty cubits long, corresponding to the width of the temple&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>). God is consistent; the same measured grace that welcomed Israel before will welcome them again in the millennial temple.<p>&#8226; The generous span reminds us of the Lord&#8217;s open invitation: &#8220;Enter His gates with thanksgiving&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/100-4.htm">Psalm 100:4</a>). He never builds a cramped doorway to His presence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And twelve cubits deep</b><p>&#8226; The depth&#8212;about twenty-one feet&#8212;gives the porch proper proportion. Ezekiel had just measured the vestibule of the inner sanctuary as twelve cubits deep as well (<a href="/ezekiel/40-48.htm">Ezekiel 40:48</a>), underscoring deliberate design.<p>&#8226; Twelve often marks governmental completeness (twelve tribes, twelve apostles). This literal measurement hints that God&#8217;s perfect order will cover every square cubit of His future house.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Your testimonies are fully confirmed; holiness adorns Your house&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/93-5.htm">Psalm 93:5</a>).

As one moves closer to the heart of the temple, the ascent grows steeper, picturing increasing holiness.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Who may ascend the hill of the LORD? He who has clean hands and a pure heart&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>). The stairway preaches preparation.<p>&#8226; In the courts of Hezekiah there was even &#8220;the stairway&#8221; by which the shadow moved backward (<a href="/2_kings/20-9.htm">2 Kings 20:9-11</a>), linking steps with divine intervention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There were columns by the side pillars</b><p>&#8226; Columns provide strength and beauty. Ezekiel records two of them flanking the entrance just as in Solomon&#8217;s temple: &#8220;He set up the pillars at the portico of the temple and named the right pillar Jachin and the left pillar Boaz&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/7-21.htm">1 Kings 7:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Columns symbolize permanence. Jesus promises, &#8220;The one who overcomes I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he will never again leave it&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>). What God establishes, He secures.<p>&#8226; The literal columns in Ezekiel&#8217;s temple forecast the unshakeable stability believers will enjoy when Christ reigns.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>One on each side</b><p>&#8226; The symmetry&#8212;&#8220;one on each side&#8221;&#8212;reflects God&#8217;s order and balance. Everything in His house lines up.<p>&#8226; Moses reminded Israel to &#8220;not turn aside from the commandment to the right or to the left&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-20.htm">Deuteronomy 17:20</a>). The equal pillars quietly echo that call to stay centered on God&#8217;s way.<p>&#8226; &#8220;All things must be done in a proper and orderly manner&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>). The vision&#8217;s mirrored pillars visually preach that principle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/40-49.htm">Ezekiel 40:49</a> paints a literal, measured porch that is wide enough to welcome, deep enough to impress, elevated enough to inspire reverence, and braced by twin columns that declare strength and balance. Every cubit points to a God who designs worship spaces&#8212;and lives&#8212;with precise care, gracious openness, ascending holiness, and unwavering stability.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 49.</span> - Like the gates into the courts, the temple porch was entered by <span class="cmt_word">steps</span>, of which the number is not stated, though, after the LXX., it is usually assumed to have been ten, Hengstenberg suggesting fourteen. The last particular noted, that there were <span class="cmt_word">pillars by the posts</span>, has been explained to signify that upon the posts, or bases, stood shafts or pillars (Currey), or with more probability that by or near the pillars rose columns (Keil, Kliefoth). The height of these is not given, though Hengstenberg again finds it in the elevation of the porch of Solomon's temple - a hundred and twenty cubits (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>). Their exact position is not stated; but they were probably, like Jachin and Boaz in the Solomonic temple, stationed one on each side of the steps. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/40-49.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The portico</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1467;&#1500;&#1464;&#1438;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;u&#183;l&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
