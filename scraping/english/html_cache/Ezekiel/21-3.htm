In the context of Ezekiel, God often speaks directly to the prophet, who then conveys His words to the people. This reflects the role of prophets as intermediaries between God and His people. The phrase underscores the divine origin of the message, which demands attention and obedience.<p><b>&#8216;I am against you,</b><br>This declaration signifies God's opposition to the people of Israel due to their persistent disobedience and idolatry. Historically, Israel had entered into a covenant with God, promising to follow His laws. However, their repeated failures led to divine judgment. This phrase echoes similar pronouncements found in other prophetic books, such as Jeremiah and Isaiah, where God expresses His displeasure with Israel's actions.<p><b>and I will draw My sword from its sheath</b><br>The imagery of God drawing a sword signifies impending judgment and warfare. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a drawn sword was a symbol of active engagement in battle. This metaphor indicates that God is preparing to execute judgment. The sword is often used in scripture as a symbol of divine justice and retribution, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-6</a> and <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>.<p><b>and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked.</b><br>This phrase highlights the comprehensive nature of the coming judgment. It suggests that the impending calamity will affect all people, regardless of their individual righteousness. This can be understood in the context of the Babylonian exile, where both the faithful and unfaithful were taken into captivity. Theologically, it raises questions about collective judgment and individual responsibility, themes explored in other parts of Ezekiel, such as chapter 18. This also foreshadows the ultimate separation of the righteous and wicked at the final judgment, as seen in <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, called to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Israel during their exile in Babylon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_israel.htm">The Land of Israel</a></b><br>The geographical and spiritual center of the Jewish people, representing the nation and its covenant relationship with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is both just and merciful, delivering messages through His prophets.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sword.htm">The Sword</a></b><br>A symbol of divine judgment and warfare, representing God's impending judgment on Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous_and_the_wicked.htm">The Righteous and the Wicked</a></b><br>The people of Israel, both those who follow God's laws and those who do not, indicating the comprehensive nature of the coming judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>God's judgment is a response to the pervasive sin in the land.

His audience needs to hear that this is not Ezekiel&#8217;s opinion but divine revelation (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4-9</a>). The phrase reminds us that &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>), so we approach the warning that follows with reverence and readiness to respond.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am against you</b><p>Those words are startling. The covenant God who once declared, &#8220;I will walk among you and be your God&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>) now says the opposite because the nation has broken that covenant. Similar announcements appear in <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/21-5.htm">Jeremiah 21:5</a>, where persistent rebellion turns the Lord&#8217;s protective presence into active opposition. The statement underscores that no political alliance, temple ritual, or national history can shield a people who persist in sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will draw My sword from its sheath</b><p>The sword is a vivid picture of imminent judgment. It is God&#8217;s own weapon&#8212;He is not sending a distant calamity but personally overseeing the discipline (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41-42</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5</a>). The imagery also recalls the cherubim&#8217;s flashing sword in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>, showing that sin always brings about the loss of God&#8217;s protective garden and the imposition of divine justice. Once the sword leaves the sheath, there is no human means to return it (<a href="/ezekiel/21-5.htm">Ezekiel 21:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked</b><p>This clause announces a sweeping, national judgment. When a nation&#8217;s corporate sin reaches a tipping point, even the faithful experience the fallout (<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:2</a>). The Babylonian advance would not spare the righteous, though God still knew how to keep them eternally secure (<a href="/2_peter/2-9.htm">2 Peter 2:9</a>). Abraham once pled, &#8220;Will You indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23</a>). In that episode God agreed to spare the city for enough righteous residents, but here the righteous remnant is too small, and judgment falls on the entire population (<a href="/ezekiel/9-6.htm">Ezekiel 9:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-47.htm">Matthew 13:47-50</a>). The righteous suffer, yet their suffering refines rather than destroys them (<a href="/malachi/3-3.htm">Malachi 3:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3</a> delivers a sobering message: God Himself is opposing His covenant people because of persistent rebellion. His drawn sword portrays an unavoidable, personal judgment that sweeps across the land without discrimination. The verse calls every generation to take sin seriously, heed God&#8217;s authoritative word, and cling to Him in obedient faith before the sword leaves its sheath.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3, 4) <span class= "bld">The righteous and the wicked.</span>--This explains <span class= "ital">the green tree </span>and <span class= "ital">the dry </span>of <a href="/ezekiel/20-47.htm" title="And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.">Ezekiel 20:47</a>; and "all flesh" of <a href="/context/ezekiel/21-4.htm" title="Seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:">Ezekiel 21:4-5</a>, corresponds to "all faces" of the same. These expressions are meant to show the universality of the approaching desolation. The actual separation in God's sight between the righteous and the wicked has already been plainly set forth in 9:4-6. But still in this, as in all national judgments, the innocent must of necessity be involved in the same temporal sufferings with the guilty. The general terms of this prophecy are to be limited by what is elsewhere said of the mercy which shall be shown to a remnant.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1438;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
