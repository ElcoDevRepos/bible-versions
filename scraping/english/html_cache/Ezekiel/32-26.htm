These names appear in other biblical texts, such as <a href="/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a>, where they are listed as descendants of Japheth, indicating their ancient origins. Historically, these groups were known for their warrior culture and trade, particularly in metals. Their mention here signifies their downfall and serves as a reminder of the fate of nations that oppose God.<p><b>with their graves all around them</b><br>The imagery of graves surrounding them emphasizes the totality of their destruction. In ancient Near Eastern culture, burial practices were significant, and being surrounded by graves could symbolize dishonor or a lack of proper burial rites. This phrase underscores the completeness of their defeat and the judgment they face.<p><b>All of them are uncircumcised</b><br>In the Hebrew context, being uncircumcised was synonymous with being outside the covenant community of Israel. It denotes spiritual separation from God and His promises. This term is often used in the Old Testament to describe those who are not part of God's chosen people, highlighting their spiritual state and the reason for their judgment.<p><b>slain by the sword</b><br>The sword is a common biblical symbol of divine judgment and warfare. This phrase indicates that their demise was violent and decisive, a direct result of their actions. It reflects the biblical principle that those who live by the sword will die by the sword, as seen in <a href="/matthew/26-52.htm">Matthew 26:52</a>.<p><b>because they spread their terror in the land of the living</b><br>This phrase explains the reason for their judgment: their actions brought fear and destruction to others. It reflects the biblical theme of retribution, where those who cause terror and violence are ultimately held accountable. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/22-8.htm">Proverbs 22:8</a>, which states that those who sow injustice will reap calamity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/meshech_and_tubal.htm">Meshech and Tubal</a></b><br>These are ancient nations often associated with regions in modern-day Turkey.

Ezekiel obviously speaks of them as one of the powers that bad been conspicuous in his own time, and had been, in part at least, overthrown by the Chaldean monarchy. We may probably connect his words with the great irruption of the Scythians mentioned by Herodotus (1. 103; 4:11) as having swept over Asia even to Palestine and Egypt, in the time of Josiah, and which, after compelling Cyaxares to raise the siege of Nineveh, left traces of itself in the name of the city of Scythe-polls. Many commentators find a reference to that invasion in the "evil from the north" of <a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>; and in <a href="/zephaniah/1-13.htm">Zephaniah 1:13-16</a>.
