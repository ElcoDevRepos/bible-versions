It is a common introduction in prophetic literature, underscoring that the message is not from the prophet himself but from God. This establishes the seriousness and authenticity of the prophecy.<p><b>On the day it was brought down to Sheol:</b><br>Sheol is the Hebrew term for the realm of the dead, often depicted as a shadowy place where the deceased reside. The imagery of being brought down to Sheol signifies judgment and the end of life or power. This reflects the fate of nations or leaders who oppose God, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9-11</a>, where Babylon's fall is similarly described.<p><b>I caused mourning:</b><br>Mourning here indicates a profound sense of loss and lamentation. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, mourning was a communal activity, often involving rituals and expressions of grief. This phrase suggests that the fall of the entity being judged is significant enough to warrant widespread lament.<p><b>I covered the deep because of it;</b><br>The "deep" refers to the primordial waters, often associated with chaos in ancient Near Eastern cosmology. Covering the deep could symbolize a return to chaos or a disruption of the natural order, indicating the severity of the judgment.<p><b>I held back its rivers; its abundant waters were restrained:</b><br>Rivers and abundant waters symbolize life, prosperity, and sustenance. Restraining them signifies a withdrawal of blessing and life, leading to desolation. This imagery is reminiscent of God's control over creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9-10</a>, where He gathers the waters.<p><b>I made Lebanon mourn for it:</b><br>Lebanon, known for its majestic cedars, symbolizes strength and beauty. The mourning of Lebanon indicates a significant loss, affecting even the most splendid and powerful. This can be connected to the lament over Tyre in <a href="/ezekiel/27.htm">Ezekiel 27</a>, where the fall of a great city causes widespread grief.<p><b>and all the trees of the field fainted because of it:</b><br>Trees often symbolize nations or leaders in biblical literature. The fainting of the trees suggests a widespread impact, where the fall of one great entity causes fear and instability among others. This is similar to the imagery in <a href="/daniel/4-10.htm">Daniel 4:10-14</a>, where a great tree representing a kingdom is cut down, affecting all who depended on it.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and authoritative voice in this passage, delivering a message of judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheol.htm">Sheol</a></b><br>The realm of the dead, often depicted as a place of darkness and silence in the Old Testament.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_deep.htm">The Deep</a></b><br>Refers to the primordial waters, symbolizing chaos and mourning in this context.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lebanon.htm">Lebanon</a></b><br>Known for its majestic cedars, representing strength and pride, now clothed in mourning.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/trees_of_the_field.htm">Trees of the Field</a></b><br>Symbolic of nations or people affected by the judgment pronounced.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God is in control of all creation, including the forces of nature, to execute His judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_pride.htm">The Consequences of Pride</a></b><br>The imagery of Lebanon and the trees serves as a warning against pride and self-exaltation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/mourning_and_repentance.htm">Mourning and Repentance</a></b><br>The mourning of creation reflects the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_sheol.htm">The Reality of Sheol</a></b><br>Sheol serves as a reminder of the reality of death and the ultimate accountability before God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/interconnectedness_of_creation.htm">Interconnectedness of Creation</a></b><br>The impact on Lebanon and the trees illustrates how sin and judgment affect the broader creation.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_31_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 31:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_31_15_God_s_life-death_power.htm">How does Ezekiel 31:15 illustrate God's power over life and death?

God Himself is speaking, so every image carries His full authority (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/3-10.htm">Ezekiel 3:10</a>). We are meant to listen as servants receiving orders, not as spectators offering suggestions. The verse is part of a larger oracle (<a href="/ezekiel/31-1.htm">Ezekiel 31:1&#8211;18</a>) where Assyria is pictured as a towering cedar in Lebanon. By beginning with &#8220;the Lord GOD,&#8221; the prophet reminds us that this coming judgment is not random political upheaval but a deliberate act of the Almighty (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On the day it was brought down to Sheol</b><p>&#8220;Sheol&#8221; signifies the realm of the dead. God is announcing the exact moment the proud &#8220;tree&#8221; (Assyria) is felled and sent to the grave (<a href="/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a> &#8211;11; <a href="/ezekiel/32-18.htm">Ezekiel 32:18</a>). This is a historical moment: when a superpower crashes, it is not simply losing a battle&#8212;it is being escorted to the place of the dead under divine decree. Notice also <a href="/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a>, where death and Hades are still under God&#8217;s jurisdiction; He sends, He summons, and no power resists.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I caused mourning</b><p>When God judges, the entire created order reacts. This mourning echoes earlier laments over Tyre (<a href="/ezekiel/26-15.htm">Ezekiel 26:15&#8211;17</a>) and later over Babylon (<a href="/revelation/18-9.htm">Revelation 18:9&#8211;11</a>). The point is clear: Assyria&#8217;s fall is not a private event. The nations that traded with her, feared her, or benefited from her now wail because their own security has collapsed. God Himself says, &#8220;I caused&#8221; the lament&#8212;He orchestrates even the emotional response of surrounding peoples (<a href="/lamentations/2-5.htm">Lamentations 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I covered the deep because of it; I held back its rivers; its abundant waters were restrained</b><p>The cedar&#8217;s life depended on abundant water (<a href="/ezekiel/31-4.htm">Ezekiel 31:4&#8211;5</a>). Now the very source of its prosperity is cut off. The &#8220;deep&#8221; recalls <a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>, where the fountains burst open in judgment, yet here God reverses the image&#8212;He shuts the waters down. Think of:<p>&#8226; <a href="/nahum/1-4.htm">Nahum 1:4</a>&#8212;&#8220;He rebukes the sea and dries it up.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/19-5.htm">Isaiah 19:5</a>&#8212;&#8220;The waters of the Nile will dry up.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/16-12.htm">Revelation 16:12</a>&#8212;&#8220;The Euphrates was dried up.&#8221;<p>When God withholds water, economies collapse, armies halt, life withers. The lesson: what God gives, He can also restrain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I made Lebanon mourn for it</b><p>Lebanon&#8217;s cedars were famous (<a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-13.htm">Isaiah 2:13</a>). They symbolize majesty and stability. If these cedars mourn, the picture is of mighty things grieving over something even mightier that has fallen. <a href="/zechariah/11-2.htm">Zechariah 11:2</a> sings the same funeral song: &#8220;Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen.&#8221; The downfall of Assyria shakes regions far beyond its borders&#8212;places once proud of their own strength.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all the trees of the field fainted because of it</b><p>&#8220;Trees&#8221; represent other nations (<a href="/daniel/4-10.htm">Daniel 4:10&#8211;14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22&#8211;24</a>). They &#8220;faint&#8221; or droop in fear, realizing that if God can uproot Assyria, no kingdom is safe. <a href="/ezekiel/31-16.htm">Ezekiel 31:16</a> continues the image: nations &#8220;shook at the sound of its downfall.&#8221; This is a sobering reminder: God&#8217;s judgments are warnings, calling every nation to humility (<a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>; <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26&#8211;31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/31-15.htm">Ezekiel 31:15</a> paints a vivid funeral scene for Assyria, the towering cedar. God personally announces the fall, directs the mourning, shuts off the life-giving waters, and makes surrounding nations tremble. The verse underscores that:<p>&#8226; God rules over death and history.<p>&#8226; Prosperity flows only as long as He permits.<p>&#8226; When prideful powers collapse, their downfall is both judgment on them and a warning to all.<p>The majestic cedar&#8217;s trip to Sheol proves that every kingdom stands or falls at the word of the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">I covered the deep for him.</span>--<a href="/context/ezekiel/31-15.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.">Ezekiel 31:15-17</a> describe the effect of Assyria's fall. <a href="/ezekiel/31-15.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.">Ezekiel 31:15</a> speaks of the mourning of the nations and of the drying up of the streams, or sources of Assyria's prosperity. "The deep" is the same as in <a href="/ezekiel/31-4.htm" title="The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent her little rivers to all the trees of the field.">Ezekiel 31:4</a>, the flood of waters which fertilised the great cedar; this is covered, as in mourning. "Floods" is the same word as "rivers" in <a href="/ezekiel/31-4.htm" title="The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent her little rivers to all the trees of the field.">Ezekiel 31:4</a>, and "great waters" as "multitude of waters" in <a href="/ezekiel/31-5.htm" title="Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.">Ezekiel 31:5</a>. "To mourn" is, literally, <span class= "ital">to be black,</span> and the sense is well given in our version, although the original is more appropriate to the figure of Lebanon with its cedars. "The trees of the field" are, of course, the subordinate potentates, who are dismayed, "faint," at Assyria's fall. (Comp. <a href="/context/ezekiel/26-15.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the middle of you?">Ezekiel 26:15-18</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I covered the deep for him</span>.

They formed part, as it were, of the pageantry of woe at the funeral of the fallen kingdom. It is as if the prophet felt, in all its intensity, what we have learnt to call the sympathy of nature with the sorrows of humanity. It would, perhaps, be over-literal to press details; but the picture, in one of its features at least, suggests a failure of the inundation of the Nile, like that indicated in <a href="/ezekiel/30-12.htm">Ezekiel 30:12</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/31-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1469;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_136.htm">Strong's 136: </a> </span><span class="str2">The Lord</span><br /><br /><span class="word">GOD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1460;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1438;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;On the day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1448;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
