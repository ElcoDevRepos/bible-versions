In biblical context, listening is often associated with obedience and understanding (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>). Ezekiel's role as a prophet required him to be a conduit for God's messages to the people of Israel.<p><b>He said to the others</b><br>The "others" refers to the angelic executioners in the vision, highlighting the divine authority and judgment being executed. This reflects the biblical theme of God using His messengers to carry out His will, as seen in other instances like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19).<p><b>Follow him through the city</b><br>The city is Jerusalem, the center of Jewish worship and identity. This phrase underscores the impending judgment on Jerusalem due to its idolatry and sin. The act of following signifies a deliberate and thorough execution of God's command, ensuring that the judgment is comprehensive.<p><b>and start killing</b><br>This harsh command reflects the severity of God's judgment against sin. It serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of disobedience and idolatry. Theologically, it points to the holiness of God and His intolerance of sin, a theme consistent throughout Scripture (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p><b>do not show pity or spare anyone!</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the totality and impartiality of divine judgment. It reflects the seriousness of the people's sins and the necessity of justice. In a broader biblical context, it serves as a warning of the final judgment, where God's justice will be fully realized (<a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>). The lack of pity also contrasts with the mercy offered through Christ, who provides a way of escape from judgment for those who believe (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel receives visions from God, including the one described in this chapter.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_with_the_writing_kit.htm">The Man with the Writing Kit</a></b><br>In the preceding verses, this figure is tasked with marking those who lament the abominations in Jerusalem, sparing them from judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_six_men_with_weapons.htm">The Six Men with Weapons</a></b><br>These are agents of God's judgment, instructed to follow the man with the writing kit and execute divine justice on the unmarked.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where this vision takes place, representing the center of spiritual and moral decay among God's people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_glory_of_the_god_of_israel.htm">The Glory of the God of Israel</a></b><br>Present in the vision, symbolizing God's authority and presence, even in judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_mercy.htm">God's Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>God's judgment is a response to persistent sin and rebellion.
