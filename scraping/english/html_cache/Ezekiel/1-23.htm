This imagery connects to the idea of God's transcendence and sovereignty over creation.<p><b>their wings stretched out toward one another</b><br>The wings of the cherubim stretching toward one another signify unity and cooperation among the heavenly beings. This imagery is reminiscent of the cherubim on the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>), where their wings also stretch toward each other, symbolizing the presence and glory of God. The unity of the wings may also reflect the harmony and order within God's creation and His divine council.<p><b>Each one also had two wings covering its body</b><br>The covering of the body with wings suggests humility and reverence in the presence of God. This act of covering is similar to the seraphim in <a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>, who cover their faces and feet in the presence of the Lord, indicating awe and respect. The covering may also symbolize protection and the holiness required to be in God's presence, as nothing impure can stand before Him.

This vast, gleaming platform rests above the living creatures, portraying the absolute separation between the heavenly throne and created beings&#8212;yet also the ordered structure of God&#8217;s realm (cf. <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>).<p>- The phrase &#8220;under the expanse&#8221; roots the vision in literal space: the creatures are physically positioned beneath God&#8217;s heavenly pavement. Their location underscores God&#8217;s transcendence&#8212;He reigns above, while mighty creatures serve below (<a href="/psalms/97-2.htm">Psalm 97:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>).<p>- The detail anticipates later clarifications that these living creatures are cherubim (<a href="/ezekiel/10-15.htm">Ezekiel 10:15, 20</a>), the same order depicted guarding Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>) and overshadowing the mercy seat (<a href="/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>), always situated near&#8212;but never equal to&#8212;the divine presence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>their wings stretched out toward one another</b><p>- Four beings, each with four wings, extend two of those wings horizontally so that tip touches tip. Scripture paints a picture of unified service&#8212;no rivalry, no disarray, only coordinated readiness (<a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>).<p>- This unanimity mirrors the cherubim over the ark: &#8220;The cherubim are to have their wings spread upward, overshadowing the mercy seat&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>). Whether in the tabernacle or Ezekiel&#8217;s vision, wing-to-wing contact symbolizes perfect alignment beneath God&#8217;s rule.<p>- The outward stretch also conveys swiftness to obey. When the Spirit moves, &#8220;they went&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/1-12.htm">Ezekiel 1:12</a>), reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20</a>, where angels &#8220;excel in strength, who do His word.&#8221; Their constant connection suggests uninterrupted communication and harmony.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Each one also had two wings covering its body</b><p>- The remaining two wings fold downward, concealing the creatures&#8217; forms. Scripture links covered wings with reverence: the seraphim &#8220;covered their faces&#8221; and &#8220;feet&#8221; before the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>). Here, cherubim veil themselves, acknowledging divine holiness.<p>- The posture protects Ezekiel, too. Though he beholds this literal spectacle, the covered bodies temper the overwhelming glory (<a href="/habakkuk/3-4.htm">Habakkuk 3:4</a>). God reveals much&#8212;yet shields frail humanity from a brilliance we could not endure fully (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20-23</a>).<p>- Practically, covered wings picture humility in service. Even beings of immense power defer, keeping attention on the One enthroned above the expanse (<a href="/revelation/4-9.htm">Revelation 4:9-11</a>). God&#8217;s servants, whether celestial or earthly, advance His will while cloaked in modesty (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/1-23.htm">Ezekiel 1:23</a> literally portrays four cherubim stationed beneath a crystal-like expanse, two wings interlinked in unified obedience, two wings folded in humble reverence.

The other two wings of each cherub were "straight," extended when they were in motion, but let down when at rest (<a href="/ezekiel/1-25.htm" title="And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.">Ezekiel 1:25</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Under the firmament,</span> etc. The description must be read as completing that of ver. 11.
