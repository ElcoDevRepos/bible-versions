In the context of Ezekiel, this refers to God's action against Zedekiah, the last king of Judah, who broke his covenant with Babylon. The "net" signifies God's sovereign control and the certainty of His plans. Similar imagery is found in <a href="/hosea/7-12.htm">Hosea 7:12</a>, where God speaks of catching Israel like birds in a net, emphasizing divine retribution.<p><b>and catch him in My snare.</b><br>The "snare" further illustrates the inevitability of God's judgment. In ancient times, snares were traps set for animals, indicating that Zedekiah's attempts to escape God's judgment would be futile. This reflects the broader biblical theme that human rebellion against God leads to inevitable consequences, as seen in <a href="/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15</a>, where the wicked are ensnared by their own actions.<p><b>I will bring him to Babylon</b><br>This prophecy was fulfilled when Zedekiah was captured and taken to Babylon after the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC. Babylon, a significant city in ancient Mesopotamia, was the center of the Babylonian Empire. This event marked the beginning of the Babylonian Exile, a pivotal moment in Jewish history, fulfilling earlier prophecies such as those in <a href="/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7-10</a>.<p><b>and execute judgment upon him there</b><br>The execution of judgment in Babylon signifies God's justice being carried out in a foreign land, highlighting the reach of His authority beyond Israel. This judgment was both a personal consequence for Zedekiah and a national one for Judah, as it marked the end of the Davidic kingship until the coming of Christ, the ultimate Davidic King.<p><b>for the treason he committed against Me.</b><br>Zedekiah's treason was not only against Babylon, to whom he had sworn allegiance, but ultimately against God, who had ordained Babylon's rule as a form of judgment against Judah. This highlights the biblical principle that rebellion against divinely established authority is rebellion against God Himself, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>. The treason also prefigures the ultimate betrayal of Christ by Judas, emphasizing the theme of covenant unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who declares judgment and executes justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_judah.htm">The King of Judah</a></b><br>The subject of God's judgment due to unfaithfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The place where judgment is executed, representing exile and divine retribution.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>The prophet delivering God's message to the people of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_net_and_snare.htm">The Net and Snare</a></b><br>Metaphors for God's inescapable judgment and the certainty of His plans.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is inevitable and just.
