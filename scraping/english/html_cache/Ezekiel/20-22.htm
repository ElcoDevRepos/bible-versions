Throughout the Bible, God's hand often symbolizes His power and action (<a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a>, <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). Here, it signifies His decision to withhold punishment despite Israel's rebellion. This restraint is a recurring theme, highlighting God's patience and mercy (<a href="/psalms/78-38.htm">Psalm 78:38</a>).<p><b>and acted for the sake of My name</b><br>God's actions are motivated by the desire to uphold His holy name. In biblical times, a name represented one's character and reputation. God's name is synonymous with His holiness and faithfulness (<a href="/exodus/34-5.htm">Exodus 34:5-7</a>). By acting for His name's sake, God ensures His reputation remains untarnished, demonstrating His commitment to His covenant promises (<a href="/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22-23</a>).<p><b>so that it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations</b><br>The concern here is the perception of God's holiness by other nations. In the ancient Near East, the reputation of a deity was often linked to the success of its people. If Israel were destroyed, it could imply that their God was powerless. Thus, God acts to prevent His name from being dishonored among the nations, maintaining His glory and sovereignty (<a href="/isaiah/48-9.htm">Isaiah 48:9-11</a>).<p><b>in whose sight I had brought them out</b><br>This refers to the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history where God delivered them from Egyptian bondage (<a href="/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31-42</a>). The surrounding nations witnessed this miraculous deliverance, which served as a testament to God's power and faithfulness.
