In the context of Ezekiel, God often declares His purpose to make Himself known through acts of judgment and deliverance. Egypt, a powerful nation and a symbol of worldly strength, is being reminded that their power is nothing compared to God's. Historically, Egypt was a significant player in the ancient Near East, often interacting with Israel. This declaration is a fulfillment of God's promise to demonstrate His power and authority over all nations, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a>, where God reveals Himself to the Egyptians through the plagues.<p><b>For you were only a staff of reeds to the house of Israel.</b><br>This metaphor highlights Egypt's unreliability as an ally. A "staff of reeds" suggests something that appears supportive but is actually weak and fragile. In the historical context, Israel often sought alliances with Egypt for military support against other empires like Assyria and Babylon. However, these alliances proved to be ineffective and even detrimental, as Egypt could not provide the stability and strength Israel needed. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>, where Egypt is described as a "broken reed" that pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it. The phrase underscores the futility of relying on human power instead of trusting in God, who is the true source of strength and support.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

The figure is taken from the reeds, which grew abundantly on the banks of the Nile, and the statement is historically amplified in the following verse, where the reference is to be understood not of any single fact so much as of a continual, often repeated result.
