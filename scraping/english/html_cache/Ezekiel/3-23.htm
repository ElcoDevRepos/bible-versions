The "plain" signifies a place of solitude and revelation, away from the distractions of the city. In biblical narratives, plains often serve as settings for divine encounters, as seen with Abraham and Lot. This setting underscores the seriousness of the message Ezekiel is about to receive.<p><b>and behold, the glory of the LORD was present there</b><br>The "glory of the LORD" refers to the visible manifestation of God's presence, often associated with divine holiness and power. This glory is a recurring theme in Ezekiel, emphasizing God's sovereignty and majesty. The Hebrew term "kavod" conveys weightiness and honor, indicating the profound impact of God's presence. This encounter reaffirms God's continued involvement with His people, even in exile.<p><b>like the glory I had seen by the River Kebar</b><br>Ezekiel's reference to the River Kebar connects this vision to his initial calling in <a href="/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>. The Kebar was a canal near Babylon, where the exiles were settled. This continuity of divine revelation assures Ezekiel of God's unchanging nature and His plans for Israel. The repeated vision serves to strengthen Ezekiel's resolve and authority as a prophet.<p><b>and I fell facedown</b><br>Ezekiel's response of falling facedown is a common reaction to divine encounters, signifying reverence, awe, and submission. This posture is seen throughout Scripture, such as in the experiences of Abraham, Moses, and John in Revelation. It highlights the overwhelming nature of God's presence and the appropriate human response to His holiness. This act of worship and humility prepares Ezekiel to receive further instructions from God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
