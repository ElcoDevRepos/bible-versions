Tyre was a major Phoenician port city, renowned for its maritime trade and skilled merchants. The city's wealth was largely due to its ability to navigate and dominate trade routes across the Mediterranean. This skill in trading is reminiscent of the wisdom and understanding attributed to Solomon in <a href="/1_kings/10-23.htm">1 Kings 10:23-24</a>, where his wealth and wisdom attracted traders and dignitaries from all over the world. The emphasis on "great skill" suggests a God-given ability that was meant to be used for good but was instead used for self-aggrandizement.<p><b>you have increased your wealth</b><br>The accumulation of wealth is a central theme here, reflecting the material prosperity that often accompanies successful trade. In biblical times, wealth was seen as a sign of blessing, but it also came with the responsibility to use it wisely and justly. The increase in wealth can be compared to the blessings given to Israel when they followed God's commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). However, the misuse of wealth is warned against in scriptures such as <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, which states that the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. The wealth of Tyre, while a testament to its success, became a snare leading to pride and eventual downfall.<p><b>but your heart has grown proud because of it</b><br>Pride is a recurring theme in the Bible, often leading to a fall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). The heart, in biblical terms, represents the center of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect. The pride of the ruler of Tyre is akin to the pride of Lucifer described in <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-15</a>, where a desire to ascend above God led to his downfall. This pride is also reminiscent of Nebuchadnezzar's pride in <a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30-37</a>, where he boasted of his achievements and was subsequently humbled by God. The warning here is clear: pride in one's achievements, especially when they lead to self-reliance and a turning away from God, results in judgment. The ruler's pride is a cautionary tale of how wealth and success can corrupt the heart, leading to spiritual blindness and separation from God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

The problem lies in letting prosperity define identity (<a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>).<p>&#8226; God had warned Israel that abundance could lead them to forget Him (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-13.htm">Deuteronomy 8:13-14</a>). The king of Tyre illustrates that warning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but your heart has grown proud because of it</b><p>&#8226; Pride follows unchecked prosperity: &#8220;Pride goes before destruction&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Ezekiel later says, &#8220;Your heart became proud because of your beauty&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/28-17.htm">Ezekiel 28:17</a>), showing how external blessings can inflate the inner ego.<p>&#8226; God opposes the proud and gives grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>); therefore, pride invites resistance from the Almighty.<p>&#8226; Paul challenges believers: &#8220;What do you have that you did not receive?&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-7.htm">1 Corinthians 4:7</a>). Remembering this question guards the heart.<p>&#8226; Excessive wealth will one day collapse, as <a href="/revelation/18-11.htm">Revelation 18:11-17</a> pictures merchants mourning the fall of Babylon&#8212;the ultimate end of prideful commerce.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/28-5.htm">Ezekiel 28:5</a> exposes a progression: God-given skill &#8594; commercial success &#8594; wealth &#8594; arrogant heart. The verse warns that talents and prosperity, though blessings, become snares when they shift trust from the Giver to the gifts. True wisdom enjoys God&#8217;s provisions while remaining humble, stewarding resources for His glory and refusing the pride that brought Tyre&#8212;and every proud heart&#8212;to ruin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/28-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">By your great</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1447;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;r&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
