The "entrance to the court" suggests the temple's outer court, a significant place in Jewish worship. The temple was central to Israelite religion, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The court was where the people gathered, and its entrance signifies a transition from the profane to the sacred. This setting underscores the gravity of the vision Ezekiel is about to receive, highlighting the corruption within a place meant for holiness.<p><b>and I looked and saw a hole in the wall</b><br>Ezekiel's action of looking and seeing a "hole in the wall" suggests a revelation of hidden things. Walls in ancient Near Eastern architecture were meant for protection and separation, but a hole indicates a breach or exposure. This imagery symbolizes the uncovering of secret sins and idolatry within the temple, which should have been a place of purity. The hole represents the initial glimpse into the deeper corruption that Ezekiel will witness. This act of seeing hidden things aligns with the prophetic role of revealing God's truth and judgment. The exposure of sin within the temple parallels the broader theme of Israel's unfaithfulness, as seen in other prophetic books like Jeremiah and Isaiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /

God is teaching that He initiates exposure, targets the very places meant for His glory, calls His people to alertness, and reveals that even the smallest breach can betray deep idolatry. The verse invites us to let His word inspect our own &#8220;walls,&#8221; closing every gap before corruption spreads.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">To the door of the court.</span>--This is clearly a different place from that in which the prophet had hitherto been in his vision, and yet is not so described that its locality can be certainly fixed. He had been inside the inner court near its north gate; in <a href="/ezekiel/8-14.htm" title="Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.">Ezekiel 8:14</a> he is taken to the north gate of the outer enclosure of the temple precincts. It is probable, therefore, that this was between them. We do not know from the description of Solomon's temple that there were any other than the inner and the outer courts; but as there were others in the temple of Herod built upon the same area, it is altogether likely that there was a further division, and that it was to such a dividing wall, with chambers attached, that the prophet was now brought. Here he finds a hole, or window, too small for entrance, and is directed to enlarge it that he may go in. Having done so, he finds a door which he is told to enter. The object of this part of the vision is to show the extreme secrecy of what he is now to see--a, secrecy made necessary by the connection of this idolatry with Egypt, the foe of Chaldaea. Any question in regard to the way the idolaters themselves entered is out of place, as all is only in vision.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the door of the court.</span> What follows suggests that the prophet was led to the gate that opened from the inner to the outer court. This gas surrounded by chambers or cells (<a href="/jeremiah/35-4.htm">Jeremiah 35:4</a>). The term for "wall" (<span class="accented">kir</span>) is that specially used for the wall which encloses a whole group of buildings (<a href="/numbers/35-4.htm">Numbers 35:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Behold a hole in the wall.</span> The fact was clearly significant. The worship here was more clandestine than that of the "image of jealousy." We are not warranted, perhaps, in insisting on minute consistency in the world of visions, but the question naturally arises - How did the worshippers enter the chamber if Ezekiel had to enlarge the hole in the wall in order to get in? We may surmise that the entrance from the temple court had been blocked up all but entirely in the days of Josiah, that the idolaters now entered it from without or through some other chamber, while Ezekiel thinks of himself as coming upon them like a spy in the dim distance of the covered passage through which he made his way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/8-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then He brought</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">me to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the entrance</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1443;&#1514;&#1463;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(pe&#183;&#7791;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6607.htm">Strong's 6607: </a> </span><span class="str2">An opening, door, entrance way</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the court,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1462;&#1469;&#1495;&#1464;&#1510;&#1461;&#1425;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2691.htm">Strong's 2691: </a> </span><span class="str2">A yard, a hamlet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and I looked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1429;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;er&#183;&#8217;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
