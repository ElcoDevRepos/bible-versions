The outer court was accessible to all Israelites, contrasting with the inner areas reserved for priestly duties.

The priests served as intermediaries between God and the people, highlighting the need for purity and reverence in their roles.<p><b>they are to take off the garments in which they have ministered</b><br>The priestly garments were specifically designed for temple service, symbolizing purity and dedication to God. <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a> details the intricate design and purpose of these garments, emphasizing their sacred nature.

The garments, having been in the presence of God, carried a degree of sanctity.
