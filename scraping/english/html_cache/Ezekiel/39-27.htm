Historically, the Israelites were exiled to Babylon, but this prophecy extends beyond that event, suggesting a future regathering. The concept of God bringing His people back is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>. It emphasizes God's sovereignty and faithfulness to His covenant promises.<p><b>and gather them out of the lands of their enemies</b><br>The gathering from enemy lands highlights the dispersion of Israel among hostile nations. This dispersion is a result of divine judgment due to Israel's disobedience, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>. The act of gathering signifies God's mercy and the reversal of judgment. It also foreshadows the ultimate gathering of believers in the eschatological future, as seen in <a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>.<p><b>I will show My holiness in them</b><br>God's holiness is demonstrated through His people. This phrase indicates that the restoration of Israel will be a testament to God's holy nature. Holiness here implies separation and purity, reflecting God's character. The transformation of Israel will serve as a witness to God's sanctifying power, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/36-23.htm">Ezekiel 36:23</a>, where God promises to vindicate the holiness of His great name.<p><b>in the sight of many nations</b><br>The restoration and sanctification of Israel will be a public event, observed by many nations. This visibility underscores the universal scope of God's plan and His desire for all nations to recognize His sovereignty. It aligns with the prophetic vision in <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>, where nations are drawn to the mountain of the Lord. This public demonstration serves as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate revelation of God's holiness to the world, as seen in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who promises to restore His people and demonstrate His holiness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who have been scattered among the nations due to their disobedience but are promised restoration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations/enemies.htm">Nations/Enemies</a></b><br>The foreign lands and peoples among whom the Israelites have been dispersed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/restoration.htm">Restoration</a></b><br>The event of God bringing His people back to their land, signifying redemption and fulfillment of His promises.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_of_god.htm">Holiness of God</a></b><br>The divine attribute that God will manifest through the restoration of His people, demonstrating His power and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God&#8217;s Faithfulness</a></b><br>God is faithful to His promises.
