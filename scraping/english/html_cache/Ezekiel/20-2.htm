This phrase is frequently used throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4</a> and <a href="/isaiah/38-4.htm">Isaiah 38:4</a>, highlighting the consistency of God's communication with His prophets.<p><b>came to me:</b><br>The personal nature of this phrase indicates that Ezekiel is the direct recipient of God's message. This personal encounter underscores the intimate relationship between God and His prophets. Ezekiel, a priest and prophet during the Babylonian exile, often received visions and messages that were specific to the circumstances of Israel's captivity. The phrase suggests a direct and unmediated communication, reinforcing the authenticity and urgency of the message.<p><b>saying:</b><br>This introduces the content of the divine message that follows. It prepares the reader for the specific instructions or revelations that God is about to impart. In the broader context of <a href="/ezekiel/20.htm">Ezekiel 20</a>, the message that follows is a recounting of Israel's history of rebellion and God's enduring faithfulness, serving as both a warning and a reminder of God's covenant promises. This structure is typical in prophetic literature, where the introduction of a divine message is followed by detailed instructions, judgments, or promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the central figure in this passage.

God waits until their approach is complete&#8212;and &#8220;then&#8221; He answers.<p>&#8226; Similar moments of divine timing reinforce the pattern: &#8220;After ten days the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/42-7.htm">Jeremiah 42:7</a>); &#8220;Then the LORD sent Nathan to David&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1</a>). God responds at precisely the right moment, underscoring His sovereign control of events.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the word</b><p>&#8226; What reaches Ezekiel is not a feeling or intuition but a clear, verbal revelation&#8212;&#8220;the word.&#8221; Scripture celebrates the power of that spoken word: &#8220;So is My word that goes out from My mouth; it will not return to Me empty&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Hebrews reminds us that &#8220;the word of God is living and active&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>). God speaks with intent&#8212;to create, correct, and call His people back.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The source is unmistakable: Yahweh Himself. This divine origin guarantees truth and authority. As Peter says, &#8220;Men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul echoes the same conviction: &#8220;You accepted it&#8230;as it truly is, the word of God&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>). When Ezekiel hears, he hears the Creator, covenant-Keeper, and Judge.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>came</b><p>&#8226; The verb stresses initiative. Ezekiel does not seek a private revelation; God seeks him. &#8220;The word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>); &#8220;The word of the LORD came to Jonah&#8221; (<a href="/jonah/1-1.htm">Jonah 1:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Whether by vision, voice, or inner prompting, God bridges the gap, proving He is not silent but actively pursuing His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to me</b><p>&#8226; Revelation is personal. The Almighty singles out Ezekiel&#8212;just as He once did Jeremiah (&#8220;The word of the LORD came to me,&#8221; <a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4</a>) and Amos (<a href="/amos/7-14.htm">Amos 7:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; This personal address commissions Ezekiel as a faithful mouthpiece, reminding every believer that God knows each servant by name.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying</b><p>&#8226; The participle forecasts content. God is about to speak words that will expose sin, recount history, and announce both judgment and hope (the remainder of chapter 20).<p>&#8226; Similar openings occur throughout Scripture: &#8220;The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/30-1.htm">Jeremiah 30:1-2</a>); &#8220;To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These are the words&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/2-1.htm">Revelation 2:1</a>). Each instance prepares the listener for unmistakable divine instruction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/20-2.htm">Ezekiel 20:2</a> is more than a narrative placeholder; it is a loaded announcement that God Himself is stepping into the moment. By timing (&#8220;Then&#8221;), by medium (&#8220;the word&#8221;), by source (&#8220;of the LORD&#8221;), by action (&#8220;came&#8221;), by recipient (&#8220;to me&#8221;), and by purpose (&#8220;saying&#8221;), the verse assures us that what follows carries absolute authority and personal urgency. God still speaks with perfect timing, unassailable truth, and intimate knowledge of His servants&#8212;calling His people to listen, repent, and obey.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/20-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the word</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#601;&#183;&#7687;ar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to me,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1463;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;lay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saying,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;&#1502;&#1465;&#1469;&#1512;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#183;m&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/20-2.htm">Ezekiel 20:2 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/20-2.htm">Ezekiel 20:2 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/20-2.htm">Ezekiel 20:2 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/20-2.htm">Ezekiel 20:2 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/20-2.htm">Ezekiel 20:2 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/20-2.htm">Ezekiel 20:2  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/20-2.htm">Ezekiel 20:2 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/20-2.htm">Ezekiel 20:2 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/20-2.htm">Ezekiel 20:2 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/20-2.htm">Ezekiel 20:2 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/20-2.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 20:2 The word of Yahweh came to me (Ezek.
