In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/17.htm">Ezekiel 17</a>, the first eagle represents Babylon, and this second eagle is often interpreted as Egypt. The imagery of "great wings and many feathers" suggests strength and influence, characteristics of Egypt during this period. Historically, Egypt was a significant power and often seen as a potential ally against Babylonian dominance. This reflects the political maneuvering of Judah's leaders, who sought alliances to resist Babylon.<p><b>And behold, this vine bent its roots toward him.</b><br>The "vine" represents the kingdom of Judah, specifically its leadership under King Zedekiah. The act of bending its roots toward the second eagle signifies Judah's attempt to seek support and protection from Egypt. This action is a metaphor for political allegiance and reliance. Biblically, this reflects Judah's unfaithfulness to God's covenant, as they were instructed to submit to Babylon as part of God's judgment. The bending of roots indicates a turning away from God's directive.<p><b>It stretched out its branches to him from its planting bed,</b><br>The stretching of branches symbolizes Judah's efforts to establish a strong alliance with Egypt. The "planting bed" refers to the land of Judah, where God had placed them. This imagery suggests a deliberate and active pursuit of Egyptian support, contrary to God's will. Theologically, this represents a lack of trust in God's sovereignty and a reliance on human power. This act of reaching out to Egypt is seen as a breach of faithfulness to God, who had planted them in their land with a purpose.<p><b>so that he might water it.</b><br>The desire for the second eagle to "water" the vine indicates Judah's hope for sustenance and protection from Egypt. Watering is a metaphor for provision and support, which Judah sought from Egypt instead of relying on God. This reflects a common biblical theme where Israel often turned to foreign powers for help rather than trusting in God's provision. Historically, this alliance with Egypt ultimately failed, as Egypt could not deliver Judah from Babylonian conquest. This serves as a prophetic warning about the futility of relying on human alliances over divine guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
