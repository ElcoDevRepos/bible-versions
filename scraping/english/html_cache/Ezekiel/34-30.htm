It suggests a future time when understanding and recognition of God's presence and actions will be undeniable. This is a common theme in prophetic literature, where God often promises that His actions will lead to a deeper knowledge of Him (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7, 13</a>:9).<p><b>that I, the LORD their God,</b><br>The use of "LORD" in all caps signifies the divine name YHWH, highlighting God's covenant relationship with Israel. This phrase underscores God's sovereignty and His personal relationship with His people. It reflects the covenantal promise found in <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>, where God assures Israel that He will be their God.<p><b>am with them,</b><br>This assurance of God's presence is a recurring promise throughout Scripture, providing comfort and security to His people. It echoes the promise given to the patriarchs (<a href="/genesis/26-24.htm">Genesis 26:24</a>) and is fulfilled ultimately in the person of Jesus Christ, who is called "Immanuel," meaning "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>).<p><b>and that they, the house of Israel,</b><br>The "house of Israel" refers to the collective people of Israel, emphasizing their identity as God's chosen nation. This phrase is significant in the context of the Babylonian exile, where the unity and identity of Israel were under threat. It reassures them of their continued status as God's people.<p><b>are My people,&#8217;</b><br>This declaration reaffirms the covenant relationship between God and Israel. It is reminiscent of the covenant language found in <a href="/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, where God promises to be their God and they will be His people. This relationship is central to the biblical narrative and is fulfilled in the New Covenant through Christ (<a href="/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10</a>).<p><b>declares the Lord GOD.</b><br>The repetition of "Lord GOD" (Adonai YHWH) emphasizes the authority and certainty of the declaration. It is a solemn affirmation that what has been spoken will surely come to pass. This phrase is often used in prophetic literature to underscore the divine origin and reliability of the message (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/17-24.htm">Ezekiel 17:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who promises His presence and protection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_israel.htm">The House of Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, often referred to as His flock, whom He promises to shepherd and care for.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, who delivers God's messages of judgment and restoration.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, a time of judgment but also of promised restoration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shepherds_of_israel.htm">The Shepherds of Israel</a></b><br>Earlier in <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>, these are the leaders who failed to care for God's people, leading to God's promise to shepherd them Himself.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God remains faithful to His promises, even when His people are unfaithful.

In the New Covenant this presence is personified in Immanuel, &#8220;God with us&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>), and sealed by the indwelling Spirit (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical implications:<p>&#8211; Security in danger (<a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>).<p>&#8211; Comfort in exile or discipline (<a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>).<p>&#8211; Courage for obedience (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and that they, the house of Israel, are My people</b><p>&#8226; God reaffirms Israel&#8217;s identity: His treasured possession (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>).
