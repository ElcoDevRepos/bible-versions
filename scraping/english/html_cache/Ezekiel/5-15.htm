In the ancient Near Eastern context, being a reproach and a taunt meant becoming an object of scorn and ridicule among neighboring nations. This reflects the covenantal curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>, where disobedience leads to becoming a byword among all peoples. The Israelites, chosen to be a light to the nations, instead become a negative example due to their failure to uphold God's laws.<p><b>a warning and a horror to the nations around you</b><br>The judgment upon Israel serves as a cautionary tale to surrounding nations, demonstrating the seriousness of God's holiness and justice. The horror experienced by these nations underscores the severity of God's judgment. This aligns with the prophetic tradition where Israel's fate is meant to instruct other nations about the consequences of sin (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>). The imagery of horror also connects to the apocalyptic visions in the book of Revelation, where divine judgment is portrayed as terrifying and awe-inspiring.<p><b>when I execute judgments against you in anger, wrath, and raging fury</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the intensity and righteousness of God's response to sin. The use of "anger, wrath, and raging fury" highlights the depth of God's emotional response to Israel's covenant unfaithfulness. It reflects the divine attributes of justice and holiness, as seen in other prophetic texts like <a href="/isaiah/13-9.htm">Isaiah 13:9</a> and <a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2</a>. The execution of judgments is not arbitrary but a fulfillment of the covenantal warnings given to Israel, demonstrating God's consistency and faithfulness to His word.<p><b>I, the LORD, have spoken</b><br>This declaration asserts the authority and finality of God's pronouncement. The use of "I, the LORD" (Yahweh) underscores the personal and covenantal relationship between God and Israel. It is a reminder of God's sovereignty and the certainty of His words coming to pass, as seen throughout the prophetic literature (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). This phrase also points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises and judgments, which find their culmination in the person and work of Jesus Christ, who embodies both the mercy and justice of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.

The verse therefore calls every reader to take God&#8217;s word seriously, repent of hidden idols, and trust that the same God who judges also stands ready to redeem.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A reproach and a taunt,</span> etc. An echo of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>. The accumulation of synonyms in both clauses of the verse is eminently characteristic of Ezekiel's style. Word follows word, like the strokes of a sledge hammer. The word for "instruction" is that which occurs so often in the Book of Proverbs (Proverbs 1:2, 3, and in twenty-two other passages). In <a href="/deuteronomy/11-12.htm">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/30-14.htm">Jeremiah 30:14</a>, the Authorized Version renders it "chastisement," and that sense is manifestly implied here. Jerusalem was, as it were, to be the great object lesson in God's education of mankind. And the final stroke of all is that the words were not the prophet's own, but "I the Lord have spokes it." The words reappear in ver. 17. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/5-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So you will be</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1469;&#1492;&#1464;&#1448;&#1497;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
