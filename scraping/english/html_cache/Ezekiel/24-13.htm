In the context of Ezekiel, this refers to the idolatry and rebellion of the Israelites. The term "indecency" suggests a shameful and blatant disregard for God's laws. The concept of uncleanness is deeply rooted in the Levitical laws (Leviticus 11-15), where physical and spiritual purity were essential for maintaining a covenant relationship with God.<p><b>I tried to cleanse you</b><br>God's attempts to cleanse His people can be seen throughout the prophetic books, where He sends prophets to call Israel to repentance. This reflects God's patience and desire for His people to return to Him. The cleansing process often involved trials and judgments intended to bring about repentance, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16-18</a>, where God invites His people to wash themselves and be clean.<p><b>but you would not be purified from your filthiness</b><br>This phrase underscores the stubbornness and resistance of the Israelites to God's efforts. Despite numerous warnings and opportunities for repentance, the people continued in their sinful ways. This resistance is echoed in <a href="/jeremiah/6-16.htm">Jeremiah 6:16-17</a>, where the people refuse to walk in the good way despite God's guidance.<p><b>You will not be pure again until My wrath against you has subsided</b><br>Here, the inevitability of divine judgment is emphasized. God's wrath is a response to persistent sin and rebellion. The concept of divine wrath is consistent with the covenantal relationship, where blessings and curses were contingent upon obedience (Deuteronomy 28). The phrase also points to a future hope, as God's wrath is not eternal but will eventually subside, allowing for restoration. This is seen in the broader narrative of the Bible, where judgment is often followed by redemption, as in the promise of a new covenant in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
