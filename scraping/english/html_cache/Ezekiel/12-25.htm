In the context of Ezekiel, God is asserting His power to communicate directly with His people through His prophets. This echoes the divine authority seen in other parts of Scripture, such as when God speaks to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>. The use of "I, the LORD" underscores the personal nature of God's communication and His covenant relationship with Israel.<p><b>whatever word I speak</b><br>Here, the focus is on the certainty and reliability of God's word. In biblical times, a king's word was law, and God's word is portrayed as even more authoritative. This phrase assures that God's declarations are not arbitrary but purposeful and intentional, aligning with <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, which states that God's word will not return void.<p><b>and it will be fulfilled without delay</b><br>This highlights the immediacy and inevitability of God's actions. Historically, the Israelites had experienced delays in the fulfillment of prophecies, leading to skepticism. However, this assurance counters any doubt, affirming that God's timing is perfect. This is reminiscent of <a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>, where the vision awaits its appointed time and will not delay.<p><b>For in your days, O rebellious house</b><br>The "rebellious house" refers to the Israelites, who were often described as stubborn and disobedient throughout the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/9-7.htm">Deuteronomy 9:7</a>). The phrase "in your days" indicates that the fulfillment of God's word will occur within the lifetime of the current generation, emphasizing the urgency and relevance of the prophecy.<p><b>I will speak a message and bring it to pass</b><br>This reiterates the certainty of God's word coming to fruition. The phrase "bring it to pass" is a common biblical expression for the fulfillment of prophecy, seen in passages like <a href="/1_kings/8-56.htm">1 Kings 8:56</a>. It underscores God's active role in history, ensuring that His plans are accomplished.<p><b>declares the Lord GOD.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The use of "declares the Lord GOD" serves as a formal conclusion to the prophetic statement, reinforcing its divine origin and authority. This formulaic ending is common in prophetic literature, emphasizing that the message is not from the prophet himself but from God. It is a reminder of God's ultimate control over the events of history, as seen throughout the prophetic books.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
