A cubit, approximately 18 inches, was a standard unit of measurement in ancient Israel. The repeated measurement of a thousand cubits suggests a progression in the vision, symbolizing the increasing depth and influence of God's presence and blessings. This measurement reflects the meticulous nature of God's plans, as seen in other parts of Ezekiel and the detailed instructions for the temple.<p><b>but now it was a river that I could not cross</b><br>The river represents the life-giving and transformative power of God. In biblical symbolism, water often signifies the Holy Spirit, cleansing, and renewal. The inability to cross the river indicates the overwhelming and boundless nature of God's grace and the spiritual life that flows from His presence. This imagery parallels the vision in <a href="/revelation/22.htm">Revelation 22:1-2</a>, where the river of life flows from the throne of God, emphasizing the eternal and abundant life found in Him.<p><b>because the water had risen and was deep enough for swimming</b><br>The increasing depth of the water signifies the growing and expansive nature of God's kingdom. It suggests a transition from a limited understanding of God's work to a fuller, more immersive experience of His power and presence. This depth can be seen as a call to deeper faith and trust in God, moving beyond superficial engagement to a profound relationship with Him. The imagery of swimming implies total reliance on God's strength and guidance.<p><b>a river that could not be crossed on foot</b><br>This phrase underscores the supernatural aspect of God's work, which cannot be navigated or comprehended through human effort alone. It highlights the necessity of faith and dependence on God to experience the fullness of His promises. The river's uncrossable nature points to the inexhaustible and infinite nature of God's love and provision, echoing the themes of divine abundance and eternal life found throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who received visions and messages to deliver to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
