It underscores the distinction between God and man, highlighting the divine authority behind Ezekiel's messages. The term is also used in the New Testament, notably by Jesus Christ to refer to Himself, indicating His role as the representative of humanity and the fulfillment of prophetic roles.<p><b>set your face against</b><br>This expression signifies a determined opposition and a resolute stance. It indicates that the message to follow is one of judgment and confrontation. In biblical terms, setting one's face against something often implies divine disapproval and impending judgment. This phrase is used in other prophetic contexts, such as in Jeremiah and Daniel, to denote God's firm stance against sin and rebellion.<p><b>Mount Seir</b><br>Mount Seir is a mountainous region associated with the descendants of Esau, also known as Edom. Geographically, it is located southeast of the Dead Sea. Historically, Edom had a tumultuous relationship with Israel, often characterized by hostility and conflict. The Edomites were descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother, and their enmity is rooted in the biblical narrative of Jacob and Esau. This judgment against Mount Seir symbolizes God's retribution against Edom for its perpetual enmity and violence against Israel.<p><b>and prophesy against it</b><br>The act of prophesying against Mount Seir indicates a divine pronouncement of judgment. Prophecy in the Old Testament often served as a warning and a call to repentance, but in this context, it is a declaration of inevitable judgment due to Edom's persistent sin. This prophecy aligns with other biblical passages where God pronounces judgment on nations that oppose His people, such as in Obadiah and Isaiah. The prophetic message serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and justice, as well as His protection over His covenant people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, called to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_seir.htm">Mount Seir</a></b><br>A mountainous region associated with the Edomites, descendants of Esau, who were often in conflict with Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/edomites.htm">Edomites</a></b><br>The people living in Mount Seir, historically antagonistic towards Israel, representing opposition to God's people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophecy.htm">Prophecy</a></b><br>A divine message delivered by a prophet, often concerning future events or divine judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The act of God delivering justice, often involving consequences for sin and rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_justice.htm">Understanding Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's judgment against Mount Seir serves as a reminder of His justice.

The land included the whole mountainous region between the Dead Sea and the Elanitic Gulf, or eastern branch of the Red Sea.

I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.">Isaiah 63:1-6</a>--while still keeping this historical relation in view, regards them also as representative of the world's hostility to the covenant people of God. This appears from the fact that the desolation of Edom, itself but a small province, is put in contrast (<a href="/ezekiel/35-14.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.">Ezekiel 35:14</a>) with the rejoicing of the whole earth, and that in <a href="/ezekiel/36-5.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey.">Ezekiel 36:5</a> (and generally <a href="/context/ezekiel/35-3.htm" title="And say to it, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I am against you, and I will stretch out my hand against you, and I will make you most desolate.">Ezekiel 35:3-7</a>) Edom is coupled with "the residue of the heathen."
