The "mother" here can be understood as the nation or the leadership of Israel, possibly referring to the Davidic dynasty. The vineyard imagery is significant, as vineyards were common in ancient Israel and symbolized prosperity and blessing. The vine represents the potential for growth and fruitfulness, which was God's intention for Israel as His chosen people.<p><b>planted by the water</b><br>The imagery of being "planted by the water" suggests a place of nourishment and sustenance. In the arid climate of the Middle East, water is a precious resource, essential for life and growth. This phrase echoes <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, where the righteous are likened to a tree planted by streams of water, indicating stability and prosperity. Spiritually, it signifies being rooted in God's provision and blessing, which was intended for Israel through their covenant relationship with Him.<p><b>it was fruitful and full of branches</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the initial success and prosperity of Israel. The vine being "fruitful and full of branches" suggests a time when Israel was thriving, possibly during the reigns of David and Solomon when the kingdom was united and prosperous. The fruitfulness symbolizes the blessings and abundance that come from obedience to God. It also reflects the potential for influence and impact, as branches can spread widely.<p><b>because of the abundant waters</b><br>The "abundant waters" signify the blessings and resources provided by God. In a spiritual sense, this abundance can be seen as the guidance, protection, and provision that God offered to Israel. The phrase underscores the idea that Israel's prosperity was not due to their own efforts but was a result of divine favor. This can be connected to the New Testament, where Jesus refers to Himself as the true vine (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1-5</a>), emphasizing that spiritual fruitfulness comes from abiding in Him, the source of living water.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, often using vivid imagery and allegories.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Represented as a vine, Israel is depicted as having been blessed and nurtured by God, symbolizing its potential and prosperity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/vineyard.htm">Vineyard</a></b><br>A metaphor for the nation of Israel, indicating a place of growth and potential under God's care.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/water.htm">Water</a></b><br>Symbolizes the blessings and sustenance provided by God, essential for the vine's growth and fruitfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mother.htm">Mother</a></b><br>Represents the nation of Israel or its leadership, indicating the source or origin of the vine's growth and prosperity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god_for_growth.htm">Dependence on God for Growth</a></b><br>Just as the vine depends on water, we must rely on God for spiritual nourishment and growth.

Every branch, blossom, and harvest came &#8220;because of the abundant waters,&#8221; a literal witness to the Lord&#8217;s faithful provision. The verse celebrates what God did for His people and warns that fruitfulness depends entirely on remaining planted in His life-giving presence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">A vine in thy blood.</span>--The figure here changes to the more common one of a vine, yet by no means the "vine of low stature" of <a href="/ezekiel/17-6.htm" title="And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.">Ezekiel 17:6</a>; it is rather a <span class= "ital">strong and goodly vine. </span>The phrase "in thy blood" is obscure, and has occasioned much perplexity to the commentators. Some of the ancient versions and some manuscripts have modified the text; but the meaning seems to be, if the text is taken as it stands, "Thy mother is like a vine living in the blood (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in the life) of her children." This would then be a statement amplified in the following, "fruitful and full of branches." The general sense is plain: Israel is described as having been planted a strong and fruitful vine, with every advantage for growth and full development.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Another parable comes close upon the heels of the first. <span class="cmt_word">Thy mother;</span> <span class="accented">sc</span>.
