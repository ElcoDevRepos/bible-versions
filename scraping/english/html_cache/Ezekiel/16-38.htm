This phrase indicates that Jerusalem, personified as an unfaithful wife, is being judged for spiritual adultery&#8212;idolatry and unfaithfulness to God. The imagery of adultery is used throughout the Old Testament to describe Israel's unfaithfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/3-8.htm">Jeremiah 3:8-9</a>, <a href="/hosea/2-2.htm">Hosea 2:2-5</a>). The punishment reflects the seriousness of breaking the covenant with God, akin to breaking a marriage vow.<p><b>and those who shed blood;</b><br>The shedding of blood refers to acts of violence and murder, which were rampant in Jerusalem at the time. This phrase highlights the city's moral corruption and injustice (<a href="/ezekiel/7-23.htm">Ezekiel 7:23, 22</a>:2-4). The shedding of innocent blood is condemned throughout Scripture (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>, <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-17</a>), and it underscores the severity of Jerusalem's sins, warranting divine judgment.<p><b>so I will bring upon you the wrath of your bloodshed and jealousy.</b><br>The wrath mentioned here is God's righteous anger against sin. Bloodshed and jealousy are linked to the idolatrous practices and alliances that Israel pursued, betraying their exclusive relationship with God (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16</a>). The consequences of these actions are divine retribution, as God is a jealous God who demands faithfulness (<a href="/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>). This wrath is not only punitive but also purifying, aiming to restore the covenant relationship (<a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25-27</a>). The prophetic nature of this judgment foreshadows the ultimate redemption and purification through Jesus Christ, who bears the punishment for sin and restores believers to God (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
