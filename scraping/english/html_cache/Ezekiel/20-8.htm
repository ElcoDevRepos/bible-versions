Historically, this rebellion refers to the period when the Israelites were in Egypt, where they were influenced by Egyptian culture and religion. The rebellion against God is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a> with the golden calf incident. This refusal to listen is a direct violation of the covenant relationship established between God and Israel, where obedience was a key component (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>).<p><b>None of them cast away the abominations before their eyes,</b><br>The "abominations" refer to the detestable practices and idols of the Egyptians. Archaeological findings have shown that Egyptian religion was polytheistic, with numerous gods and idols. The Israelites, living in Egypt for centuries, were exposed to these practices. The abominations could include idol worship and other practices contrary to the worship of Yahweh. This phrase underscores the Israelites' failure to separate themselves from pagan influences, a theme also seen in later periods, such as during the time of the Judges (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-13</a>).<p><b>and they did not forsake the idols of Egypt.</b><br>Idolatry is a significant issue throughout the Bible, representing a turning away from the one true God. The "idols of Egypt" could include gods like Ra, Osiris, and Isis. This phrase indicates that the Israelites were not fully committed to God, as they continued to hold onto these foreign deities. This is a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). The persistence of idolatry among the Israelites is a recurring problem, leading to various judgments and calls for repentance by the prophets.<p><b>So I resolved to pour out My wrath upon them and vent My anger against them in the land of Egypt.</b><br>God's wrath is a response to the covenant unfaithfulness of His people. The decision to "pour out My wrath" indicates a divine judgment that was intended to bring the Israelites back to repentance. This phrase reflects God's justice and holiness, as He cannot tolerate sin and rebellion. The mention of "in the land of Egypt" suggests that this judgment was considered even before the Exodus, highlighting God's patience and mercy in delaying His wrath. This concept of divine wrath is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/29-24.htm">Deuteronomy 29:24-28</a>, where disobedience leads to curses and judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile, delivering messages of judgment and hope.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt but often fell into idolatry and rebellion.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved for 400 years, representing bondage and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who delivered the Israelites from Egypt and called them to worship Him alone.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols_of_egypt.htm">Idols of Egypt</a></b><br>The false gods and abominations that the Israelites were tempted to worship, representing disobedience and spiritual adultery.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/rebellion_against_god.htm">Rebellion Against God</a></b><br>The Israelites' refusal to listen to God serves as a warning against hardening our hearts and ignoring His commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites clung to the idols of Egypt, we must be vigilant against modern-day idols that can lead us away from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_righteous_anger.htm">God's Righteous Anger</a></b><br>God's response to Israel's rebellion reminds us of His holiness and the seriousness of sin, urging us to seek repentance and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_forsake_sin.htm">The Call to Forsake Sin</a></b><br>We are called to cast away anything that hinders our relationship with God, just as the Israelites were called to forsake their idols.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_and_mercy.htm">God's Faithfulness and Mercy</a></b><br>Despite Israel's rebellion, God remained faithful to His covenant, offering hope and restoration to those who repent.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_20_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 20:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_20_8_Israel_s_rebellion_shown.htm">How does Ezekiel 20:8 illustrate Israel's rebellion against God's commands?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_idols_today_block_God_s_voice.htm">What idols today might cause us to "not listen" to God's voice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Avoid_defilement_by_worldly_influences.htm">How can we ensure we are not defiling ourselves with worldly influences?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Compare_Ezekiel_20_8_with_other_disobedience.htm">Compare Israel's rebellion in Ezekiel 20:8 with other biblical instances of disobedience.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_Israel_s_Ezekiel_20_8_errors.htm">What steps can we take to avoid repeating Israel's mistakes in Ezekiel 20:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_rebel_in_Ezekiel_20_8_after_miracles.htm">Why did the Israelites rebel against God in Ezekiel 20:8 despite witnessing His miracles in Egypt?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_20_8_and_Old_Testament_idolatry.htm">How does Ezekiel 20:8 reflect the theme of idolatry in the Old Testament?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_20_8_on_human_nature_disobedience.htm">What does Ezekiel 20:8 reveal about human nature and disobedience to God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ezekiel_20.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ezekiel 20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_there_evidence_for_cycles_in_ezekiel_20.htm">Historically and archaeologically, is there evidence to support the repeated cycles of rebellion and divine judgment described throughout Ezekiel 20?

But they had the same disposition then as they had afterwards; and, even without such a charge, we could infer the probability of their idolatry. It is possible that the prophet may have had in mind such incidents as are related in <a href="/context/numbers/14-11.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have showed among them?">Numbers 14:11-20</a>, happening while the Israelites were still in the neighbourhood of Egypt, and when the report of them would speedily have reached Egyptian ears. It is by no means necessary to suppose that in this broad and general review of the teachings of history each incident is kept in its strict chronological place. Yet idolatry in Egypt is distinctly charged upon the Israelites in <a href="/ezekiel/16-3.htm" title="And say, Thus said the Lord GOD to Jerusalem; Your birth and your nativity is of the land of Canaan; your father was an Amorite, and your mother an Hittite.">Ezekiel 16:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-19.htm" title="My meat also which I gave you, fine flour, and oil, and honey, with which I fed you, you have even set it before them for a sweet smell: and thus it was, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 16:19</a>, and this verse may well refer to God's judgment for this sin suspended and delayed while they were in Egypt lest it should be misunderstood by the heathen.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/20-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But they rebelled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yam&#183;r&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
