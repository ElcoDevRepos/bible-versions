In the context of Ezekiel, the shedding of innocent blood refers to acts of violence and injustice prevalent in Jerusalem. The Mosaic Law explicitly condemns murder (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>), and the prophets often rebuked Israel for their violence and oppression (<a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>). The guilt of bloodshed is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, emphasizing the sanctity of life and the need for justice.<p><b>and you are defiled by the idols you have made</b><br>Idolatry was a significant issue for Israel, leading to spiritual defilement. The making and worshiping of idols violated the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). Idolatry is often equated with spiritual adultery, as it represents unfaithfulness to God. The prophets frequently condemned Israel for turning to idols, which were powerless and led the people away from true worship (<a href="/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11-13</a>). This defilement is not just ritual but moral, corrupting the heart and society.<p><b>You have brought your days to a close and have come to the end of your years</b><br>This phrase indicates impending judgment and the end of an era for Jerusalem. The prophetic message is that the people's sins have led to their downfall. The "end of your years" suggests a divinely appointed time for judgment, echoing the warnings given by other prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>). It underscores the concept of divine retribution, where persistent sin leads to inevitable consequences.<p><b>Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations</b><br>Israel was meant to be a light to the nations, demonstrating God's holiness and righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>). However, due to their sins, they became a reproach, a source of scorn and derision among the surrounding nations. This reversal of roles is a common theme in the prophets, where Israel's failure to uphold God's standards results in shame rather than honor (<a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15-16</a>). It serves as a warning of the consequences of disobedience.<p><b>and a mockery to all the lands</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the extent of Israel's disgrace. Being a mockery implies that other nations would ridicule and scorn Israel for their downfall. This fulfills the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>, where disobedience would lead to becoming "an object of horror, scorn, and ridicule." The mockery from other lands highlights the public nature of God's judgment and serves as a sobering reminder of the importance of faithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation addressed in this passage, specifically the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who are being condemned for their sins.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry.htm">Idolatry</a></b><br>The worship of idols, which was a significant sin among the Israelites, leading to their spiritual and moral corruption.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bloodshed.htm">Bloodshed</a></b><br>Refers to the violence and injustice prevalent in Jerusalem, contributing to their guilt before God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>The surrounding peoples who would witness Israel's downfall and mock them as a result of their disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin, particularly idolatry and violence, leads to spiritual and physical ruin.

Israel's law stood far above the legislation of any other nation of the period, but the habitual conduct of her people was in utter disregard of that law. The effect was the same as at a later day, when St. Paul said, "The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you" (<a href="/romans/2-24.htm" title="For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.">Romans 2:24</a>), just as the same evils and the same hindrances to the spread of the Gospel now result from the unworthy lives of Christians. But the Jews peculiarly exposed themselves to derision by their claim, as the chosen people of God, to universal and everlasting dominion, contrasted with their present overthrow and desolation; and this desolation was a punishment for the outrageous sins of a people whose whole national existence was based upon a call to peculiar holiness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast caused thy days to draw near</span>, etc. As in Ver. 3, the days and the years are those of God's judgments. The people had made no effort to avert their doom by repentance. They had, as it were, rushed upon their appointed fate. So, though in another sense, the righteous lives of the faithful are said, in <a href="/2_peter/3-12.htm">2 Peter 3:12</a>, to "hasten the coming of the day of God." Exceptional evil and exceptional good alike hasten the approach of the day which is to decide between the two. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/22-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">you are guilty</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1431;&#1502;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#353;amt)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_816.htm">Strong's 816: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be guilty, to be punished, perish</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the blood</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1448;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;m&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
