The Lord has just finished confronting Judah&#8217;s elders over idolatry (<a href="/bsb/ezekiel/14.htm">Ezekiel 14</a>), and &#8220;then&#8221; alerts us to a fresh installment in the same unfolding conversation.<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses similar transitions to mark God&#8217;s continuing dialogue with His people (cf. &#8220;After these things&#8221; in <a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Then&#8221; reminds us that God&#8217;s dealings with us are orderly and purposeful, not random (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The word</b><p>&#8226; What Ezekiel is about to hear is not a dream, impression, or opinion; it is &#8220;the word,&#8221; a concrete, verbal revelation (<a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Throughout the book this phrase occurs repeatedly (<a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>; 6:1; 12:1), underscoring the consistency of God&#8217;s communication.<p>&#8226; Because it is God&#8217;s word, it carries the same authority and reliability affirmed elsewhere (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The source is &#8220;the LORD&#8221; (YHWH), Israel&#8217;s covenant-keeping God (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; His covenant name stresses both His self-existence and His faithfulness (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The authority behind the forthcoming parable about the useless vine (<a href="/ezekiel/15-2.htm">Ezekiel 15:2-8</a>) rests not in Ezekiel&#8217;s creativity but in the Lord&#8217;s own character (<a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>came to me</b><p>&#8226; God initiates; Ezekiel only receives.

Each phrase underscores key truths: God speaks in sequence and purpose (&#8220;Then&#8221;); His message is concrete and authoritative (&#8220;the word&#8221;); it originates from the covenant Lord Himself (&#8220;of the LORD&#8221;); it is delivered personally to a chosen servant (&#8220;came to me&#8221;); and it is meant to be heard and obeyed (&#8220;saying&#8221;). Before we even reach the parable of the vine, verse 1 teaches that every prophetic warning rests on the sure, living voice of God who still calls His people to listen and respond.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/15-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the word</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#601;&#183;&#7687;ar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to me,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1463;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;lay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saying,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;&#1502;&#1465;&#1469;&#1512;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#183;m&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ezekiel/15-1.htm">Ezekiel 15:1 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ezekiel/15-1.htm">Ezekiel 15:1 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ezekiel/15-1.htm">Ezekiel 15:1 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ezekiel/15-1.htm">Ezekiel 15:1 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ezekiel/15-1.htm">Ezekiel 15:1 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ezekiel/15-1.htm">Ezekiel 15:1  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ezekiel/15-1.htm">Ezekiel 15:1 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ezekiel/15-1.htm">Ezekiel 15:1 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ezekiel/15-1.htm">Ezekiel 15:1 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ezekiel/15-1.htm">Ezekiel 15:1 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ezekiel/15-1.htm">OT Prophets: Ezekiel 15:1 The word of Yahweh came to me (Ezek.
