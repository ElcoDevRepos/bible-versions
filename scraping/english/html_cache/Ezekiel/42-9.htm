These chambers were likely used for various purposes, including storage and possibly living quarters for priests. The mention of "below" suggests a multi-level structure, indicating the complexity and grandeur of the temple design. This reflects the detailed architectural plans given by God, emphasizing the order and holiness required in worship.<p><b>was the entrance on the east side</b><br>The east side of the temple holds significant importance in biblical symbolism. The entrance facing east aligns with the direction from which God's glory returns to the temple in <a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2-4</a>. Eastward orientation is also seen in the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>) and the entrance of the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/27-13.htm">Exodus 27:13-16</a>), symbolizing the direction of divine presence and blessing. This entrance would have been a primary access point, highlighting the accessibility of God's house to His people.<p><b>as one enters them from the outer court</b><br>The outer court was the area accessible to the general population, including Gentiles, in the temple complex. This phrase indicates a transition from the outer court to the more restricted areas of the temple, symbolizing a movement from common to sacred space. The progression from the outer court to the inner areas reflects the increasing levels of holiness and the need for purification and reverence as one approaches God's presence. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to draw near to God with a pure heart (<a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.

&#8220;These chambers&#8221; are the three-story priestly rooms flanking the northern outer wall of the inner court (<a href="/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Saying they are &#8220;below&#8221; points to a tiered construction&#8212;upper, middle, and lower floors&#8212;showing ordered hierarchy much like the side rooms Solomon added to the first temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The lower placement also keeps the priests&#8217; workspaces distinct from the elevated temple platform (<a href="/ezekiel/40-49.htm">Ezekiel 40:49</a>), underscoring the increasing sanctity as one moves upward and inward (<a href="/ezekiel/43-12.htm">Ezekiel 43:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was the entrance</b><p>&#8226; A single, designated doorway signals that access to holy service is not casual but regulated (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-3</a>; <a href="/john/10-1.htm">John 10:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; The entrance&#8217;s existence affirms God&#8217;s provision of a literal, functional space for priestly ministry in the coming millennial temple (<a href="/ezekiel/40-38.htm">Ezekiel 40:38-46</a>; 44:15-16).<p>&#8226; By specifying the entrance, the text guards against improvisation; the priests must use the God-ordained path (<a href="/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On the east side</b><p>&#8226; The east in Scripture is often tied to God&#8217;s appearing and returning glory (<a href="/ezekiel/43-1.htm">Ezekiel 43:1-2</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-27.htm">Matthew 24:27</a>).<p>&#8226; The east gate was shut to common entry after the glory departed (<a href="/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1-2</a>), so an east-side entrance to the chambers links priestly service with the direction of divine visitation.<p>&#8226; Facing east also mirrors Eden&#8217;s entrance (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>), hinting that temple service anticipates restored fellowship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As one enters them from the outer court</b><p>&#8226; The phrase places the doorway at ground level of the outer court, the area accessible to worshipers (<a href="/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Priests step straight from public ministry into their reserved quarters, highlighting seamless movement between serving people and serving God (<a href="/2_chronicles/31-2.htm">2 Chronicles 31:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The progression&#8212;from outer court to chambers to inner court&#8212;illustrates increasing holiness (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>) and the mediating role of the priesthood (<a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/42-9.htm">Ezekiel 42:9</a> records a precise architectural detail: the lower-story priestly rooms have a single doorway on the east, opening directly from the outer court. This literal feature reveals God&#8217;s ordered design for worship: a clear, regulated access point, oriented toward the direction of His returning glory, enabling priests to move from serving the people to preparing for inner-court ministry. The verse, though brief, underlines holiness, order, and anticipation of restored fellowship in the future temple.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/42.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">From under these chambers.--</span>This verse as it stands in our version is scarcely intelligible. Translate: <span class= "ital">And from underneath it</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the wall just spoken of) <span class= "ital">these chambers.</span> The wall screened the lower part of the chambers so that to one looking from the east they appeared to rise out of it. Then a new clause begins: "The entrance was from the east, as one goeth to them from the outer court." It is perfectly clear that this does not refer to any entrance from the inner court, because it expressly says "as one goeth from the outer court." The object of the statement is probably to show that the access to the chambers was from the outer court by means of the walk already described, leading from the east, from the porch of the gate to the inner court.<p><a href="/context/ezekiel/42-10.htm" title="The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.">Ezekiel 42:10-12</a> describe briefly another chamber-building at the south of the "separate place," exactly like the one already described at the north. There is only need to notice some required changes in the translation.

Along this, as it stretched to the east, the building was situated. Some writers, by a slight alteration of the text, would change <span class= "ital">east</span> into <span class= "ital">south,</span> so that for "going toward the east" we should read <span class= "ital">on the south.</span> This makes the sense clearer, but is not necessary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The chambers were approached by an entry (in the text <span class="cmt_word">the entry</span>, this being a well-known and recognized part of the structure) which ran along the east side of the building, and led from the outer to the temple court. As this (the outer) court was higher than that (the temple), and could only be reached by steps, "the entry" is represented as lying under the chambers.
