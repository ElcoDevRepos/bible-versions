In the context of the temple vision, they represent the boundary between the profane world and the holy presence of God. This mirrors the thresholds in Solomon's Temple, emphasizing the sanctity and separation required in worship.<p><b>and the beveled windows</b><br>Beveled windows were designed to allow light while maintaining privacy and security. In biblical symbolism, light often represents divine revelation and truth. These windows suggest that the temple is a place where God's light and truth are present, yet it is protected from external corruption.<p><b>and the galleries all around with their three levels</b><br>The three levels of galleries indicate a structured and ordered design, reflecting the divine order and perfection. The number three often signifies completeness and divine wholeness in Scripture, as seen in the Trinity. This architectural feature underscores the completeness and sufficiency of God's dwelling place.<p><b>opposite the threshold,</b><br>Positioning opposite the threshold suggests a direct alignment with the entrance, symbolizing accessibility to God's presence for those who enter. This alignment can be seen as a metaphor for the direct relationship between God and His people, facilitated by the temple.<p><b>were overlaid with wood on all sides.</b><br>Wood overlay in the temple signifies durability and beauty, often associated with the cedars of Lebanon used in Solomon's Temple.

This thorough covering can be seen as a metaphor for God's all-encompassing care and the thoroughness of His salvation plan.<p><b>and the windows were covered.</b><br>Covered windows imply a controlled environment, where the light is managed and directed. This can symbolize the selective revelation of God&#8217;s truth, given to those who are within the covenant community.
