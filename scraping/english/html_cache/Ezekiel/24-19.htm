Ezekiel often acted out symbolic actions as part of his prophetic ministry, which was a common practice among prophets to convey God's messages. The people's inquiry suggests that Ezekiel's actions were striking enough to provoke curiosity and concern. This reflects the role of a prophet as a mediator between God and His people, tasked with delivering divine messages in ways that capture attention and provoke reflection.<p><b>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell us</b><br>The people's request for an explanation highlights their desire for understanding and clarity. This reflects a moment of engagement where the audience is actively seeking insight into God's will. It underscores the importance of interpretation in prophetic ministry, as the symbolic actions often required explanation to be fully understood. This also points to the responsibility of spiritual leaders to provide guidance and clarity to their communities.<p><b>what these things you are doing mean to us?&#8221;</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the personal and communal impact of Ezekiel's actions. The people are not just curious about the actions themselves but are concerned about their implications for their own lives. This reflects the broader context of Ezekiel's ministry, which was to address the spiritual and moral state of Israel during a time of impending judgment and exile. The question also suggests an awareness of the potential consequences of their actions and the need for repentance. This inquiry can be seen as a moment of introspection, where the people are prompted to consider their relationship with God and the covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, Ezekiel is the central figure in this passage.

Their question signals that the prophet&#8217;s dramatic obedience to God is getting under their skin. They had watched earlier sign-acts without changing (<a href="/ezekiel/12-9.htm">Ezekiel 12:9</a>), yet this time the sudden death of Ezekiel&#8217;s wife and his refusal to mourn (<a href="/ezekiel/24-15.htm">Ezekiel 24:15-18</a>) jolts them.<p>&#8226; God often uses a faithful life to break through hard hearts (<a href="/daniel/4-27.htm">Daniel 4:27</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The people&#8217;s curiosity shows that even rebels can be moved when confronted with unmistakable evidence that &#8220;a prophet has been among them&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Won&#8217;t you tell us</b><p>Their request acknowledges Ezekiel as the one who can interpret God&#8217;s message, much like King Zedekiah secretly sought Jeremiah&#8217;s counsel (<a href="/jeremiah/37-17.htm">Jeremiah 37:17</a>).

The rumor must have spread among the exiles of Tel-Abib that the prophet had lost the wife whom he loved so tenderly. They were ready, we may imagine, to offer their consolations and their sympathy. And, behold, he appears as one on whom no special sorrow had fallen. But that strange outward hardness had the effect which it was meant to have. It roused them to ask questions, and it was one of the cases in which the <span class="accented">prudens interrogatio</span>, which if not in itself the <span class="accented">dimidium seientiae</span>, at least prepared the way for it.
