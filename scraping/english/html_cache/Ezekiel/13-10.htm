In the historical context, Israel was often led astray by leaders who claimed to speak for God but instead promoted their own agendas. This echoes the warnings found in <a href="/deuteronomy/13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1-5</a> about false prophets. The spiritual leaders were supposed to guide the people in truth, but instead, they led them into idolatry and disobedience, which ultimately resulted in judgment and exile.<p><b>saying, &#8216;Peace,&#8217; when there is no peace</b><br>The false prophets proclaimed a false sense of security, assuring the people that all was well when, in reality, danger and judgment were imminent. This mirrors the situation in <a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14 and 8</a>:11, where prophets and priests falsely declared peace. The cultural context of the time was one of impending Babylonian invasion, yet these leaders denied the reality of the threat. This false assurance is a type of deception that contrasts with the true peace offered by Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), who provides genuine reconciliation with God.<p><b>and whitewashing any flimsy wall that is built</b><br>The imagery of whitewashing a flimsy wall suggests a superficial attempt to cover up or beautify something inherently weak and unstable. This metaphor is used to describe the false prophets' efforts to make their deceptive messages appear credible. In the New Testament, Jesus uses similar imagery in <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>, calling the Pharisees "whitewashed tombs," indicating hypocrisy. Archaeologically, whitewashing was a common practice to make structures appear clean and solid, but it did not strengthen the underlying structure.

One of the false prophets would build a wall, set up of his own device--some vision as a defence against the warnings of calamity; and his fellows would join in his deceit by covering this wall "with untempered mortar." The word is not the usual one for plaster, and indeed is used in this sense only in these verses and in <a href="/ezekiel/22-28.htm" title="And her prophets have daubed them with untempered mortar, seeing vanity, and divining lies to them, saying, Thus said the Lord GOD, when the LORD has not spoken.">Ezekiel 22:28</a>.

Calvin understands it of mortar mixed with sand and water only, the lime being left out. It is still a common practice in the East, as it has always been, to cover over their walls with stucco. In this case the other false prophets are represented as joining with the one who built the wall by covering over its weaknesses and defects with a fair-seeming plaster. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are like to white washed sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.">Matthew 23:27</a>; <a href="/acts/23-3.htm" title="Then said Paul to him, God shall smite you, you white washed wall: for sit you to judge me after the law, and command me to be smitten contrary to the law?">Acts 23:3</a>.)

He lulled men into a false security, and so narcotized their consciences. <span class="cmt_word">One built up a wall.</span> The imagery starts from the picture of a ruined city already implied in vers. 4 and 5, and expands into a parable in which we note a parallelism <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to Isaiah's picture of dishonest and unsafe building (<a href="/ezekiel/30-13.htm">Ezekiel 30:13</a>); <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to our Lord's parable at the end of the sermon on the mount (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24, 25</a>: <a href="/luke/6-47.htm">Luke 6:47-49</a>). <p>With an incisive sarcasm, Ezekiel describes what we should call the "scamp-work" of their spiritual building. They profess to be "repairers of the breach" (<a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>) in the walls of the spiritual Zion, and this is how they set about it. <span class="accented">One built up a wall.</span> This may point to a false prophet, but the "one" (Hebrew, "he") is probably indefinite, like the French <span class="accented">on</span>, equivalent to "some one." Some scheme is devised, an Egyptian alliance or the like, to which the people look for safety. It is, as in the margin of the Authorized Version, a "slight wall," such as was used for partition walls inside houses. They make it do duty as an outside wall (<span class="accented">kir</span> in ver. 12). It has no sure "footings," and materials and workmanship are alike defective. The false prophets would smear it over <span class="cmt_word">with untempered</span> mortar (the Hebrew word is found only here and in <a href="/ezekiel/22-28.htm">Ezekiel 22:28</a>, and is probably an example of Ezekiel's acquaintance with the technical vocabulary of his time) - with a stucco or plaster, which is hardly better than whitewash (compare the "whitened" or plastered wall or sepulchre of <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>; <a href="/luke/11-44.htm">Luke 11:44</a>; <a href="/acts/23-3.htm">Acts 23:3</a>), used to hide its detects and give it a semblance of solidity.
