In the prophetic books, this formula often introduces a direct revelation from God, underscoring the seriousness and certainty of the prophecy. It reflects the role of prophets as God's spokespersons, delivering messages that are not their own but from the Lord.<p><b>At the end of forty years:</b><br>The number forty is significant in biblical literature, often symbolizing a period of testing, trial, or judgment. Examples include the forty years the Israelites spent in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>) and the forty days Jesus fasted in the desert (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). Here, it indicates a defined period of judgment for Egypt, suggesting a complete cycle of divine discipline.<p><b>I will gather the Egyptians from the nations:</b><br>This phrase indicates a future restoration for Egypt after a period of dispersion. The gathering of a scattered people is a common theme in prophetic literature, often associated with God's mercy and faithfulness. It parallels the promises made to Israel regarding their own restoration (<a href="/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>). This gathering signifies a reversal of judgment and a return to a semblance of former stability.<p><b>to which they were scattered:</b><br>The scattering of the Egyptians implies a significant upheaval, likely due to conquest or exile. Historically, Egypt faced invasions and periods of foreign domination, such as by the Assyrians and later the Babylonians. This scattering reflects the broader biblical theme of dispersion as a consequence of divine judgment, similar to the exile experienced by Israel and Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
