It is a common prophetic formula used to assert that the message is directly from God, underscoring the seriousness and certainty of the forthcoming declaration.<p><b>Surely in My burning zeal I have spoken:</b><br>God's "burning zeal" reflects His passionate commitment to His people and His land. This zeal is often associated with divine judgment and protection, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a> and <a href="/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14</a>. It indicates God's intense emotional response to the injustices committed against Israel.<p><b>Against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom:</b><br>The nations and Edom are singled out for their actions against Israel. Historically, Edom, descendants of Esau, had a longstanding enmity with Israel, descendants of Jacob. This animosity is documented in passages like <a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10-14</a> and <a href="/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>. The "rest of the nations" likely refers to surrounding peoples who also opposed Israel.<p><b>Who took My land as their own possession:</b><br>The land is described as "My land," highlighting God's ownership and covenantal promise to Israel (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The nations' appropriation of the land is seen as a direct affront to God's sovereignty and His covenant with Israel.<p><b>With wholehearted joy and utter contempt:</b><br>This phrase indicates the malicious intent and pleasure the nations, particularly Edom, took in seizing the land. Their actions were not only opportunistic but also disdainful, reflecting a deep-seated animosity towards Israel. This attitude is condemned in scriptures like <a href="/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a> and <a href="/lamentations/4-21.htm">Lamentations 4:21-22</a>.<p><b>So that its pastureland became plunder:</b><br>The reference to "pastureland" being plundered underscores the devastation and exploitation of the land's resources. This imagery is often used to depict the consequences of foreign invasion and occupation, as seen in <a href="/joel/1-6.htm">Joel 1:6-7</a>.
