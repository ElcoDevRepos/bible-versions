"My hill" likely refers to Mount Zion, a central place of worship and the symbolic dwelling place of God in Jerusalem. Historically, Mount Zion was the site of the Temple, representing God's presence among His people. The promise of making the people and the land a blessing echoes the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised to make Abraham's descendants a blessing to all nations (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>). This transformation is not just physical but spiritual, indicating a renewal and restoration of Israel. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of the Church, where believers are called to be a blessing to the world through the indwelling presence of Christ.<p><b>I will send down showers in season&#8212;showers of blessing.</b><br>The imagery of "showers in season" signifies God's provision and favor. In an agrarian society like ancient Israel, timely rain was crucial for crops and survival, symbolizing God's sustenance and care. The "showers of blessing" suggest an abundance of divine favor, not just in material terms but also spiritually. This can be connected to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23-29</a> and fulfilled in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, where God's Spirit is poured out on all people. The showers also point to the eschatological hope of a future time when God's blessings will be fully realized in His kingdom. This phrase reassures believers of God's faithfulness to provide and nurture His people, both physically and spiritually.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, promising blessings to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of Ezekiel's prophecy, representing God's chosen people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/my_hill.htm">My Hill</a></b><br>Refers to Mount Zion, symbolizing God's holy presence and the center of His kingdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/showers_of_blessing.htm">Showers of Blessing</a></b><br>A metaphor for God's abundant provision and favor.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_promise_of_blessing.htm">God's Promise of Blessing</a></b><br>God is faithful to His promises, and His blessings are abundant and timely.

The centre of the old theocracy is always spoken of in Scripture as also the centre from which goes forth the new covenant of salvation, and this was historically fulfilled in the coming of Christ and the cradling of His Church in the Jewish Church.
