It underscores the distinction between God and man, highlighting the humility and frailty of human nature. This title is also significant in the New Testament, where Jesus frequently refers to Himself as the "Son of Man," linking His mission to the prophetic tradition and emphasizing His role as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity.<p><b>He added,</b><br>The phrase indicates a continuation of God's direct communication with Ezekiel. It suggests the importance of the message that follows, as God is personally ensuring that Ezekiel understands the gravity and significance of His words. This direct divine communication is a hallmark of prophetic literature, where God often speaks directly to His chosen messengers.<p><b>listen carefully to all the words I speak to you,</b><br>This command emphasizes the importance of attentiveness and obedience to God's word. In the historical context, prophets were expected to convey God's messages accurately and faithfully. Listening carefully implies a deep, active engagement with God's instructions, which is crucial for Ezekiel's role as a prophet. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of the importance of hearing and obeying God's word, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>, where the Shema calls for Israel to hear and obey.<p><b>and take them to heart.</b><br>Taking God's words to heart implies internalizing and fully embracing the message. It goes beyond mere intellectual understanding to a deep, personal commitment to live out the divine instructions. This phrase highlights the necessity of transformation and alignment with God's will, a theme echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>, where the psalmist treasures God's word in his heart to avoid sin. It also foreshadows the New Covenant promise in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, where God writes His law on the hearts of His people, indicating a profound internalization and personal relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, instructing Ezekiel on how to receive His words.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The historical context in which Ezekiel prophesied, where the Israelites were in captivity in Babylon.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of Ezekiel's prophecies, who were in need of repentance and restoration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/vision_of_god.htm">Vision of God</a></b><br>The broader context of Ezekiel's calling and commissioning, where he receives visions and instructions from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/listening_with_intent.htm">Listening with Intent</a></b><br>Just as Ezekiel was instructed to listen carefully, believers are called to approach God's word with attentiveness and a readiness to understand.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/internalizing_god's_word.htm">Internalizing God's Word</a></b><br>The phrase "take them to heart" suggests a deep internalization of God's message, encouraging believers to meditate on and cherish Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_instructions.htm">Obedience to God's Instructions</a></b><br>Ezekiel's role as a prophet required obedience to God's words, reminding us of the importance of aligning our actions with God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_heart_in_faith.htm">The Role of the Heart in Faith</a></b><br>The heart is central to our relationship with God, serving as the seat of our emotions, will, and understanding.

Like Paul later testifies he declared &#8220;the whole counsel of God&#8221; (<a href="/acts/20-27.htm">Acts 20:27</a>), Ezekiel is commissioned to receive and relay every syllable.<p>&#8226; Selective obedience led to Israel&#8217;s earlier downfall (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22&#8211;23</a>). This reminder safeguards Ezekiel from the temptation to soften unpopular truths about judgment and restoration (<a href="/ezekiel/3-11.htm">Ezekiel 3:11</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s speech is the standard; none of it is optional because &#8220;every word of God is flawless&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and take them to heart</b><p>&#8226; Internalization precedes proclamation. Jeremiah had a similar mandate: God&#8217;s words had to be within him &#8220;like a burning fire&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Heart-level reception transforms the messenger, ensuring authenticity and courage when confronting a &#8220;rebellious house&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/3-7.htm">Ezekiel 3:7&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a> reminds us the word penetrates heart and spirit; Ezekiel must first allow that penetration before he confronts others.<p>&#8226; True ministry flows from a heart shaped by Scripture: Paul urges Timothy, &#8220;Pay close attention to yourself and to the teaching&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/4-16.htm">1 Timothy 4:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/3-10.htm">Ezekiel 3:10</a> shows the prophet&#8217;s essential posture: a mere man summoned by God, commanded to listen intently, receive every word without omission, and let those words sink deeply into his heart. Only then can he faithfully deliver God&#8217;s message to a resistant people. The verse models how every believer is to relate to Scripture&#8212;acknowledging its divine origin, listening carefully, embracing the whole counsel, and allowing it to transform the inner life before sharing it with the world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All my words,</span> etc. The stress lies on the first word. The prophet was not to pick and choose out of the message, but was to deliver "all the counsel of God" (<a href="/acts/20-27.htm">Acts 20:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Take into thine heart,</span> etc. An inverted order of the two commands would, perhaps, have seemed more natural. What we actually find, however, is sufficiently suggestive. The message of Jehovah is first received into the inner depths of the soul, but in that stage it is vague, undefined, incommunicable. It needs to be clothed in articulate speech before it can be heard with the mental ear and passed on to others. The mouth speaks out of the fulness of the heart. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/3-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of man,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1429;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He added,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1430;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
