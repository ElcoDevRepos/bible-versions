The ordinances refer to the specific commands given by God to His people, which were meant to guide their moral and spiritual conduct. This rejection is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where Israel often turned away from God's commands, as seen in passages like <a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-13</a>. The rejection of divine ordinances signifies a deeper spiritual rebellion and a refusal to acknowledge God's authority.<p><b>refusing to walk in My statutes</b><br>Walking in God's statutes implies living according to His decrees and commands. The refusal to do so indicates a deliberate choice to ignore God's guidance. This phrase echoes the covenantal relationship established at Sinai, where the Israelites agreed to follow God's laws (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-8</a>). The failure to walk in these statutes often led to divine judgment, as seen in the Babylonian exile, which serves as a historical backdrop for Ezekiel's prophecies.<p><b>and profaning My Sabbaths</b><br>The Sabbath was a sign of the covenant between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>). Profaning the Sabbath meant treating it as ordinary, thus disregarding its sanctity and the rest it symbolized. This violation was not just a legal infraction but a spiritual one, reflecting a lack of reverence for God. <a href="/nehemiah/13-17.htm">Nehemiah 13:17-18</a> also addresses the issue of Sabbath desecration, showing its importance in maintaining a holy relationship with God.<p><b>for their hearts continually went after their idols</b><br>Idolatry was a significant issue for Israel, often leading them away from exclusive worship of Yahweh. The heart, in biblical terms, represents the center of will and desire. The continual pursuit of idols indicates a deep-seated spiritual adultery, as seen in <a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>. This idolatry was not just physical but also spiritual, as it involved placing trust and devotion in something other than God. The prophets frequently warned against this, as it led to the nation's downfall and exile.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were in rebellion against Him, leading to their exile.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon as a consequence of their disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_ordinances_and_statutes.htm">God's Ordinances and Statutes</a></b><br>The laws and commands given by God to guide the Israelites in righteous living.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry.htm">Idolatry</a></b><br>The worship of idols, which was a significant sin among the Israelites, leading them away from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>God's ordinances and statutes are given for our benefit and protection.

When God&#8217;s law is sidelined, chaos follows&#8212;then and now.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Refusing to walk in My statutes</b><p>The issue was not ignorance but stubborn refusal (<a href="/jeremiah/7-23.htm">Jeremiah 7:23-24</a>). <a href="/bsb/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> promised blessing &#8220;if you walk in My statutes,&#8221; yet the people chose self-rule, leading to exile (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14-17</a>).

The New Testament echoes the danger: &#8220;Little children, keep yourselves from idols&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/5-21.htm">1 John 5:21</a>).
