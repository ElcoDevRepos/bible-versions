In the prophetic tradition, such expressions are often used to convey the seriousness of God's impending judgment. The term "son of man" is a title frequently used for Ezekiel, emphasizing his humanity and role as a representative of the people. This phrase underscores the emotional weight of the message Ezekiel is to deliver, reflecting the gravity of the situation facing Israel.<p><b>for the sword is wielded against My people</b><br>The "sword" symbolizes impending judgment and destruction, often associated with warfare and divine retribution. In this context, it represents the Babylonian army, which God is using as an instrument of judgment against Israel. The phrase "My people" highlights the covenant relationship between God and Israel, emphasizing the tragedy of the situation as it is God's own chosen people who are facing judgment due to their disobedience.<p><b>it is against all the princes of Israel!</b><br>The "princes of Israel" refers to the leaders and rulers of the nation, who are held accountable for leading the people astray. This judgment is not only against the common people but specifically targets those in positions of authority who have failed in their responsibilities. This reflects a common biblical theme where leaders are judged more harshly due to their influence and the expectations placed upon them.<p><b>They are tossed to the sword with My people</b><br>The imagery of being "tossed to the sword" suggests a sense of inevitability and helplessness in the face of judgment. It indicates that both the leaders and the people will suffer the consequences of their collective disobedience. This phrase emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the judgment, affecting all levels of society.<p><b>therefore strike your thigh</b><br>Striking the thigh is an expression of intense grief and distress in ancient Near Eastern cultures. It is a physical manifestation of the emotional turmoil that accompanies the realization of impending doom. This action serves as a symbolic gesture of mourning and lamentation, reinforcing the seriousness of the message Ezekiel is delivering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.
