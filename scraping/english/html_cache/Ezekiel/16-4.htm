In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the birth of a child was a significant event, often accompanied by specific rituals. The "day of your birth" symbolizes the beginning of Israel as a nation, chosen by God but initially in a state of vulnerability and neglect.<p><b>your cord was not cut</b><br>The cutting of the umbilical cord is a basic and essential part of childbirth, signifying the beginning of independent life. In this context, it represents the lack of care and attention given to Jerusalem at its inception. Spiritually, it suggests that Israel was not yet separated from its pagan origins and influences.<p><b>nor were you washed with water for cleansing</b><br>Washing a newborn was a customary practice to cleanse and purify the child. The absence of this act symbolizes the impurity and sinfulness of Jerusalem at its beginning. Biblically, water often represents purification and renewal, as seen in baptism (<a href="/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>).<p><b>You were not rubbed with salt</b><br>Rubbing a newborn with salt was an ancient practice believed to promote health and strength. The lack of this treatment indicates neglect and a lack of nurturing care. Salt in the Bible can symbolize preservation and covenant (<a href="/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>), suggesting that Jerusalem was initially without divine protection or covenantal relationship.<p><b>or wrapped in cloths</b><br>Swaddling a baby was a sign of care and protection. The absence of swaddling cloths implies abandonment and exposure to the elements. This imagery highlights Jerusalem's initial state of helplessness and need for divine intervention. It contrasts with the care God later provides, as seen in His covenantal promises (<a href="/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

The day Israel emerged as a nation&#8212;rescued from slavery in Egypt and destined for covenant life&#8212;was a genuine &#8220;birthday.&#8221; Yet the Lord describes it as lonely and forsaken. <a href="/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4-6</a> shows the high calling of that birth, while <a href="/ezekiel/16-3.htm">Ezekiel 16:3</a> reminds us the people&#8217;s ancestry was rooted in pagan lands (&#8220;your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite&#8221;). From the start, Israel had no natural claim to favor; every blessing would have to come from the Lord alone (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; The image sets the scene: a helpless infant needing intervention.<p>&#8226; It exposes human inability and divine initiative, much like <a href="/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6</a> says that &#8220;while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your cord was not cut</b><p>An uncut umbilical cord leaves an infant tethered to a situation of certain death. Spiritually, Israel had no life of her own, still entangled in idolatry and slavery. <a href="/ezekiel/16-5.htm">Ezekiel 16:5</a> adds that &#8220;no eye pitied you,&#8221; underscoring utter abandonment.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1-3</a> recalls God teaching Israel to walk, picking her up in His arms.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/22-9.htm">Psalm 22:9-10</a> describes the Lord as midwife, emphasizing that only God can truly &#8220;cut the cord&#8221; and grant independent life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nor were you washed with water for cleansing</b><p>A newborn covered in blood must be washed; left unwashed, infection sets in. Likewise, Israel carried the stain of Egypt&#8217;s idols (<a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Later in this same chapter, <a href="/ezekiel/16-9.htm">Ezekiel 16:9</a> says, &#8220;Then I bathed you with water, rinsed off your blood, and anointed you with oil,&#8221; showing that God Himself supplied the cleansing.<p>&#8226; This anticipates <a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25</a>&#8212;&#8220;I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean&#8221;&#8212;and foreshadows the washing &#8220;of regeneration&#8221; in <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>.<p>Bullet points for application:<p>&#8211; Cleansing is God&#8217;s gracious act.<p>&#8211; Refusal to be washed leaves a soul exposed to corruption (<a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You were not rubbed with salt</b><p>In the ancient Near East, salt was rubbed on infants to disinfect, strengthen skin, and symbolize dedication. Israel, however, lacked this mark of covenant care.<p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a> commands, &#8220;You shall season all your grain offerings with salt&#8230; the salt of the covenant of your God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/13-5.htm">2 Chronicles 13:5</a> speaks of &#8220;a covenant of salt&#8221; given to David, underlining permanence.<p>&#8226; Without salt, Israel showed no lasting stability or covenant identity&#8212;she was flavorless, like &#8220;salt that has lost its savor&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or wrapped in cloths</b><p>Swaddling secures a child, providing warmth and protection. The absence of swaddling pictures a baby flailing, exposed, and unnoticed&#8212;exactly how Jerusalem stood before God found her.<p>&#8226; Contrast <a href="/luke/2-7.htm">Luke 2:7</a>, where the newborn Messiah is &#8220;wrapped in swaddling cloths,&#8221; receiving the care Israel never gave her own infants (cf. <a href="/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/38-9.htm">Job 38:9</a> poetically shows God &#8220;swaddling&#8221; the newborn earth with clouds, hinting that only the Creator can grant true security.<p>Practical insights:<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s people are safest when bound by His instructions (<a href="/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3-4</a>).<p>&#8211; Neglect of God&#8217;s covering leads to vulnerability and shame (<a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/16-4.htm">Ezekiel 16:4</a> paints a vivid, literal picture of Israel as an abandoned newborn&#8212;cord uncut, body unwashed, skin unsalted, limbs unswaddled. Each neglected act underscores the nation&#8217;s helplessness and highlights God&#8217;s forthcoming grace. Left to herself, Israel would have perished, but the Lord intervened, granting life, cleansing, covenant salt, and protective covering. The verse therefore magnifies human need and divine mercy, inviting every reader to recognize personal helplessness and to rejoice in the God who lovingly rescues, cleanses, and secures His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Washed in water to supple thee.</span>--The various particulars of this and the following verse describe a child cast out into the field immediately upon its birth, unpitied by any one, and in a condition in which it must soon have perished. Neither the text nor the margin seems to have hit upon the sense of the word translated "to supple," the probable meaning of which is "to cleanse." The rubbing of the body of the new-born infant with salt, a custom still prevailing in some parts of the east, probably had a symbolical, as well as a supposed physical effect; and is recommended for the latter reason by Galen (<span class= "ital">De Sanit. </span>i. 7). The wrapping the body tightly in swaddling-bands (Comp. <a href="/luke/2-7.htm" title="And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.">Luke 2:7</a>) is still common, even in Italy. The time here referred to in the life of Israel is that in which it passed from its embryonic state in the family of the patriarchs to a nation in the bondage of Egypt. Despised, oppressed, and enslaved, no other people ever became a nation under such circumstances. Humanly speaking, national life was an impossibility for them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As for thy nativity,</span> etc. We ask, as we interpret the parable, of what period in the history of Israel Ezekiel speaks. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are ignored by him, and he starts from a time of misery and shame. It is obvious that the only period which corresponds to this is that of the sojourn of Israel as an oppressed and degraded people in the land of Goshen. He paints, with a Dantesque minuteness, the picture of a child just born, abandoned by its mother and neglected by all others from the very moment of its birth. It lies unwashed and foul to look upon. No woman's care does for it the commonest offices of motherhood. <span class="cmt_word">For to supple</span>, read, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">to cleanse.</span> The practice still met with in the East of rubbing the newborn child with salt may have rested partly on sanitary grounds (Jerome, <span class="accented">in loc.</span> Galen, 'De San.,' 1:7), partly on its symbolic meaning (<a href="/numbers/18-19.htm">Numbers 18:19</a>). When this was done, the child was wrapt in swaddling clothes (<a href="/luke/2-7.htm">Luke 2:7</a>), but these too were wanting in the picture which Ezekiel draws. The whole scene may have been painted from the life. Such a birth may well have been witnessed during the march of the exiles, when the brutality of their Chaldean drivers allowed no halt, and the child was left to perish of neglect, and the thought may then have flashed across Ezekiel's mind that the pity which he felt for the deserted infant was a faint shadow of that which Jehovah had felt for Israel in the degradation of their heathen bondage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/16-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On the day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1448;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
