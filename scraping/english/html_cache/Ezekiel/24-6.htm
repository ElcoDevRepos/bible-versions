In the context of Ezekiel, God often speaks directly to convey His judgments and plans. This reflects the prophetic tradition where God communicates His will through chosen messengers.<p><b>&#8216;Woe to the city of bloodshed:</b><br>The "city of bloodshed" refers to Jerusalem, known for its violence and idolatry. The term "woe" is a lamentation and a pronouncement of impending doom. This echoes earlier prophetic warnings found in books like Isaiah and Jeremiah, where Jerusalem's sins are condemned. The city's history of violence, including the shedding of innocent blood, is a central theme in its judgment.<p><b>to the pot now rusted, whose rust will not come off!:</b><br>The imagery of a rusted pot symbolizes the corruption and impurity of Jerusalem. In ancient times, a pot was a common household item, and rust would render it useless. The rust that "will not come off" signifies the deep-seated sin and moral decay that cannot be cleansed. This metaphor is consistent with other prophetic imagery, such as Jeremiah's vision of the marred potter's vessel, representing Israel's spiritual state.<p><b>Empty it piece by piece;</b><br>This phrase suggests a methodical and complete judgment. The city will be dismantled, and its people will be taken away in stages. This reflects the historical sieges of Jerusalem, particularly the Babylonian conquest, where the city was gradually stripped of its inhabitants and treasures. The process of emptying piece by piece indicates thoroughness in God's judgment.<p><b>cast no lots for its contents:</b><br>In ancient times, casting lots was a method of decision-making or dividing spoils. The instruction to "cast no lots" implies that the destruction and desolation of Jerusalem will be so complete that there will be nothing left to divide. This can be seen as a fulfillment of prophecies where Jerusalem's wealth and people are taken without the usual procedures of war, highlighting the totality of divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God, Ezekiel is the one delivering God's message to the people of Israel.

A new feature, that of the rust on the cauldron, is also introduced. A somewhat similar figure may be found in <a href="/isaiah/4-4.htm" title="When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the middle thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.">Isaiah 4:4</a>, but with the difference that Ezekiel, as usual, goes much more into minute details.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">Scum.</span>--This word, which occurs five times in these verses (<a href="/ezekiel/24-6.htm" title="Why thus said the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall on it.">Ezekiel 24:6</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/24-11.htm" title="Then set it empty on the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.">Ezekiel 24:11-12</a>), is found nowhere else. Interpreters are agreed in the correctness of the old Greek version of it, <span class= "ital">rust. </span>The thought is, that not only the inhabitants of the city are wicked, but that this wickedness is so great that the city itself (represented by the cauldron) is, as it were, corroded with rust. It is therefore to be utterly destroyed, "brought out piece by piece" (see <a href="/2_kings/25-10.htm" title="And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about.">2Kings 25:10</a>); no lot is to fall upon it to make a discrimination, since nothing is to be spared.

The word is not found elsewhere. The Authorized Version follows the Vulgate. Keil and the Revised Version give "rust." As the cauldron was of brass (Ver. 11), this must have been the verdigris which was eating into the metal, and which even the blazing fire could not get rid cf. The pieces that are to be brought out are the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who are to be carried into exile. There was to be "no lot cast," as was often done with prisoners of war, taking every tenth man (decimating) of the captives for death or exile (comp. <a href="/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>).
