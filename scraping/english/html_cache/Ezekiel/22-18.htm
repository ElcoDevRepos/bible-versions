It is used over 90 times in the book, highlighting the contrast between the divine message and the human messenger. The term is also significant in the New Testament, where Jesus frequently refers to Himself as the "Son of Man," indicating His role as the representative of humanity and His fulfillment of prophetic roles.<p><b>the house of Israel has become dross to Me</b><br>"Dross" refers to the impurities that are separated from metals during the refining process. Here, God is expressing His disappointment with Israel, indicating that they have become impure and worthless in their current state. This imagery of refining is used throughout the Bible to describe God's judgment and purification process (e.g., <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>). Historically, Israel had turned away from God, engaging in idolatry and injustice, which led to their spiritual corruption.<p><b>All of them are copper, tin, iron, and lead inside the furnace</b><br>These metals, while valuable in certain contexts, are considered inferior to silver and gold. The mention of a furnace suggests a process of testing and purification. In ancient metallurgy, a furnace was used to refine metals, symbolizing God's judgment and the trials Israel would face. The imagery indicates that the people of Israel, once precious, have become like these lesser metals, needing purification.<p><b>they are but the dross of silver</b><br>Silver is often associated with purity and value in the Bible. By stating that Israel is the "dross of silver," God is emphasizing that they have fallen from their intended state of purity and worth. This phrase underscores the severity of Israel's spiritual decline. The refining process is a metaphor for God's judgment, where impurities are removed to restore purity. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22-25</a>, where God promises to purge away the dross and restore righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_israel.htm">House of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Israel, who are being compared to dross, the impurities removed during the refining of metals.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/dross.htm">Dross</a></b><br>The impurities or waste material that is separated from metals during the refining process, symbolizing the moral and spiritual corruption of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/furnace.htm">Furnace</a></b><br>Represents the process of judgment and purification that God is using to refine His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this passage, expressing His disappointment and judgment towards Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_spiritual_impurities.htm">Understanding Spiritual Impurities</a></b><br>Just as dross is the unwanted material in metal, sin and disobedience are impurities in our spiritual lives.

The peculiar appropriateness of this figure has been often noted in the fact that the completion of the process of refining silver in the furnace was determined by the parting of the floating dross and the reflection of the image of the refiner from its molten surface. This figure, while setting forth the punishment of Israel, shows clearly that this punishment was for the purpose of purification.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The house of Israel is to me become dross</span>, etc. A new parable, based upon <a href="/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22, 23</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/6.htm">Jeremiah 6</a>:80, begins, and is carried out with considerable fullness.

And this was to be the issue of the "fiery trial" through which Jerusalem and its inhabitants were to pass. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/22-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of man,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1429;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the house</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#234;&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has become</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">dross to Me.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1505;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1490;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;s&#238;&#7713;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
