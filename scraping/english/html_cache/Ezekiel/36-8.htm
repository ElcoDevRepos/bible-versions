The mountains symbolize the entire land, which holds significant historical and spiritual importance for the Israelites. The land is central to God's covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>) and is a recurring theme in the promises of restoration throughout the Old Testament. The mountains of Israel are also a geographical reality, forming a central spine through the country, and have been the site of many biblical events.<p><b>will produce branches and bear fruit</b><br>This imagery of branches and fruit signifies fertility and abundance, contrasting with the desolation described earlier in Ezekiel. It reflects the blessings of God upon the land, reminiscent of the promises in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-11.htm">Deuteronomy 28:11-12</a>. The agricultural metaphor is common in Scripture, symbolizing spiritual renewal and divine favor. This promise of productivity is both literal, concerning the land's physical restoration, and metaphorical, indicating spiritual revival.<p><b>for My people Israel,</b><br>The phrase emphasizes God's covenant relationship with Israel. Despite their previous disobedience and exile, God remains committed to His people. This reflects the theme of divine faithfulness found throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>. The restoration of the land is directly linked to the restoration of the people, underscoring the inseparable bond between Israel and their God-given inheritance.<p><b>for they will soon come home.</b><br>This prophecy foretells the return of the Israelites from exile, a central theme in Ezekiel and other prophetic books like Isaiah and Jeremiah. Historically, this was fulfilled when the exiles returned from Babylon under leaders like Zerubbabel and Ezra. Theologically, it points to God's redemptive plan and foreshadows the ultimate gathering of His people, as seen in eschatological passages like <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-3</a>. The return home is not just a physical relocation but a spiritual restoration to a right relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountains_of_israel.htm">Mountains of Israel</a></b><br>Symbolic of the land of Israel, representing the physical and spiritual restoration of the nation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/people_of_israel.htm">People of Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are promised restoration and return to their homeland.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this passage, promising restoration and blessing to His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/restoration.htm">Restoration</a></b><br>The event of Israel's return to their land and the renewal of their covenant relationship with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fruitfulness.htm">Fruitfulness</a></b><br>A metaphor for the blessings and prosperity that will come upon Israel as they are restored.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God's promises are sure and steadfast.

Because God&#8217;s Word is true in every detail, these mountains will experience literal transformation, signaling to the watching world that He keeps His promises (<a href="/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will produce branches</b><p>New shoots picture fresh life springing from soil once defiled by idolatry and invasion. <a href="/isaiah/27-6.htm">Isaiah 27:6</a> proclaims, &#8220;Israel will bud and blossom and fill the whole world with fruit,&#8221; and <a href="/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22</a> depicts the LORD planting a tender sprig that becomes a noble cedar.

Yet the promise looks beyond that first wave toward a worldwide regathering (<a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11&#8211;12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>). <a href="/ezekiel/20-41.htm">Ezekiel 20:41&#8211;42</a> speaks of God being &#8220;proved holy&#8221; when He brings His people back.

Keil and Plumptre make the subject of the verb the material blessings in which Israel's prosperity is depicted as consisting, viz. the foliage and fruit her mountains were soon to bear for the people of Jehovah. The majority of expositors believe the subject to be the people whose return from exile was in this way declared to be approaching. Nor is there any reason why Ezekiel should not have represented the return from exile as an event soon to take place, since of the seventy years of captivity predicted by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>) at least twenty years had passed, if its commencement be dated from the fourth year of Jehoiakim (<a href="/ezekiel/33-21.htm">Ezekiel 33:21</a>);
