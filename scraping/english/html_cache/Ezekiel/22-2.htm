It underscores the distinction between the divine and the human, highlighting Ezekiel's position as a mediator. This title is also significant in the New Testament, where Jesus frequently refers to Himself as the "Son of Man," indicating His role as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity.<p><b>will you judge her?</b><br>The act of judging here refers to the role of the prophet in declaring God's righteous standards and the consequences of failing to meet them. In the context of Ezekiel, this judgment is directed towards Jerusalem, which had fallen into deep moral and spiritual corruption. The question posed is rhetorical, emphasizing the inevitability of judgment due to the city's persistent sinfulness. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's justice, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>Will you pass judgment on the city of bloodshed?</b><br>The "city of bloodshed" refers to Jerusalem, which had become notorious for violence, idolatry, and injustice. This phrase highlights the severity of the city's sins, particularly the shedding of innocent blood, which is a grave offense in the eyes of God. The historical context includes the rampant social injustices and the failure of the leaders to uphold God's laws. This imagery is echoed in other scriptures, such as Nahum's description of Nineveh and Jesus' lament over Jerusalem in the Gospels.<p><b>Then confront her with all her abominations</b><br>The term "abominations" refers to the detestable practices that had become prevalent in Jerusalem, including idolatry, corruption, and moral decay. The prophet's role is to confront and expose these sins, calling the people to repentance. This confrontation is not merely an accusation but an invitation to return to covenant faithfulness. The concept of abominations is consistent with the Levitical laws, where certain practices are deemed abhorrent to God. This call to confront sin is a precursor to the New Testament message of repentance and redemption through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.
