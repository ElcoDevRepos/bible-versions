In the prophetic books, this introduction is common, underscoring that the words are not merely human opinion but a direct communication from God. It reflects the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces, as seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a> and <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>.<p><b>I will spread My net over you:</b><br>The imagery of a net is often used in the Bible to signify capture or entrapment, as seen in <a href="/job/19-6.htm">Job 19:6</a> and <a href="/lamentations/1-13.htm">Lamentations 1:13</a>. In the context of Ezekiel, it symbolizes God's judgment and the inescapability of His decrees. The net metaphor is particularly poignant given the fishing culture of the ancient Near East, where nets were a primary tool for capturing fish, illustrating the certainty and thoroughness of God's judgment.<p><b>with a company of many peoples:</b><br>This phrase indicates that God will use various nations as instruments of His judgment. Historically, this reflects the alliances and coalitions that were common in ancient warfare. It also points to the Babylonian Empire's practice of employing troops from conquered peoples, as seen in the accounts of Nebuchadnezzar's campaigns. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God using foreign nations to accomplish His purposes, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a> with Assyria.<p><b>and they will draw you up in My net:</b><br>The act of drawing up in a net suggests a complete and unavoidable capture, akin to a fisherman pulling in a catch. This reflects the certainty of Pharaoh's downfall and Egypt's defeat, as prophesied by Ezekiel. The imagery connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's sovereignty over nations, as seen in <a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>, where God is described as having authority over the kingdoms of men. The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and deliverance themes found in the New Testament, where Christ's work is seen as a means of drawing people to God, as in <a href="/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Whenever Scripture prefaces a statement this way, it announces that what follows is not human speculation but divine decree (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p>- It reminds readers that God alone sets the agenda of history (<a href="/daniel/4-35.htm">Daniel 4:35</a>) and that His word never returns empty (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>- Because it is the Lord GOD speaking, the promise of judgment is as certain as His character is unchanging (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will spread My net over you</b><p>- God pictures Himself as the hunter or fisherman who personally casts the net. The imagery stresses control: Pharaoh will have no chance to escape (<a href="/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>; 17:20).<p>- The possessive &#8220;My&#8221; underlines that the judgment belongs to God, not to random fate or merely to geopolitics (<a href="/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>).<p>- Nets in Scripture often symbolize sudden, inescapable justice (<a href="/lamentations/1-13.htm">Lamentations 1:13</a>; <a href="/amos/3-5.htm">Amos 3:5</a>), so Egypt&#8217;s downfall will be both swift and certain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with a company of many peoples</b><p>- God employs a coalition of nations&#8212;historically led by Babylon (<a href="/ezekiel/29-19.htm">Ezekiel 29:19</a>; 30:10)&#8212;to execute His verdict.<p>- This fulfills earlier prophecies that He would &#8220;summon all the families of the north&#8221; for judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>) and shows that even pagan armies serve His larger purposes (<a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5&#8211;7</a>).<p>- The phrase also foreshadows the broader biblical principle that God can marshal multiple nations to humble one empire (<a href="/revelation/17-16.htm">Revelation 17:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they will draw you up in My net</b><p>- The invaders become the hands that pull the net tight.
