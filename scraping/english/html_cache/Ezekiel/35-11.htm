The use of "as surely as I live" is a divine oath, underscoring the seriousness and inevitability of the coming judgment. This is a common expression in prophetic literature, highlighting God's eternal nature and His sovereign power to fulfill His promises. It reflects the covenantal relationship between God and His people, where His declarations are as unchanging as His existence.<p><b>I will treat you according to the anger and jealousy you showed in your hatred against them,</b><br>This part of the verse addresses the Edomites' hostility towards Israel. Historically, Edom, descended from Esau, harbored longstanding enmity against Israel, descended from Jacob. This animosity is documented in various biblical passages, such as Obadiah and <a href="/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>. The "anger and jealousy" refer to Edom's malicious actions during Israel's times of distress, particularly during the Babylonian conquest. God's response is a measure-for-measure retribution, a common biblical theme where divine justice mirrors the actions of the offenders.<p><b>and I will make Myself known among them when I judge you.</b><br>Here, God promises that His judgment on Edom will reveal His power and justice to Israel and the surrounding nations. This revelation serves a dual purpose: it vindicates Israel and demonstrates God's sovereignty and righteousness. The phrase "make Myself known" is significant in biblical theology, often associated with God's self-revelation through acts of salvation or judgment. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a>, where God's actions in Egypt made His identity known. The judgment on Edom is not only punitive but also revelatory, affirming God's covenantal faithfulness to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
