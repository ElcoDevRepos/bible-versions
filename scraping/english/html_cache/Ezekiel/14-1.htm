Their coming to Ezekiel indicates a recognition of his prophetic authority. Historically, elders held significant roles in Israelite society, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a> and <a href="/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16</a>, where they are involved in leadership and governance. This gathering suggests a serious concern or inquiry, possibly related to the spiritual state of the nation or seeking divine guidance during the Babylonian exile.<p><b>came and sat down before me.</b><br>The act of sitting before a prophet like Ezekiel signifies a posture of listening and seeking counsel. This setting implies a formal audience, where the elders are prepared to hear a message from God. In the cultural context, sitting was a common posture for learning and receiving instruction, as seen in <a href="/luke/10-39.htm">Luke 10:39</a> with Mary sitting at Jesus' feet. The phrase also indicates a direct encounter with the prophet, emphasizing the importance of the message they are about to receive. This moment foreshadows the confrontation of idolatry and the call to repentance that follows in the chapter.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is known for his vivid visions and symbolic acts.

Israel is now becoming the ordinary name of the existing nation, except where it is used with some special mark of distinction. The object of their enquiry is not mentioned, nor is it even expressly said that they made any enquiry; but the message to them implies this, and from what is said to them we may probably gather what was uppermost in their minds. Already told by the previous prophecies that God would not spare Jerusalem for its own sake, and that His long forbearance hitherto was no warrant for its continuance, they still evidently cherished the hope that, however sinful they might be in themselves, their city would yet be delivered for the sake of the holy men who lived therein. With such thoughts in their minds the elders came and sat before the prophet, in whose fearless words they had already learned to have confidence, and waited what he might have to say to them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - As the result, probably, of the previous utterances, certain <span class="cmt_word">elders of Israel</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. of the exiles in Tel-Abib, came to consult Ezekiel, wishing to know what counsels or what predictions he had for them.
