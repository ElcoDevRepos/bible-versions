In biblical times, a diamond was known for its hardness, symbolizing strength and unyielding determination. Flint, a hard sedimentary rock, was used to make tools and weapons, emphasizing the toughness required for Ezekiel's prophetic mission. This imagery suggests that God equips His servants with the necessary fortitude to withstand opposition. The concept of a hardened forehead can be linked to <a href="/isaiah/50-7.htm">Isaiah 50:7</a>, where the servant of the Lord sets his face like flint, indicating resolute determination. This also prefigures Christ's steadfastness in His mission, as seen in <a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>, where Jesus resolutely sets out for Jerusalem.<p><b>Do not be afraid of them or dismayed at their presence,</b><br>God's command to Ezekiel not to fear reflects a common biblical theme where God reassures His prophets and people of His presence and support. This echoes God's words to Joshua in <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>, where He commands strength and courage. The cultural context of Ezekiel's time involved significant opposition from the Israelites, who were in rebellion against God. Fearlessness in the face of such opposition is a recurring theme in the lives of biblical figures, including Moses, Jeremiah, and the apostles in the New Testament. This assurance is a reminder of God's sovereignty and the protection He offers to those who faithfully carry out His will.<p><b>even though they are a rebellious house.</b><br>The term "rebellious house" refers to the Israelites, who consistently resisted God's commands and prophets. This rebellion is a central theme in the book of Ezekiel, highlighting the spiritual and moral decay of the nation. Historically, this period was marked by idolatry and disobedience, leading to the Babylonian exile. The phrase underscores the persistent nature of Israel's rebellion, as seen throughout the Old Testament, from the wilderness wanderings in Exodus to the divided kingdom era. This rebellion sets the stage for the need for a new covenant, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who offers redemption and restoration to a rebellious humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.

Here the firmness is wholly positive&#8212;an unwavering commitment to truth.<p>&#8226; The point is literal: the prophet&#8217;s mind and emotions are supernaturally fortified.

The antidote to fear is always the nearness of the Lord (<a href="/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>).<p>&#8226; When the apostles faced hostility, the Lord repeated it: &#8220;Do not be afraid&#8230;for I am with you&#8221; (<a href="/acts/18-9.htm">Acts 18:9-10</a>).
