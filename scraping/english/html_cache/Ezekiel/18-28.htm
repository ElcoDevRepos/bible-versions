In the context of <a href="/ezekiel/18.htm">Ezekiel 18</a>, God is addressing the Israelites' belief that they were suffering for the sins of their ancestors. The chapter underscores individual accountability, a theme that runs counter to the prevailing cultural belief in collective punishment. The Hebrew word for "considered" implies a deep reflection and understanding of one's actions, leading to a conscious decision to change. This mirrors the call to repentance found throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/isaiah/55-7.htm">Isaiah 55:7</a>, where the wicked are urged to forsake their ways. The act of turning from transgressions is a key aspect of repentance, which is not merely feeling sorry but involves a decisive change in behavior, aligning with the New Testament call to repentance in <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>.<p><b>he will surely live; he will not die</b><br>This assurance of life is both physical and spiritual. In the immediate context, it refers to the promise of life for those who repent, contrasting with the death that comes from sin, as stated in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>. The certainty of life ("surely live") underscores God's faithfulness to His promises and His desire for repentance rather than punishment, as seen in <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>. This promise also foreshadows the eternal life offered through Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's plan for redemption. The phrase "he will not die" can be seen as a type of the eternal security found in Christ, who conquered death and offers eternal life to those who believe in Him, as affirmed in <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, emphasizing personal responsibility and repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience of Ezekiel's prophecies, they were in exile due to their collective disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, serving as a backdrop for Ezekiel's messages of repentance and hope.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_responsibility.htm">Personal Responsibility</a></b><br>Each individual is accountable for their own actions and decisions. <a href="/ezekiel/18-28.htm">Ezekiel 18:28</a> emphasizes that personal repentance leads to life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_leads_to_life.htm">Repentance Leads to Life</a></b><br>True repentance involves a conscious decision to turn away from sin, resulting in spiritual life and restoration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_mercy.htm">God's Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>God is just in holding individuals accountable, yet merciful in offering life to those who repent.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/continuous_reflection.htm">Continuous Reflection</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to regularly examine their lives, turning away from sin and aligning with God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_for_transformation.htm">Hope for Transformation</a></b><br>No matter past transgressions, there is hope for transformation and life through repentance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ezekiel_18_28_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ezekiel 18:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_18_28_on_personal_responsibility.htm">How does Ezekiel 18:28 emphasize personal responsibility for one's actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lesson_of_repentance_in_considered_turned.htm">What does "considered and turned away" teach about repentance and transformation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_18_28_s_guide_for_righteous_choices.htm">How can Ezekiel 18:28 guide us in making righteous life choices today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Ezekiel_18_28_to_New_Testament_repentance.htm">Connect Ezekiel 18:28 with New Testament teachings on repentance and salvation.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Use_Ezekiel_18_28_in_daily_choices.htm">How can you apply the principles of Ezekiel 18:28 in daily decision-making?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_18_28_vs_predestination.htm">How does Ezekiel 18:28 challenge the concept of predestination?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Is_Ezekiel_18_28_about_works-based_salvation.htm">Does Ezekiel 18:28 imply salvation is based on works?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Ezekiel_18_28_and_New_Testament_grace.htm">How does Ezekiel 18:28 align with the New Testament's message of grace?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ezekiel_18.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ezekiel 18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what's_biblical_prophecy's_meaning.htm">What is the meaning of Biblical prophecy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/do_neh._1_5-7_and_ot_agree_on_sin,_covenant.htm">In Nehemiah 1:5-7, are the concepts of collective sin and covenant consistent with other Old Testament texts or do they create contradictions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/can_people_instantly_gain_a_new_heart_spirit.htm">Ezekiel 18:31 -

Genuine repentance begins when a person pauses, thinks, and lets God&#8217;s truth expose the heart. We see this pattern elsewhere:<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/15-17.htm">Luke 15:17&#8211;18</a> shows the prodigal &#8220;came to his senses.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/haggai/1-5.htm">Haggai 1:5</a> urges, &#8220;Consider carefully your ways.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/119-59.htm">Psalm 119:59</a> testifies, &#8220;I considered my ways and turned my steps to Your testimonies.&#8221;<p>When we truly &#8220;consider,&#8221; we stop blaming circumstances and start acknowledging personal responsibility before a holy God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and turned from</b><p>Thinking alone is not enough; it must lead somewhere. &#8220;Turned&#8221; speaks of decisive action&#8212;repentance that changes direction. God consistently links blessing to this pivot:<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>: &#8220;Repent, then, and turn back, so that your sins may be wiped away.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/55-7.htm">Isaiah 55:7</a>: &#8220;Let the wicked man forsake his own way&#8230;let him return to the LORD, for He will freely pardon.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a> promises forgiveness and healing when His people &#8220;turn from their wicked ways.&#8221;<p>Turning is not a mere emotional moment; it is a deliberate break with sin and a move toward obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the transgressions he had committed</b><p>God calls for a comprehensive surrender, not selective morality. Partial repentance is no repentance at all. Scripture underscores the seriousness of every sin:<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>: &#8220;Whoever keeps the whole law yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/51-2.htm">Psalm 51:2&#8211;3</a>: David confesses, &#8220;Wash me&#8230;for I know my transgressions.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>: &#8220;Whoever confesses and renounces [sins] finds mercy.&#8221;<p>The phrase &#8220;all the transgressions&#8221; assures us that no sin is too small to confess and none too great for God to forgive when we forsake it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he will surely live</b><p>This is God&#8217;s unwavering pledge. Life here reaches beyond mere survival; it signals restored fellowship with God and the promise of eternal life. Consider:<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>: the believer &#8220;has crossed over from death to life.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>: whoever believes &#8220;shall not perish but have eternal life.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>: though sin&#8217;s wage is death, God&#8217;s gift is &#8220;eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&#8221;<p>The certainty&#8212;&#8220;surely&#8221;&#8212;echoes God&#8217;s faithfulness; when He forgives, He also imparts life in its fullest sense.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he will not die</b><p>With sin forgiven and a new course set, the penalty of death no longer hangs over the repentant person. Scripture repeats this assurance:<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>: &#8220;There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25&#8211;26</a>: &#8220;Whoever believes in Me will live, even though he dies&#8230;will never die.&#8221;<p>Physical death may still occur, but spiritual death&#8212;the ultimate separation from God&#8212;is forever removed. God&#8217;s justice is satisfied, and His mercy triumphs.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ezekiel/18-28.htm">Ezekiel 18:28</a> presents a simple yet profound sequence: honest reflection, decisive turning, comprehensive confession, and the resulting gift of life instead of death.
