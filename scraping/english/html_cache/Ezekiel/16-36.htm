It is a common prophetic formula used to assert that the message is directly from God, underscoring the seriousness and authenticity of the forthcoming judgment. This phrase is used throughout the prophetic books to indicate that the prophet is speaking on behalf of God, not from personal opinion.<p><b>Because you poured out your wealth:</b><br>The imagery of pouring out wealth suggests reckless and wasteful expenditure, often associated with idolatry and alliances with foreign nations. In the historical context, Israel and Judah frequently sought security through alliances with surrounding nations, often at the cost of their own resources and spiritual fidelity. This phrase can be connected to the broader biblical theme of stewardship and the misuse of God-given resources.<p><b>and exposed your nakedness in your promiscuity with your lovers:</b><br>Nakedness here symbolizes shame and vulnerability, often used in the Bible to describe spiritual unfaithfulness. The promiscuity with lovers refers to Israel's idolatrous relationships with other nations and their gods, which is likened to adultery. This metaphor is consistent with the prophetic tradition, where idolatry is frequently depicted as spiritual adultery (e.g., <a href="/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1-3</a>). The cultural context of the Ancient Near East often involved fertility rites and cultic prostitution, which further illustrates the depth of Israel's unfaithfulness.<p><b>and with all your detestable idols:</b><br>Idolatry is a central issue in the prophetic literature, representing a direct violation of the first two commandments. The term "detestable" underscores the abomination of idol worship in God's eyes. Archaeological findings have uncovered numerous idols from the period, indicating the prevalence of this practice. The prophets consistently warned against idolatry, which led to spiritual and moral decay.<p><b>and because of the blood of your children which you gave to them:</b><br>This phrase refers to the horrific practice of child sacrifice, which was part of some pagan religious rituals, notably those associated with the god Molech. This practice is explicitly condemned in the Law (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21, 20</a>:2-5). The shedding of innocent blood is a grave sin, and it highlights the extent of Israel's apostasy. This act of giving children to idols is a stark illustration of the depth of Israel's spiritual corruption and the severe consequences of turning away from God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and holy God of Israel, who speaks through the prophet Ezekiel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites during their exile in Babylon.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Represented as an unfaithful wife in this allegory, Israel is accused of spiritual adultery through idolatry and alliances with pagan nations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lovers.htm">Lovers</a></b><br>Symbolic of the foreign nations and false gods with whom Israel has been unfaithful to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/detestable_idols.htm">Detestable Idols</a></b><br>The false gods and idols that Israel worshipped, leading them away from their covenant with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_idolatry.htm">The Seriousness of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but includes anything that takes the place of God in our hearts.

The harlot city is indicated as being also a murderess. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ezekiel/16-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1469;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_136.htm">Strong's 136: </a> </span><span class="str2">The Lord</span><br /><br /><span class="word">GOD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1465;&#1493;&#1460;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3069.htm">Strong's 3069: </a> </span><span class="str2">YHWH</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1438;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;Because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3282.htm">Strong's 3282: </a> </span><span class="str2">Heed, purpose, to indicate the reason, cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you poured out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1461;&#1444;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(hi&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8210.htm">Strong's 8210: </a> </span><span class="str2">To spill forth, to expend, to sprawl out</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your wealth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1467;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#7717;u&#353;&#183;t&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
