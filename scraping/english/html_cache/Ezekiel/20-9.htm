In biblical times, a name represented one's character and authority. God's actions are often motivated by the desire to uphold His holy name, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/48-11.htm">Isaiah 48:11</a>. This reflects the importance of God's name being revered and not associated with failure or unfaithfulness.<p><b>that it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations</b><br>The profaning of God's name would occur if the nations perceived Him as unable to fulfill His promises or protect His people. In the ancient Near East, gods were often judged by the success of their followers. God's concern here is that His name remains holy and respected among the nations, aligning with His covenantal promises to Israel.<p><b>among whom they were living</b><br>This refers to the Israelites living among pagan nations during their captivity and exile. The surrounding nations were polytheistic, and Israel's monotheistic worship of Yahweh set them apart. The behavior and fate of Israel were a testimony to the power and character of their God, influencing how these nations viewed Yahweh.<p><b>in whose sight I had revealed Myself to Israel</b><br>God's revelation to Israel was unique and significant, involving direct communication and miraculous acts. This revelation began with the patriarchs and was solidified through the Exodus and the giving of the Law at Sinai. It established Israel as God's chosen people, with a special relationship and responsibility to reflect His holiness.<p><b>by bringing them out of the land of Egypt</b><br>The Exodus is a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing salvation and deliverance. It is frequently referenced throughout the Bible as a demonstration of God's power and faithfulness. This act prefigures the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who brings spiritual liberation from sin. The Exodus serves as a type of Christ's redemptive work, highlighting God's ability to save and His commitment to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and given the Law to follow.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land of bondage from which God delivered the Israelites, symbolizing sin and oppression.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>The surrounding peoples who observed Israel and through whom God's reputation was at stake.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_name.htm">God's Name</a></b><br>Represents His character, reputation, and the holiness that He desires to be recognized among all nations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_reputation_matters.htm">God's Reputation Matters</a></b><br>God's actions are often motivated by the desire to uphold His holy name.

Israel&#8217;s rebellion in Egypt deserved judgment, yet the Lord intervened anyway. His action was not passive or reluctant; it was purposeful and deliberate, just as He later &#8220;saved them for His name&#8217;s sake, to make His mighty power known&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/106-8.htm">Psalm 106:8</a>). The same divine initiative appears when He restrains wrath in <a href="/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10&#8211;14</a> after the golden calf incident.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the sake of My name</b><p>The motive behind God&#8217;s intervention was His own reputation. &#8220;For My name&#8217;s sake I will defer My anger&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/48-9.htm">Isaiah 48:9&#8211;11</a>) echoes this theme. God&#8217;s name embodies His character&#8212;holy, faithful, powerful. By acting, He safeguarded that character from slander and ensured that future generations would know Him as the covenant-keeping Lord (<a href="/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22&#8211;23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that it should not be profaned</b><p>To profane God&#8217;s name is to treat it as common or worthless. If Israel had been destroyed in Egypt, the surrounding peoples would have concluded that Yahweh was either weak or fickle. <a href="/leviticus/22-32.htm">Leviticus 22:32</a> instructs, &#8220;You must not profane My holy name.&#8221; <a href="/romans/2-24.htm">Romans 2:24</a> later warns, &#8220;The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.&#8221; God&#8217;s rescue preserved His holiness from such dishonor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the eyes of the nations among whom they were living</b><p>Egypt and the wider ancient world were watching.

Through them He introduced Himself not only to Israel but also to Egyptians who witnessed the signs (<a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a>). Each miracle built a testimony that would echo through history (<a href="/exodus/10-1.htm">Exodus 10:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by bringing them out of the land of Egypt</b><p>The Exodus is the cornerstone of Israel&#8217;s identity.

He defended His reputation, displayed His power, and kept covenant promises, ensuring that neither Israel&#8217;s sin nor Egypt&#8217;s pride could diminish His glory.
