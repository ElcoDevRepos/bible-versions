The four corners symbolize completeness and universality, reflecting the temple's role as a house of prayer for all nations (<a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>). The number four often represents the earth or creation, indicating the temple's connection to the world.<p><b>there were enclosed courts</b><br>These enclosed courts suggest designated spaces for specific purposes, possibly related to offerings or purification rituals. The enclosure implies separation, a common theme in temple architecture, emphasizing holiness and the need for sanctification before approaching God. This separation can be seen as a type of the separation between the holy and the common, a theme fulfilled in Christ, who bridges the gap between God and humanity (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p><b>each forty cubits long and thirty cubits wide</b><br>The dimensions of forty by thirty cubits indicate a significant size, suggesting these areas were meant for substantial activity. The number forty often symbolizes testing or trial in the Bible, as seen in the forty years of Israel's wilderness journey (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>) and Jesus' forty days of fasting (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). The number thirty can denote maturity or the beginning of ministry, as Jesus began His public ministry at about thirty years of age (<a href="/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23</a>).<p><b>Each of the four corner areas had the same dimensions</b><br>The uniformity in dimensions underscores the order and precision in God's design, reflecting His nature of consistency and fairness. This equality in size may symbolize the equal access to God's presence and blessings, prefiguring the New Testament teaching that in Christ, there is no distinction between Jew and Gentile (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). The equal dimensions also highlight the theme of justice and righteousness, foundational to God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, Ezekiel is the author of the book.

The global symbolism is married to real geography; worship in that day will be both universal and local.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>there were enclosed courts</b><p>&#8226; The term &#8220;enclosed&#8221; points to walled or partitioned spaces, set apart for a specific purpose.
