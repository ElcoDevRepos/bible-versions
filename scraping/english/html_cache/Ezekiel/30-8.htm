Throughout the book, God declares His intention to make Himself known to both Israel and the nations. This revelation often comes through acts of judgment or deliverance, underscoring His power and authority. The phrase echoes similar declarations in <a href="/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7 and 7</a>:4, where God's judgments serve as a means for people to recognize His divine nature.<p><b>when I set fire to Egypt</b><br>The imagery of fire is frequently used in the Bible to symbolize judgment and purification. In the context of Egypt, a nation historically known for its power and influence, the setting of fire signifies a divine judgment against its idolatry and opposition to God's people. Egypt had been a place of refuge and temptation for Israel, and God's judgment serves as a warning against reliance on foreign powers. This prophecy aligns with historical events where Egypt faced invasions and internal strife, fulfilling God's pronouncement.<p><b>and all her helpers are shattered</b><br>Egypt's "helpers" likely refer to the nations and allies that supported or were allied with Egypt. Historically, Egypt had alliances with various neighboring nations, which were often political and military in nature. The shattering of these helpers indicates a comprehensive judgment that extends beyond Egypt itself, affecting its entire sphere of influence. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the futility of trusting in human alliances rather than in God, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>, where reliance on Egypt is condemned.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who ministered to the Israelites during their Babylonian exile.
