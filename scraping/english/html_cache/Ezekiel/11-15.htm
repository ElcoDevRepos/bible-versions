It is used over 90 times in the book, highlighting the contrast between God&#8217;s divine nature and Ezekiel&#8217;s human nature. This title is also significant in the New Testament, where Jesus frequently refers to Himself as the "Son of Man," indicating His role as the representative human and the Messiah.<p><b>your brothers&#8212;your relatives, your fellow exiles, and the whole house of Israel</b><br>Ezekiel is being reminded of his connection to the exiles in Babylon, who are his literal and spiritual family. This phrase underscores the unity and shared identity of the Israelites, despite their physical separation. The mention of "the whole house of Israel" indicates that God&#8217;s concern and message are for all Israelites, not just those in Jerusalem or in exile. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God&#8217;s covenant with all of Israel, as seen in passages like <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a> and <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>.<p><b>are those of whom the people of Jerusalem have said</b><br>This highlights the division and tension between the exiles in Babylon and those remaining in Jerusalem. The people in Jerusalem viewed themselves as the true inheritors of God&#8217;s promises, dismissing the exiles. This reflects a common human tendency to see physical proximity to religious sites or symbols as equating to spiritual favor, a theme also addressed by Jesus in <a href="/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21-24</a>.<p><b>&#8216;They are far away from the LORD</b><br>The people of Jerusalem believed that physical distance from the temple equated to spiritual distance from God. This reflects a misunderstanding of God&#8217;s omnipresence and His ability to be with His people regardless of location. Theologically, this is countered by passages like <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-10</a>, which affirm God&#8217;s presence everywhere. The exile itself was a result of Israel&#8217;s disobedience, yet God&#8217;s presence and promises remained with them, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11-14</a>.<p><b>this land has been given to us as a possession.&#8217;</b><br>The inhabitants of Jerusalem believed that they were the rightful heirs of the land, seeing the exile of others as a sign of their own favor with God. This reflects a misunderstanding of the conditional nature of God&#8217;s promises regarding the land, which were contingent upon obedience (Deuteronomy 28). Theologically, this foreshadows the New Testament teaching that true inheritance is not about physical land but about being part of God&#8217;s kingdom through faith in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezekiel.htm">Ezekiel</a></b><br>A prophet and priest during the Babylonian exile, tasked with delivering God's messages to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exiles.htm">The Exiles</a></b><br>The Israelites who were taken captive and relocated to Babylon, including Ezekiel himself.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_jerusalem.htm">The People of Jerusalem</a></b><br>Those who remained in Jerusalem and believed they were the rightful heirs of the land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_whole_house_of_israel.htm">The Whole House of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the entire nation of Israel, both those in exile and those remaining in the land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks through Ezekiel to address the misconceptions of His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_in_exile.htm">God's Presence in Exile</a></b><br>Despite physical distance, God remains with His people.

Though men in Jerusalem declare the exiles abandoned and claim the land, the Lord affirms that His covenant family extends beyond city walls. He Himself will be present with the displaced, and in His timing He will restore them to the very inheritance others tried to seize. The passage reminds believers that human verdicts never overturn God&#8217;s promises; nearness to the Lord is measured by His grace, not geography.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ezekiel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Thy brethren--</span><span class= "ital">i.e., </span>those who were with Ezekiel in the Captivity. The expression is made emphatic by repetition, and by the addition, "men of thy kindred." The people remaining in Jerusalem, with arrogant confidence in themselves, and without sympathy for the exiles, had said to them, by words and by deeds, "We are holier than you; we dwell in the chosen city, we have the Temple, the appointed priesthood and sacrifices, and we have in possession the land of the Church of God; you are outcasts." The prophet is taught that these despised exiles, deprived of so many privileges, are yet his true brethren, and that he is to regard these as his true kindred rather than the corrupt priests at Jerusalem. In this word there is an allusion to the office of <span class= "ital">G&#8221;el, </span>the next of kin, whose duty it was in every way to assist his impoverished or unfortunate kinsman. Still further, these exiles are called "all the house of Israel wholly; "the others, not these, are cast out, and God will make His people from those who are now undergoing His purifying chastisement. This contrast is carried out in the following verses.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The men of thy kindred,</span> etc. The full force of the phrase can hardly be understood without remembering that the word for "kindred" implies the function and office of a <span class="accented">goel</span>, the redeemer and avenger of those among his relations who had suffered wrong (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25, 48</a>; <a href="/numbers/5-8.htm">Numbers 5:8</a>), and the point of the revelation is that Ezekiel is to find those who have this claim on him, his true "brethren," not only or chiefly in his natural relations in the priesthood, but in the companions of his exile (the LXX., following a different reading, gives, "the men of the Captivity"), and the whole house of Israel, who were in a like position, who were condemned by those who had been left in Jerusalem. As in Jeremiah's vision (<a href="/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1</a>), they were the "good figs;" those in the city, the vile and worthless. They were the remnant, the residue, for whom there was a hope of better things. They were despised as far off from the Lord. They were really nearer to his presence than those who worshipped in the temple from which Jehovah had departed.
