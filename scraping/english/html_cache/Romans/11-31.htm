Historically, Israel's disobedience is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where the nation often turned away from God despite His faithfulness. This disobedience is not just a rejection of the law but a refusal to accept Jesus as the Messiah. The Apostle Paul, who authored Romans, was deeply concerned with the spiritual state of Israel, as seen in <a href="/romans/9.htm">Romans 9-11</a>. This disobedience is part of a larger divine plan, allowing the Gentiles to receive the gospel, as seen in <a href="/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11-12</a>.<p><b>in order that they too may now receive mercy</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's redemptive plan for Israel. Despite their disobedience, God's purpose is to extend mercy to them. This reflects the biblical theme of God's enduring mercy and grace, as seen in passages like <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>. The mercy shown to Israel is not based on their merit but on God's sovereign choice and promise, as seen in His covenant with Abraham. This mercy is also a fulfillment of prophecy, where God promises to restore Israel, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24-28</a>.<p><b>through the mercy shown to you</b><br>Here, "you" refers to the Gentile believers who have received God's mercy through faith in Christ. This mercy is a result of Israel's temporary hardening, which opened the door for the Gentiles to be grafted into God's family, as explained in <a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-24</a>. The mercy shown to the Gentiles serves as a catalyst for Israel's eventual return to God, demonstrating the interconnectedness of God's plan for both Jews and Gentiles. This reflects the mystery of God's salvation plan, where both groups are united in Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-22</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is addressing the believers in Rome, both Jews and Gentiles, explaining the mystery of God's plan for Israel and the Gentiles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of Israel, God's chosen people, who have experienced a partial hardening, as Paul explains, so that the fullness of the Gentiles may come in.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who have received the gospel and are now part of God's redemptive plan, provoking Israel to jealousy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_mercy.htm">God's Mercy</a></b><br>A central theme in this passage, highlighting God's sovereign grace and mercy extended to both Jews and Gentiles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/disobedience.htm">Disobedience</a></b><br>The state of both Jews and Gentiles before receiving God's mercy, emphasizing the universal need for salvation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_sovereignty.htm">Understanding God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God's plan for salvation is both mysterious and sovereign, encompassing both Jews and Gentiles in His mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_disobedience.htm">The Role of Disobedience</a></b><br>Reflect on how disobedience serves as a backdrop for the display of God's mercy, reminding us of our need for grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>Embrace the unity of believers, regardless of ethnic or cultural background, as part of God's redemptive plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/provoking_to_jealousy.htm">Provoking to Jealousy</a></b><br>Consider how our lives as Christians can provoke others to seek the same mercy and grace we have received.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_mercy.htm">Living in Mercy</a></b><br>Live out the mercy we have received by extending it to others, demonstrating the transformative power of God's grace.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_11_31_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 11:31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_11_31_God_s_mercy_on_disobedience.htm">How does Romans 11:31 illustrate God's mercy towards disobedience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Romans_11_31_God_s_plan_for_all.htm">What does Romans 11:31 teach about God's plan for both Jews and Gentiles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Romans_11_31_s_mercy_today.htm">How can we apply the concept of mercy in Romans 11:31 to our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Romans_11_31_and_OT_promises_link.htm">How does Romans 11:31 connect with God's promises in the Old Testament?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_show_mercy_like_Romans_11_31.htm">In what ways can we show mercy to others, reflecting Romans 11:31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Romans_11_31_God_s_mercy_on_disobedience_2.htm">What does Romans 11:31 reveal about God's mercy towards disobedience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Romans_11_31_vs_divine_justice.htm">How does Romans 11:31 challenge the concept of divine justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_mercy_key_in_Romans_11_31.htm">Why is mercy a central theme in Romans 11:31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_romans_11.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Romans 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_will_god_judge_and_restore_israel.htm">How will God's judgment and restoration manifest for Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_do_job_31_curses_compare_to_nt_mercy.htm">How do Job's self-imposed curses in Job 31 compare with New Testament passages emphasizing mercy and forgiveness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_death_for_sabbath-breaking,_not_mercy.htm">Exodus 31:15 -
