It invites the audience to consider the implications of what has been previously discussed, particularly the relationship between the law and sin. This method of questioning is seen throughout Paul's letters, such as in <a href="/romans/6.htm">Romans 6:1 and 9</a>:14, where he anticipates objections or misunderstandings from his audience.<p><b>Is the law sin?</b><br>Paul addresses a potential misunderstanding that could arise from his teachings on the law. The law, given by God, is not sinful; rather, it reveals sin. This distinction is crucial in understanding the purpose of the law in the life of a believer. The law itself is holy and righteous, as Paul later affirms in <a href="/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a>.<p><b>Certainly not!</b><br>Paul emphatically rejects the notion that the law is sinful. This strong denial underscores the importance of the law in God's plan. The phrase "Certainly not!" is a translation of the Greek phrase "m&#275; genoito," which is used by Paul to strongly refute any suggestion that contradicts the truth of the gospel, as seen in <a href="/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a> and <a href="/galatians/2-17.htm">Galatians 2:17</a>.<p><b>Indeed, I would not have been mindful of sin if not for the law.</b><br>The law serves as a mirror, reflecting the sinful nature of humanity. Without the law, individuals would lack awareness of their sinful actions and thoughts. This concept is echoed in <a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>, where Paul states that through the law comes the knowledge of sin. The law's role is to convict and lead individuals to recognize their need for a Savior.<p><b>For I would not have been aware of coveting if the law had not said, &#8220;Do not covet.&#8221;</b><br>Paul uses the specific example of coveting, one of the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>), to illustrate how the law reveals sin. Coveting, an internal desire, highlights that sin is not only about external actions but also about the heart's intentions. This aligns with Jesus' teachings in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21-28</a>), where He emphasizes the internal nature of sin. The law's commandment against coveting exposes the sinful desires that reside within, demonstrating the law's role in revealing the depth of human sinfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Romans, addressing the role of the law in understanding sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law, which includes commandments given to the Israelites, such as "Do not covet."<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin.htm">Sin</a></b><br>The moral failing or transgression against God's law, which Paul discusses in relation to the law's role in revealing sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/romans.htm">Romans</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, a Christian community in Rome, grappling with the relationship between law and grace.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/coveting.htm">Coveting</a></b><br>A specific sin mentioned by Paul, highlighting the law's role in identifying sinful desires.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_law's_purpose.htm">The Law's Purpose</a></b><br>The law is not sinful; rather, it reveals sin.

Paul is consistent&#8212;God&#8217;s moral standard remains holy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Certainly not!</b><p>Paul&#8217;s emphatic answer shuts the door on any slander against God&#8217;s commandments.<p>&#8226; The same phrase appears in <a href="/romans/6-2.htm">Romans 6:2</a> where Paul rejects living in sin; both times he defends God&#8217;s character and gospel integrity.<p>&#8226; The strength of the denial guards believers from antinomian drift, anchoring them to the truth that God&#8217;s revealed will is good.<p>&#8226; By insisting on the law&#8217;s purity, Paul prepares the ground for explaining why we still wrestle with sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Indeed, I would not have been mindful of sin if not for the law.</b><p>Paul now personalizes the doctrine: the law exposed his own heart.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a> explains that &#8220;through the law we become conscious of sin.&#8221; The mirror shows the grime we would otherwise ignore.<p>&#8226; <a href="/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a> says the law &#8220;was added on account of transgressions,&#8221; highlighting its diagnostic role.<p>&#8226; <a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a> adds that the law is a tutor leading us to Christ; awareness of sin presses us toward the Savior.<p>&#8226; Far from causing sin, the law defines it, awakening moral sensitivity and revealing our need for grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For I would not have been aware of coveting if the law had not said, &#8220;Do not covet.&#8221;</b><p>Paul chooses the tenth commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>) because it addresses inward desire, proving sin is more than outward action.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a> describes the word of God as &#8220;living and active&#8230;judging the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&#8221; Coveting fits that target.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14</a> traces sin&#8217;s origin to desires within; the command &#8220;Do not covet&#8221; shines light on that inner battleground.<p>&#8226; By naming a subtle, internal trespass, Paul dismantles self-righteousness. Even those who avoid public scandal stand guilty when motives are measured.<p>&#8226; The law therefore functions like a spiritual X-ray, exposing what human eyes miss.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7</a> defends the holiness of God&#8217;s law while revealing its true purpose: not to save but to diagnose. The law is not sin; it&#8217;s the spotlight that exposes sin. By highlighting coveting, Paul shows that sin reaches into the deepest desires, leaving no room for self-justification. The law&#8217;s verdict drives us to the only sufficient remedy&#8212;Jesus Christ&#8212;who fulfills the law&#8217;s demands and frees us to walk in newness of life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">What shall we say then</span>?--The Apostle had spoken in a manner disparaging to the Law, and which might well give offence to some of his readers. It was necessary to correct this. And so now he proceeds to lay down more precisely in what it was that the Law was defective, and what was its true function and relation to the history and struggles of humanity.<p>In what follows the Apostle speaks throughout in the first person. He is really making a general statement which applies to all mankind; but this statement is based upon his own personal experience. Self-analysis is at the bottom of most profound psychology. The Apostle goes back in thought to the time before he had embraced Christianity, and treats his own case as typical. There can be little question that the description which follows to the end of <a href="/romans/7-24.htm" title="O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?">Romans 7:24</a> is a description of the <span class= "ital">unregenerate</span> state of man. It is one prolonged crisis and conflict, which at last finds its solution in Christ.<p><span class= "bld">Is the law sin?</span>--The Law had just been described as stimulating and exciting "the motions of sins." Was this true? Was the Law really immoral? No, that could not be.<p><span class= "bld">Nay.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">howbeit</span> (Ellicott), <span class= "ital">nevertheless.</span> The Law is not actually immoral, but it is near being made so. It is not itself sin (sinful), but it reveals, and so in a manner incites to, sin.<p><span class= "bld">I had not known.</span>--Strictly, <span class= "ital">I did not know.</span> I had no acquaintance with sin except through the Law. Before the introduction of law, acts that are sinful in themselves, objectively viewed, may be done, but they are not sinful with reference to the person who does them. He has no knowledge or consciousness of what sin is until it is revealed to him by law.<p><span class= "bld">Sin.</span>--Here a sort of quasi-personification. The principle or power of sin into contact and acquaintance with which the Apostle was brought for the first time by the Law.<p><span class= "bld">I had not known lust.</span>--The Apostle introduces an illustration from a special law--the Tenth Commandment. "Lust" is here to be taken in the special sense of covetousness, desire for that which is forbidden. Doubtless there would be many before the giving of the Law who desired their "neighbour's wife, or his manservant, or his maidservant," &c.; but this would not be <span class= "ital">coveting,</span> it would not be desire <span class= "ital">of that which was forbidden,</span> for the simple reason that it was <span class= "ital">not</span> forbidden. Covetousness, then, <span class= "ital">as a sin,</span> the Apostle did not know until he was confronted with the law against it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-25.</span> - (<span class="accented">b</span>) The <span class="accented">relation of law to sin, and how law prepares the soul for emancipation in Christ from the dominion of sin.</span> In the section of the argument which begins at <a href="/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1</a> we have seen that the idea of being under <span class="accented">sin</span> has passed into that of being under <span class="accented">law</span>, in such apparent connection of thought as to identify the positions. The apostle, seeing that readers might be perplexed by such identification, now, in the first place, explains what he has meant by it. Is the Law, then, sin? No, replies the apostle; the Law itself (with especial reference to the Mosaic Law as the great and authentic expression of Divine law) is holy; and its connection with sin is only this - that, in virtue of its very holiness, it convinces of sin, and makes it sinful. And then, to the end of ch. 7, he goes on to show how this is by an analysis of the operation of law on human consciousness. He presents to us a vivid picture of a man supposed at first to be without law, and therefore unconscious of sin; but then, through law coming in, acquiring a sense of it, and yet unable to avoid it. The man assents in his conscience to the good, but is dragged down by the infection of his nature to the evil. He seems to have, as it were, two contrary laws within himself, distracting him. And so the external Law, appealing to the higher law within himself, good and holy though it be, is, in a sense, killing him; for it reveals sin to him, and makes it deadly, but does not deliver him from it, till the crisis comes in the desperate cry, "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" (ver. 24). But this crisis is the precursor of deliverance; it is the last throe preceding the new birth; the Law has now done its work, having fully convinced of sin, and excited the yearning for deliverance, and in "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" the deliverance comes. How it comes is set forth in ch. 8, where the state of peace and hope, consequent on deliverance through faith in Christ, is portrayed in glowing terms, so as thus to complete the subject which we announced as being that of the sixth, seventh, and eighth chapters, viz. "the moral results to believers of the revealed righteousness of God." Two questions have been raised and discussed with regard to vers. 7-25. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Whether St. Paul, who writes throughout the passage in the first person singular, is describing his own personal experience, or only so writing in order to give vividness and reality to his picture of the experience of any human soul. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Whether he is describing the mental experience of an unregenerate or of a regenerate man. As to (1), his purpose undoubtedly is not (like that of Augustine in his 'Confessions ') to tell us about himself, but to depict generally the throes of the human soul when convinced of sin. But, in doing this, he as undoubtedly draws on his own past experience; recollections of the struggle he had himself gone through gleam evidently throughout the picture; he paints so vividly because he has felt so keenly. This makes the passage so peculiarly interesting, as being not only a striking analysis of human consciousness, but also an opening out to us of the great apostle's inner self; of the inward pangs and dissatisfaction with himself which had, we may well believe, distracted him through the many years when he had been a zealot for the Law and apparently satisfied with it, and when - perhaps partly to stifle disturbing thoughts - he had thrown himself into the work of persecution. Then, further, the sudden change of tone observable in the eighth chapter, which is like calm and sunshine after storm, reveals to us the change that had come over him (to which he often elsewhere refers), when "the light from heaven" had shown him an escape from his mental chaos. He was then "a new creature: old things had passed away; behold, all things had become new" (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). As to question (2), an answer has been already virtually given; viz. that the condition described is that of the unregenerate; in this sense - that it is of one still under the bondage of sin and law, before the revelation to the soul of the righteousness of God, and the consequent rising to a new life in Christ. This seems obvious from its being the thought of law subjecting to sin that introduces the whole passage, and runs through it - the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> which connects ver. 14 with what precedes denoting a continuance throughout of the same line of thought - and also from the marked change of tone in ch. 8, where the state of the regenerate is undoubtedly described. Further, we find, in vers. 5 and 6 of ch. 7, the obvious theses of the two sections that follow, in the remainder of ch. 7. and in ch. 8. respectively. Their wording exactly corresponds to the subject-matter of these sections; and ver. 5 distinctly expresses the state of being under law, ver. 6 the state of deliverance from it. Further, particular expressions in the two sections seem to be in intended contrast with each other, so as to denote contrasted states. In <a href="/romans/7-9.htm">Romans 7:9, 11, 13</a>, sin, through the Law, <span class="accented">kills</span>; in <a href="/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a> we have "the law of the Spirit of <span class="accented">life."</span> In <a href="/romans/7-23.htm">Romans 7:23</a> the man is brought into <span class="accented">captivity</span>; in <a href="/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a> he is made <span class="accented">free.</span> In <a href="/romans/7-14.htm">Romans 7:14, 18</a> there is invincible strife between the holy Law and the carnal mind; in <a href="/romans/8-4.htm">Romans 8:4</a> the righteousness of the Law is fulfilled. In <a href="/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5</a> we were in the <span class="accented">flesh</span>; in <a href="/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a> not in the <span class="accented">flesh</span>, but in the <span class="accented">Spirit.</span> And, further, could St. Paul possibly have spoken of the regenerate Christian as "sold under sin" (ver. 14)? His state is one of redemption from it. We do not mean that the state which begins to be described at ver. 14 is one devoid of grace. A condition of progress towards regeneration is described; and the final utter dissatisfaction with self, and the keen yearning after good, imply a reused and enlightened conscience: it is the state of one who is being prepared for deliverance, and is not far from the kingdom of God. All, in fact, we say is that it is not till ch. 8. that the picture of a soul emancipated by a living faith in Christ begins. We may observe, further, that the mere use of the present tense in ver. 14 and afterwards by no means necessitates our supposing the apostle to be speaking of his own state at the time of writing, and therefore of the state of a regenerate Christian. He uses the present to add vividness and reality to the picture; he throws himself back into, and realizes to himself again, his own former feebleness; and he thus also more clearly distinguishes between the state described and the imagined previous one before law had begun to operate. The view which we thus confidently advocate is that of the Greek Fathers generally, the application of the passage to the regenerate Christian being apparently due to Augustine in his opposition to Pelagianism; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> according to his <span class="accented">later</span> view; for in his earlier days (Prop. 45 in 'Ep. ad Romans;' 'Ad Simplic.,' 1:91, 'Conf.,' 7:21) he had held with the Greek Fathers. Jerome also seems to have similarly changed his mind about it; and the later view of both these Fathers has been adopted by Anselm, Thomas Aquinas, Corn. a Lapide, and by Luther, Melancthon, Calvin, Beza, and others among the Protestants. What weighed with Augustine was that in vers. 17, 20, 22, more propension to good is implied than his doctrinal theory allowed to the natural man. Under a similar impression, Calvin says, commenting on ver. 17, "Porto hic locus palam evincit non nisi de pits qui jam regeniti sunt Paulum disputare. Quamdiu enim manet homo sui similis, quantus quantus est, merito censetur vitiosus." If, however, St. Paul's intention, obvious from his own writing, does not fit in with Augustinian or Calvinistic theology, so much the worse for the latter. The verses in question do not, in fact, express more than the apostle elsewhere allows man to be capable of, and what observation of fact shows him to be capable of, though not having yet attained to Christian faith; viz. approval of, longing for, and even striving for, what is good. It is not more than the sincere and earnest, even in the Gentile world, have been already credited with in ch. 2. of this Epistle (vers. 7, 10, 14, 15, 26, 29). It does not follow that such moral earnestness is independent of Divine grace; but there is a true and effective operation of Divine grace, suitable to men's needs and capacities, before the fulness of Pentecostal grace. And further, however "far gone from original righteousness" man in his natural state may be, still that utter depravity attributed to him by some theologians is neither consonant with observed fact nor declared in Holy Writ. The image of God in which he was made is represented as defaced, but not obliterated. Be it observed, lastly, with regard to the whole question of the intention of this chapter, that its reference to the unregenerate precludes the wresting of some parts of it to support antinomianism. Calvin, though applying it, as said above, to the regenerate, thus alludes to and guards against any such abuse of ver. 17: "Non est deprecatio so excusantis, ac si culpa vacaret; quomodo multi nugatores justam defensionem habere se putant, qua tegant sua fiagitia dum in carnem ea rejiciunt." It was observed in the note at the head of ch. 2. that, though the thesis to be then proved was the sinfulness of all men without exception before God, this did not seem to be in that chapter rigorously proved with regard to those - and such it was allowed there were - who sincerely sought after righteousness, and refrained from judging others; and it was said that this apparent deficiency in the proof would be supplied in ch. 7. And so it is in this analysis of the inward consciousness of even the best in their natural state; recognizable by all as a true one in proportion to their own moral enlightenment and moral earnestness. This consideration is an additional reason for regarding ch. 7. as referring to the unregenerate; since otherwise a link in the argument on which the whole treatise rests would seem to be wanting. We may remark also, before proceeding with our exposition, that, though we hold ch. 7. to refer to the unregenerate, and ch. 8. to the regenerate state, between which a sharp line is here drawn, yet it need not follow that either the sense of having passed at a definite time from one to the other as represented in this ideal picture, or the consciousness of entire blessedness as portrayed in ch. 8, will be realized by all, who may still be regenerate and have undergone a true conversion. Owing to the weakness of the human will, which has to work with grace, and to the infection of nature that remains in the regenerate, the triumph of the grace of the new birth is seldom, in fact, complete; and so even saints may often be still painfully conscious of the conflict described in ch. 7. They will, indeed, have the peace and assurance of ch. 8. in proportion as "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" <span class="accented">is</span> potent and paramount in them; but still they may not attain all at once to the ideal of their regenerate condition. Similarly, in St. John's Epistles the kingdoms of darkness and of light are set forth as totally distinct, and the regenerate are regarded as having passed entirely from the one into the other, so as to have the perfect love which casteth out fear; and it is of importance that the essential distinction between the two kingdoms should be kept in view. But still in actual life, as we cannot but feel, the majority of believing Christians have not so passed entirely; clouds from the old kingdom of darkness still partially overshadow most of those who, in the main, have passed into the light, and it may be difficult for us to determine to which kingdom some belong. Such would be the case even with those whom the apostle addressed - persons who had consciously, in adult life, risen to a new life in baptism; and still more will it be so with us, who were baptized in infancy, and may have grown up more or less, but few entirely, under the influence of the regenerating Spirit. Further, it is to be observed that, though the peace and confidence of ch. 8. be the growing result and reward of a true conversion, yet the practical tests of one are ever said by both St. Paul and St. John not to be feelings only, but the fruits of the Spirit in character and life. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What shall we say then?</span> (St. Paul's usual phrase, with <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> following, for meeting and rejecting a possible misunderstanding of his meaning; cf. <a href="/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Is the Law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known Bin, but through law</span>. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span>, translated "nay," being thus taken, as in the Authorized Version, adversatively to the supposition of the Law being sin, and so a continuation of what is expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. So far from the Law being sin, it exposes sin. Or it may be in the sense of "howbeit," as in the Revised Version, meaning - still, law has to do with sin so far as this, that it brings it out. <span class="cmt_word">For I had not known lust, except the Law had said, Thou shalt not covet</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">thou shalt not lust</span>, so as to retain the correspondence of the verb with the preceding substantive. Observe, here as elsewhere, the significance of <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> with and without the article. In the preceding section it was the Mosaic Law that wad specially in view, and it is the idea of being sin that is so indignantly repudiated at the beginning of this verse. So also, at the end, the Law of Moses is referred to as forbidding lust. Hence the article in both cases. But in the intervening phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, it is the principle of law generally that is regarding as making sin known. The adducing of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> as being made known by the Law seems to have a significance beyond that of its being one particular instance of sin being so made known. It may imply that the very propension to evil, which is the root of sin, is thus only made known as sinful. The reference is, of course, to the tenth commandment. Without it men might not have been aware of the sinfulness of desires as well as of deeds, and thus, after all, been unacquainted with the essence of sin. Further, we may suppose it to be not without a purpose that the apostle varies his verbs expressive of knowing, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f1c;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x2e;</span> majus est, <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> minus. Hinc posterius, cure etiam minor gradus negatur, est in increments" (Bengel). <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> may express personal acquaintance with the working and power of sin; <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, no more than knowing lust as being sin at all. If so, it does not in itself imply (whatever may seem to be the case in ver. 8, of which below) that the Law <span class="accented">excites</span> lust, in the sense that I should not have lusted as I do had not the Law forbidden me to lust. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/7-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">What</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Ti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
