In the Jewish context, circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). It symbolized belonging to God's chosen people. However, Paul challenges the notion that this blessing is exclusive to the Jews. By questioning whether the blessing is only for the circumcised, Paul emphasizes that righteousness through faith is available to all, Jew and Gentile alike. This reflects the inclusive nature of the gospel, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where Paul states that there is neither Jew nor Greek in Christ. The early church grappled with this issue, as seen in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, where the Jerusalem Council debated the necessity of circumcision for Gentile believers.<p><b>We have been saying that Abraham&#8217;s faith was credited to him as righteousness.</b><br>This phrase refers to the foundational principle of justification by faith, which Paul elaborates on in <a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>, quoting <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>. Abraham's faith, not his works or adherence to the law, was the basis for his righteousness. This predates the law given to Moses and the institution of circumcision, underscoring that righteousness is a matter of faith, not legalistic observance. This concept is central to Paul's argument in Romans and Galatians, where he contrasts faith and works. It also connects to the broader biblical narrative of salvation by faith, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, which highlights the faith of Old Testament figures. Abraham is a type of Christ in that he is the father of many nations, and through his seed, all nations are blessed (<a href="/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>), pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>A key patriarch in the Bible, known for his faith and obedience to God.

Paul will stress this in <a href="/romans/4-10.htm">Romans 4:10-11</a>.<p>&#8226; The sequence proves that faith, not ritual, was (and remains) the ground of acceptance with God.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8-12</a> highlights Abraham as the prototype of faith for all generations, making him &#8220;the father of all who believe&#8221; (<a href="/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>).<p>Paul&#8217;s argument is airtight: if the patriarch was justified before circumcision existed, then circumcision cannot be the channel of justification for anyone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/4-9.htm">Romans 4:9</a> answers a critical question: the blessing of forgiveness and righteousness is not confined to the physically circumcised but is offered equally to the uncircumcised. Abraham&#8217;s own experience&#8212;being counted righteous solely by faith long before he was circumcised&#8212;demonstrates that God&#8217;s saving promise transcends rituals and ethnic boundaries. In Christ, every believer, Jew or Gentile, receives the same gracious credit of righteousness by faith alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9-12) What is the bearing of this upon the relation between Jew and Gentile? Is the blessedness of the justified state reserved only for the former? Is it limited to those who are circumcised? On the contrary, the state of justification was attributed to Abraham himself <span class= "ital">before</span> he was circumcised. Justification is the result of faith, not of circumcision. Circumcision is so far from superseding faith that it was only the sign or seal of it.<p>This, then, is the great test. Those who have it may hope for justification, whether their descent from Abraham is spiritual or literal.<p>(9) <span class= "bld">Cometh this blessedness.</span>--We shall, perhaps. best see the force of the particles "then" and "for" if we take the sentence out of its interrogative form. "It follows from the language of David that the blessedness thus predicated belongs to the uncircumcised as well as to the circumcised, <span class= "ital">for"</span>--then comes the first premise of the argument by which this is proved. It was the act of faith which was the cause of Abraham's justification. But both the act of faith and the justification consequent upon it were prior to the institution of the rite of circumcision. The narrative of this institution falls in Genesis 17, when Abraham was ninety-nine years old, and Ishmael, his son, thirteen (<a href="/genesis/17-1.htm" title="And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said to him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be you perfect.">Genesis 17:1</a>; <a href="/context/genesis/17-24.htm" title="And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.">Genesis 17:24-25</a>), while the vision and promise of Genesis 15 apparently came before the birth of Ishmael.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cometh this blessedness then</span> (properly, <span class="accented">is then this blessing</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. How</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as the context shows, <span class="accented">under what circumstances</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision</span>. Faith, and not works, having been shown to be the principle of Abraham's justification, and those who were under the Mosaic Law, represented by David, having been seen to have shared the blessing of being so justified, the question still remains, whether it may not be confined to them only, or to Abraham's circumcised descendants only. That this cannot be is shown in two ways: firstly (vers. 10-13), from the fact that Abraham was himself <span class="accented">uncircumcised</span> when he was spoken of as being thus justified, so that neither the capability nor the inheritance of such justification can be viewed as dependent on circumcision; and, secondly (vers. 13-16), it is argued that the Law could not appropriate the privilege to his carnal descendants, the very principle of law being the opposite of that on which Abraham is said to have been justified. Thus the <span class="accented">seed</span>, innumerable as the stars, to be understood as inheritors of the promise made to him, and sharers in his blessing, are not his circumcised descendants, but a spiritual seed - they which are of faith being the true children of Abraham (<a href="/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/4-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Is] this</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(houtos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">blessing</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#945;&#954;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(makarismos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3108.htm">Strong's 3108: </a> </span><span class="str2">Regarding as happy, blessed, or enviable.
