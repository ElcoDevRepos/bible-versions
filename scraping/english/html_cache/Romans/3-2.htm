Historically, the Jews were chosen as God's people, receiving His laws and covenants. This special relationship is highlighted throughout the Old Testament, where God repeatedly shows His favor and guidance to Israel. The phrase underscores the comprehensive nature of these advantages, suggesting that they are not limited to a single aspect but are abundant and multifaceted.<p><b>First of all,</b><br>This indicates the primary or most significant advantage among many. The phrase suggests a sequence or priority, pointing to the foundational role of the Jews in God's redemptive plan. Historically, the Jewish nation was the first to receive divine revelation, setting the stage for the coming of the Messiah. This priority is not just chronological but also theological, as it establishes the basis for understanding God's unfolding plan for humanity.<p><b>they have been entrusted with the very words of God.</b><br>The Jews were given the sacred responsibility of preserving and transmitting the Scriptures, which are considered the direct revelation of God. This entrustment is a profound privilege and responsibility, as it involves safeguarding the divine message for future generations. The "very words of God" refer to the Old Testament Scriptures, which include the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings. This highlights the Jewish role in the history of salvation, as they were the custodians of God's revelation until the coming of Christ.
