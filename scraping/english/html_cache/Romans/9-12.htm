This aligns with <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which states that salvation is a gift from God, not a result of works. The concept of God calling individuals is seen throughout Scripture, such as in the calling of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>) and the apostles (<a href="/mark/1-16.htm">Mark 1:16-20</a>). This underscores the idea that God's purposes are fulfilled according to His plan, not human effort.<p><b>she was told</b><br>This refers to the revelation given to Rebekah, the mother of Esau and Jacob, as recorded in <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>. It highlights the importance of divine revelation in understanding God's will and purposes. In the biblical narrative, God often communicates His plans through direct revelation, dreams, or prophets, as seen with figures like Moses (Exodus 3) and Samuel (1 Samuel 3).<p><b>&#8220;The older will serve the younger.&#8221;</b><br>This prophecy given to Rebekah is significant because it reverses the cultural norm of primogeniture, where the firstborn typically receives the inheritance and blessing. In this case, Esau, the older, would serve Jacob, the younger. This reversal is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in the stories of Isaac over Ishmael and Joseph over his brothers. It points to God's sovereignty in choosing whom He wills to fulfill His purposes, regardless of human expectations. This also foreshadows the coming of Christ, who, though not conforming to worldly expectations, fulfills God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebecca.htm">Rebecca</a></b><br>The wife of Isaac and mother of Esau and Jacob.
