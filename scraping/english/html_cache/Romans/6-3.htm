Paul often uses rhetorical questions to engage his readers and emphasize important theological points. This approach is common in his letters, as seen in <a href="/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>, where he challenges the readers' understanding to deepen their comprehension of spiritual truths.<p><b>that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus</b><br>Baptism in the early Christian context was a significant rite of initiation, symbolizing the believer's identification with Christ. The phrase "baptized into Christ Jesus" implies a spiritual union with Him. In <a href="/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>, Paul similarly states that those who are baptized into Christ have "clothed" themselves with Him, indicating a transformation and new identity. The act of baptism is not merely a ritual but a profound declaration of faith and allegiance to Jesus.<p><b>were baptized into His death?</b><br>This phrase highlights the theological concept of believers participating in the death of Christ through baptism. It signifies dying to sin and the old self, as explained further in <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4-6</a>. The imagery of being "baptized into His death" connects to the idea of being buried with Christ, which is a precursor to being raised to new life. This concept is echoed in <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>, where Paul speaks of being buried with Christ in baptism and raised through faith.

In the first place, the death of Christ is the central and cardinal fact of the Christian scheme. It is specially related to justification, and justification proceeds from faith, which is ratified in baptism. In the second place, the symbolism of baptism was such as naturally to harmonise with the symbolism of death. It was the final close of one period, and the beginning of another--the complete stripping off of the past and putting on of the "new man."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Or know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death!</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;</span>, if taken in the sense of "or," at the beginning of ver. 3, will be understood if we put what is meant thus: Do you not know that we have all died to sin? <span class="accented">Or</span> are you really ignorant of what your very baptism meant? But cf. <a href="/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1</a>, where the same expression occurs, and where <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;</span> appears only to imply a question. The expression <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;</span> also in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-2.htm">1 Corinthians 10:2</a> and <a href="/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>; in the first of these texts with reference to the Israelites and Moses. It denotes the entering by baptism into close union with a person, coming to belong to him, so as to be in a sense identified with him. In <a href="/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a> being <span class="accented">baptized</span> into Christ is understood as implying <span class="accented">putting him on</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) The phrases, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, were understood to imply the same idea, though not so plainly expressing it. Thus St. Paul rejoiced that he had not himself baptized many at Corinth, lest it might have been said that he had baptized them into his own name (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> into such connection with himself as baptism implied with Christ alone. Doubtless in the instruction which preceded baptism this significance of the sacrament would be explained. And if "into Christ," then "into his death." "In Christum, inquam, totum, adeoque in mortem ejus baptizatur" (Bengel). The whole experience of Christ was understood to have its counterpart in those who were baptized into him; in them was understood a death to sin, corresponding to his actual death. This, too, would form part of the instruction of catechumens. St. Paul often presses it as what he conceives to be well understood; and in subsequent verses of this chapter he further explains what he means. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/6-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Or</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7970;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2228.htm">Strong's 2228: </a> </span><span class="str2">Or, than.
