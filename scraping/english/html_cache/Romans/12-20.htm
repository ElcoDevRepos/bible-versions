It reflects the broader biblical theme of responding to evil with good, as seen in Jesus' teachings in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>). The call to act differently than expected is a hallmark of Christian ethics.<p><b>If your enemy is hungry, feed him</b><br>This directive emphasizes practical love and kindness towards one's enemies, echoing <a href="/proverbs/25-21.htm">Proverbs 25:21-22</a>. In the ancient world, sharing a meal was a significant act of fellowship and peace. This command challenges believers to transcend cultural norms of retribution and instead demonstrate God's love through tangible actions.<p><b>if he is thirsty, give him a drink</b><br>Providing water to the thirsty is a basic act of compassion, reflecting the hospitality norms of the ancient Near East. This act symbolizes meeting essential needs and mirrors Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35</a>, where caring for the least of these is equated with serving Christ Himself.<p><b>For in so doing, you will heap burning coals on his head</b><br>This metaphorical expression has been interpreted in various ways. Some suggest it refers to causing an enemy to feel shame and remorse, leading to repentance. Others see it as a reference to an ancient Egyptian ritual where carrying coals signified repentance. The imagery underscores the transformative power of unexpected kindness, aligning with the biblical principle that God's kindness leads to repentance (<a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the early Christian community in Rome, which was diverse and included both Jewish and Gentile believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>In this context, "enemies" refers to those who oppose or persecute believers, a common experience for early Christians.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/proverbs_25_-21-22.htm">Proverbs 25:21-22</a></b><br>The Old Testament source of the quote used by Paul, highlighting the continuity of biblical teaching on responding to enemies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/burning_coals.htm">Burning Coals</a></b><br>A metaphorical expression with roots in ancient practices, possibly symbolizing repentance or divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_with_kindness.htm">Responding with Kindness</a></b><br>The command to feed and give drink to our enemies challenges us to respond with kindness rather than retaliation.

Now, in a complete reversal of natural instinct, he says, &#8220;On the contrary.&#8221; Rather than pay back wrong with wrong, we are called to active good. Jesus said the same in <a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>: &#8220;Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.&#8221; Peter echoed it: &#8220;Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/3-9.htm">1 Peter 3:9</a>). The pattern is unmistakable: genuine faith treats hostility with generosity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If your enemy is hungry, feed him</b><p>The command is simple and literal. Hunger is one of the most basic human needs; meeting it demonstrates love in unmistakable terms.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s people have always been urged to show kindness, even to foes. <a href="/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4&#8211;5</a> pictures returning a stray donkey to an enemy.<p>&#8226; Jesus multiplied bread for crowds who would later cry, &#8220;Crucify Him!&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-10.htm">John 6:10&#8211;14</a>; 19:15).<p>&#8226; In <a href="/2_kings/6-21.htm">2 Kings 6:21&#8211;23</a>, Elisha refused to let Israel slaughter captured Arameans; instead he ordered a meal for them, and the raiders stopped coming.<p>Feeding an enemy may cost us time, money, and comfort, yet it mirrors the Lord who &#8220;sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>if he is thirsty, give him a drink</b><p>Thirst intensifies need. Offering water when someone is vulnerable disarms hostility. Think of Jesus at Jacob&#8217;s well, asking a Samaritan woman for a drink and then giving her living water (<a href="/john/4-7.htm">John 4:7&#8211;14</a>). <a href="/proverbs/25-21.htm">Proverbs 25:21</a>&#8212;Paul&#8217;s source here&#8212;pairs hunger and thirst because both spotlight practical love. Even a cup of cold water, Jesus said, brings reward (<a href="/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a>). Meeting a tangible need opens hearts to deeper spiritual truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For in so doing, you will heap burning coals on his head.</b><p>This vivid image isn&#8217;t a promise of secret revenge; it describes the sting of conviction that kindness often ignites.<p>&#8226; When David spared Saul in the cave, Saul wept and confessed, &#8220;You are more righteous than I&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/24-16.htm">1 Samuel 24:16&#8211;18</a>). David&#8217;s mercy piled &#8220;coals&#8221; on Saul&#8217;s conscience.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s kindness aims at repentance (<a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>). Loving deeds toward enemies may break their hardened resistance and lead them to God.<p>&#8226; If the enemy refuses to repent, the coals become evidence of rejected grace when God judges (<a href="/psalms/140-10.htm">Psalm 140:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22</a>&#8217;s next line: &#8220;and the LORD will reward you&#8221;).<p>Either way, we overcome evil with good (<a href="/romans/12-21.htm">Romans 12:21</a>), leaving vengeance to God while we keep our witness clear.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20</a> calls believers to meet an enemy&#8217;s basic needs&#8212;food and drink&#8212;turning hostility into an opportunity for grace. Such practical love mirrors Christ, pricks consciences, and leaves judgment with God. By blessing enemies, we refuse to be mastered by evil and instead display the conquering power of good.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Thou shalt heap coals of fire.</span>--Comp. <a href="/context/psalms/18-12.htm" title="At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.">Psalm 18:12-14</a>, where the phrase "coals of fire" is used of the divine vengeance. So here, but in a strictly metaphorical sense, it means, "Thou shalt take the best and most summary vengeance upon him."
