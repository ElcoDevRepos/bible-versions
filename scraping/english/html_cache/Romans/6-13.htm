In the cultural context of the Roman Empire, where Paul was writing, the body was often seen as a vessel for both honor and dishonor. The term "instruments" can also be translated as "weapons," suggesting a battle against sin. This aligns with the biblical theme of spiritual warfare (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>). The call to not offer one's body to sin echoes the Old Testament's emphasis on holiness and purity (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44</a>).<p><b>but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life</b><br>This phrase highlights the transformative power of salvation. The imagery of moving from death to life is central to Christian doctrine, symbolizing spiritual rebirth (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-7</a>). Historically, this reflects the early Christian understanding of baptism as a representation of dying to sin and rising to new life in Christ (<a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>). The call to present oneself to God is reminiscent of the sacrificial system in the Old Testament, where offerings were made to God as acts of worship (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>).<p><b>and present the parts of your body to Him as instruments of righteousness</b><br>Here, the focus shifts to using one's body for God's purposes. The concept of righteousness is deeply rooted in the character of God and His covenant with His people (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>). In the New Testament, righteousness is often associated with living in accordance with God's will (<a href="/matthew/5-6.htm">Matthew 5:6</a>). This phrase encourages believers to actively engage in righteous deeds, reflecting the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate example of righteousness (<a href="/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21-24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is writing to the Christian believers in Rome, providing theological insights and practical instructions for living a life that honors God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_christians.htm">Roman Christians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, these early Christians were living in a diverse and often morally challenging environment, requiring guidance on how to live out their faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin.htm">Sin</a></b><br>Personified as a force or power that believers are to resist, sin is depicted as something that can control and use the body for wicked purposes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate authority and the one to whom believers are to present themselves, living in righteousness as a response to His grace.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/death_to_life.htm">Death to Life</a></b><br>A metaphor for the transformation that occurs in believers who have accepted Christ, moving from spiritual death to eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_identity_in_christ.htm">Understanding Our Identity in Christ</a></b><br>Recognize that as believers, we have been brought from death to life.

The second of these reasons really proves nothing. Whatever the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 23, it is too far removed from the passage before us to be taken in any connection with it. Neither is the first reason at all cogent. <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span> bears the sense of <span class="accented">instruments</span> as well as of <span class="accented">weapons</span>, and may more suitably bear it here. When St. Paul elsewhere speaks of armour, it is the armour of <span class="accented">light</span>, or of <span class="accented">righteousness</span>, which we are told to <span class="accented">take up</span>, and to <span class="accented">put on, in</span> order to fight against our spiritual enemies. Such a conception is inapplicable to our own <span class="accented">members</span>, which we have already, which we may use either for good or evil, and which require the protection of heavenly armour rather than being themselves armour; and we certainly could not be told to take them up or put them on. We may, in the next place, observe that the two clauses of this verse are differently expressed in two respects. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It is our <span class="accented">members</span> only that we are forbidden to yield to sin; but <span class="accented">ourselves</span>, with our members, we are bidden to yield to God. For few of the persons addressed, if even any, could be supposed, deliberately and of choice, to offer their whole being to the service of sin as such; they were only liable to succumb to sin, in this or that way, through soliciting lusts. But the regenerate Christian offers and presents his whole serf to God, and desires to be his entirely. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> In the first clause we find the present imperative, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>; but in the second the aorist imperative, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. The distinction between the two tenses in the imperative is thus expressed in Matthiae's 'Greek Grammar:' "that the aorist designates an action passing by, and considered abstractedly in its completion, but the present a continued and frequently repeated action." Our giving ourselves to God is something done once for all; our yielding our members as instruments of sin is a succession of acts of yielding. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/6-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{Do} not</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#951;&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#275;de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3366.htm">Strong's 3366: </a> </span><span class="str2">And not, not even, neither&#8230;nor.
