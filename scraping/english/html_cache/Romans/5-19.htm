Adam's act of eating the forbidden fruit is seen as the original sin, which introduced sin and death into the world. This concept is foundational in understanding the doctrine of original sin, which posits that all humans inherit a sinful nature due to Adam's transgression. Theologically, Adam is often viewed as a "type" of Christ, serving as a representative head of humanity, whose actions have consequences for all his descendants.<p><b>the many were made sinners</b><br>The term "the many" refers to all of humanity, indicating the universal impact of Adam's sin. This phrase underscores the idea that sin is not just an individual act but a condition that affects all people. The concept of being "made sinners" suggests a legal or positional standing before God, where humanity is seen as guilty and in need of redemption. This aligns with passages like <a href="/psalms/51-5.htm">Psalm 51:5</a>, which speaks of being sinful from birth, and <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>, which states that all have sinned.<p><b>so also through the obedience of the one man</b><br>This refers to Jesus Christ, whose life and sacrificial death are seen as acts of perfect obedience to God. Unlike Adam, Jesus lived a sinless life and fulfilled the law completely (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>). His obedience is often highlighted in passages such as <a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>, which describes Jesus humbling Himself and becoming obedient to death on a cross. This obedience is central to the Christian understanding of atonement and redemption.<p><b>the many will be made righteous</b><br>This phrase speaks to the transformative power of Christ's obedience, which offers justification and righteousness to all who believe in Him. The "many" here refers to those who accept Christ's sacrifice and are justified by faith, as explained in <a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22-24</a>. This righteousness is not earned but is imputed to believers, meaning it is credited to their account because of Christ's work. This concept is foundational to the doctrine of justification by faith, a key tenet of Christian theology, and is echoed in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>, which states that believers become the righteousness of God in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam.htm">Adam</a></b><br>The first man created by God, whose disobedience in the Garden of Eden led to the fall of humanity and the introduction of sin into the world.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The Son of God, whose obedience unto death on the cross provides the means for humanity's justification and righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/garden_of_eden.htm">Garden of Eden</a></b><br>The place where Adam's disobedience occurred, resulting in the fall of man.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cross.htm">The Cross</a></b><br>The event and place where Jesus' obedience was fully realized, offering redemption to mankind.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/humanity.htm">Humanity</a></b><br>Represented by "the many," who are affected by both Adam's disobedience and Christ's obedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_impact_of_one_man's_actions.htm">The Impact of One Man's Actions</a></b><br>Adam's disobedience had a profound impact on all of humanity, illustrating the far-reaching consequences of sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_obedience.htm">The Power of Obedience</a></b><br>Jesus' obedience demonstrates the transformative power of aligning with God's will, offering redemption and righteousness to many.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_choice.htm">The Role of Choice</a></b><br>Both Adam and Jesus made choices with significant outcomes, reminding us of the importance of our daily decisions in following God's path.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/righteousness_through_faith.htm">Righteousness Through Faith</a></b><br>Just as sin entered through one man, righteousness is available through faith in Jesus Christ, emphasizing the grace of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_obedience.htm">Living in Obedience</a></b><br>As followers of Christ, we are called to live in obedience, reflecting His righteousness in our lives and impacting those around us.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_5_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 5:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Adam_s_sin_in_Romans_5_19.htm">How does Romans 5:19 illustrate the impact of Adam's disobedience on humanity?

The obedience of Christ was an element in the atonement. (Comp. <a href="/philippians/2-8.htm" title="And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross.">Philippians 2:8</a>, where it is said that he "became obedient unto death;" and <a href="/hebrews/10-7.htm" title="Then said I, See, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do your will, O God.">Hebrews 10:7</a>, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God," specially in connection with the atonement.) But if we interpret St. Paul by himself, we must not see in it the sole element to the exclusion of the "propitiatory sacrifice" of <a href="/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm" title="And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling smell.">Ephesians 5:2</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-6.htm" title="Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.">1Timothy 2:6</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For as through the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the One shall the many be made righteous.</span> As to the significance of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, see under ver. 15. The phrase, if taken as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, would seem here to imply even more than in ver. 15; for there it was only said that "the gift... abounded unto the many;" here an actual result is expressed by the future, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. But even so the universality of final salvation need not necessarily follow. The phrase is, "shall be constituted righteous," and might only mean that all will be put into the position of justified persons, capable as such of salvation, just as all had, through the first transgression, been put into the position of sinners, liable as such to condemnation; and the future tense might be taken to denote the continuance, through all future ages, of the availing effect of the accomplished atonement. Further, it may be remarked that if universal final salvation did seem to follow from the passage before us, it would still have to be understood consistently with the purport of ch. 6, 7, and 8, which follow. In them the practical result to the believer of his justification through Christ is treated; and renunciation of sin, "living after the Spirit," is postulated as the condition for attaining the life eternal. Hence, if the doctrine of "eternal hope" be sound (and who can fail to desire that it should be so?), it must be to some unknown reconciliation beyond the limits of the present life that we must look in the case of those who have not fulfilled the necessary conditions here. Thus, further, the doctrine cannot legitimately be allowed to affect our view of our responsibilities now. To us the only doctrine distinctly revealed on the subject of salvation is that it is in this present life that we are to make our "calling and election sure." Two ways are put before us - the way of life, and the way of death; the one leading to <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the other to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. In vers. 6-10 (as elsewhere, see note on Romans 3:25) it was through the <span class="accented">death</span>, the <span class="accented">blood</span>, of Christ that we were said to have been reconciled to God; here it is through his <span class="accented">obedience</span>, opposed to the <span class="accented">disobedience</span> of Adam. Though the doctrine of the atonement, in all its depth, is beyond our comprehension now (see above on ver. 9), yet it is important for us to observe the various aspects in which it is presented to us in Scripture. Here the idea suggested is that of Christ, as the Representative of humanity, satisfying Divine righteousness by perfect <span class="accented">obedience</span> to the Divine will, and thus offering to God for man what man had lest the power of offering (cf. <a href="/psalms/40-10.htm">Psalm 40:10</a>, "Lo, I come to fulfil thy will, O my God;" and <a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-9.htm">Hebrews 10:9</a>, <span class="accented">et seq</span>.; also <a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>, "became <span class="accented">obedient</span> unto death, even the death of the cross"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/5-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For just as</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8037;&#963;&#960;&#949;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;sper)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5618.htm">Strong's 5618: </a> </span><span class="str2">Just as, as, even as.
