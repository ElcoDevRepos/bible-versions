In the context of Roman society, slavery was a common institution, and the fear associated with it was well understood. The "spirit of slavery" suggests a life bound by the law and sin, leading to fear of judgment and death. This echoes the Israelites' experience in Egypt, where they lived in bondage and fear. Theologically, it contrasts the old covenant of the law, which brought awareness of sin and fear of punishment, with the new covenant of grace through Jesus Christ. The believer is no longer under the law's condemnation (<a href="/romans/8.htm">Romans 8:1</a>) but is set free through Christ (<a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>).<p><b>but you received the Spirit of adoption to sonship</b><br>The concept of adoption in Roman culture was significant, as adopted children were given full rights and privileges of natural-born children, including inheritance rights. This adoption is not merely a legal change but a relational one, signifying a new identity and status before God. The "Spirit of adoption" refers to the Holy Spirit, who confirms the believer's status as a child of God. This adoption fulfills the promise of a new relationship with God, as seen in the prophecy of <a href="/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>, where those not considered God's people would be called "sons of the living God." It also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham, making believers heirs according to the promise (<a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>).<p><b>by whom we cry, &#8220;Abba! Father!&#8221;</b><br>"Abba" is an Aramaic term for father, expressing intimacy and trust, akin to "Daddy" in English. This term was used by Jesus in <a href="/mark/14-36.htm">Mark 14:36</a> during His prayer in Gethsemane, highlighting the close relationship He had with the Father. The use of "Abba! Father!" signifies the believer's intimate relationship with God, made possible through the Holy Spirit. It reflects the fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, where God promises to write His law on the hearts of His people, establishing a personal relationship with them. This cry is a testament to the believer's assurance and confidence in their relationship with God, free from fear and full of love, as emphasized in 1 <a href="/john/4-18.htm">John 4:18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is writing to the believers in Rome, providing theological insights and practical guidance for living a Christian life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_christians.htm">Roman Christians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, these early Christians were living in a diverse and often challenging environment, facing both internal and external pressures.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_spirit.htm">Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Referred to as the "Spirit of sonship," the Holy Spirit plays a crucial role in the believer's life, transforming their relationship with God from one of fear to one of intimate family connection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/abba,_father.htm">Abba, Father</a></b><br>A term of endearment and intimacy, "Abba" is an Aramaic word that reflects a close, personal relationship with God, akin to calling Him "Daddy" or "Papa."<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/spirit_of_slavery.htm">Spirit of Slavery</a></b><br>Represents the old way of living under the law and fear, contrasting with the freedom and relationship offered through the Spirit of sonship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/freedom_from_fear.htm">Freedom from Fear</a></b><br>As believers, we are no longer bound by a spirit of fear.
