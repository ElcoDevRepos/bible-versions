In the context of Romans, Paul is addressing Jewish and Gentile believers in Rome, highlighting the importance of returning to the Scriptures for understanding God's plan. The rhetorical question invites readers to consider the biblical foundation of faith and righteousness. This approach aligns with Jewish traditions of interpreting the Torah and underscores the continuity of God's revelation from the Old Testament to the New Testament.<p><b>&#8220;Abraham believed God,</b><br>Abraham is a central figure in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions, often referred to as the father of faith. His belief in God is foundational for understanding the concept of faith in the Bible. In <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>, Abraham's faith is demonstrated when he trusts God's promise of numerous descendants despite his old age and Sarah's barrenness. This act of belief is not merely intellectual assent but a deep trust in God's character and promises. Abraham's faith is a prototype of the faith required for salvation, illustrating that righteousness comes through faith, not works.<p><b>and it was credited to him as righteousness.&#8221;</b><br>The concept of crediting or imputing righteousness is central to Paul's argument about justification by faith. In the cultural and historical context, this term is akin to accounting language, where something is reckoned or counted towards someone's account. Abraham's faith was counted as righteousness, meaning he was declared righteous before God not because of his actions but because of his faith. This principle is echoed in other New Testament passages, such as <a href="/galatians/3-6.htm">Galatians 3:6-9</a> and <a href="/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>, reinforcing the idea that righteousness is a gift from God, received through faith. This imputation of righteousness is a type of the righteousness believers receive through faith in Jesus Christ, who fulfills the promises made to Abraham.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>A key patriarch in the Bible, Abraham is often referred to as the "father of faith."

God&#8217;s Word declares that Abraham placed simple trust in Him, and in response God credited perfect righteousness to Abraham&#8217;s account. This same pattern&#8212;faith apart from works leading to full acceptance before God&#8212;remains the bedrock for every believer today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) The Apostle gives a proof of this from Scripture. Abraham was not justified by works, and therefore had nothing to boast of in God's sight. He was justified by faith. His righteousness was not real, but imputed. His faith was treated as if it had been equivalent to a righteousness of works. It met with the same acceptance in the sight of God that a righteousness of works would have done. But--the argument goes on--faith carries with it no such idea of merit or debt as works. It is met by a pure act of grace on the part of God.<p><span class= "bld">Abraham believed God.</span>--The quotation is taken from <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm" title="And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.">Genesis 15:6</a>, where it appears as a comment upon Abraham's belief in the promise that he should have a numerous posterity. The same passage is elaborately commented upon by Philo and others, so that it would seem to have been a common topic in the Jewish schools. It should be noticed that the word "faith" is not used in quite the same sense in the original and in the application. In Abraham's case it was trust in the fulfilment of the divine promise, in St. Paul's sense it is rather enthusiastic adhesion to a person. This is part of the general enlargement and deepening of the Old Testament terminology by St. Paul. A writer of less profundity (though marked by striking and elevated qualities), the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, applies the word more strictly. (See <a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm" title="By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing where he went.">Hebrews 11:8</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) In <a href="/james/2-23.htm" title="And the scripture was fulfilled which said, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.">James 2:23</a> the word has the still thinner meaning of a merely intellectual assent. St Paul quotes the same passage in the same sense as here in <a href="/galatians/3-6.htm" title="Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.">Galatians 3:6</a>. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus B: On the Meaning of the word Faith.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">It was counted unto him.</span>--It should be observed that the same words are translated by the Authorised version here, "it was <span class= "ital">counted unto</span> him;" in <a href="/romans/4-9.htm" title="Comes this blessedness then on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.">Romans 4:9</a>, "faith was <span class= "ital">reckoned to</span> Abraham;" in <a href="/romans/4-22.htm" title="And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.">Romans 4:22</a>, "it was <span class= "ital">imputed unto</span> him;" in <a href="/galatians/3-6.htm" title="Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.">Galatians 3:6</a>, "it was <span class= "ital">accounted to</span> him;" in <a href="/james/2-23.htm" title="And the scripture was fulfilled which said, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.">James 2:23</a>, "it was <span class= "ital">imputed to</span> him."

It has a peculiar cogency in the general argument from being in connection with, and with reference to, one of the Divine promises to Abraham of an unnumbered seed; so that it may be understood with an extended application to those who were to inherit the blessing, as well as to the "father of the faithful," and so declaring the principle of justification for all the "children of the promise." Further, it would be peculiarly telling as addressed to the Jews, who made such a point of their descent from Abraham as the root of all their position of privilege (cf. <a href="/psalms/105-6.htm">Psalm 105:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-2.htm">Isaiah 51:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>; <a href="/luke/3-8.htm">Luke 3:8</a>; <a href="/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>).
