In the context of Romans, Paul is emphasizing that ignorance of the law does not exempt one from accountability. Historically, Gentiles were not given the Law of Moses, which was a covenant specifically with Israel. However, Paul argues that they still have a moral law written on their hearts (<a href="/romans/2-14.htm">Romans 2:14-15</a>), which holds them accountable. This reflects the universal nature of sin and the need for redemption through Christ.<p><b>will also perish apart from the law</b><br>The term "perish" here indicates eternal separation from God, a concept consistent with the biblical understanding of spiritual death. This phrase suggests that even without the Mosaic Law, Gentiles are still subject to God's judgment due to their inherent sinfulness. The idea is that God's justice is impartial and applies to all humanity, regardless of their knowledge of the law. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>).<p><b>and all who sin under the law</b><br>This refers to the Jews who were given the Mosaic Law. The historical context is the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where the law was given as a guide for living in accordance with God's will. However, possessing the law does not guarantee righteousness, as Paul points out that the law reveals sin but does not provide the power to overcome it (<a href="/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-12</a>). This highlights the need for a savior, as the law alone cannot justify.<p><b>will be judged by the law</b><br>The law serves as the standard by which those who have it will be judged. This underscores the principle that greater knowledge brings greater responsibility. In the Jewish context, the law was seen as a blessing and a guide, but it also brought accountability. Theologically, this points to the insufficiency of the law for salvation and the necessity of faith in Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). The judgment by the law reveals the need for grace, as no one can perfectly keep the law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is addressing both Jewish and Gentile believers in Rome, emphasizing the universality of sin and the need for salvation through Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_believers.htm">Jewish Believers</a></b><br>Those who are "under the law," meaning they have received the Mosaic Law and are judged by it.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentile_believers.htm">Gentile Believers</a></b><br>Those who are "apart from the law," meaning they have not received the Mosaic Law but are still accountable for their actions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rome.htm">Rome</a></b><br>The city where the recipients of this letter reside, a diverse community of Jews and Gentiles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law given to the Israelites, which serves as a standard for judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/universality_of_sin.htm">Universality of Sin</a></b><br>Both Jews and Gentiles are under sin, whether they have the law or not.

Sin is still sin, whether or not a person holds a scroll of commandments in hand. Creation itself testifies to God&#8217;s righteous standards (<a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18-20</a>), so no one can plead total ignorance. Even without Sinai&#8217;s tablets, the conscience bears witness (<a href="/romans/2-14.htm">Romans 2:14-15</a>). Think of Cornelius before meeting Peter&#8212;devout, yet still a sinner in need of the gospel (<a href="/bsb/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will also perish apart from the law</b><p>&#8220;Perish&#8221; is sobering: eternal separation from God, not mere physical death (<a href="/john/3-18.htm">John 3:18</a>; <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). The absence of a written code does not grant immunity. Just as a driver ignorant of the speed limit can still be ticketed for reckless driving, so the Gentile faces real accountability. <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12-15</a> pictures all the dead, great and small, judged by what is written in God&#8217;s books&#8212;not by personal claims of unawareness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all who sin under the law</b><p>Now Paul turns to those who possess the Law&#8212;Israel.<p>&#8226; They enjoy covenant privileges (<a href="/psalms/147-19.htm">Psalm 147:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; They hear the commandments weekly in synagogue (<a href="/acts/15-21.htm">Acts 15:21</a>).<p>&#8226; They are therefore &#8220;under the Law&#8221; (<a href="/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19-20</a>).<p>Yet privilege heightens responsibility.

Only the gospel&#8212;&#8220;the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes&#8221; (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>)&#8212;rescues either group from perishing or being condemned by the Law.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) Jew and Gentile alike will be judged, each by the method proper to his case; the Jew by the written Law against which he has sinned, the Gentile by the unwritten law of conscience against which he too has sinned. The mere hearing of the Law will bring no exemption to the Jew; and, on the other hand, the Gentile, who, at the dictates of conscience, acts as if he were subject to law, shall have the full benefit that law can give him. In fact, his conscience is to him a law. He undergoes precisely the same conflict of self- condemnation and self-acquittal as one who has a written law to refer to.
