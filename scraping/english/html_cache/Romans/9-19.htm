It reflects the style of diatribe, a method of argumentation where the writer anticipates and responds to potential questions or criticisms. This approach helps clarify theological points and engage readers in deeper reflection. Paul often uses this technique to address concerns or misunderstandings about his teachings, as seen in other parts of Romans and his epistles.<p><b>&#8220;Then why does God still find fault?</b><br>This question addresses the issue of divine justice and human responsibility. It reflects a common concern about the fairness of God's judgment if His will is ultimately irresistible. The question implies a tension between God's sovereignty and human accountability, a theme that runs throughout Romans. This tension is also seen in the Old Testament, such as in the story of Pharaoh, where God hardens Pharaoh's heart, yet Pharaoh is still held accountable for his actions (<a href="/exodus/9-12.htm">Exodus 9:12-16</a>). The question challenges readers to consider the nature of God's justice and the mystery of His sovereign will.<p><b>For who can resist His will?&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the belief in God's omnipotence and the idea that His purposes cannot be thwarted. It echoes themes found in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, where God declares that His counsel shall stand and He will accomplish all His purpose. The rhetorical question emphasizes the futility of opposing God's will, highlighting His ultimate authority over creation. This concept is central to understanding the biblical portrayal of God's sovereignty, as seen in the lives of biblical figures like Job, who acknowledges God's unchallengeable power (<a href="/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a>). The phrase invites reflection on the relationship between divine sovereignty and human freedom, a complex theological issue that has been debated throughout church history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, addressing the Roman church and tackling deep theological questions about God's sovereignty and human responsibility.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile believers, who were grappling with issues of faith, law, and grace.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>Central to the discussion, as Paul explores His sovereignty, justice, and mercy in the context of salvation and human responsibility.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation often referenced in <a href="/bsb/romans/9.htm">Romans 9</a>, as Paul discusses God's promises and the role of Israel in His redemptive plan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>Mentioned earlier in <a href="/bsb/romans/9.htm">Romans 9</a> as an example of God's sovereign will in hardening hearts to fulfill His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_sovereignty.htm">Understanding God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God's will is supreme and beyond human challenge.

Throughout <a href="/bsb/romans/9.htm">Romans 9</a> he has shown that God&#8217;s purposes stand not by human effort but by His sovereign choice (<a href="/romans/9-11.htm">Romans 9:11-13</a>; 9:16). By posing an imagined questioner, Paul:<p>&#8226; Invites us into an honest conversation, much like he did earlier in <a href="/romans/3-1.htm">Romans 3:1-8</a>, where he fielded possible misunderstandings.<p>&#8226; Reminds us that grappling with divine sovereignty is not new; believers have always wrestled with the tension between God&#8217;s choice and human response (see <a href="/job/40-2.htm">Job 40:2</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-2.htm">Malachi 1:2-3</a> compared with <a href="/romans/9-12.htm">Romans 9:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Signals that what follows is pastoral as well as theological&#8212;he is guiding readers through potential stumbling points, not silencing sincere inquiry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then why does God still find fault?</b><p>The heart of the objection is moral: If God directs history, can He rightly hold anyone accountable? Paul later answers with the potter-clay analogy (<a href="/romans/9-20.htm">Romans 9:20-21</a>), but here we pause to notice:<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently affirms personal responsibility even under God&#8217;s overarching plan (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>).<p>&#8226; Pharaoh is Paul&#8217;s immediate example (<a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17-18</a>). Though God hardened him, Exodus repeatedly notes Pharaoh hardening his own heart (<a href="/exodus/8-15.htm">Exodus 8:15, 32</a>). Both truths stand side by side.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s judgment is always righteous; <a href="/romans/3-5.htm">Romans 3:5-6</a> insists that if He could not judge justly, the world would have no moral order.<p>&#8226; Divine fault-finding is aimed at displaying mercy as well as justice (<a href="/romans/9-22.htm">Romans 9:22-23</a>), leading people to repentance (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For who can resist His will?</b><p>The objector concludes that God&#8217;s will is irresistible, so human effort seems futile. Paul affirms God&#8217;s unstoppable purpose yet rejects fatalism:<p>&#8226; God &#8220;works out everything according to the counsel of His will&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>), and &#8220;none can ward off His hand&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/4-35.htm">Daniel 4:35</a>).<p>&#8226; At the same time, Scripture calls everyone to respond: &#8220;Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/3-15.htm">Hebrews 3:15</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27-28</a> shows both truths intertwined: Herod, Pilate, and the crowds acted freely, yet their deeds fulfilled &#8220;what Your hand and Your purpose had determined beforehand.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The tension drives us to humility. Paul&#8217;s next words&#8212;&#8220;But who are you, O man, to answer back to God?&#8221; (<a href="/romans/9-20.htm">Romans 9:20</a>)&#8212;do not dismiss questions; they place them within the Creator-creature relationship (<a href="/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/9-19.htm">Romans 9:19</a> voices a natural human protest: If God&#8217;s sovereign will prevails, how can He hold people responsible? Paul acknowledges the question, upholds God&#8217;s right to judge, and maintains human accountability. Scripture&#8217;s consistent witness is that God&#8217;s will is indeed irresistible, yet He calls each person to repent and believe. Instead of pitting sovereignty against responsibility, the verse invites us to trust the righteous character of God who weaves both truths together for His glory and our good.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19-21) These verses contain the third part of the vindication, which is based upon a possible extension of the objection. Not only might it seem as if this absolute choice and rejection was unjust in itself, but also unjust in its consequences. How can a man be blamed or punished, when his actions are determined for him? The Apostle meets this by a simple but emphatic assertion of the absolute and unquestionable prerogative of God over His creatures.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who resisteth his will?</span> Having shown that <span class="accented">injustice</span> cannot be imputed to God in hardening as well as having mercy on whom he will, the apostle now meets the supposed difficulty of understanding why men should be held <span class="accented">guilty</span> before God for but being as he wills them to be. It is immediately suggested by Pharaoh's case, which led to the conclusion, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>; but the apostle foresees that an objection might be raised on this ground to his finding fault with the Jews for rejecting Christ, and them he especially has in view in what follows. It may be observed here that there is undoubtedly a difficulty to the human mind in reconciling theoretically Divine omnipotence with human free-will and responsibility. (On the general question, see notes on ch. 8.) St. Paul here, after his manner, does not attempt to solve the general problem, confining himself for the present to the Divine side of it. His answer, in vers. 20, 21, is simply to the effect that God has the absolute right as well as power to deal with his own creation as he pleases, and that man is in no position to "contend with the Almighty" (see <a href="/job/40-2.htm">Job 40:2</a>). He brings in from the prophets the illustration of the potter's power and right over the clay, which he fashions and deals with as he chooses. It will be seen, however, as we go on, that this illustration by no means involves, as by some it has been supposed to do, the idea of rejection and condemnation irrespectively of desert. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/9-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">One of you will say</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Ereis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Future Indicative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2046.htm">Strong's 2046: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably a fuller form of rheo; an alternate for epo in certain tenses; to utter, i.e. Speak or say.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to me,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(moi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
