The term "brothers" indicates a close-knit community of faith, reflecting the early Christian understanding of the church as a family. This familial language is consistent with Paul's other letters, where he often uses "brothers" to foster unity and mutual care among believers (e.g., <a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>).<p><b>to watch out for those who create divisions and obstacles</b><br>Paul warns against individuals who disrupt the unity of the church. Divisions and obstacles can refer to false teachings or behaviors that lead believers away from the core message of the Gospel. In the early church, such issues often arose from Judaizers or Gnostic influences, which sought to impose additional requirements or esoteric knowledge beyond the Gospel. This echoes Jesus' warnings about false prophets (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>) and Paul's own experiences with divisive figures (<a href="/galatians/2-4.htm">Galatians 2:4</a>).<p><b>that are contrary to the teaching you have learned</b><br>The "teaching" refers to the apostolic doctrine that Paul and others had delivered to the church. This teaching is rooted in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, as well as the ethical and moral instructions derived from it. The early church placed a strong emphasis on maintaining the purity of this teaching, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>, where believers devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching. The phrase underscores the importance of doctrinal integrity and the dangers of deviating from the foundational truths of Christianity.<p><b>Turn away from them</b><br>Paul's instruction to "turn away" is a call for decisive action to maintain the purity and unity of the church. This directive aligns with other scriptural admonitions to avoid false teachers and those who cause division (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a>, <a href="/titus/3-10.htm">Titus 3:10</a>). The early church faced numerous challenges from within and without, and maintaining doctrinal purity was essential for its survival and growth. This command reflects the seriousness with which the early Christians were to guard against influences that could lead them astray from the truth of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Romans, providing guidance and instruction to the early Christian church in Rome.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers in Rome.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/divisive_individuals.htm">Divisive Individuals</a></b><br>Those who create divisions and obstacles within the church, contrary to the teachings of the apostles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_christian_teachings.htm">The Early Christian Teachings</a></b><br>The foundational doctrines and teachings that the early church received from the apostles, rooted in the teachings of Jesus Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_community.htm">The Church Community</a></b><br>The collective body of believers who are called to unity and adherence to sound doctrine.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/guard_against_division.htm">Guard Against Division</a></b><br>Believers are called to be vigilant and discerning, recognizing those who cause division and disrupt the unity of the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/adherence_to_sound_doctrine.htm">Adherence to Sound Doctrine</a></b><br>It is crucial to remain steadfast in the teachings of the apostles and reject any teachings that deviate from the truth of the Gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_unity.htm">The Importance of Unity</a></b><br>Unity in the church is a reflection of the body of Christ; believers should strive to maintain harmony and peace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_and_action.htm">Discernment and Action</a></b><br>Christians must exercise discernment in identifying false teachings and take action by turning away from those who promote them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_accountability.htm">Community Accountability</a></b><br>The church community should hold each other accountable to the teachings of Christ, encouraging one another to remain faithful.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_16_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 16:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_spot_division_creators_in_church.htm">How can we "watch out for those who create divisions" in our church?
