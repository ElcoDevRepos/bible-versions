In the Roman context, servants were common, and their loyalty was to their own masters, not to outsiders. This reflects the broader biblical principle found in <a href="/matthew/7.htm">Matthew 7:1</a>, "Do not judge, or you too will be judged." The idea is that judgment belongs to God, who is the ultimate master of all. This echoes the teaching of Jesus, who emphasized mercy and understanding over judgment. The cultural context of the Roman church, which included both Jewish and Gentile believers, often led to disputes over practices and observances, making this admonition particularly relevant.<p><b>To his own master he stands or falls.</b><br>This phrase underscores the accountability each believer has to God alone. In the historical context, a servant's success or failure was determined by their master, not by external opinions. This reflects the biblical theme of divine sovereignty, where God is the ultimate judge of human actions. Theologically, this aligns with <a href="/1_corinthians/4-4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:4-5</a>, where Paul states that it is the Lord who judges him, not human courts. This serves as a reminder that believers should focus on their relationship with God rather than being concerned with the judgments of others.<p><b>And he will stand,</b><br>This assurance speaks to the security and stability that comes from being under God's authority. Theologically, it reflects the doctrine of perseverance, where God sustains and upholds believers. This is consistent with <a href="/jude/1-24.htm">Jude 1:24</a>, which speaks of God being able to keep believers from falling. The phrase offers comfort and confidence that, despite human weaknesses, God's power ensures the believer's steadfastness.<p><b>for the Lord is able to make him stand.</b><br>This final phrase emphasizes God's omnipotence and grace. It highlights the belief that it is not by human effort but by divine enablement that one remains faithful. This is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>, where Paul expresses confidence that God will complete the good work He began in believers. It also points to the transformative power of God's grace, which is sufficient to uphold and strengthen believers in their spiritual journey.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, addressing the Christian community in Rome.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_christians.htm">Roman Christians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile believers, who were experiencing tensions over differing practices and beliefs.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/servant.htm">Servant</a></b><br>A metaphorical reference to believers, emphasizing their relationship to God as their master.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/master.htm">Master</a></b><br>Refers to God, who is the ultimate judge and authority over each believer.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>Jesus Christ, who empowers believers to stand firm in their faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_judgment.htm">Avoiding Judgment</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to refrain from judging others, recognizing that each person is accountable to God alone.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_god's_authority.htm">Recognizing God's Authority</a></b><br>Understanding that God is the ultimate authority and judge helps us to focus on our own walk with Him rather than critiquing others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_in_faith.htm">Encouragement in Faith</a></b><br>The assurance that the Lord is able to make us stand should encourage us to trust in His power and grace in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>In a diverse body of believers, we should strive for unity by respecting different practices and convictions, knowing that God is at work in each person.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_accountability.htm">Personal Accountability</a></b><br>Each believer is responsible for their own relationship with God, and should focus on living faithfully according to His guidance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_14_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 14:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_14_4_on_judging_believers.htm">How does Romans 14:4 guide us in judging fellow believers' actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lesson_of_self-accountability.htm">What does "to his own master he stands or falls" teach us?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Romans_14_4_s_role_in_church_disputes.htm">How can Romans 14:4 influence our approach to church disagreements?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Romans_14_4_Matthew_7_1-2_on_judging.htm">Connect Romans 14:4 with Matthew 7:1-2 on judging others.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Use_Romans_14_4_to_unify_community.htm">How can we apply Romans 14:4 to promote unity in our community?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Romans_14_4_on_judging_others.htm">How does Romans 14:4 address judging others within the Christian community?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Romans_14_4_God_s_authority_over_believers.htm">What authority does Romans 14:4 give to God over individual believers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Romans_14_4_s_impact_on_religious_biases.htm">How does Romans 14:4 challenge personal biases in religious practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_romans_14.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Romans 14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_happens_to_those_unaware_of_christ.htm">What is the fate of those unaware of Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/does_romans_14_promote_moral_relativism.htm">Romans 14 (entire chapter) &#8211; Does this chapter&#8217;s emphasis on personal conviction over collective rules lead to moral relativism within the church?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/judge_others_(matt_7_1_vs._john_7_24).htm">Should we judge others?

Paul reminds believers that every Christian ultimately answers to God, not to fellow believers.<p>&#8226; The question exposes the presumption behind passing judgment. Jesus warned, &#8220;Do not judge, or you will be judged&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-1.htm">Matthew 7:1&#8211;2</a>), and James adds, &#8220;There is only one Lawgiver and Judge&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-11.htm">James 4:11&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s earlier words in this chapter urge welcoming believers &#8220;without passing judgment on disputable matters&#8221; (<a href="/romans/14-1.htm">Romans 14:1</a>). The focus is on family discussions&#8212;issues like food, days, or other gray areas&#8212;not clear moral commands.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-3.htm">1 Corinthians 4:3&#8211;5</a> echoes the same humility: &#8220;It is the Lord who judges me&#8230; He will bring to light what is hidden.&#8221; God alone sees motives and hearts.<p>&#8226; Judging God&#8217;s servants places us outside our lane. As servants ourselves (<a href="/romans/6-22.htm">Romans 6:22</a>), our calling is love and mutual upbuilding, not policing doubtful matters (<a href="/romans/14-19.htm">Romans 14:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To his own master he stands or falls.</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;To his own master he stands or falls&#8221;. Paul shifts from the horizontal (believer-to-believer) to the vertical (believer-to-Lord).<p>&#8226; Every servant&#8217;s performance review is conducted by the Master. <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a> clarifies: &#8220;Each of us will give an account of himself to God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23&#8211;24</a> urges believers to work &#8220;as for the Lord and not for men&#8230; It is the Lord Christ you are serving.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The imagery of standing or falling reflects acceptance or rejection. Yet Scripture assures that Christ&#8217;s servants are evaluated by grace, not human opinion.<p>&#8226; This truth frees the church from micromanaging consciences. Our task: point one another to the Master, not replace Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.</b><p>The final clause offers confidence: &#8220;And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Stability rests on God&#8217;s sustaining power, not personal grit. Jude 24 praises &#8220;Him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a> promises that &#8220;He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion.&#8221; The same Lord who saved will uphold.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-24.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:24</a> underscores it: &#8220;The One who calls you is faithful, and He will do it.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Because the Lord guarantees perseverance, believers can extend patience to others still growing. Rather than condemn, we cooperate with God&#8217;s sanctifying work (<a href="/romans/15-1.htm">Romans 15:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/14-4.htm">Romans 14:4</a> dismantles the impulse to critique fellow Christians over secondary issues. Only God has the right to judge His servants; each believer answers directly to Him, and He alone ensures their standing. Trusting the Lord&#8217;s ability to keep His people frees us to trade judgment for encouragement, guarding unity while relying on God&#8217;s unfailing grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Who art thou?</span>--This is addressed to the weak. The Apostle indignantly challenges his right to judge. That right belongs to another tribunal, before which the conduct of the stronger Christian will not be condemned but approved and upheld.<p><span class= "bld">He standeth or falleth.</span>--It seems most in accordance with what precedes to take this of judicial condemnation or approval from the Master whom he serves--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Christ.<p><span class= "bld">Holden up.</span>--The same word as that in the clause following, and similar to that in the clause preceding--"Made to stand."<p><span class= "bld">God is able to make him stand.</span>--The true reading here is "the Lord"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Christ; the word is the same as "his Master" above. "Make him stand" seems to be still judicial. "Secure his acquittal," but with reference to his previous course of conduct on which that acquittal is grounded. The trial is not necessarily reserved for the last day, but is rather the judgment which Christ may be supposed at any moment to pass upon His servants. If they can sustain this judgment, it is only because His grace has enabled them so to act as not to be condemned by it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who art thou that judgest another man's servant?</span> (observe the emphatic position of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">to his own lord he standeth or falleth.

The <span class="accented">standing</span> or <span class="accented">falling</span> here spoken of may be taken to mean standing firm in, or falling from, a state of grace (cf. <a href="/romans/11-20.htm">Romans 11:20, 22</a>), rather than acceptance or rejection at the last judgment. "For God is able," etc., seems to require this meaning. The non-abstainer's freedom does not endanger his position; for God is powerful to sustain him, and to God alone he is accountable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/14-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#943;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
