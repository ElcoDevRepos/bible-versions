The law's purpose was to reveal sin (<a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>) and act as a tutor leading to Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>). However, it lacked the power to change the human heart or provide the means for overcoming sin.<p><b>in that it was weakened by the flesh,</b><br>The "flesh" refers to human nature in its fallen state, prone to sin and rebellion against God. The law was weakened because it relied on human ability to fulfill its demands, which was impossible due to the inherent sinfulness of humanity (<a href="/romans/7-18.htm">Romans 7:18</a>). The flesh's weakness made it impossible for the law to achieve righteousness.<p><b>God did by sending His own Son</b><br>God intervened where the law could not, by sending Jesus Christ, His own Son. This act of sending signifies divine initiative and grace. Jesus' coming was prophesied throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a> and <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, and fulfilled God's redemptive plan.<p><b>in the likeness of sinful man,</b><br>Jesus came in human form, fully identifying with humanity yet without sin (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>). The phrase emphasizes His genuine humanity while maintaining His sinlessness. This likeness allowed Him to be the perfect representative and substitute for humanity.<p><b>as an offering for sin.</b><br>Jesus' death was a sacrificial offering, fulfilling the Old Testament sacrificial system (<a href="/leviticus/16-15.htm">Leviticus 16:15-16</a>) and the prophecy of the suffering servant (<a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>). His sacrifice was once for all, providing atonement and reconciliation with God (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>He thus condemned sin in the flesh,</b><br>Through His death and resurrection, Jesus condemned sin, breaking its power and dominion over humanity (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-56.htm">1 Corinthians 15:56-57</a>). This condemnation means that sin's penalty was paid, and its power was nullified for those who are in Christ.

In Jesus&#8217; flesh sin was condemned once and for all, releasing believers from guilt and empowering a new life in the Spirit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) How was I freed? Thus. Precisely on that very point where the law of Moses showed its impotence--viz., in the attempt to get rid of sin, which it failed to do because of the counteracting influence of the flesh--precisely on this very point God interposed by sending His Son in a body of flesh similar to that in which sin resides, and as an offering to expiate human sin, and so dethroned and got rid of sin in the flesh which He had assumed. The flesh, the scene of its former triumphs, became now the scene of its defeat and expulsion.<p><span class= "bld">What the law could not do.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the impossible thing of the Law</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> "that which was impossible to the Law." The construction is what is called a <span class= "ital">nominativus pendens.</span> The phrase thus inserted at the beginning of the sentence characterises what follows. God did what the Law could not do--viz., condemned sin.<p><span class= "bld">In that it was weak through the flesh.</span>--There was one constant impediment in the way of the success of the Law, that it had to be carried out by human agents, beset by human frailty, a frailty naturally consequent upon that physical organisation with which man is endowed. Temptation and sin have their roots in the physical part of human nature, and they were too strong for the purely moral influence of the Law. The Law was limited in its operations by them, and failed to overcome them.<p><span class= "bld">In the likeness of sinful flesh</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in the flesh, but not in <span class= "ital">sinful</span> flesh. With a human body which was so far like the physical organisation of the rest of mankind, but yet which was not in Him, as in other men, the seat of sin; at once like and unlike.<p><span class= "bld">And for sin.</span>--This is the phrase which is used constantly in the LXX. ("more than fifty times in the Book of Leviticus alone"--Vaughan) for the "sin-offering." The essence of the original sin-offering was that it was accepted by an act of grace on the part of God, instead of the personal punishment of the offender. The exact nature of this "instead" appears to be left an open question in Scripture, and its further definition--if it is to be defined--belongs to the sphere of dogmatics rather than of exegesis. It must only be remembered that St. Paul uses, in regard to the sacrifice of Christ, similar language to that which is used in the Old Testament of this particular class of sacrifice, the sin-offering.<p><span class= "bld">Condemned sin.</span>--The meaning of this expression is brought out by the context. It is that which the Law was hindered from doing by the hold which sin had upon the flesh. That hold is made to cease through the participation of the believer in the death of Christ. Sin is, as it were, brought into court, and the cause given against it. It loses all its rights and claims over its victim. It is <span class= "ital">dispossessed</span> as one who is dispossessed of a property.<p><span class= "bld">In the flesh.</span>--In that same sphere, the flesh, in which sin had hitherto had the mastery, it now stood condemned and worsted; it was unable to exercise its old sway any longer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For what the Law could not do</span> (this is certainly what is meant by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.</span> The Law could not deliver from the domination of sin; it was weak for such a purpose (cf. <a href="/hebrews/7-18.htm">Hebrews 7:18, 19</a>) but this not through any defect in itself but as having to work through our sinful flesh which refused obedience. And it was not the office of law to regenerate; it could only command and threaten. Hence the deliverance came, and could only come, from God himself (and this in accordance with the grand idea of the whole Epistle, expressed by the phrase, "the righteousness of God"); and so he sent <span class="accented">his own</span> Son (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> his Son essentially - in a sense in which none of us can be called sons, himself Divine. The whole drift of the passage, as well as <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, requires this conception); and he sent him into the very sphere of things that required redemption, that by actual participation in it he might personally redeem it; for he sent him in likeness of our "flesh of sin." It is not said <span class="accented">in flesh of sin</span>; for that might imply sin in Christ's individual humanity: but, on the other hand, "in likeness" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) does not imply docetism, as though Christ's humanity were not real; for stress is evidently laid on the fact that it was in our actual human flesh that he "condemned" sin. The phrase appears to mean the same as what is expressed in <a href="/hebrews/2-17.htm">Hebrews 2:17</a> and Hebrews 4:15: <span class="greek">&#x1f6c;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. The addition of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> "adds to the how the wherefore" (Meyer). Both this and the preceding expression are most naturally and intelligibly connected with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>; not, as some say, with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> comes suitably after the former verb, as denoting the occasion and purpose of the sending (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <a href="/luke/5-14.htm">Luke 5:14</a>). In <a href="/hebrews/10-8.htm">Hebrews 10:8</a> (quoting from <a href="/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7</a> in the LXX.) we find <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, where the expression signifies offerings for sin; and in <a href="/hebrews/10-18.htm">Hebrews 10:18</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. The correspondence of phrase here suggests decidedly the idea of the purpose of <span class="accented">atonement</span> being intended to be expressed by it, though it does not follow that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is used here substantively as it seems to be in <a href="/hebrews/10-8.htm">Hebrews 10:8</a>. But in what sense are we to understand <span class="accented">condemned</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>) sin? We observe first that the verb appears to be suggested by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 1, the connection being that formerly sin condemned us, but now sin itself has been condemned; that is (as Meyer expresses it), deposed from its rule in the flesh - "jure sue dejectum" (Calvin). (Perhaps similarly, <a href="/john/16-11.htm">John 16:11</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>.) One view of the force of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span> (found in Origen, and taken by Erasmus and others), that it denotes the <span class="accented">punishment</span> of sin endured by Christ vicariously on the cross, is not only not obvious, but inconsistent also with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> preceding; for what the Law could not do, was not to punish sin, but to deliver from it. Nor is there, further, anything in the language used to confine the condemnation of sin, in whatever sense intended, to the atonement made for it on the cross itself. It was in the whole mission of the Saviour (expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) that sin was "condemned;" and the idea may include his triumph over it in his human life no less than the penalty paid for it on the cross in behalf of man. "In the flesh" (connected with <span class="accented">condemned</span>, not with <span class="accented">sin</span>) does not mean Christ's own flesh, but human nature generally. He represented man, having become for our sake the Soul of man; and we share his triumph over <span class="accented">sin</span>, made in our very human flesh, when we are baptized into his death, and become thereupon partakers of his resurrection. This idea, ever present to St. Paul's mind, is expressed in the next verse, where our own appropriation of the condemnation of sin in Christ is declared. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/8-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
