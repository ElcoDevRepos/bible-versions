The darkening of eyes symbolizes spiritual blindness and a lack of understanding. In the context of <a href="/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a>, Paul is discussing Israel's rejection of the Gospel and the resulting spiritual blindness. This blindness is not total or permanent, as Paul later explains that a remnant will be saved. The imagery of darkened eyes is used throughout Scripture to denote a lack of spiritual insight (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, <a href="/john/12-40.htm">John 12:40</a>). It serves as a warning of the consequences of rejecting God's truth.<p><b>and their backs be bent forever.</b><br>This part of the verse continues the theme of judgment and consequence. A bent back symbolizes oppression and burden, often associated with sin and its consequences. In the cultural context of the time, a straight back was a sign of strength and dignity, while a bent back indicated subjugation and weakness. The phrase "forever" emphasizes the severity and enduring nature of this judgment, though it is important to note that in the broader context of <a href="/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a>, Paul speaks of hope and restoration for Israel. The imagery of a bent back can also be seen as a type of the burden of sin that Christ came to lift, as He invites all to take His yoke, which is easy and light (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is addressing the spiritual state of Israel and the Gentiles' inclusion in God's salvation plan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of Israel is central to this passage, as Paul discusses their spiritual blindness and the consequences of their rejection of the Messiah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who are being grafted into the spiritual blessings originally intended for Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The quote in <a href="/romans/11-10.htm">Romans 11:10</a> is a reference to the words of King David, highlighting the continuity of God's message through the Old Testament.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_rome.htm">The Church in Rome</a></b><br>The original recipients of the letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile believers, who are being taught about God's overarching plan for salvation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_blindness.htm">Spiritual Blindness</a></b><br>Recognize that spiritual blindness is a serious condition that can affect anyone who turns away from God's truth.<br><br>Pray for spiritual insight and understanding, asking God to open your eyes to His truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Understand that God has a sovereign plan for both Israel and the Gentiles, and His purposes will be fulfilled.<br><br>Trust in God's overarching plan, even when it is not immediately clear to us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_hardening.htm">The Role of Hardening</a></b><br>Acknowledge that sometimes God allows hardening as a means to bring about a greater purpose, such as the inclusion of the Gentiles.<br><br>Reflect on areas in your life where you may be resistant to God's will and seek His guidance to soften your heart.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intercession_for_others.htm">Intercession for Others</a></b><br>Be encouraged to pray for those who are spiritually blind, asking God to reveal Himself to them.<br><br>Engage in sharing the Gospel with others, knowing that God can use you to help remove spiritual blindness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_11_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 11:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_11_10_God_s_judgment_on_blindness.htm">How does Romans 11:10 illustrate God's judgment on spiritual blindness and hardness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/OT_links_in_Romans_11_10.htm">What Old Testament connections can be found in Romans 11:10's message?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Keep_spiritual_eyes_open_avoid_warning.htm">How can we ensure our spiritual eyes remain open, avoiding Romans 11:10's warning?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Romans_11_10_inspire_discernment.htm">In what ways does Romans 11:10 encourage us to pray for spiritual discernment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Romans_11_10_Inspire_Gospel_sharing.htm">How can Romans 11:10 inspire us to share the Gospel with others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_let_their_eyes_be_darkened.htm">What does Romans 11:10 mean by "let their eyes be darkened"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Romans_11_10_God_s_justice_and_mercy.htm">How does Romans 11:10 relate to God's justice and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_quote_Old_Testament_in_Romans_11_10.htm">Why does Paul quote from the Old Testament in Romans 11:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_romans_11.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Romans 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what's_life's_purpose.htm">What is the purpose of existence and life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_glorification_mean.htm">What does glorification mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_is_genesis_13_14-17_reconciled.htm">In Genesis 13:14-17, God promises Abram that his descendants will inherit the land 'forever';

Because Scripture is both accurate and literal, we understand that God sometimes allows willful unbelief to deepen into judicial blindness.<p>- Darkness here pictures a loss of spiritual perception. <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a> records a similar judgment: &#8220;Make the heart of this people dull&#8230; blind their eyes.&#8221; Jesus echoes it in <a href="/john/12-40.htm">John 12:40</a>, and Paul reminds the church in <a href="/acts/28-26.htm">Acts 28:26-27</a> that the prophecy still stands.<p>- By granting the request, God shows He is not the author of unbelief but the righteous Judge who confirms people in the state they insist on (see <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so they cannot see</b><p>- The darkening leads to incapacity: they literally &#8220;cannot see.&#8221; Second Corinthians 4:4 says, &#8220;The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers,&#8221; and First Corinthians 2:14 explains why: the natural man &#8220;cannot understand&#8221; the things of the Spirit.<p>- This inability is not mere ignorance; it is moral and spiritual. The light of Christ stands before them, yet, like those in <a href="/matthew/13-15.htm">Matthew 13:15</a>, their eyes &#8220;hardly see.&#8221;<p>- Still, <a href="/bsb/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a> assures us the blindness is neither universal nor final. Verses 5-7 mention a remnant chosen by grace, and verse 25 hints the partial hardening will end when &#8220;the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and their backs be bent forever.</b><p>- The picture moves from eyesight to posture. A bent back speaks of ceaseless toil and captivity. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-65.htm">Deuteronomy 28:65</a> warns of a curse that brings &#8220;a trembling heart, failing eyes, and a despairing soul,&#8221; while <a href="/psalms/38-6.htm">Psalm 38:6</a> describes being &#8220;bent over and greatly bowed down.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/luke/13-11.htm">Luke 13:11</a> portrays a woman &#8220;bent double&#8221; until Jesus loosed her; her release illustrates that Christ alone straightens what sin has bowed. Until He intervenes, the burden remains.<p>- The word &#8220;forever&#8221; reads like a final sentence, yet <a href="/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11-12</a> immediately reveals divine purpose: Israel&#8217;s stumbling brings salvation to the nations, which in turn is meant to provoke Israel to envy and eventual restoration. Judgment stands, but mercy still beckons.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul cites <a href="/bsb/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a> to explain why so many of his kinsmen remain unresponsive to the gospel: God has granted the blindness and burden they chose, confirming them in unbelief. Their darkened eyes cannot discern Christ, and their bent backs picture the heavy yoke of sin and judgment. Yet even this stern verdict serves a redemptive aim, opening the door for Gentiles and setting the stage for Israel&#8217;s future awakening when they, too, will look upon the One they have pierced and find rest in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Let their eyes be darkened.</span>--In the Apostle's sense, "Let them be spiritually blinded, incapable of discerning or receiving the truth, and let their backs be bowed with the yoke of spiritual thraldom!" The Hebrew is, "Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not, and make their loins continually to shake." On which Perowne remarks: "The darkening of the eyes denotes weakness and perplexity, as the enlightening of the eyes denotes renewed vigour and strength. Similarly, the shaking of the loins is expressive of terror and dismay and feebleness."<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/11-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{May} their</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
