This aligns with <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>, where believers are encouraged to "pray without ceasing." The phrase suggests a disciplined spiritual life, where prayer is not sporadic but a regular practice. In the cultural context of the early church, prayer was a communal and individual act, vital for spiritual growth and guidance.<p><b>asking that now at last</b><br>Paul's request indicates a persistent desire, showing that he has been praying for this opportunity for some time. This persistence in prayer is reminiscent of Jesus' teaching in <a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18:1-8</a>, where the parable of the persistent widow illustrates the importance of continual prayer. The phrase "at last" suggests a culmination of hope and anticipation, reflecting Paul's deep longing to visit the Roman believers.<p><b>by God&#8217;s will</b><br>Paul acknowledges the sovereignty of God in his plans, demonstrating submission to divine authority. This reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/james/4-15.htm">James 4:15</a>, where believers are encouraged to say, "If it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that." The phrase underscores the belief that God's will is paramount, and human plans must align with divine purposes.<p><b>I may succeed in coming to you</b><br>Paul's desire to visit Rome is not merely personal but is driven by his mission to spread the Gospel. The historical context reveals that Rome was a significant center of influence in the ancient world, and Paul&#8217;s visit would have strategic importance for the spread of Christianity. This journey is later fulfilled in <a href="/acts/28.htm">Acts 28</a>, where Paul finally arrives in Rome, albeit as a prisoner, showing that God's plans may unfold in unexpected ways.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle and author of the letter to the Romans, expressing his desire to visit the believers in Rome.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_christians.htm">Roman Christians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers in Rome.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign being whose will Paul seeks in his plans to visit Rome.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prayer.htm">Prayer</a></b><br>The means by which Paul communicates his desires and seeks God's will.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rome.htm">Rome</a></b><br>The capital of the Roman Empire, a significant city for the spread of Christianity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_prayer.htm">The Importance of Prayer</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s example shows that prayer should be a constant part of our lives, especially when seeking God&#8217;s guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_god's_will.htm">Seeking God&#8217;s Will</a></b><br>Like Paul, we should prioritize God&#8217;s will over our own desires, trusting His timing and plans.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/desire_for_fellowship.htm">Desire for Fellowship</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s longing to visit the Roman Christians highlights the value of Christian fellowship and mutual encouragement.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_prayer.htm">Perseverance in Prayer</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s persistent prayers remind us to be steadfast and patient in our requests to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God&#8217;s Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognizing God&#8217;s control over our plans can bring peace and assurance as we navigate life&#8217;s uncertainties.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_1_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 1:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prioritize_prayer_for_others.htm">How can we prioritize prayer for others, as Paul does in Romans 1:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Paul_s_Rome_visit_Christian_fellowship.htm">What does Paul's desire to visit Rome teach about Christian fellowship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Romans_1_10_God_s_will_in_our_plans.htm">How does Romans 1:10 reflect God's will in our personal plans?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_seek_God_s_guidance_daily_25.htm">In what ways can we seek God's guidance in our daily decisions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Romans_1_10_Trust_God_s_timing.htm">How does Romans 1:10 encourage us to trust God's timing and plans?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Romans_1_10_on_God_s_will_for_us.htm">What does Romans 1:10 reveal about God's will in our personal lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Romans_1_10_Prayer_s_role_in_decisions.htm">How does Romans 1:10 emphasize the importance of prayer in decision-making?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Romans_1_10.htm">What historical context influenced Paul's writing in Romans 1:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_romans_1.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Romans 1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_does_prayer_not_heal_amputees.htm">Why does prayer not heal amputees?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_did_jesus_mean_by_'raise_him_up'.htm">How can I engage in a guided Christian prayer?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/who_wrote_the_book_of_romans.htm">Who is the author of the Book of Romans?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_sinner's_prayer.htm">What is the Sinner's Prayer?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Romans 1:10 Mean</div><b>in my prayers at all times</b><p>&#8226; Paul tells the Roman believers he remembers them ceaselessly.
