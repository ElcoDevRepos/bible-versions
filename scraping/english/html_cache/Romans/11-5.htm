It refers back to the earlier verses in <a href="/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a>, where Paul discusses how God has always preserved a faithful remnant of Israel, even when the majority turned away. This continuity emphasizes God's unchanging nature and His consistent plan throughout history.<p><b>at the present time</b><br>Paul is addressing the situation in his own day, during the first century. This was a time when the early church was expanding, and there was tension between Jewish and Gentile believers. The phrase highlights the immediacy and relevance of God's actions in preserving a remnant, showing that His work is ongoing and not confined to the past.<p><b>there is a remnant</b><br>The concept of a remnant is a recurring theme in the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament. It refers to a small, faithful group that remains true to God despite widespread unfaithfulness. This idea is seen in passages like <a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>, where God tells Elijah that He has preserved 7,000 in Israel who have not bowed to Baal. The remnant serves as a symbol of hope and continuity for God's people.<p><b>chosen by grace</b><br>This phrase underscores the doctrine of election, where God's choice is based on His grace rather than human merit. It aligns with <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which emphasizes salvation as a gift from God, not a result of works. This highlights the sovereignty of God in salvation and His initiative in preserving a faithful remnant. The emphasis on grace also points to the New Covenant, where salvation is extended to all through faith in Jesus Christ, fulfilling the promises made to Abraham.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological writings.
