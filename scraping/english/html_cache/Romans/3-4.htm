It emphasizes the importance of rejecting any notion that contradicts God's nature or His promises. In the context of Romans, Paul is addressing potential objections to the faithfulness of God despite human unfaithfulness. This phrase underscores the absolute certainty and reliability of God's character.<p><b>Let God be true and every man a liar.</b><br>This statement highlights the contrast between God's infallibility and human fallibility. It reflects the biblical theme that God's truth stands regardless of human opinion or behavior. This echoes <a href="/psalms/116-11.htm">Psalm 116:11</a>, where the psalmist acknowledges the deceitfulness of humanity compared to God's truth. It serves as a reminder that divine truth is the ultimate standard, and human perspectives must align with it.<p><b>As it is written:</b><br>This introduction to a scriptural quotation indicates Paul's reliance on the Hebrew Scriptures to support his argument. It shows the continuity between the Old and New Testaments and the fulfillment of God's word through Christ. Paul often uses this phrase to demonstrate that his teachings are rooted in the established Word of God.<p><b>&#8220;So that You may be proved right when You speak</b><br>This part of the verse is a citation from <a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>, where David acknowledges God's righteousness in judgment. It emphasizes that God's words and actions are always justified and righteous. The context of <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a> is David's repentance, highlighting the theme of God's justice and mercy. It underscores the idea that God's truth and righteousness are vindicated in His dealings with humanity.<p><b>and victorious when You judge.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase affirms God's ultimate authority and justice. It suggests that God's judgments are not only right but also triumphant over any falsehood or rebellion. The concept of God as judge is prevalent throughout Scripture, with His judgments being both a source of fear for the wicked and comfort for the righteous. This victory in judgment points to the eschatological hope of God's final and perfect justice, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a>, where Christ is depicted as the righteous judge.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, addressing the believers in Rome and discussing the righteousness of God and the faithfulness of His promises.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, whose truth and righteousness are being affirmed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mankind.htm">Mankind</a></b><br>Represented as fallible and often untruthful, in contrast to God's unwavering truth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The original speaker of the quote found in <a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>, which Paul references to illustrate God's righteousness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rome.htm">Rome</a></b><br>The city where the recipients of this letter resided, a diverse and influential center of the ancient world.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_unchanging_truth.htm">God's Unchanging Truth</a></b><br>God's truth is absolute and unchanging, regardless of human opinion or behavior.

Rather let God be seen to be true though all mankind should be proved false, even as the Psalmist looked upon his own sin as serving to enhance the triumph of God's justice. Speaking of that justice for the moment as if it could be arraigned before the bar of a still higher tribunal, he asserts its absolute and complete acquittal.<p><span class= "bld">That thou mightest be justified.</span>--Strictly, <span class= "ital">in order that,</span> here as in the Hebrew of the Psalm. Good is, in some way inscrutable to us, educed out of evil, and this is clearly foreseen by God, and forms part of His design, though so as not to interfere with the free-will of man. Religion assumes that the two things, free-will and omnipotence, are reconcilable, though how they are to be reconciled seems an insoluble problem. The same difficulty attaches to every system but one of blank fatalism and atheism. But the theory of fatalism if logically carried out would simply destroy human society.<p>Psalms 51, in which the quotation occurs, is commonly (in accordance with the heading), though perhaps wrongly, ascribed to David after his sin with Bathsheba. The effect of this sin is to throw out into the strongest relief the justice of the sentence by which it is followed and punished. The original is, "That thou mightest be just in thy speaking; that thou mightest be pure in thy judging." St. Paul adopts the rendering of the LXX., who make the last word passive instead of active, thus making it apply, not to the sentence given by God, but to the imaginary trial to which by a figure of speech that sentence itself is supposed to be submitted.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God forbid</span> (there is no better English phrase for expressing the indignant repudiation of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>): <span class="cmt_word">yea, let God be true</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "let his truth be established;" "Fiat, in judicio," Bengel), <span class="cmt_word">but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged</span>, We can hardly avoid recognizing a reference to <a href="/psalms/116-11.htm">Psalm 116:11</a> in "every man a liar, the words of the LXX. being exactly given, though the general purport of that psalm does not bear upon the present argument. The apostle takes this phrase from it as expressing well what he wants to say, viz. that though <span class="accented">all</span> men were false (in the sense expressed and implied by the previous <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), yet God's truth stands. But it only leads up to the second quotation from <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>, which is the important one, introduced by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. In its final words, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, the LXX. is followed (so also Vulgate, <span class="accented">cum</span> <span class="accented">judicaris</span>), though the Hebrew may be more correctly rendered, as in the Authorized Version, "be clear when thou judgest." The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of the LXX. may be understood passively in the sense of God being called to account, as men might be, for the justice of his dealings; or, perhaps, in a middle sense for entering into a suit or controversy with his people. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means "going to law" in <a href="/1_corinthians/6-1.htm">1 Corinthians 6:1, 6</a> (cf. also <a href="/matthew/5-40.htm">Matthew 5:40</a>), and in the LXX., with especial reference to a supposed <span class="accented">controversy</span> or <span class="accented">pleading</span> of God with men, <a href="/jeremiah/25-31.htm">Jeremiah 25:31</a>; <a href="/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2</a>; <a href="/job/13-19.htm">Job 13:19</a>. (See also <a href="/hosea/2-2.htm">Hosea 2:2</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>.) The meaning of this concluding expression does not, however, affect the main purport of the verse, or its relevancy as here quoted. Occurring in what is believed to be David's penitential psalm after his sin. in the matter of Uriah, it declares, in conjunction with the preceding verse, that, sin having been committed, man alone is guilty, and that God's truth and righteousness can never be impugned. But it seems to imply still more than this, viz. that man's sin has the establishment of God's righteousness as its consequence, or even, it may be, as its purpose; for the conclusion of ver. 4 in the psalm, naturally connected with "against thee only have I sinned" preceding, is so connected by <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span> (in Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>); and it is not out of keeping with scriptural doctrine that David should have intended to express even Divine <span class="accented">purpose in</span> that he had been permitted, for his sins, to fall into that deeper sin <span class="accented">with the view of</span> establishing God's righteousness all the more. It does not, however, seem certain (whatever some grammarians may say) that the conjunction need of necessity be understood as <span class="accented">relic</span>; it may be <span class="accented">embatic</span> only. However this be, it is the inference from <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;</span> that suggests the new objection of the following verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/3-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Absolutely not!</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(genoito)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Optative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1096.htm">Strong's 1096: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolongation and middle voice form of a primary verb; to cause to be, i.e. to become, used with great latitude.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">{Let} God</span><br /><span class="grk">&#920;&#949;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Theos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2316.htm">Strong's 2316: </a> </span><span class="str2">A deity, especially the supreme Divinity; figuratively, a magistrate; by Hebraism, very.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">be</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#953;&#957;&#941;&#963;&#952;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(ginesth&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Imperative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1096.htm">Strong's 1096: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolongation and middle voice form of a primary verb; to cause to be, i.e. to become, used with great latitude.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">TRUE</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#942;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(al&#275;th&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_227.htm">Strong's 227: </a> </span><span class="str2">Unconcealed, true, true in fact, worthy of credit, truthful.
