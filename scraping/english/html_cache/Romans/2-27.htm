In the Jewish context, circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). However, Paul emphasizes that true righteousness comes from obeying God's law, not merely external rituals. This echoes the Old Testament prophets, such as Jeremiah, who spoke of the need for a "circumcision of the heart" (<a href="/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>). The idea is that Gentiles, who were not physically circumcised, could still fulfill the law's requirements through their actions and faith, aligning with the New Covenant promise of the law written on hearts (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<p><b>will condemn you who</b><br>This part of the verse suggests a reversal of expectations. The Jewish audience, who prided themselves on their covenant status, would be judged by the very Gentiles they considered inferior. This is reminiscent of Jesus' teachings, where He often turned societal norms upside down, such as in the parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25-37</a>). The concept of being judged by one's actions rather than heritage is a consistent biblical theme, emphasizing personal responsibility and the universality of God's judgment.<p><b>even though you have the written code and circumcision</b><br>The "written code" refers to the Torah, the law given to Moses, which was central to Jewish identity and religious practice. Circumcision was a physical sign of belonging to God's chosen people. However, Paul argues that possession of the law and the sign of circumcision are insufficient for righteousness if not accompanied by obedience. This critique aligns with the prophetic tradition, where prophets like Isaiah and Amos condemned empty ritualism (<a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>, <a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21-24</a>). The emphasis is on the spirit of the law rather than the letter, a theme Paul expands upon in his letters (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>).<p><b>are a lawbreaker</b><br>Despite having the law and the sign of the covenant, the Jewish people are still capable of breaking the law. This underscores the universality of sin, as Paul later elaborates in <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>, "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." The term "lawbreaker" indicates that mere possession of the law does not equate to righteousness. This concept is foundational to Paul's argument that both Jews and Gentiles need salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). The inability to keep the law perfectly points to the necessity of grace and the redemptive work of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, addressing both Jewish and Gentile believers in Rome.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_believers.htm">Jewish Believers</a></b><br>Those who have the written law and practice circumcision as a sign of the covenant with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentile_believers.htm">Gentile Believers</a></b><br>Non-Jewish individuals who may not be circumcised but follow the moral law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rome.htm">Rome</a></b><br>The city where the recipients of the letter reside, a diverse hub of early Christianity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law, which includes moral, ceremonial, and civil commandments given to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/true_righteousness.htm">True Righteousness</a></b><br>Righteousness is not about external rituals but about internal obedience to God's law.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_law.htm">The Role of the Law</a></b><br>The law serves to reveal sin and our need for a Savior, not as a means to achieve righteousness on our own.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/heart_transformation.htm">Heart Transformation</a></b><br>God desires a transformation of the heart, which is evidenced by obedience and faith, not merely external compliance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_and_accountability.htm">Judgment and Accountability</a></b><br>Those who have the law and fail to keep it are accountable, and those who follow God's moral law, even without the written code, demonstrate true obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/inclusivity_of_the_gospel.htm">Inclusivity of the Gospel</a></b><br>The gospel is for all, Jew and Gentile alike, and true faith transcends cultural and religious boundaries.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_2_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 2:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_2_27_vs_outward_rituals_today.htm">How does Romans 2:27 challenge the importance of outward religious rituals today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Romans_2_27_True_vs_Mere_Obedience.htm">What does Romans 2:27 teach about true obedience versus mere law observance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_Romans_2_27_inwardly.htm">How can we apply the principle of inward transformation from Romans 2:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Old_Testament_examples_for_Romans_2_27.htm">What Old Testament examples illustrate the message of Romans 2:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Romans_2_27_and_Jesus_on_heart_s_state.htm">How does Romans 2:27 relate to Jesus' teachings on the heart's condition?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Romans_2_27_Rituals_vs_True_Faith.htm">How does Romans 2:27 challenge the notion of outward religious rituals versus inward faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Romans_2_27_Law_vs_Faith_Importance.htm">What does Romans 2:27 imply about the importance of following the law versus having faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Romans_2_27_Jews_Gentiles_in_God_s_plan.htm">How does Romans 2:27 address the relationship between Jews and Gentiles in God's plan?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_romans_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Romans 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/diligent_or_slothful_habits.htm">What is the significance of circumcision in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_do_paul_and_peter_have_distinct_missions.htm">Galatians 2:7 -

In a like double sense we may use the word "Christian" (cf. <a href="/john/1-47.htm">John 1:47</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>; <a href="/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>, "If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham;" also ch. 4. and <a href="/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a>). So, too, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span> for spiritual circumcision (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>), in the sense of inward dedication to God's service, and "<span class="accented">putting</span> off the body of the sins of the flesh" (<a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>; see also <a href="/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2, 3</a>). Such ethical significance of the rite appears even in the Old Testament. We read there of "uncircumcised lips" (<a href="/exodus/6-12.htm">Exodus 6:12, 30</a>), or "ears" (<a href="/jeremiah/6-10.htm">Jeremiah 6:10</a>), or "hearts" (<a href="/leviticus/26-41.htm">Leviticus 26:41</a>); and in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-6.htm">Deuteronomy 30:6</a> we find the significant words." The LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy <span class="accented">seed</span>, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live;" and in <a href="/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>, "<span class="accented">Circumcise</span> yourselves to the Loan, and take away the foreskins of your hearts, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem." (Cf. <a href="/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>, "<span class="accented">Put</span> on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.") <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/2-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The [one who is]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
