The "right time" refers to the divinely appointed moment in history when Jesus came into the world. <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-5</a> echoes this sentiment, stating that God sent His Son "when the fullness of time had come." Historically, this period was marked by the Pax Romana, a time of relative peace across the Roman Empire, which facilitated the spread of the Gospel. Theologically, it signifies God's sovereignty and His control over history, ensuring that Christ's sacrifice occurred precisely when it was most needed and most effective.<p><b>while we were still powerless</b><br>This phrase highlights human inability to achieve righteousness or salvation through our own efforts. The term "powerless" underscores the spiritual helplessness of humanity due to sin. <a href="/ephesians/2.htm">Ephesians 2:1-5</a> describes humanity as "dead in transgressions and sins," further illustrating our incapacity to save ourselves. This condition necessitates divine intervention, underscoring the need for a Savior. The concept of human powerlessness is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing that salvation is a gift from God, not a result of human works (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><b>Christ died for the ungodly</b><br>This statement encapsulates the core of the Gospel message: Christ's sacrificial death on behalf of sinners. The term "ungodly" refers to those who are opposed to God, highlighting the depth of God's love and grace. <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a> further elaborates on this by stating that God demonstrates His love for us in that "while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." This act of substitutionary atonement is central to Christian theology, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who bears the sins of many.

That love was evidenced in the death of Christ. And consider what that death was. It is rare enough for one man to die for another--even for a good man. Christ died not for good men, but for sinners, and while they were sinners. If then His death had the power to save us from punishment, it is an easy thing to believe that His life will lead us to glory.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">For when we were yet . . .</span>--The reading at the beginning of this verse is doubtful. The reading of the Vatican MS. is very attractive, "If at least," "If, as we know to be the fact, Christ died," &c. But, unfortunately, this has not much further external support. If we keep the common reading we must either translate "For, moreover," or we may suppose that there is some confusion between two constructions, and the word translated "yet" came to be repeated.<p><span class= "bld">Without strength.</span>--Powerless to work out our own salvation.<p><span class= "bld">In due time.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">in due season.</span> So the Authorised version, rightly. Just at the moment when the forbearance of God (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>) had come to an end, His love interposed, through the death of Christ, to save sinners from their merited destruction.<p><span class= "bld">For the ungodly.</span>--The force of the preposition here is "for the benefit of," not "instead of." St. Paul, it is true, holds the doctrine of the vicarious sacrifice of Christ, but this is expressed by such terms as the "propitiation" of <a href="/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>, or the "offering, and sacrifice for us" of <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm" title="And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling smell.">Ephesians 5:2</a>, and especially the "ransom for all" of <a href="/1_timothy/2-6.htm" title="Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.">1Timothy 2:6</a>, not by the use of the preposition. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet</span> (<span class="accented">literally,for</span>) <span class="cmt_word">peradventure for the good man some would even dare to die</span>. The general purport of ver. 7 is obvious, viz. to show how Christ's death for the ungodly transcends all human instances of self-sacrifice for others. But the exact import of the language used is not equally plain. That of the first clause, indeed, and its connection with what precedes, presents no difficulty. The meaning is that Christ's dying for the <span class="accented">ungodly</span> is a proof of love beyond what is common among men. The second clause seems to be added as a concession of what some men may perhaps sometimes be capable cf. It is introduced by a second <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> (this being the reading of all the manuscripts), which may be meant <span class="accented">as exceptive</span>, "I do not press this without exception," being understood. So Alford; and in this case the "yet" of the Authorized Version, or <span class="accented">though</span>, may give its meaning. Or it may be connected with <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, thus: "Scarcely, I say, for there may possibly be cases," etc. But what is the distinction between <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in the first clause and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in the second? Some interpreters say that there is none, the intention being simply to express the possibility of human self-sacrifice for one that is good or righteous in some rare cases. But the change of the word, which would, according to this view, be purposeless, and still more the insertion of the article before <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, forbids this interpretation. One view is that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> is neuter, meaning that, though for a righteous individual one can hardly be found to be willing to die, yet for the cause of good, for what a man regards as the highest good, or <span class="accented">pro bone publico</span> (it might be), such self-sacrifice may be possible; This view is tenable, though against it is the fact that death in behalf of <span class="accented">persons</span> is being spoken of all along. The remaining and most commonly accepted view is that by "the good man" (the article pointing him out generally as a well-known type of character) is meant the beneficent - one who inspires attachment and devotion - as opposed to one who is merely just. Cicero ('De Off.,' 3:15) is quoted in support of this distinction between the words: "Si vir bonus is est qui prodest quibus potest, nemini nocet, recte <span class="accented">justum</span> virum, <span class="accented">bonum</span> non facile reperiemus." Tholuck quotes, as a Greek instance, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (AElian, 'Var.

Possibly the term <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> would have a well-understood meaning to the readers of the Epistle, which is not equally obvious to us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/5-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
