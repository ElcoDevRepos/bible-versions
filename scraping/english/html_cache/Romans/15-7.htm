In the early church, there were tensions between Jewish and Gentile Christians, and Paul addresses these divisions by urging acceptance. This call to acceptance reflects the broader biblical theme of love and unity within the body of Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2-3</a>, which encourages believers to maintain the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.<p><b>then,</b><br>The word "then" serves as a transitional term, linking the command to accept one another with the preceding context. In <a href="/romans/15.htm">Romans 15:1-6</a>, Paul discusses the importance of bearing with the failings of the weak and building up one another. This connection underscores that acceptance is not an isolated command but part of a larger call to live in harmony and support one another in the faith.<p><b>just as Christ accepted you,</b><br>This phrase sets the standard for acceptance, pointing to Christ's example. Jesus' acceptance of believers is rooted in His sacrificial love and grace, as seen in His interactions with diverse individuals during His ministry (e.g., the Samaritan woman in <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4</a>). This acceptance is not based on merit but on grace, as highlighted in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, reminding believers that they are to extend the same grace to others.<p><b>in order to bring glory to God.</b><br>The ultimate purpose of accepting one another is to glorify God. This reflects the biblical principle that all actions of believers should aim to honor God, as stated in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>. The unity and love among believers serve as a testimony to the world of God's transformative power, fulfilling Jesus' prayer in <a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a> for believers to be one, so that the world may believe in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the Roman church was a diverse community of Jewish and Gentile believers, facing challenges in unity and acceptance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to the message of acceptance, Jesus is the model for how believers should accept one another, as He accepted us.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The ultimate recipient of glory when believers accept one another, reflecting His love and unity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_christian_community.htm">The Early Christian Community</a></b><br>The broader context in which Paul writes, characterized by diversity and the need for unity among believers from different backgrounds.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_our_model_for_acceptance.htm">Christ as Our Model for Acceptance</a></b><br>Jesus' acceptance of us is the standard by which we should accept others.

The word "received" is the same as that at the beginning of Romans 14, the subject of which chapter is still continued, and is now taken up for the last time. The duty of Christians to show cordiality to each other is now based upon the comprehensiveness of the love of Christ, whose mission was directed with the same impartiality towards Jews and Gentiles.
