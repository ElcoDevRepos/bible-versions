It connects the preceding discussion of sin and grace to the ultimate goal of God's redemptive plan. The use of "so that" implies a transition from the problem of sin to the solution provided by God.<p><b>just as sin reigned in death</b><br>Sin's dominion is characterized by death, both physical and spiritual. This reflects the consequence of Adam's transgression in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where death entered the world. The reign of sin is pervasive, affecting all humanity (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>). The imagery of reigning suggests a powerful and oppressive rule, highlighting the severity of sin's impact on creation.<p><b>so also grace might reign through righteousness</b><br>Grace is presented as the counterforce to sin, offering hope and redemption. The reign of grace is made possible through righteousness, which is a key theme in Paul's writings. This righteousness is not of human origin but is imputed through faith in Christ (<a href="/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>). The contrast between the reign of sin and the reign of grace underscores the transformative power of God's grace.<p><b>to bring eternal life</b><br>Eternal life is the ultimate gift of grace, contrasting with the death brought by sin. This life is not merely an unending existence but a quality of life in communion with God (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). The promise of eternal life is central to the Christian hope and is frequently mentioned in the New Testament (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16, 1</a> <a href="/john/5-11.htm">John 5:11-13</a>).<p><b>through Jesus Christ our Lord</b><br>Jesus Christ is the mediator of this grace and the source of eternal life. His lordship signifies authority and divinity, affirming His role in God's redemptive plan. The phrase emphasizes the exclusivity of Christ as the way to eternal life (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).
