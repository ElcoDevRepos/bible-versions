It echoes the humility required before the Creator, reminiscent of God's response to Job in <a href="/job/38.htm">Job 38-41</a>, where God questions Job's understanding of divine wisdom and power. The rhetorical question emphasizes the vast difference between God's infinite wisdom and human limited understanding. Historically, this reflects the Jewish understanding of God's absolute authority, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a>, where the clay questions the potter. It underscores the biblical theme of submission to God's will, a central tenet in both Old and New Testament teachings.<p><b>Shall what is formed say to Him who formed it,</b><br>This phrase uses the metaphor of a potter and clay, a common biblical image illustrating God's creative authority and human dependency. <a href="/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/18-6.htm">Jeremiah 18:6</a> also use this imagery to convey God's right to shape nations and individuals according to His purpose. The cultural context of pottery in ancient times, a skilled and deliberate craft, highlights the intentionality and care of the Creator. This metaphor reinforces the idea that creation does not possess the authority or perspective to question the Creator's intentions or methods.<p><b>&#8220;Why did You make me like this?&#8221;</b><br>This question reflects a common human struggle with identity and purpose, often arising from suffering or perceived injustice. It challenges believers to trust in God's perfect plan, even when it is not fully understood. Theologically, it points to the doctrine of God's providence and the belief that all things work together for good (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>). This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's redemptive plan, where individual roles and circumstances contribute to the fulfillment of divine purposes, as seen in the lives of biblical figures like Joseph (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>) and Esther (<a href="/esther/4-14.htm">Esther 4:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, addressing the Roman Christians and discussing God's sovereignty and human responsibility.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator, whose sovereignty and authority are being questioned by humans in this passage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/man.htm">Man</a></b><br>Represents humanity, who is being reminded of their position in relation to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_potter_and_the_clay.htm">The Potter and the Clay</a></b><br>A metaphor used by Paul to illustrate God's authority over creation, drawing from Old Testament imagery.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The original audience of the letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_sovereignty.htm">Understanding God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God, as the Creator, has the ultimate authority and wisdom to shape our lives according to His purpose.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_before_god.htm">Humility Before God</a></b><br>Approach God with humility, acknowledging our limited understanding and His infinite wisdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_plan.htm">Trust in God's Plan</a></b><br>Trust that God's plans are for our good, even when we do not understand them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/acceptance_of_our_role.htm">Acceptance of Our Role</a></b><br>Accept our role as part of God's creation, understanding that questioning His design is beyond our place.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_goodness.htm">Faith in God's Goodness</a></b><br>Have faith that God's intentions are always good, and His ways are higher than ours.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_9_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 9:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_9_20_on_God_s_control_challenge.htm">How does Romans 9:20 challenge our understanding of God's sovereignty over creation?

The figure of the clay, first introduced from Isaiah, is carried out at length in the passage from Jeremiah which is referred to. It is important, for understanding St. Paul's drift, to examine this passage. The prophet, in order that he might understand God's way of dealing with nations, is directed to go down to the potter's house, and watch the potter at his work. The potter is at work with a lump of clay, with the view of making a vessel of it; but it is "marred in the hand of the potter;" it does not come out into the form intended; so he rejects it, and makes anew another vessel after his mind, "as seemed good to the potter to make it." The prophet's application of the illustration is that, "as the clay is in the potter's hands, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel, saith the LORD;" meaning that if the house of Israel failed to answer to the LORD'S purpose, he could reject it at his pleasure, as the potter did the marred vessel; and in vers. 7-10 the view is extended to God's power over, and way of dealing with, all nations of mankind; and then, in ver. 11, the men of Judah are warned to return from their evil ways, lest the LORD should so do unto them. Thus it is by no means implied by the illustration that Israel, or any other nation, has been formed with the primary and irresistible purpose of rejecting it as a "vessel unto dishonour," or that, when rejected, it has not had opportunity of being otherwise; but only that God has absolute power and right over it, to reject it if proved unworthy. It cannot then resist his will (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> determination or resolve; not here <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. The primary Divine <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is "that all men should be saved, and come to a knowledge of the truth" (<a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>); and this men do resist. For distinction between <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, cf. <a href="/matthew/1-19.htm">Matthew 1:19</a>); but yet he may "find fault" with justice. It is here again evident that it is not individuals, but nations, that are in view all along. The apostle goes on next to consider whether, in God's actual dealings with the "vessels unto dishonour," there may not be, not only great forbearance, but also a merciful purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/9-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#947;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(menounge)</span><br /><span class="parse">Particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3304.htm">Strong's 3304: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nay rather; indeed, truly, really.
