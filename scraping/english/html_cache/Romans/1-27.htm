The term "natural relations" refers to the biological and complementary design of male and female. The abandonment suggests a willful rejection of God's design, echoing the broader theme of humanity's rebellion against divine order found throughout <a href="/romans/1.htm">Romans 1</a>.<p><b>and burned with lust for one another</b><br>The imagery of "burned with lust" conveys intense, uncontrolled desires. This phrase highlights the depth of the moral and spiritual corruption that Paul is addressing.

This can be understood as both a physical and spiritual repercussion, aligning with the biblical principle that sin leads to death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).
