According to the Mosaic Law, marriage was a binding covenant, and adultery was a serious offense (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>). The cultural context of the time viewed marriage as a sacred institution, and breaking this covenant through adultery was not only a personal sin but also a violation of community standards. The term "adulteress" reflects the societal and religious condemnation of such actions. This principle is consistent with Jesus' teachings in the New Testament, where He emphasizes the sanctity of marriage (<a href="/matthew/5-32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>).<p><b>but if her husband dies, she is free from that law</b><br>The death of a spouse releases the surviving partner from the marital law, allowing them to remarry without being considered adulterous. This reflects the legal principle found in the Torah, where death nullifies the binding nature of the marriage covenant (<a href="/numbers/36-6.htm">Numbers 36:6-9</a>). Theologically, this can be seen as a metaphor for the believer's release from the law through the death of Christ, as Paul elaborates in <a href="/romans/7-4.htm">Romans 7:4</a>. The concept of being "free from the law" is central to understanding the transition from the Old Covenant to the New Covenant, where believers are no longer bound by the law but live under grace.<p><b>and is not an adulteress if she marries another man.</b><br>This clause confirms the legitimacy of remarriage after the death of a spouse, aligning with Jewish customs and laws that permitted widows and widowers to remarry (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>). In the broader biblical narrative, this freedom to remarry symbolizes the new life and freedom believers have in Christ. Theologically, it underscores the idea of liberation from the law's condemnation, as believers are united with Christ in His death and resurrection (<a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4-5</a>). This reflects the transformative power of the Gospel, where the old self is put to death, and a new life in Christ begins.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, addressing the believers in Rome with teachings on the law and grace.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The audience of Paul's letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile Christians.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law, which Paul uses to illustrate spiritual truths about sin and grace.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/marriage.htm">Marriage</a></b><br>Used as an analogy by Paul to explain the believer's relationship to the law and to Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/adultery.htm">Adultery</a></b><br>A key concept in this verse, representing unfaithfulness and the breaking of a covenant.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_law's_authority.htm">Understanding the Law's Authority</a></b><br>The law has authority over a person only as long as they live.

It signals a practical conclusion he is drawing from the marriage analogy. In context, Paul is showing that death changes legal relationships. Cross references reinforce this principle: <a href="/hebrews/9-16.htm">Hebrews 9:16-17</a> speaks of a covenant made effective by death, and <a href="/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19</a> notes that believers &#8220;died to the law&#8221; through Christ so they might live for God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If she is joined to another man while her husband is still alive</b><p>Paul uses a clear, everyday scenario. According to God&#8217;s design, marriage unites a man and a woman as &#8220;one flesh&#8221; until death (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-6.htm">Matthew 19:6</a>). While her husband lives, the wife remains under the binding covenant of that marriage.<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>&#8212;marriage creates a lifelong union.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-10.htm">1 Corinthians 7:10-11</a>&#8212;Paul echoes Jesus in urging spouses not to separate, and if they do, to remain unmarried or be reconciled.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She is called an adulteress</b><p>If the wife takes another man while her husband lives, Scripture defines it plainly as adultery. God&#8217;s moral law forbids this breach of covenant (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>). Jesus reinforces the same standard in <a href="/matthew/5-27.htm">Matthew 5:27-28</a> and <a href="/luke/16-18.htm">Luke 16:18</a>. The word &#8220;called&#8221; highlights the public, objective judgment: society and God&#8217;s Word alike recognize the act as sinful.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But if her husband dies</b><p>Death ends the legal bond of marriage. The covenant is fulfilled, not broken. Paul&#8217;s illustration depends on this universally accepted truth. <a href="/1_corinthians/7-39.htm">1 Corinthians 7:39</a> states, &#8220;A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, only in the Lord&#8221;. This shows the divine logic: death releases from previous obligations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She is free from that law</b><p>Here &#8220;that law&#8221; refers to the marriage law binding her to her first husband. Once death occurs, the law no longer applies. The same pattern underlies Paul&#8217;s teaching that believers, having died with Christ, are released from the Mosaic law&#8217;s condemnation (<a href="/romans/7-4.htm">Romans 7:4-6</a>). <a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24-25</a> notes the law was a guardian until Christ came; now faith has come, believers are no longer under that guardian.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And is not an adulteress if she marries another man</b><p>Post-death remarriage is honorable and free of moral reproach. The widow&#8217;s new union is legitimate because no covenant remains with the first husband. This underscores God&#8217;s concern for both moral purity and compassionate provision (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-5.htm">Deuteronomy 24:5</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-14.htm">1 Timothy 5:14</a>). The point: freedom from the prior covenant allows a fresh, rightful relationship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/7-3.htm">Romans 7:3</a> uses the unambiguous rules of marriage to illustrate a spiritual reality. While a husband lives, a wife would commit adultery by uniting with another man; when he dies, she is released and may remarry without sin. In the same way, believers who &#8220;died&#8221; with Christ are freed from the law&#8217;s jurisdiction and can belong to Him in newness of life. The verse affirms both the sanctity of lifelong marriage and the liberating power of death&#8212;whether physical in marriage or spiritual in union with Christ&#8212;to dissolve an old covenant and usher in a new, God-ordained relationship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/7-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
