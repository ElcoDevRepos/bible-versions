The "flesh" represents human nature in its fallen state, prone to sin and rebellion against God. In the context of Romans, Paul contrasts the life led by the flesh with the life led by the Spirit. This dichotomy is central to understanding the Christian life as a battle between the old self and the new creation in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). The "flesh" is not merely physical but encompasses all aspects of human life that are opposed to God's will.<p><b>set their minds on the things of the flesh;</b><br>To "set their minds" indicates a deliberate focus or preoccupation. This phrase suggests that those living according to the flesh are consumed by worldly desires and pursuits, such as materialism, power, and sensual pleasures. This mindset is in direct opposition to the teachings of Christ, who calls for a life of self-denial and spiritual focus (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24-26</a>). The "things of the flesh" can also be linked to the works of the flesh listed in <a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>, which include immorality, idolatry, and envy, among others.<p><b>but those who live according to the Spirit</b><br>In contrast, this phrase describes individuals who are guided by the Holy Spirit. Living according to the Spirit involves a transformation that begins with accepting Christ and is characterized by a life that seeks to align with God's will. This transformation is a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, where God promises to give a new heart and spirit to His people. The Spirit empowers believers to overcome the desires of the flesh and to produce the fruit of the Spirit, as outlined in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>.<p><b>set their minds on the things of the Spirit.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes a conscious decision to focus on spiritual matters, such as prayer, worship, and the study of God's Word. It involves a continual renewal of the mind, as Paul later elaborates in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, urging believers not to conform to the patterns of this world but to be transformed by the renewing of their minds. The "things of the Spirit" include love, joy, peace, patience, and other virtues that reflect the character of Christ. This mindset is essential for spiritual growth and maturity, enabling believers to discern God's will and to live in a manner that pleases Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the early Christian community in Rome, which was composed of both Jewish and Gentile believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, who empowers believers to live according to God's will and not according to the flesh.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flesh.htm">The Flesh</a></b><br>A term used by Paul to describe the sinful nature and human inclinations that are opposed to God's Spirit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit.htm">The Spirit</a></b><br>Refers to the Holy Spirit, who guides and transforms believers to live in accordance with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_flesh_and_the_spirit.htm">Understanding the Flesh and the Spirit</a></b><br>Recognize the distinction between living according to the flesh and living according to the Spirit.
