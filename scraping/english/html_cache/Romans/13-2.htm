In the biblical context, Paul writes to the Roman Christians who lived under the Roman Empire, a regime not always favorable to Christians. The term "authority" here refers to governmental powers, which were seen as instituted by God for maintaining order. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching that God is sovereign over all nations and rulers (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>). The resistance mentioned is not just civil disobedience but a deeper rebellion against God's ordained structure.<p><b>is opposing what God has set in place</b><br>This highlights the divine origin of governmental authority. The Bible consistently teaches that God establishes rulers and kingdoms (<a href="/proverbs/8-15.htm">Proverbs 8:15-16</a>). This does not mean all actions by authorities are just, but the institution itself is part of God's order. The phrase suggests a theological understanding that God uses even imperfect governments to accomplish His purposes, as seen in the stories of Joseph in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>) and Daniel in Babylon (<a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>).<p><b>and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves</b><br>This serves as a warning of the consequences of resisting authority. The "judgment" can be understood in two ways: divine judgment and legal consequences. Biblically, God holds individuals accountable for their actions, and rebellion against authority is seen as rebellion against God (<a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13-14</a>). Historically, the Roman legal system was strict, and defiance often led to severe penalties. This phrase underscores the importance of living peaceably and lawfully, reflecting Jesus' teaching to "render to Caesar what is Caesar's" (<a href="/matthew/22-21.htm">Matthew 22:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the early Christian community in Rome, who were navigating their faith under Roman rule.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_authorities.htm">Roman Authorities</a></b><br>The governing bodies in Rome during the time of Paul's writing, representing the secular power structure.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate authority who, according to Paul, establishes earthly authorities.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The consequence mentioned by Paul for those who resist authority, implying both divine and earthly repercussions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_ordination_of_authority.htm">Divine Ordination of Authority</a></b><br>Recognize that all authority is established by God, and resisting it is akin to resisting God's order.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_resistance.htm">Consequences of Resistance</a></b><br>Understand that opposing authority leads to judgment, both from God and potentially from earthly systems.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christian_conduct_in_society.htm">Christian Conduct in Society</a></b><br>As Christians, we are called to be exemplary citizens, respecting and obeying laws unless they directly contradict God's commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/balancing_obedience_and_conscience.htm">Balancing Obedience and Conscience</a></b><br>While submission to authority is important, discernment is necessary when laws conflict with God's higher law.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_prayer_for_leaders.htm">Role of Prayer for Leaders</a></b><br>Pray for those in authority, seeking God's guidance and wisdom for them, as their decisions impact society.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_13_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 13:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_13_2_s_role_in_obeying_government.htm">How does Romans 13:2 guide our response to governmental authority today?

Because God ordains civil structures, obedience is not simply good citizenship&#8212;it is spiritual obedience. Paul&#8217;s flow of thought resembles earlier calls to overcome evil with good (<a href="/romans/12-21.htm">Romans 12:21</a>) and to live peaceably with all (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>). When we remember that God &#8220;changes times and seasons; He removes kings and establishes them&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>), it becomes clear that submission to proper authority is the logical outcome of recognizing God&#8217;s sovereignty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whoever resists authority</b><p>&#8220;Whoever&#8221; makes the warning universal&#8212;no believer is exempt. &#8220;Resists&#8221; pictures an active stance against lawful rule.

Whether rulers recognize it or not, &#8220;the Most High rules the kingdom of men&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>). Respect for authority, then, is not blind allegiance to people; it is reverence for the Lord who establishes seats of power for His purposes&#8212;even using pagan kings to accomplish His will (<a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves</b><p>Judgment can arrive in several ways:<p>&#8226; Legal penalties&#8212;government &#8220;does not bear the sword in vain&#8221; (<a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Divine discipline&#8212;God chastens children who refuse His order (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Societal chaos&#8212;rebellion breeds instability, as warned: &#8220;Fear the LORD and the king&#8230; disaster will rise suddenly&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/24-21.htm">Proverbs 24:21-22</a>).<p>The principle stands unless authorities command disobedience to God; in that exceptional case, &#8220;We must obey God rather than men&#8221; (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).

It is the theory of the laws of all civilized governments to uphold justice, and only to punish what is wrong; and in the main they do so.
