In the context of the Roman Empire, where Paul was writing, the concept of paying debts was crucial for maintaining social order. The Bible consistently teaches the importance of integrity and honesty in financial matters (<a href="/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27-28</a>). This principle reflects the broader biblical theme of justice and righteousness, as seen in the teachings of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23-24</a>).<p><b>Taxes to whom taxes are due:</b><br>During Paul's time, the Roman government imposed various taxes on its citizens, including poll taxes and land taxes. The instruction to pay taxes aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/22-21.htm">Matthew 22:21</a>, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's." This reflects the understanding that governmental authorities are established by God (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>), and paying taxes is part of submitting to their authority.<p><b>Revenue to whom revenue is due:</b><br>Revenue here can be understood as customs or duties, which were common in the Roman Empire, especially in trade and commerce. This phrase underscores the importance of fulfilling financial obligations in business dealings. The Bible encourages fair and honest trade practices (<a href="/proverbs/11.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>), and this principle is a call to uphold integrity in all financial transactions.<p><b>Respect to whom respect is due:</b><br>Respect is a fundamental biblical principle, rooted in the understanding that all people are made in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>). In the cultural context of the Roman Empire, social hierarchies were prevalent, and showing respect to those in authority was expected. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching of honoring others (<a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a>) and living peaceably with all (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>).<p><b>Honor to whom honor is due:</b><br>Honor goes beyond respect, involving a deeper recognition of someone's position or contribution. In biblical terms, honor is often associated with parents (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>) and leaders (<a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>). This phrase calls believers to acknowledge and esteem those who hold positions of authority or have made significant contributions to society, reflecting the biblical value of giving honor where it is due (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the

Mean</div><b>Pay everyone what you owe him</b><p><a href="/romans/13-7.htm">Romans 13:7</a> opens with a sweeping command: &#8220;Pay everyone what you owe him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Paul ties this to the governing-authority discussion that began in <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1&#8211;6</a>, reminding believers that obedience to God often runs through ordinary civic responsibilities.<p>&#8226; Cross references like <a href="/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27</a> (&#8220;Do not withhold good from the deserving when it is within your power to act&#8221;) and <a href="/matthew/22-21.htm">Matthew 22:21</a> (&#8220;Give to Caesar what is Caesar&#8217;s, and to God what is God&#8217;s&#8221;) confirm the consistent biblical call to settle all rightful obligations.<p>&#8226; The verse&#8217;s structure shows four examples, not an exhaustive list; the principle covers every debt&#8212;monetary, verbal, relational, or spiritual&#8212;that love and justice require us to pay (<a href="/romans/13-8.htm">Romans 13:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Taxes to whom taxes are due</b><p>&#8220;Taxes&#8221; points to the regular, fixed levies imposed by the state.<p>&#8226; Jesus modeled submission by paying the temple tax (<a href="/matthew/17-24.htm">Matthew 17:24-27</a>) and teaching, &#8220;Render to Caesar&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/22-17.htm">Matthew 22:17-21</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/13-6.htm">Romans 13:6</a> explains that rulers are &#8220;God&#8217;s servants&#8221; who need revenue to carry out their work; paying taxes recognizes God&#8217;s provision of order through government.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13-14, 17</a> echoes the same call: &#8220;Submit yourselves for the Lord&#8217;s sake to every human institution&#8230; honor the emperor.&#8221;<p>The takeaway: drafting a budget check to the IRS (or its equivalent) can be an act of worship when done with a willing heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Revenue to whom revenue is due</b><p>&#8220;Revenue&#8221; (often translated &#8220;custom&#8221; or &#8220;tariff&#8221;) covers variable fees, tolls, and business duties.<p>&#8226; John the Baptist told tax collectors, &#8220;Collect no more than you are authorized&#8221; (<a href="/luke/3-12.htm">Luke 3:12-13</a>), implying that the public must also pay what is authorized.<p>&#8226; Zacchaeus demonstrated repentance by restoring improperly taken customs fourfold and giving to the poor (<a href="/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a> warns, &#8220;Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everybody,&#8221; a principle that applies to every financial dealing, formal or informal.<p>Settling these lesser-known obligations&#8212;licensing fees, import duties, and the like&#8212;keeps our consciences clear and our witness credible.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Respect to whom respect is due</b><p>Here Paul shifts from money to attitude. &#8220;Respect&#8221; (or &#8220;fear&#8221;) recognizes positional authority.<p>&#8226; The command reflects <a href="/exodus/22-28.htm">Exodus 22:28</a>: &#8220;You must not curse God, nor curse a ruler of your people.&#8221;<p>&#8226; When Paul appeared before the Sanhedrin, he apologized for speaking rashly to the high priest once he realized his position (<a href="/acts/23-4.htm">Acts 23:4-5</a>), modeling respectful speech even under pressure.<p>&#8226; <a href="/titus/3-1.htm">Titus 3:1-2</a> urges believers &#8220;to be subject to rulers and authorities&#8230; to slander no one, to be peaceable and considerate.&#8221;<p>Practical expressions include courteous language, prompt compliance with lawful orders, and praying for leaders (<a href="/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Honor to whom honor is due</b><p>&#8220;Honor&#8221; goes beyond respect; it assigns value and esteem.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a> condenses civic duty into four words: &#8220;Honor the emperor.&#8221; The same verse pairs it with &#8220;Love the brotherhood,&#8221; showing that honoring authorities does not negate, but complements, Christian fellowship.<p>&#8226; Honoring parents (<a href="/ephesians/6-2.htm">Ephesians 6:2</a>) and elders who direct the church (<a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>) shows that honor operates in every sphere God has ordained.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/5-13.htm">Revelation 5:13</a> pictures all creation giving &#8220;honor and glory&#8221; to the Lamb, reminding us that earthly honor mirrors the ultimate honor God deserves.<p>Displaying honor can look like speaking well of leaders in public, writing a thank-you note, or standing during a judge&#8217;s entrance&#8212;small gestures that proclaim a big theology: authority is God-given.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/13-7.htm">Romans 13:7</a> calls believers to settle every debt&#8212;financial, civic, and relational. Paying taxes and fees funds the governing structures God has allowed; offering respect and honor upholds the dignity of those He has placed in authority.
