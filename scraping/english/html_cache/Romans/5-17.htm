Adam's disobedience introduced sin into the world, affecting all of humanity. This concept is foundational in understanding original sin, which posits that Adam's sin has been imputed to all his descendants. Theologically, this sets the stage for the need for redemption and the coming of Christ as the second Adam.<p><b>death reigned through that one man,</b><br>Death here is both physical and spiritual, signifying separation from God. The reign of death indicates its pervasive and dominating influence over humanity as a result of Adam's sin. This is echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>, "For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive." The imagery of reigning suggests a kingdom or dominion, highlighting the power and inevitability of death without divine intervention.<p><b>how much more will those who receive the abundance of grace</b><br>This phrase introduces the concept of grace as a superabundant gift from God, contrasting the destructive power of sin. Grace is unmerited favor, and its abundance suggests that it is more than sufficient to overcome the effects of sin. <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a> emphasizes that salvation is by grace through faith, not by works, underscoring the generosity of God's grace.<p><b>and of the gift of righteousness</b><br>Righteousness here is a legal standing before God, granted through faith in Jesus Christ. It is a gift, not earned by human effort, aligning with the doctrine of justification by faith. This righteousness is imputed to believers, as seen in <a href="/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>, where Paul speaks of having a righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith.<p><b>reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!</b><br>This phrase contrasts the reign of death with the reign of life, made possible through Jesus Christ. Believers are promised not just eternal life, but a victorious life, empowered by the Holy Spirit. The concept of reigning suggests authority and victory, as seen in <a href="/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>, where believers are described as a kingdom and priests who will reign on the earth.

This &#8220;if&#8221; is not doubtful; it is a way of setting up a reality already established in <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>&#8212;&#8220;sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin.&#8221; Scripture paints Adam&#8217;s act as the doorway through which sin and death entered history (<a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>; 3:6-19). Because that doorway truly swung open, everything that follows is built on a solid, literal foundation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by the trespass of the one man</b><p>&#8220;One man&#8221; is Adam. His single, historical disobedience (<a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a>) counted for the entire human family. Notice Paul calls it a &#8220;trespass&#8221;&#8212;a deliberate stepping over God&#8217;s boundary (<a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>). Every descendant is therefore born into Adam&#8217;s guilt (<a href="/psalms/51-5.htm">Psalm 51:5</a>), not by personal imitation alone but by inherited status (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>, first half).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>death reigned through that one man</b><p>Death is pictured as a monarch ruling over humanity. The physical return to dust (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>) and the spiritual separation from God (<a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>) both lie under this reign. Evidence is everywhere: cemeteries, wars, sickness, estrangement from God. Paul states earlier, &#8220;the wages of sin is death&#8221; (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). Adam&#8217;s single act placed all of us under that tyrant&#8217;s rule.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>how much more</b><p>With these words Paul pivots. If Adam&#8217;s power was great, Christ&#8217;s is infinitely greater.
