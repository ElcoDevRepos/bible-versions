The "therefore" indicates a conclusion drawn from the argument that all are guilty before God. The idea of having "no excuse" echoes <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>, where Paul states that God's invisible qualities are clearly seen, leaving humanity without excuse for their unbelief and sin. This phrase emphasizes personal accountability and the universality of sin.<p><b>you who pass judgment on another</b><br>Paul addresses those who judge others, likely referring to both Jews and Gentiles who consider themselves morally superior. In the cultural context, Jews might have felt a sense of superiority due to their possession of the Law. This phrase warns against hypocrisy and self-righteousness, aligning with Jesus' teachings in <a href="/matthew/7.htm">Matthew 7:1-5</a> about the dangers of judging others without self-reflection.<p><b>For on whatever grounds you judge the other</b><br>This phrase highlights the principle of reciprocity in judgment. The grounds or criteria used to judge others will be the same criteria by which one is judged. This reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/matthew/7-2.htm">Matthew 7:2</a>, where Jesus teaches that the measure used to judge others will be used against the judge. It underscores the importance of humility and self-awareness.<p><b>you are condemning yourself</b><br>Paul points out the self-condemnation inherent in judging others. This is a logical consequence of the previous phrase, as those who judge are often guilty of the same or similar sins. This concept is rooted in the idea of God's justice, where He judges impartially, as seen in <a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>. It serves as a warning against hypocrisy and the need for repentance.<p><b>because you who pass judgment do the same things</b><br>This phrase reveals the hypocrisy of those who judge others while committing similar sins. It reflects the human tendency to overlook one's own faults while criticizing others. This aligns with Jesus' rebuke of the Pharisees in <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>, where He calls them out for their outward righteousness but inward corruption.

Now he turns the spotlight from &#8220;they&#8221; to &#8220;you,&#8221; showing that every reader&#8212;Jew or Gentile&#8212;stands on the same footing before God. The shift echoes Nathan&#8217;s &#8220;You are the man!&#8221; to David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>), exposing hidden hypocrisy.

The position to be proved is that all mankind is guilty before God (see note on ver. 18). So far this has been shown with regard to the mass of the heathen world; its general moral corruption, prevalent and condoned, having been pointed out finally as a glaring proof; the main point of the argument having been to trace this state of things to man's own fault, in that he had refused to retain and act on a knowledge of God originally imparted to him through nature and through conscience. From such refusal had ensued idolatry; thence, as a judicial consequence, profligacy; thence a general prevalence of abominable practices; and at last (in many at least) the "reprobate mind," lost to moral restraint, and approving of vice as well as practising it. Thus it is sufficiently proved that the heathen world, regarded as a whole, is under sin, and liable to the wrath of God. But the required proof that the whole of mankind is guilty is not yet complete. It might be said that there are many still who disapprove of all this wickedness, and sit in judgment on it, and who are, therefore, not themselves implicated in the guilt. To such persons the apostle now turns, his purpose being to show that their judging others does not exempt themselves, unless they can show that they are themselves sinless. All, he argues, are tainted with sin, and therefore implicated in the guilt of the human race, while the very fact of their judging others condemns them all the more. It is usually said by commentators that, the sin of the heathen world having been established in the first chapter, the second has reference exclusively to the Jews. But this is surely not so. The expressions, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (vers. 1, 3), seem evidently to include <span class="accented">all</span> who judge others; and it is not till ver. 9 that any distinction between Jew and Gentile comes in. Nor would the argument have been complete without refutation of Gentile as well as Jewish judgers of others. For the philosophical schools especially claimed superiority to the mass of mankind, and would be likely to resent their own inclusion in the general condemnation. Notably the Stoics, whose philosophy was at that time, as well as that of the Epicureans, extensively professed by educated Romans. Seneca was a contemporary of St. Paul. The Stoics might be suitably designated as <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>: for they affected to look down from a position of calm philosophical superiority on those who followed their mere natural impulses, professing to be themselves guided by right reason, and superior to the passions of ordinary humanity. It was a home-thrust at them to ask - Are you, who thus judge others, as exempt as you profess to be from the vices you condemn? If the accounts that have come down to us of Seneca's own life be true, he certainly was not a paragon of virtue. Now, be it observed that the sort of people now addressed are not concluded to be sunk into all the depths of sin spoken of above; their very affecting to judge others implies, at any rate, theoretic approval of the right. Nor does St. Paul anywhere suggest that there is no difference between man and man with regard to moral worth before God; nay, in this very chapter he forcibly declares the moral excellence of some, without the Law as well as with the Law, and eternal life as its reward (vers. 7, 10, 14, 15). All he implies of necessity is that none whatever are so exempt from sin as to be in a position to judge others; and it is the judgment of others that he here especially attacks, as increasing, rather than exempting from, condemnation. For it involves in itself the sin of presumption, unless those that judge are sinless. But it may be said that the universal sinfulness of mankind is still not proved. For <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> it is not actually demonstrated that all of those who judge "do the same things." The answer to this objection is, that this does not admit of rigid proof, and that therefore the apostle deems it enough to appeal to the consciences of the judgers themselves as to how the matter stands with them. But it may be said <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the sinfulness of such persons as are spoken of in vers. 7, 10, 14, 15, 29-such, namely, as sincerely strive after good without setting themselves up as judges - is still unproved. So it is in this chapter; and, for logical completeness, the proof must be taken as implied. It was, we may suppose in the writer's mind, and afterwards, in ch. 7, where the inner consciousness of even the best is analyzed, the missing link of the argument is supplied. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou doest</span> (rather, <span class="accented">dost practise</span>; the word is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, see <a href="/romans/1-32.htm">Romans 1:32</a>) <span class="cmt_word">the same things. But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit</span> (or, <span class="accented">practise</span>, as before) <span class="cmt_word">such things</span>. As has been observed above, the fact that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> "does the same things," is not proved; it is incapable of patent proof, and so the argument takes the form of an appeal to the consciences of such persons. "Porro quia ipsos interioris impuritatis insimulat, quae ut humanos oculos latet, redargui convincique nequeat humanis testimoniis, ad Dei judicium provocat, cui nec tenebrae ipsae sunt absconditae, et cujus sensu tangi peceatoribus, velint nolint, necesse est" (Calvin). On <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, in ver. 2, Calvin also remarks, "Veritas porro haec judicii in duobus consistit: quod sine personarum respectu delictum puniet, in quocunque deprehenderit homine; deinde quod externam speciem non moratur, nec opere ipso contentus est nisi a vera sinceri-tate animi prodeat." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/2-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">You</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
