This enthusiasm is rooted in his understanding of the gospel as the power of God for salvation (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). His zeal is reminiscent of the prophets, such as Isaiah, who were eager to proclaim God's message despite opposition. Paul's transformation from a persecutor of Christians to an apostle underscores the transformative power of the gospel, which fuels his eagerness.<p><b>to preach the gospel</b><br>The gospel, or "good news," is central to Paul's ministry. It encompasses the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, offering salvation to all who believe. Paul's focus on preaching highlights the importance of verbal proclamation in spreading the Christian faith. This aligns with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations. Paul's dedication to preaching is a model for Christian evangelism.<p><b>also to you who are in Rome</b><br>Rome, the heart of the Roman Empire, was a significant and strategic location for the spread of Christianity. The city's diverse population and status as a cultural and political hub made it an ideal place for the gospel to take root and spread throughout the empire. Paul's desire to visit Rome reflects his strategic approach to mission work, aiming to establish a strong Christian presence in influential cities. The Roman church, likely founded by Jewish and Gentile converts, faced challenges of unity and cultural integration, which Paul addresses in his letter.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle and author of the letter to the Romans.

(3) Combining them, "The readiness or inclination on my part (literally, <span class= "ital">The on-my-part readiness or inclination</span>) is," &c.
