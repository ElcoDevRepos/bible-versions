The creation account establishes God as the Creator, setting the foundation for His authority and sovereignty over all things. The phrase suggests that evidence of God&#8217;s existence and attributes has been present since the very beginning, aligning with the biblical narrative that God&#8217;s handiwork is evident in the natural world.<p><b>God&#8217;s invisible qualities</b><br>These qualities refer to aspects of God that are not physically seen but are understood through His creation. Attributes such as His wisdom, creativity, and order are reflected in the complexity and beauty of the universe. This aligns with <a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>, which states, "The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands."<p><b>His eternal power and divine nature</b><br>Eternal power refers to God&#8217;s omnipotence and timelessness, indicating that He is not bound by the constraints of time and space. Divine nature encompasses His holiness, righteousness, and other attributes that set Him apart from His creation. This is consistent with <a href="/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>, which speaks of God as the everlasting Creator who does not grow tired or weary.<p><b>have been clearly seen</b><br>The clarity with which God&#8217;s attributes are perceived in creation suggests that they are evident and unmistakable. This is supported by the intricate design and order found in nature, which points to an intelligent Designer. The clarity of this revelation is such that it leaves humanity without a valid argument against the existence of God.<p><b>being understood from His workmanship</b><br>Workmanship refers to the created world, which acts as a testament to God&#8217;s attributes. The complexity of ecosystems, the vastness of the universe, and the intricacies of biological life all serve as evidence of a purposeful Creator. This understanding is accessible to all people, regardless of their cultural or historical context.<p><b>so that men are without excuse</b><br>This phrase underscores the accountability of humanity in recognizing God&#8217;s existence and attributes. The natural revelation provided through creation is sufficient for people to acknowledge God, leaving them without excuse for unbelief.

The difference between the two conceptions is apparent from the Vulgate, <span class="accented">ira at sint inexcusabiles</span>, compared with Calvin's <span class="accented">in hoc ut.</span> The bearing of the distinction on the doctrine of predestination is obvious, and it was consequently a subject of contention between the Lutherans and Calvinists. Meyer among moderns contends strongly that "the view which takes it of the <span class="accented">purpose</span> is required by the prevailing use of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> with the infinitive," referring in this Epistle to <a href="/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>; <a href="/romans/3-26.htm">Romans 3:26</a>; <a href="/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11, 16, 18</a>; <a href="/romans/6-12.htm">Romans 6:12</a>; <a href="/romans/7-4.htm">Romans 7:4, 5</a>; <a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>; <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2, 3</a>; <a href="/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8, 13, 16</a>. A comparison, however, of these passages does not seem to bear out his contention, it being apparently dependent on the context in each case, rather than the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span>, whether the idea of <span class="accented">purpose</span> comes in. Chrysostom among the ancients expressly opposed this view, saying, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>,<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x2e;</span> So that they should be may be suggested as an adequate rendering, so as to avoid the idea of God's manifestation of himself to men hating been from the first delusive, having condemnation, and not enlightenment, for its purpose. These two verses, 19 and 20, carry out the thought of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 18, their purport being to show that the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of men have been in spite of <span class="accented">knowledge</span>, and therefore involve them all in sin. For <span class="accented">sin</span> implies knowledge of good and evil; it is not imputed to the brute beasts, who but follow their natural instincts, having no perception of God or a Divine law. Now, to man, even without any special revelation, God manifests himself in two ways <span class="accented">- outwardly</span> in nature, and <span class="accented">inwardly</span> in conscience. In these verses the outward manifestation is spoken of, the other being more especially noted in ch. 2:14, etc. But here, too, an inward manifestation is implied by the word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, as before by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>. To the animals below us the phenomena of nature may be but a spectacle before their eyes, making no appeal to a mind within. But to man they have a language - they awake wonder, awe, admiration, a sense of infinite mysterious power, and, to the receptive of such impressions, of ideal beauty indefinable. To the psalmists of old they spoke irresistibly of God; of one infinite and eternal Being, above and beyond all; and their consciences, owning the supremacy of good in the moral sphere, concurred with their sense of the evidences of beneficence in nature, so as to convince them also of the <span class="accented">righteousness</span> of God. All men (the apostle would say) were originally endowed with a like capacity of knowing God; and their failure in this regard, shown in the various forms of idolatry prevalent throughout the world, he views as the first stage in the development of human sin. The next stage is general moral degradation, regarded as the judicial consequence of the dishonour done to God. It is, indeed, a necessary consequence; for low and unworthy conceptions of Deity bring with them moral deterioration; when man's Divine ideal becomes degraded, with it he becomes degraded too. Witness, for instance, the debauches and cruelties that so commonly accompanied idolatrous worship. Lastly, the final stage of this moral degradation is represented in an unveiled picture of the utter wickedness, and even unnatural vice, at that time prevalent and condoned in the heart of the boasted civilization of the heathen world. Such is the drift of the remainder of this first chapter. The argument suggests the following thoughts. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> There is no mention here of Adam s transgression as the origin of human sin. The reason is that the apostle is arguing from a philosophical rather than a theological point of view, having Gentile as well as Jewish thinkers in his view as readers. His appeal in this chapter is not to the Old Testament at all, but to facts by all acknowledged. He is offering the world a philosophy of human history to account for the present perplexing state of things - for the undoubted discord between conscience and performance, between ideal and practice, - his purpose being to show universal guilt on the part of man. But his position here is quite consistent with what he says elsewhere (as in ch. 5.) of Adam's original transgression. For his whole argument in this chapter involves the doctrine of the <span class="accented">fall</span> of man, who is conceived to have been originally endowed with Divine instincts, and to have forfeited his prerogative through sin; and this is the essential meaning of the picture given us in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. of the original transgression. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The entire drift of the chapter is against the view of the condemnation of mankind being due simply to the sin of the progenitor being <span class="accented">imputed to</span> the race. For all men are represented as guilty, in that all have sinned against light which they might have followed. This view does not, indeed, preclude that of an inherited infection of nature predisposing all to sin; nay, it rather necessitates it; for why should the sin have been so universal but for such predisposing cause? Still, the distinction between the two views is important in regard to our conception of the Divine justice. 3. It may, however, be said that the distinction is without a real difference in this regard; for that, if the inherited infection is such that sin becomes inevitable (as seems to be implied by its alleged universality), it may appear as inconsistent with the Divine justice to condemn men for it, as it would be to impute to them their progenitor's transgression. In reply to this difficulty, it may be said that Scripture nowhere says that men are <span class="accented">finally</span> condemned for it. On the contrary, the gospel reveals to us the atonement, preordained from the first, for the avoidance of such final condemnation; and this retrospective as well as prospective in its effects (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25, 26</a>), and as far-reaching as was the original transgression (<a href="/romans/4-12.htm">Romans 4:12</a>, etc.). And our apostle (<a href="/romans/2-7.htm">Romans 2:7, 14, 15, 16</a>) expressly asserts the salvation of <span class="accented">all</span> who, according to their light, have done what they could. The fact is, that in the argument before us (as in other passages of similar purport) it is only the <span class="accented">principle</span>, or the <span class="accented">ground</span>, of man's possible justification before God that is under review. The intention is to show that this cannot be man's own "works or deservings," as of debt, but is another which the gospel reveals. Be it observed, lastly, that a clear view of this position is important, not only for our apprehension of the truth of things and of the meaning of the gospel, but also for our right moral tone of mind and attitude before God. For not to be convinced of sin is to belie the true ideal of our conscience, and implies acquiescence in a moral standard below that of the Divine righteousness to which we are able to aspire. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/1-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
