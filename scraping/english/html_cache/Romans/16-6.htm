This Mary is distinct from other Marys mentioned in the New Testament, such as Mary, the mother of Jesus, or Mary Magdalene. The mention of her name indicates her significance in the early Christian community in Rome. The act of greeting suggests a personal connection and respect within the church, highlighting the importance of fellowship and community among believers.<p><b>who has worked very hard</b><br>The phrase "worked very hard" implies diligent and laborious effort, suggesting that Mary was deeply committed to the ministry and service of the church. This reflects the early Christian emphasis on serving others and the communal nature of the church's mission. The Greek word used here, "kopiao," often denotes toil to the point of exhaustion, indicating that her contributions were significant and sacrificial.<p><b>for you</b><br>The phrase "for you" indicates that Mary's efforts were directed towards the Roman believers. This highlights the interconnectedness of the early Christian communities and the importance of mutual support and service.
