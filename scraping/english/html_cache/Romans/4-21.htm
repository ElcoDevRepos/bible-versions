In the biblical context, faith is not merely intellectual assent but a deep-seated conviction. Abraham's faith is a model for believers, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>, which defines faith as the assurance of things hoped for. This persuasion is rooted in trust and confidence in God's character and promises.<p><b>that God was able</b><br>The focus here is on God's omnipotence. Throughout Scripture, God's ability to fulfill His promises is emphasized, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/32-17.htm">Jeremiah 32:17</a>, which declares that nothing is too hard for God. This reflects the belief in God's sovereignty and power over all creation, reinforcing the idea that He is capable of accomplishing His will.<p><b>to do what He had promised</b><br>This refers to the specific promise made to Abraham regarding his descendants and the land (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3, 15</a>:5). The fulfillment of God's promises is a central theme in the Bible, demonstrating His faithfulness. This also connects to the New Testament, where God's promises are fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>). Abraham's faith in God's promise is a type of the faith believers are called to have in the promises of salvation through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The central figure in <a href="/bsb/romans/4.htm">Romans 4</a>, Abraham is presented as the model of faith. He believed God's promise that he would be the father of many nations despite his old age and Sarah's barrenness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The promise-maker, whose faithfulness and omnipotence are emphasized. God made a covenant with Abraham, promising him numerous descendants.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sarah.htm">Sarah</a></b><br>Abraham's wife, who was initially barren.
