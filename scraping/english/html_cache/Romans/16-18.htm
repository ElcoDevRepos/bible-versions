Historically, the early church faced challenges from false teachers and divisive individuals, as seen in other New Testament writings (e.g., <a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>, <a href="/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a>). These people often sought personal gain rather than the advancement of the Gospel. The phrase underscores the importance of discernment within the Christian community, as Jesus warned about false prophets in <a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>.<p><b>but their own appetites</b><br>The term "appetites" refers to selfish desires and personal ambitions. In a cultural context, the Greco-Roman world was characterized by a pursuit of personal honor and status, which could infiltrate the church. This phrase echoes <a href="/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19</a>, where Paul speaks of those whose "god is their stomach," indicating a focus on earthly desires rather than spiritual truths. It serves as a warning against prioritizing personal gain over spiritual integrity.<p><b>By smooth talk and flattery</b><br>This phrase highlights the methods used by deceptive individuals to manipulate others. In the ancient world, rhetoric and persuasive speech were highly valued skills, often used to sway public opinion. The Bible frequently warns against being misled by eloquent but deceitful speech, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/26-28.htm">Proverbs 26:28</a> and <a href="/colossians/2-4.htm">Colossians 2:4</a>. The emphasis here is on the seductive nature of such speech, which can lead believers away from sound doctrine.<p><b>they deceive the hearts of the naive</b><br>The "naive" refers to those who are unsuspecting or lacking in discernment. In biblical terms, the heart is often seen as the center of one's being, encompassing mind, will, and emotions. Deception of the heart implies a deep level of manipulation, affecting one's core beliefs and values. This warning is consistent with other scriptural admonitions to guard one's heart (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>) and to be vigilant against spiritual deception (<a href="/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6</a>).

It is not, however, quite clear that the class of persons intended is precisely the same. There the Apostle is condemning Antinomian extravagances which professed to be based on his own teaching; here he would seem to have in view some more radical divergence of doctrine, "contrary to" that which they had learned.

Had St. Paul thought these people sincere though mistaken, he would doubtless have treated them with the tenderness he shows towards the weak brethren. But he regards them as self-interested, and of the flesh; and against such disturbers of the Church's peace he is, here as elsewhere, indignant (el. <a href="/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7, 8</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-4.htm">Galatians 2:4</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-11.htm">Galatians 5:11, 12</a>). In speaking of them as serving, or being slaves to, their own belly, it cannot be concluded certainly that he attributed to them habits of sensuality. He may only mean that it is the gratification of the lower part of their nature that they have in view; and there may be allusion to the motive of such persons being the desire of eating and drinking at the cost of the Churches. In 'The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles' (alluded to under Romans 12:6, <span class="accented">seq</span>.) the desire to live without working at the cost of the Church is set down as one of the marks of a false apostle or a false prophet. <span class="cmt_word">And by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple</span> (rather, <span class="accented">innocent</span>, or <span class="accented">harmless.</span> So the word <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is translated in <a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>.
