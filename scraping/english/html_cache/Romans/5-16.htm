Adam's sin introduced sin and death into the world (Genesis 3), affecting all humanity. In contrast, the "gift" refers to the grace and righteousness offered through Jesus (<a href="/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15</a>). This highlights the superiority and abundance of God's grace over the effects of sin. Theologically, this sets up the doctrine of original sin versus the redemptive work of Christ.<p><b>The judgment that followed one sin brought condemnation,</b><br>Adam's single act of disobedience (eating the forbidden fruit) resulted in judgment and condemnation for all humanity (<a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17, 3</a>:6-19). This reflects the biblical principle that sin leads to death and separation from God (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). The historical context of Adam's sin is foundational for understanding the need for redemption. Theologically, this underscores the seriousness of sin and its universal impact.<p><b>but the gift that followed many trespasses brought justification.</b><br>Despite the multitude of sins committed by humanity, the gift of grace through Jesus Christ brings justification (<a href="/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24</a>). Justification is a legal term signifying being declared righteous before God. This reflects the abundant mercy and grace of God, who provides a way for reconciliation despite repeated human failures. Theologically, this emphasizes the sufficiency of Christ's atonement and the transformative power of grace. This connects to prophecies of a coming Redeemer (Isaiah 53) and the fulfillment of the law through Christ (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam.htm">Adam</a></b><br>The first man created by God, whose sin brought condemnation to all humanity.
