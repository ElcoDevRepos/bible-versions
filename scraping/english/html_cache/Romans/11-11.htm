The term "stumble" suggests a temporary misstep rather than a complete fall. This reflects the biblical theme of Israel's recurring disobedience and God's enduring faithfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/31-37.htm">Jeremiah 31:37</a>). The question implies hope for restoration, aligning with prophecies of Israel's eventual redemption (<a href="/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21-23</a>).<p><b>Certainly not!</b><br>Paul emphatically denies the idea of Israel's permanent fall. This assurance is consistent with God's covenant promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which are irrevocable (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>). It underscores the belief in God's unchanging nature and His plan for Israel's future restoration (<a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26-27</a>).<p><b>However, because of their trespass,</b><br>Israel's "trespass" refers to their rejection of Jesus as the Messiah. This act is seen as part of God's sovereign plan, allowing the gospel to spread beyond Jewish boundaries. The concept of God using human failure to fulfill His purposes is seen throughout Scripture, such as Joseph's story in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>.<p><b>salvation has come to the Gentiles</b><br>The inclusion of the Gentiles in God's salvation plan fulfills Old Testament prophecies (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>). This was a radical shift in the early church, as salvation was no longer confined to the Jewish people. The spread of the gospel to the Gentiles is documented in the Book of Acts, particularly through Paul's missionary journeys (<a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46-48</a>).<p><b>to make Israel jealous.</b><br>The idea of provoking Israel to jealousy is rooted in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>, where God uses other nations to stir Israel to return to Him. This strategy aims to lead Israel back to faithfulness by witnessing the blessings and relationship Gentiles have with God. It reflects God's desire for all people, including Israel, to come to repentance and faith (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, through whom He revealed His law and promises.

It brought salvation to the Gentiles, and it did this only to react as an incentive upon the Jews.<p><span class= "bld">For to provoke them to jealousy.</span>--The reason why salvation had been extended to the Gentiles was to stir up them (the Jews) to emulation. Their privileges had made them negligent and apathetic. The sight of others stepping into those privileges was to rouse them from their apathy<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall?</span> <span class="accented">i.e. in such wise as to fall</span>, rightly given in the Vulgate <span class="accented">as sic ut caderent.</span> There is no need here to press the <span class="accented">telic</span> use of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> in <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, so as to require the translation, "that they might fall." It is rather the use of <span class="accented">contemplated result.</span> God forbid. But by their fall (rather, <span class="accented">trip, or false step</span>). The word is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, suitably used here in view of the figure of stumbling. The idea is that they had stumbled over the "stumbling-block" above spoken of, but not so as to lie hopelessly prostrate. Calvin translates well, "Num impegerunt ut corruerent?" and "eoram lapsu." Alford adopts "lapse" for <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. But the word, as used in English, is not equivalent. If we retain the rendering "fall," we must understand a partial or temporary fall, not prostration from which there is no recovery. <span class="cmt_word">Salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</span> (The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> with the idea conveyed by it, is from <a href="/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>, which see.) <span class="cmt_word">Now if the fall</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, as above) <span class="cmt_word">of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fulness?</span> The words <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, rendered in the Authorized Version "<span class="accented">diminishing"</span> and "<span class="accented">fulness</span>," have been variously understood. They are in contrast with each other, and must evidently be understood with reference to the same idea. Now, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, as used afterwards in ver. 25 <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1fc3;</span>), seems plainly to mean the <span class="accented">full complement</span> of the Gentiles; and so here must surely be meant the <span class="accented">full complement</span> of the Jews, pointing to the same idea as as <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;</span> in ver. 26. If so, <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> must mean the defect from such full complement - not. indeed (as some have explained), the small number (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of believers) now opposed to the full number in the future, but abstractedly, <span class="accented">defect</span>, or <span class="accented">fewness</span>, as opposed to <span class="accented">fulness.</span> This interpretation agrees with the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in the only other place where it occurs in the New Testament, viz. <a href="/1_corinthians/6-7.htm">1 Corinthians 6:7</a>, where it seems to signify "defect," though used in that passage with a moral reference. The reason why the present <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> of the Jews is the riches of the Gentiles is that the refusal of the Jews to accept the gospel had been the occasion of its being offered to the Gentiles (cf. <a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a>; <a href="/acts/28-28.htm">Acts 28:28</a>; also <a href="/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>; <a href="/matthew/22-9.htm">Matthew 22:9</a>). It is not, of course, meant that the gospel was not originally intended for all the world, but only that the present and immediate promulgation of it to the Gentiles had been due to the Jews' refusal. Otherwise, we may conceive, it would have been after the fulness of the Jews had come in that it would have been extended through them to the Gentiles (el. <a href="/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8, 9</a>). Cf. <a href="/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60</a>, where, as in other prophetic passages, the vision presented is that of the scattered <span class="accented">sons</span> of Israel being first brought into the glorified holy city, and the Gentiles gathering round them through the ever-open gates. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/11-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I ask</span><br /><span class="grk">&#923;&#941;&#947;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(Leg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">then,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
