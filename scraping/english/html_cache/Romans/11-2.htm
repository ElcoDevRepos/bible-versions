Throughout the Old Testament, God made covenants with the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;promising to be their God and to make their descendants a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). The idea of God not rejecting His people is consistent with His character as a covenant-keeping God (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>). This assurance is echoed in the prophets, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/31-37.htm">Jeremiah 31:37</a>, where God declares that He will not cast off the descendants of Israel.<p><b>whom He foreknew</b><br>The concept of foreknowledge here implies a predetermined relationship and purpose. In biblical terms, to "foreknow" is not merely to foresee but to establish a relationship beforehand. This is seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>, where God tells Jeremiah that He knew him before he was formed in the womb. In the New Testament, this idea is expanded in <a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>, where those God foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son. This indicates a special, chosen relationship with Israel, rooted in God's sovereign will and purpose.<p><b>Do you not know what the Scripture says about Elijah</b><br>This reference to Elijah draws from <a href="/1_kings/19.htm">1 Kings 19</a>, where Elijah, feeling isolated and persecuted, believes he is the only faithful one left in Israel. The mention of Elijah serves as a reminder of God's preservation of a remnant, even when it seems that all have turned away. Elijah's story is a powerful example of God's intervention and encouragement to His prophets and people during times of widespread apostasy.<p><b>how he appealed to God against Israel</b><br>Elijah's appeal to God reflects his deep concern for the spiritual state of Israel. In <a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>, Elijah laments that the Israelites have rejected God's covenant, torn down His altars, and killed His prophets. This appeal is not just a complaint but a plea for God to act in righteousness and justice. It highlights the tension between God's judgment and mercy, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible. Elijah's intercession is a type of Christ's own intercession for humanity, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>, where Jesus is described as always living to intercede for those who come to God through Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who has a covenant relationship with Israel and foreknows His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, often seen as His people in the Old Testament, with whom He has made everlasting covenants.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who appealed to God during a time of widespread idolatry in Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle and author of the Book of Romans, addressing the issue of God's faithfulness to Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_remnant.htm">The Remnant</a></b><br>A concept referring to the faithful few within Israel who remain true to God despite widespread apostasy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Despite Israel's unfaithfulness, God remains faithful to His promises.
