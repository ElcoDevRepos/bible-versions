In the context of the early church, Jews and Greeks (Gentiles) were often seen as distinct groups with different religious and cultural backgrounds. The statement reflects the breaking down of barriers, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where Paul declares that in Christ, there is neither Jew nor Greek. This echoes the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where the Servant of the Lord is a light to the nations, indicating God's plan for salvation to reach all people. Historically, Jews were God's chosen people, but with the coming of Christ, the invitation to salvation extends to all humanity, fulfilling God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>The same Lord is Lord of all:</b><br>This phrase affirms the sovereignty and universality of Christ's lordship. It aligns with the monotheistic belief central to Judaism, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, and extends it to include all people under Christ's authority. The lordship of Christ is a recurring theme in the New Testament, as in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where every knee shall bow to Jesus. This reflects the early Christian understanding that Jesus is the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah, who would reign over all nations (<a href="/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>).<p><b>And gives richly to all who call on Him:</b><br>This phrase highlights the generosity and grace of God. The concept of calling on the Lord is rooted in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>, which promises that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. This promise is reiterated in <a href="/acts/2-21.htm">Acts 2:21</a> during Peter's sermon at Pentecost. The richness of God's giving is not limited to material blessings but includes spiritual riches, such as salvation, peace, and eternal life. This reflects the abundant life Jesus promised in <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a> and underscores the inclusivity of God's grace, available to anyone who seeks Him, regardless of their background or past.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jews.htm">Jews</a></b><br>The descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were the original recipients of God's covenant and the Law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/greeks.htm">Greeks</a></b><br>Often used to represent Gentiles or non-Jews in the New Testament, symbolizing the broader world outside of the Jewish community.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, who is recognized as the sovereign Lord over all humanity, regardless of ethnic or cultural background.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The community of believers in the first century, which was grappling with the integration of Jewish and Gentile believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_christ.htm">Unity in Christ</a></b><br>The gospel transcends ethnic and cultural boundaries, uniting all believers under the lordship of Christ.

Whether someone grew up with the covenants of Israel or in the pagan world of the Gentiles, every heart needs the same Savior.<p>&#8226; Peter discovered this firsthand when God sent him to Cornelius: &#8220;God does not show favoritism, but accepts from every nation the one who fears Him&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>).<p>&#8226; The gospel levels every human barrier: ethnicity (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>), status, gender, background&#8212;none of it earns or blocks salvation.<p>&#8226; This also means no one is disqualified. If God removes the dividing wall (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-15</a>), nobody needs to ask, &#8220;Am I the right kind of person for Jesus?&#8221; The answer is always yes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The same Lord is Lord of all</b><p>&#8220;The same Lord is Lord of all,&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-12.htm">Romans 10:12</a>b)<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s Shema declared, &#8220;Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>).
