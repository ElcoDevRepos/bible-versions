The concept of God as a source of strength is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29-31</a>, where God gives power to the faint. The idea of being strengthened by God is also echoed in <a href="/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>, where Paul prays for believers to be strengthened with power through the Spirit.<p><b>by my gospel</b><br>Paul refers to the message he preaches as "my gospel," indicating the personal responsibility and divine commission he received to spread the good news of Jesus Christ. This gospel is consistent with the teachings of the apostles and is rooted in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. The term "gospel" means "good news," and it is the message of salvation and reconciliation with God. Paul's gospel is not different from that of the other apostles but is uniquely his in the sense of his calling to the Gentiles (<a href="/galatians/2-7.htm">Galatians 2:7-8</a>).<p><b>and by the proclamation of Jesus Christ</b><br>The proclamation of Jesus Christ is central to the Christian faith, focusing on His identity as the Son of God, His redemptive work on the cross, and His resurrection. This proclamation is the core of the apostolic preaching, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22-36</a>, where Peter declares Jesus as both Lord and Christ. The proclamation involves not just the historical facts about Jesus but also the implications of His lordship and the call to faith and repentance.<p><b>according to the revelation of the mystery</b><br>The term "mystery" in biblical context refers to a divine truth that was previously hidden but is now revealed. In the New Testament, this often pertains to the inclusion of the Gentiles in God's plan of salvation, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3-6</a>. The revelation of this mystery is a key theme in Paul's writings, highlighting the unfolding of God's redemptive plan through Christ.<p><b>concealed for ages past</b><br>This phrase indicates that the mystery of God's plan was hidden in previous generations but has now been disclosed through the apostles and prophets by the Spirit. The concept of divine mysteries being concealed and then revealed is seen in <a href="/daniel/2-22.htm">Daniel 2:22</a>, where God reveals deep and hidden things. The unfolding of God's plan through history demonstrates His sovereignty and the progressive nature of revelation, culminating in the person and work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Romans, emphasizing the power of the gospel and the revelation of Jesus Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure of the gospel, whose life, death, and resurrection are the foundation of Christian faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_rome.htm">The Church in Rome</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mystery_concealed_for_ages_past.htm">Mystery Concealed for Ages Past</a></b><br>Refers to the divine plan of salvation through Jesus Christ, which was hidden in the Old Testament but revealed in the New Testament.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gospel.htm">The Gospel</a></b><br>The good news of Jesus Christ, which Paul preached and which has the power to strengthen believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_the_gospel.htm">The Power of the Gospel</a></b><br>The gospel is not just a message but a divine power that strengthens believers.
