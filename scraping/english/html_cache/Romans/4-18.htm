Despite his old age and Sarah's barrenness, Abraham's faith transcended human logic. This reflects the biblical theme of God working beyond human limitations, as seen in other instances like the parting of the Red Sea (Exodus 14) and the virgin birth of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/1-18.htm">Matthew 1:18-25</a>).<p><b>Abraham in hope believed</b><br>Abraham's faith is a central theme in the Bible, often cited as a model for believers. His belief was not based on visible evidence but on trust in God's promise. This mirrors <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>, which defines faith as confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. Abraham's faith is also a precursor to the New Testament teaching of justification by faith (<a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>).<p><b>and so became the father of many nations</b><br>This phrase fulfills God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/17-4.htm">Genesis 17:4-5</a>, where God declares that Abraham will be the father of many nations. This promise is not only biological, through Isaac and Ishmael, but also spiritual, as believers in Christ are considered Abraham's descendants (<a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>). The phrase underscores the global scope of God's covenant with Abraham.<p><b>just as he had been told</b><br>This refers to God's specific promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>, where God tells him to look at the stars and promises that his offspring will be as numerous. This assurance from God is a testament to His faithfulness and the reliability of His word, a theme echoed throughout Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><b>&#8220;So shall your offspring be.&#8221;</b><br>This quote from <a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a> emphasizes the certainty of God's promise. It also points to the future fulfillment in Christ, through whom all nations are blessed (<a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a>).

The purport of the whole passage is to show, with reference to <a href="/genesis/17-15.htm">Genesis 17:15-22</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-9.htm">Genesis 18:9-16</a>, how Abraham's faith in the promise of a seed through Sarah, which seemed impossible in the natural course of things, corresponded in essence to our faith in "him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead" (ver. 24). It was faith in a Divine power above nature, able to quicken into supernatural life that which humanly is dead. And as Abraham's faith in this promised birth of Isaac involved a further faith in the fulfilment through him of all the promises, so our faith in the resurrection of Christ involves faith in all that is signified and assured to us thereby - in "the power of a Divine life" in him, to bring life out of death, to regenerate and quicken the spiritually dead, and finally in "eternal redemption" and the "restitution of all things" (cf. <a href="/john/3-6.htm">John 3:6</a>; <a href="/john/5-25.htm">John 5:25</a>; <a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-21.htm">1 Corinthians 3:21-23</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18-23</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4-8</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>; to which many other similarly significant passages might be added). It may be observed that, not only in the instance here adduced, but in his whole life as recorded in Genesis, Abraham stands forth as an exemplification of habitual faith in a Divine order beyond sight, and trust in Divine promises. In this consists the religious meaning of that record for us all. Notably so (as is especially set forth in <a href="/hebrews/11-17.htm">Hebrews 11:17</a>, etc.) in his willingness to sacrifice the son through whom the promise was to be fulfilled, retaining still his faith in the fulfilment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/4-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Against</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(par&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3844.htm">Strong's 3844: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gen: from; dat: beside, in the presence of; acc: alongside of. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">all hope,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#955;&#960;&#943;&#948;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(elpida)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1680.htm">Strong's 1680: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hope, expectation, trust, confidence.
