Historically, the Jewish people were seen as God's chosen nation, but through Christ, salvation is extended to all nations. This reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of being a light to the Gentiles. The mercy of God is a key attribute, emphasizing His compassion and grace in offering salvation to those who were once outside the covenant community. This inclusion of the Gentiles fulfills the Abrahamic promise that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>As it is written:</b><br>This phrase introduces a quotation from the Old Testament, underscoring the continuity between the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament. It reflects the apostolic practice of grounding teachings in the authority of Scripture, showing that the inclusion of the Gentiles was always part of God's plan. This method of citing Scripture was common in Jewish teaching and is used by Paul to validate his message to a diverse audience.<p><b>&#8220;Therefore I will praise You among the Gentiles;</b><br>This quotation is from <a href="/psalms/18-49.htm">Psalm 18:49</a>, attributed to King David. In its original context, David is celebrating God's deliverance and victory over his enemies. By applying this verse to the Gentiles, Paul is illustrating that the praise of God is not limited to Israel but extends to all peoples. David's role as a type of Christ is significant here; just as David praised God among the nations, so too does Christ, the Son of David, bring the message of salvation to all.<p><b>I will sing hymns to Your name.&#8221;</b><br>Singing hymns is an expression of worship and adoration, reflecting a heart transformed by God's mercy. In the cultural context of the early church, singing was a vital part of worship, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a> and <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>. This act of worship among the Gentiles signifies their acceptance into the community of faith and their response to God's grace. The name of God represents His character and deeds, and singing to His name is a declaration of His glory and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who were often seen as outsiders to the covenant community of Israel.

The Jews had their covenant to appeal to, and the attributes of God most clearly brought home to them in Christianity was His veracity in fulfilling the promises contained in this covenant. The Gentiles had no such covenant, and their admission to the blessings of Christianity was an act of pure grace and mercy, which they could only thankfully recognise. The Apostle then proceeds to quote from the Old Testament a succession of passages bearing upon this ultimate reception and triumph of the Gentiles.<p><span class= "bld">For this cause. . . .</span>--Psalms 18, from which this quotation is taken, is assigned by the heading, as most commentators believe, rightly, to David himself, as a review of his past life, and a thanksgiving for his deliverance from his enemies. David is here taken as a type of Christ. He is said to "confess to God among the Gentiles," inasmuch as He is the head of the Gentile Church, in whose name its praises are offered, and by whom they are presented.<p><span class= "bld">Confess. . . .</span>--Comp. the Note on <a href="/romans/14-11.htm" title="For it is written, As I live, said the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.">Romans 14:11</a>.
