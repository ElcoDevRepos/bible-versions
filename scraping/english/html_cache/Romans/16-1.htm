In the ancient world, letters of commendation were common for travelers, especially within the early Christian community, to ensure they were received with hospitality and trust. Paul often used such commendations to vouch for the character and mission of individuals.<p><b>our sister Phoebe</b><br>Phoebe is referred to as "our sister," highlighting the familial bond among believers in the early church. This term underscores the unity and equality among Christians, transcending social and gender barriers. Phoebe's name, of Greek origin, suggests she was likely a Gentile convert. Her role in the early church is significant, as she is entrusted with delivering Paul's letter to the Romans, indicating her reliability and prominence.<p><b>a servant of the church</b><br>The term "servant" is translated from the Greek word "diakonos," which can mean servant, minister, or deacon. This suggests that Phoebe held a recognized position of service within the church, possibly as a deaconess. Her role would have involved various forms of ministry, including teaching, caring for the needy, and possibly leadership responsibilities.<p><b>in Cenchrea</b><br>Cenchrea was a port city near Corinth, serving as its eastern harbor. It was a significant location for trade and travel, which would have facilitated the spread of the gospel. The mention of Cenchrea indicates that the early church was expanding beyond major urban centers into surrounding regions.

He calls her &#8220;our sister&#8221; because the church is a family, identifies her as a dedicated servant whose ministry blesses many, and locates her in Cenchrea, illustrating the spread of vibrant local churches. The verse encourages believers today to honor faithful workers, practice hospitality, and serve wholeheartedly wherever God places them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Phebe.</span>--As the Roman Church is especially exhorted to receive Phebe, it has been inferred that she was one of the party to which St. Paul entrusted his Epistle, if not the actual bearer of it herself.<p><span class= "bld">Our sister</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in a spiritual sense--a fellow-Christian.<p><span class= "bld">Servant.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">a deaconess,</span> keeping the technical term.

She appears to have had business, perhaps of a legal kind, that took her to Rome; and St. Paul took advantage of her going to send the letter by her, desiring also to enlist the aid of her fellow-Christians at Rome in furtherance of her business, whatever it might be. Her having business at Rome, and her having been "a succourer of many," suggests the idea of her being a lady of means. Her designation as <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of the Church at Cenchrea probably implies that she held an office there corresponding to that of <span class="accented">deaconess</span>, though there is no reason to suppose the distinguishing term <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> to have been as yet in use. Her function, and that of others (as perhaps of Tryphena and Tryphosa, mentioned in ver. 12 as "labouring much in the Lord"), might be to minister to the sick and poor, and to fulfil such charitable offices as women could best discharge. Cf. <a href="/1_timothy/3-11.htm">1 Timothy 3:11</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, mentioned in the midst of directions as to the qualifications of <span class="accented">men</span> for the office of deacons, probably denotes <span class="accented">women</span> who fulfilled similar duties. Cf. also Pliny's celebrated letter to Trajan (circ. A.D. 107), in which he says that he had extorted information as to the doings of Christians, "ex duabus ancillis, quae <span class="accented">ministrae</span> dicebantur." The Latin <span class="accented">ministra</span> answers exactly to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Cenchrea was the port of Corinth on the Saronic Gulf; and it appears from this passage that there was a Church or congregation there, as well as one or more in Corinth itself. It is an interesting conjecture that St. Paul, in speaking of Phoebe having been a succourer of himself as well as of others, may refer to an illness of his own at Cenchrea, during which she had ministered to him, and that his shaving his head at Cenchrea because he had a vow (<a href="/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a>) may have been during, or on his recovery from, that illness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/16-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I commend</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#965;&#957;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#956;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Synist&#275;mi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4921.htm">Strong's 4921: </a> </span><span class="str2">To place together, commend, prove, exhibit; instrans: I stand with; To be composed of, cohere. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
