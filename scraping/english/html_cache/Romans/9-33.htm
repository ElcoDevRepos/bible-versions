It underscores the authority of Scripture and Paul's reliance on it to validate his teachings. The phrase often introduces a fulfillment of prophecy or a theological point grounded in the Jewish tradition.<p><b>&#8220;See, I lay in Zion</b><br>Zion refers to Jerusalem, the city of David, and by extension, the people of Israel. It is a central location in biblical prophecy and history, symbolizing God's chosen place for His presence and the center of His redemptive work. The laying of a stone in Zion signifies God's sovereign action in establishing a foundation for His people.<p><b>a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense;</b><br>This imagery is drawn from <a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a> and <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>. The stone represents Jesus Christ, whose coming was a fulfillment of prophecy. For those who reject Him, He becomes a stumbling block, causing them to fall due to unbelief. This reflects the division Christ brings, as He is both the cornerstone of faith for believers and a point of contention for those who do not accept Him.<p><b>and the one who believes in Him</b><br>Faith in Jesus is the central tenet of Christian doctrine. Belief in Him is not merely intellectual assent but involves trust and reliance on His redemptive work. This phrase emphasizes the personal nature of faith and the necessity of individual response to the gospel.<p><b>will never be put to shame.&#8221;</b><br>This assurance is rooted in the promise of salvation and eternal security for believers. It echoes the confidence found in <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>, where those who trust in God's provision will not be disappointed.

In the first of these passages the prophet refers to the foundation-stone of the Temple as a symbol of the divine faithfulness; in the second to God Himself. St. Paul, like the Jewish Rabbis, applied both passages to the Messiah; not wrongly, for they foretold the triumph of the theocracy which was fulfilled in the Messiah.
