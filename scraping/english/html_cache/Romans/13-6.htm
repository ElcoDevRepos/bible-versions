In the Roman Empire, taxes were a significant part of life, funding public works and the military. The command to pay taxes aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/22-21.htm">Matthew 22:21</a>, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's," emphasizing the believer's responsibility to support governmental structures. This reflects a recognition of God's sovereignty over earthly authorities and the believer's duty to live peaceably within society.<p><b>For the authorities are God&#8217;s servants,</b><br>The term "servants" here is translated from the Greek word "leitourgos," often used to describe public servants or ministers. This suggests that governing authorities, regardless of their personal beliefs or actions, are instituted by God to maintain order and justice. This concept is echoed in <a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13-14</a>, where believers are urged to submit to every human authority for the Lord's sake. The idea that authorities are God's servants underscores the belief that God uses even secular governments to accomplish His purposes.<p><b>who devote themselves to their work.</b><br>The phrase indicates a sense of duty and commitment expected from those in authority. In the Roman context, officials were responsible for maintaining peace and order, collecting taxes, and administering justice. The dedication to their roles is seen as part of God's providential plan, ensuring societal stability. This devotion is a reminder to believers that while human leaders are fallible, their roles are part of a divine order. The call for authorities to be devoted to their work also implies a standard of integrity and diligence, reflecting the biblical principle that all work should be done as unto the Lord (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_authorities.htm">Roman Authorities</a></b><br>The governing bodies in Rome during the time of Paul's writing.

Paying taxes is part of that conscience-driven submission.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13-14</a> reinforces the same principle: submission &#8220;for the Lord&#8217;s sake to every human authority.&#8221; Taxes fund the very structures God uses to keep social order.<p>&#8226; This obedience is practical worship: honoring God by honoring the structures He ordained (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the authorities are God&#8217;s servants</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;For the authorities are God&#8217;s servants.&#8221; Scripture views civil officials&#8212;believers or not&#8212;as serving under God&#8217;s appointment.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a> repeats the title: &#8220;He is God&#8217;s servant for your good&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a> declares that God &#8220;removes kings and establishes them.&#8221; Even pagan rulers rise only by His sovereign hand.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a> shows God calling the Persian king Cyrus &#8220;My shepherd,&#8221; proving He can use any leader for His purposes.<p>&#8226; Because rulers are &#8220;servants,&#8221; resisting lawful authority becomes resistance to God Himself (<a href="/romans/13-2.htm">Romans 13:2</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1-2</a> urges prayer &#8220;for kings and all those in authority,&#8221; underscoring their God-given role and our obligation to support them spiritually as well as financially.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who devote themselves to their work</b><p>Authorities &#8220;devote themselves to their work.&#8221; God expects rulers to focus on maintaining justice and order, tasks that require resources supplied through taxes.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/13-3.htm">Romans 13:3-4</a> defines their work: punishing wrongdoers and commending those who do right, functions that preserve peaceful society.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a> commanded Israel to appoint judges who would &#8220;judge the people with righteous judgment,&#8221; an Old Testament parallel.<p>&#8226; When John the Baptist addressed tax collectors and soldiers, he affirmed their vocational integrity rather than telling them to quit (<a href="/luke/3-12.htm">Luke 3:12-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Taxes enable these servants to carry out God&#8217;s mandate&#8212;courts, defense, infrastructure, and public welfare all fall under the sphere of &#8220;the sword&#8221; they bear (<a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/titus/3-1.htm">Titus 3:1</a> reminds believers to &#8220;be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient,&#8221; a stance that includes faithfully funding the work God assigns them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/13-6.htm">Romans 13:6</a> teaches that paying taxes is a concrete, conscientious act of submission to God.
