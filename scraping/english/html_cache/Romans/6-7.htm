In the context of <a href="/romans/6.htm">Romans 6</a>, Paul is discussing the believer's identification with Christ's death and resurrection. This spiritual death signifies a break from the power of sin. In the cultural context of the Roman audience, death was seen as a definitive end, symbolizing a complete separation from one's previous life. This concept is echoed in <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, where Paul states, "I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me."<p><b>has been freed from sin</b><br>The Greek term used here for "freed" can also be translated as "justified." This indicates not only liberation from the power of sin but also a legal declaration of righteousness. In the historical context of Roman law, a person who died was no longer subject to legal obligations or penalties, symbolizing the believer's release from the dominion of sin. This freedom is not merely a future hope but a present reality for those in Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>, "So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed." This freedom is a type of the ultimate liberation that Christ provides, fulfilling the prophecies of a Messiah who would deliver His people from bondage, as foretold in <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the Roman Christians were a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers living in the heart of the Roman Empire.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin.htm">Sin</a></b><br>A central theme in Paul's writings, sin is described as a power that enslaves humanity, from which believers are freed through Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a></b><br>In this context, death refers to the spiritual death to sin that believers experience through their union with Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/freedom.htm">Freedom</a></b><br>The state of being liberated from the bondage of sin, which is a key outcome of salvation in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_spiritual_death.htm">Understanding Spiritual Death</a></b><br>Believers are called to recognize that through Christ, they have died to sin.
