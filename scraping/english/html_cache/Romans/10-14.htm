In the biblical context, "calling on the Lord" is an expression of worship, prayer, and reliance on God (<a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>; <a href="/acts/2-21.htm">Acts 2:21</a>). The rhetorical question underscores the logical sequence of salvation: belief must precede invocation. Historically, the Jewish audience of Paul's time would have understood the importance of faith in God, yet many struggled to accept Jesus as the Messiah. This reflects the broader biblical theme that faith is essential for a relationship with God (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>).<p><b>And how can they believe in the One of whom they have not heard?</b><br>This phrase highlights the necessity of hearing the message of Christ for faith to develop. In the cultural context of the first century, oral communication was the primary means of spreading news and teachings. The importance of hearing is also seen in <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>, where faith is said to come from hearing the message of Christ. Theologically, this underscores the role of revelation and the proclamation of the Gospel as essential for belief. The connection to other scripture, such as <a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>, emphasizes the beauty and necessity of those who bring good news.<p><b>And how can they hear without someone to preach?</b><br>This phrase points to the essential role of preaching in the dissemination of the Gospel. The term "preach" in the original Greek implies a public proclamation, akin to a herald announcing news. In the early church, apostles and evangelists traveled extensively to preach the Gospel, as seen in the missionary journeys of Paul (Acts 13-28). This reflects the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus commands His followers to go and make disciples of all nations. The historical context of the Roman Empire, with its extensive road networks and common language (Koine Greek), facilitated the spread of Christianity through preaching.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is addressing the Roman Christians, emphasizing the necessity of preaching for faith to arise.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_christians.htm">Roman Christians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, living in a diverse and often challenging environment for early Christians.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/preachers/messengers.htm">Preachers/Messengers</a></b><br>Those who are called to proclaim the Gospel so that others may hear and believe.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/unbelievers.htm">Unbelievers</a></b><br>The individuals who have not yet heard or believed in the Gospel, highlighting the need for evangelism.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gospel.htm">The Gospel</a></b><br>The message of salvation through Jesus Christ, central to the passage and the mission of the Church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_preaching.htm">The Necessity of Preaching</a></b><br>Preaching is essential for people to hear and believe the Gospel.

Calling is an act of wholehearted trust, a verbal outcry that presumes the Lord hears and rescues. Yet Paul points out the logical starting point:<p>&#8226; People do not cry out to someone they doubt. Genuine belief precedes the cry (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The Scripture pattern is clear: faith, then appeal. Elijah believed before calling for fire from heaven (<a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36-37</a>). Peter believed before crying, &#8220;Lord, save me!&#8221; on the waves (<a href="/matthew/14-30.htm">Matthew 14:30-31</a>).<p>&#8226; Therefore, the promise of <a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>&#8212;quoted in <a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>&#8212;stands open to all, but only realized by those who first trust that the Lord truly is Savior (<a href="/acts/2-21.htm">Acts 2:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And how can they believe in the One of whom they have not heard?</b><p>Belief is anchored in information, not imagination. Paul underscores that saving faith is rooted in the revealed gospel, not in a vague sense of the divine.<p>&#8226; Hearing means receiving the specific news that &#8220;Christ died for our sins&#8230;was buried&#8230;was raised&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, faith is generated by God&#8217;s spoken word&#8212;Abraham believed after hearing God&#8217;s promise (<a href="/genesis/15-4.htm">Genesis 15:4-6</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-6.htm">Galatians 3:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Even Cornelius, already God-fearing, needed Peter&#8217;s message to believe unto salvation (<a href="/acts/10-22.htm">Acts 10:22, 33</a>-44).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And how can they hear without someone to preach?</b><p>The Lord has chosen human messengers as His ordinary means of broadcasting the gospel.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>). The preached word is God&#8217;s appointed delivery system.<p>&#8226; Old Testament prophets modeled this: Isaiah&#8217;s lips were cleansed so he could say, &#8220;Here am I. Send me!&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; New Testament practice confirms it: Paul and Barnabas &#8220;spoke the word of the Lord&#8221; and &#8220;many believed&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-44.htm">Acts 13:44-48</a>).<p>&#8226; The chain is unbreakable: sent preacher &#8594; heard message &#8594; believed gospel &#8594; called on the Lord &#8594; saved (<a href="/romans/10-15.htm">Romans 10:15</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/10-14.htm">Romans 10:14</a> unpacks the logical sequence God ordained for salvation: proclamation leads to hearing, hearing produces belief, belief issues in a heartfelt call, and that call receives the promised rescue. Each link depends on the previous one, emphasizing both the necessity of gospel preaching and the certainty that all who believe and call upon Christ will be saved.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14-21) Thus there is a distinct order--belief, confession, invocation. But before either the last or the first of these steps is taken the gospel must be preached. The Jew, however, cannot plead that the gospel has not been preached to him. It <span class= "ital">has</span> been preached both to Jew and Gentile. Both Moses and Isaiah had foretold the conversion of the Gentiles, and Isaiah had also foretold the unbelief of the Jews.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?</span> This question may be taken, in the first place, as serving to connect the two passages from Joel and from Isaiah (see previous note). But it is further the beginning of a sorites, suggested by a new thought, which is carried out to the end of the chapter. The course of this new thought through the rest of the chapter may be expounded as follows: It might be pleaded, in behalf of the unbelieving Jews, that they had never really heard, through preachers duly sent to them, the gospel message; and hence that they were not to be blamed for rejecting it. With this idea before him, the apostle first (vers. 14, 15) allows generally, in the form of a series of questions, that, as before <span class="accented">calling on the Lord</span> there must be <span class="accented">faith</span>, so before <span class="accented">faith</span> there must be <span class="accented">hearing</span>, before <span class="accented">hearing</span> there must <span class="accented">be preaching</span>, and for <span class="accented">preaching</span> there must be authorizing <span class="accented">mission</span>; and he quotes, in illustration, a passage from Isaiah, which describes beautifully the preaching of good tidings of peace by commissioned messengers to all the world. But he is careful to add (vers. 16, 17) that, according to the same prophet, such universal <span class="accented">preaching</span>, and consequent <span class="accented">hearing</span>, does not involve universal <span class="accented">hearkening</span>; thus showing, in view of the main purpose of his argument, that the fact of the Jews not <span class="accented">hearkening</span> now is no evidence that they had not <span class="accented">heard.</span> Then he goes on to ask whether any could plead the excuse of not having <span class="accented">heard</span>, so as to justify want of the <span class="accented">faith</span> that cometh of <span class="accented">hearing.</span> Nay, he replies (ver. 18), the sound of the good tidings has gone forth to all the earth, even like the language of nature spoken of in <a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19</a>. Then (ver. 19), pressing his argument home to the Jews, who have been all along in view, he asks, "But I say, Did not <span class="accented">Israel</span> know?" The word <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, being different from <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> previously used, must express some different meaning. But what St. Paul exactly meant by it is not quite clear. The quotations from the Old Testament that follow in proof of knowledge (vers. 19, 20) seem to support the view that what Israel knew, or ought to have known, was the Divine design of the promulgation of the "good tidings" to all the world, which has just been spoken cf. Such promulgation should have been to them no stumbling-block; for it had been told to them from Moses downwards, and they had full opportunity of <span class="accented">knowing</span> it. Lastly (ver. 21), the apostle intimates that the present state of things, in which Gentiles accept the gospel while Israel in the main rejects it, far from being an objection to it, is but a further fulfilment of Isaiah's prophecies, which represent God as making himself known to those who had not known him, while pleading with Israel in vain. This exposition of the supposed course of thought being borne in mind, the passage (with the further aid of some interposed comments) may become intelligible. It continues: And how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard! and how shall they hear without a preacher! and how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that [preach the gospel (or, good <span class="accented">tidings</span>) of peace, and] bring glad tidings of flood things!
