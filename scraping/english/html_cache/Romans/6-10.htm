The death of Christ is seen as a sacrificial act, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of a suffering servant who bears the sins of many. The crucifixion took place outside the city walls of Jerusalem, at a site known as Golgotha. This event is central to the Christian understanding of atonement, where Jesus, the sinless Lamb of God, takes upon Himself the sins of humanity.<p><b>He died to sin</b><br>This indicates that Jesus' death was a decisive victory over sin. In the context of Romans, sin is often personified as a power that enslaves humanity. By dying to sin, Jesus breaks its hold, offering believers freedom from its dominion. This concept is rooted in the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, where the death of an innocent animal symbolically removed sin. Jesus' death is the ultimate fulfillment of this system, providing a once-for-all solution to the problem of sin.<p><b>once for all</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the completeness and finality of Christ's sacrifice. Unlike the repeated sacrifices of the Old Testament, Jesus' death was a singular, all-sufficient act. <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a> echoes this idea, stating that by one offering, He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified. This underscores the sufficiency of Christ's atonement and the assurance it provides to believers.<p><b>but the life He lives</b><br>Following His resurrection, Jesus lives a new life, characterized by victory over death and sin. This new life is not subject to the limitations of His earthly existence. The resurrection is a cornerstone of Christian faith, affirming Jesus' divine nature and His power over death. It also serves as a prototype for the believer's future resurrection, as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>.<p><b>He lives to God</b><br>This phrase highlights the purpose and orientation of Jesus' resurrected life. Living to God implies a life fully devoted to the will and glory of the Father. It reflects the perfect obedience and communion between Jesus and God, which is a model for believers. This concept is echoed in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where Jesus is exalted and given a name above every name, to the glory of God the Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to this verse, Jesus is the one who died to sin and now lives to God.

Death has lost all its power over Him. The death which He died, He died to sin. It was the last sacrifice which He made to sin, and one that freed Him from its dominion for ever. He died to it once for all, and His death did not need to be, and could not be, repeated. On the other hand, His life is assured, because it is wholly dependent upon God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God</span>. "Died unto sin" certainly does not mean here, as some have taken it, died <span class="accented">by reason of sin</span>, or <span class="accented">to atone for sin</span>, but has the sense, elsewhere obvious in this chapter, of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, followed by a dative, which was explained under ver. 2. Christ was, indeed, never subject to sin, or himself infected with it, as we are; but he "bore the sins of many;" "the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all." He submitted for us to the condition and penalty of human sin; but, when he died, he threw off its burden, and was done with it for ever (cf. <a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a>, "Unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time <span class="accented">without sin</span> unto salvation"). The purpose of thus describing the permanent life to God of the risen Christ is, of course, to show that the new life of us who are accounted to have risen with Christ must in like manner be permanent and free from sin. "Quo docere vult hanc vitae novitatem tota vila esse Christianis persequendam, Nam si Christi imaginem in se repraesentare debent, hanc perpetuo durare necesse est. Non quod uno momento emoriatur caro in nobis, sicuti nuper diximus: sed quia retrocedere in ea mortificanda non liceat. Si enim in coenum nostrum revolvimur, Christum abnegamus; cujus nisi per vitae novitatem consortes esse non possumus, sicut ipse vitam incorruptibilem agit" (Calvin).
