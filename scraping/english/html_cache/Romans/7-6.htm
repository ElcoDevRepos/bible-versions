It marks a pivotal change in the believer's relationship with God, emphasizing the present reality of salvation through Christ. This transition is a common theme in Paul's writings, highlighting the shift from the old covenant to the new covenant.<p><b>having died to what bound us</b><br>This refers to the believer's death to the law through the body of Christ, as explained earlier in <a href="/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>. The law, which once held people captive by highlighting sin, no longer has dominion over those who are in Christ. This death is symbolic of the believer's union with Christ in His death and resurrection, as seen in <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4-5</a>.<p><b>we have been released from the law</b><br>The release from the law signifies freedom from its penalties and the inability to achieve righteousness through it. This echoes <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>, where Christ redeems believers from the curse of the law. The law's purpose was to reveal sin, but it could not provide salvation, which is now available through faith in Jesus.<p><b>so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit</b><br>This phrase highlights the transformation in how believers live and serve God. The "new way of the Spirit" contrasts with the old way of adhering to the law. The Holy Spirit empowers believers to live righteously, fulfilling the righteous requirements of the law through love and obedience, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-18</a>.<p><b>and not in the old way of the written code</b><br>The "old way of the written code" refers to the Mosaic Law, which was external and written on tablets of stone. This contrasts with the new covenant, where God's laws are written on believers' hearts, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a> and fulfilled in <a href="/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10</a>.

In the act of our baptism, which united us to Christ, we obtained a release from our old tyrant, the Law.<p><span class= "bld">Wherein we were held.</span>--Oppressed, held in bondage.<p><span class= "bld">That we should serve.</span>--Rather, perhaps, <span class= "ital">so that we serve;</span> result, not purpose.

There the apostle intimated that he was but speaking humanly in describing our new allegiance to righteousness as bond-service, such as we had once been under. Here he intimates the true character of our new service by the addition of the words, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. These are characteristic and significant expressions. "Spirit" and "letter" are similarly contrasted (<a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>). "Spiritum literae opponit, quia antequam ad Dei voluntatem voluntas nostra per Spiritum sanctum formats sit, non habemus in Lege nisi externam literam; quae fraenum quidem externis nostris actionibus injicit, concupiscientiae autem nostrae furorem minime cohibet. Novitatem. vero Spiritui attribuit, quia in locum veteris hominis succedit; ut litera vetus dicitur quae interit per Spiritus regenerationem" (Calvin). Otherwise, with regard to <span class="accented">newness</span> and <span class="accented">old</span>ness, "Vetustatis et novitatis vocabulo Paulus spectat duo testamenta" (Bengel). That the latter idea may have suggested the expressions seems not unlikely from <a href="/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6-18</a> (cf. also <a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>). For in both these passages the idea of the verse before us enters, and in both the old and new covenants are contrasted with regard to it. It may be enough here to say that the contrast in its essence is between exacted conformity to an external code (which was the characteristic of the old covenant) and inspired allegiance to the Law of God written on the heart (which is the characteristic of the new). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/7-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">now,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#957;&#965;&#957;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(nyni)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3570.htm">Strong's 3570: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of nun for emphasis; just now.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">having died</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#952;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(apothanontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_599.htm">Strong's 599: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be dying, be about to die, wither, decay.
