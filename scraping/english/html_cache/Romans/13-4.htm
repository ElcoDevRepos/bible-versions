The term "servant" (Greek: diakonos) suggests a role of service and duty, aligning with the biblical principle that all authority is established by God (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). This reflects the Old Testament understanding of leaders like King David, who were seen as shepherds of God's people (<a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a>). The purpose of this service is for the "good" of the people, indicating that the primary role of government is to promote justice and societal well-being, echoing the wisdom literature's call for righteous leadership (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>).<p><b>But if you do wrong, be afraid,</b><br>This phrase introduces the concept of accountability and the fear of consequences for wrongdoing. The fear mentioned here is not merely emotional but a recognition of the authority's power to enforce laws. This aligns with the biblical principle of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>) and the understanding that God uses human institutions to maintain order and justice. The fear of punishment serves as a deterrent to evil actions, similar to the warnings found in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-11.htm">Deuteronomy 13:11</a>).<p><b>for he does not carry the sword in vain.</b><br>The "sword" symbolizes the authority's power to enforce laws, including the use of force if necessary. In the Roman context, the sword was a symbol of the magistrate's power to execute justice, including capital punishment. This reflects the broader biblical theme of divine justice, where God uses human agents to execute His judgment (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>). The phrase underscores the seriousness of governmental authority and its role in maintaining order, resonating with the prophetic calls for justice and righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>).<p><b>He is God&#8217;s servant, an agent of retribution to the wrongdoer.</b><br>Reiterating the role of the authority as God's servant, this phrase highlights the aspect of retribution. The concept of retribution is deeply rooted in biblical justice, where wrongdoing is met with appropriate consequences (<a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23-25</a>). The authority acts as an "agent" (Greek: ekdikos), meaning one who carries out justice on behalf of another, in this case, God. This reflects the divine mandate given to rulers to uphold justice and punish evil, as seen in the roles of judges and kings throughout Israel's history (<a href="/1_kings/3-28.htm">1 Kings 3:28</a>). The phrase underscores the moral responsibility of authorities to act justly, aligning with the prophetic vision of a world where justice prevails (<a href="/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, addressing the Christian community in Rome.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_authorities.htm">Roman Authorities</a></b><br>The governing bodies in Rome during the time of Paul's writing, representing civil authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christian_community_in_rome.htm">Christian Community in Rome</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, navigating their faith under Roman rule.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate authority who ordains earthly rulers as His servants.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wrongdoers.htm">Wrongdoers</a></b><br>Individuals who act contrary to the laws and moral standards established by God and enforced by authorities.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_ordination_of_authority.htm">Divine Ordination of Authority</a></b><br>Recognize that all authority is established by God, and rulers serve as His agents for maintaining order and justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_government.htm">Role of Government</a></b><br>Understand that the primary role of government is to promote good and restrain evil, acting as God's servant for societal welfare.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_retribution.htm">Fear of Retribution</a></b><br>Acknowledge that fear of punishment is a legitimate deterrent for wrongdoing, as authorities are empowered to enforce justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christian_conduct.htm">Christian Conduct</a></b><br>As Christians, we are called to live righteously and respect authority, reflecting our ultimate submission to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/balancing_obedience_and_conscience.htm">Balancing Obedience and Conscience</a></b><br>While respecting authority, discern when obedience to God takes precedence, especially when human laws conflict with divine commands.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_13_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 13:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_13_4_Role_of_authorities.htm">How does Romans 13:4 define the role of governing authorities as God's servants?

"To bear the sword" seems to be a recognised Greek phrase to express the power of the magistrates. It was carried before them in processions, and on other important occasions.<p>It is clear from this passage that capital punishment is sanctioned by Scripture. At the same time its abolition is not excluded, as the abolition of slavery was not excluded, if the gradual development of Christian principle should seem to demand it.
