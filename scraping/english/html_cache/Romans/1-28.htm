In the broader context of <a href="/romans/1.htm">Romans 1</a>, Paul is addressing the Gentile world, emphasizing that despite the evidence of God's existence and nature through creation (<a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>), people chose not to honor Him. This reflects the biblical theme of human rebellion against God, seen as early as <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a> with the fall of man. The phrase "did not see fit" suggests a deliberate decision, indicating moral and spiritual blindness. This rejection is not due to ignorance but a conscious choice to ignore God's revelation.<p><b>He gave them up to a depraved mind</b><br>The concept of God "giving them up" is a judicial act, where God allows individuals to follow their sinful desires as a form of judgment. This is a recurring theme in <a href="/romans/1.htm">Romans 1</a>, where God gives people over to various sins as a consequence of their rejection of Him (<a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24, 26</a>). The "depraved mind" refers to a corrupted way of thinking, unable to discern right from wrong. This echoes the Old Testament, where similar language is used to describe the consequences of persistent sin (e.g., <a href="/psalms/81-12.htm">Psalm 81:12</a>). Theologically, it underscores the seriousness of turning away from God and the resulting moral decay.<p><b>to do what ought not to be done</b><br>This phrase describes the actions that result from a depraved mind. The "ought not to be done" implies a violation of God's moral order, which is evident in the natural law written on human hearts (<a href="/romans/2-14.htm">Romans 2:14-15</a>). The actions that follow are detailed in the subsequent verses (<a href="/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29-31</a>), which list various sins that characterize a life apart from God. This reflects the biblical principle that thoughts lead to actions, as seen in Jesus' teachings on the heart's role in sin (<a href="/matthew/15-19.htm">Matthew 15:19</a>). The phrase serves as a warning of the destructive path of sin and the need for repentance and transformation through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, addressing the believers in Rome, providing theological insights and practical teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile believers, living in the heart of the Roman Empire.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in the passage, whose judgment is described as giving people over to a depraved mind.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unbelievers.htm">The Unbelievers</a></b><br>Those who have rejected God and are described as having a depraved mind due to their refusal to acknowledge Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_depraved_mind.htm">The Depraved Mind</a></b><br>A state of moral and spiritual corruption resulting from the rejection of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledging_god.htm">Acknowledging God</a></b><br>Recognize the importance of acknowledging God in all aspects of life.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is capable of the senses <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "to prove" (as in assaying metals), and, generally, "to discern," or "judge;" <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "to approve," after supposed proving.

But it is at least doubtful whether <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> can be taken in an active sense, which is not its classical one. In the New Testament it occurs <a href="/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5, 6</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-8.htm">2 Timothy 3:8</a>; <a href="/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-8.htm">Hebrews 6:8</a>. In the first of the above passages the word obviously means "rejected" (in the Authorized Version <span class="accented">a castaway</span>), with reference to the comparison of a competitor in athletic contests being proved unworthy of the prize - a sense cognate to the common one of the same adjective as applied to spurious metals, rejected or worthless after being tested. In <a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5, 6</a>, either sense seems admissible - <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. But not so in <a href="/hebrews/6-8.htm">Hebrews 6:8</a>, where the word is applied to barren land. The passages from 2 Timothy and Titus may in themselves admit the sense of <span class="accented">undiscerning</span>, but the passive one is more probable in view of the common usage of the word. On the other hand, ch. 12:2 may be adduced in favour of the active sense; for there the consequence of the renewal of the mind in Christians is said to be that they may <span class="accented">prove</span>, or <span class="accented">discern</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>), what is Gods will; and hence it may seem probable that the want of such <span class="accented">discernment is</span> denoted here. The same passage also favours the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> being taken here in sense (1) given above, and Jowett's rendering of the whole passage. It is, after all, uncertain; nor does it follow that the Greek <span class="accented">paronomasia</span> can be reproduced in English. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/1-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Furthermore,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">since</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#8060;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(kath&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2531.htm">Strong's 2531: </a> </span><span class="str2">According to the manner in which, in the degree that, just as, as.
