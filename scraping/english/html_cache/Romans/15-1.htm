In the context of Romans, Paul addresses those who have a robust conscience and are not troubled by issues such as dietary laws or observing certain days. The "strong" are those who have a deeper grasp of the freedom found in Christ (<a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>). This strength is not merely physical or intellectual but spiritual, rooted in a mature relationship with God.<p><b>ought to bear with the shortcomings of the weak</b><br>The term "ought" implies a moral obligation or duty. The "strong" are called to support and uphold those who are "weak," meaning those who may struggle with doubts or scruples about certain practices. This echoes the teaching of <a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>, where believers are encouraged to "carry each other's burdens." The "shortcomings" refer to areas where the "weak" may lack understanding or confidence in their faith. This call to bear with others is a reflection of Christ's own patience and love for humanity.<p><b>and not to please ourselves</b><br>This phrase emphasizes selflessness and the call to put others' needs before our own desires. It challenges believers to follow the example of Christ, who did not seek to please Himself but rather served others, even to the point of sacrifice (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-8</a>). This teaching is counter-cultural, especially in a society that often prioritizes personal satisfaction and individual rights. The call is to live in a way that builds up the community of faith, reflecting the unity and love that Jesus prayed for in <a href="/john/17-20.htm">John 17:20-23</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is writing to the Christian community in Rome, addressing both Jewish and Gentile believers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, consisting of a diverse group of believers with varying levels of spiritual maturity and understanding.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_strong_and_the_weak.htm">The Strong and the Weak</a></b><br>Terms used by Paul to describe believers with differing levels of faith and understanding, particularly in matters of conscience and liberty.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_strength_and_weakness.htm">Understanding Strength and Weakness</a></b><br>Spiritual maturity involves recognizing our strengths and using them to support others, not to boast or dominate.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/bearing_with_one_another.htm">Bearing with One Another</a></b><br>True Christian love is demonstrated by our willingness to bear with the weaknesses of others, showing patience and understanding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/selflessness_over_self-pleasure.htm">Selflessness Over Self-Pleasure</a></b><br>The call to not please ourselves challenges us to prioritize the needs and growth of others over our own desires.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>The church is a diverse body, and unity is achieved when the strong support the weak, fostering an environment of growth and encouragement.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_love_in_action.htm">Practical Love in Action</a></b><br>Our faith is made evident through practical acts of love and support, reflecting Christ's love for us.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_15_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 15:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_handle_others_weaknesses_daily.htm">How can we "bear the weaknesses" of others in our daily interactions?

SUPPLEMENTARY. (See summary of contents, p. 16.) Questions have been raised and much discussed as to the connection of the last two chapters, 15. and 16, with the rest of the Epistle. The facts and the opinions founded on them may be summarized as follows. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> There is sufficient proof that in early times copies of the Epistle existed without these two chapters. The evidence is this - <p><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> Origen (on <a href="/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25-27</a>) speaks of some copies in his time being without the concluding doxology, and also without any part of these two chapters, attributing the omission to Marcion, for his own purposes, having mutilated the Epistle. His words are, "Caput hoc (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> <a href="/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25-27</a>) Marcion, a quo scripturae evangelicae et apostolicae interpolatae sunt, de hac Epistola penitus abstulit; et non solum hoe, sod ab hoc loco ubi scriptum est, Omne autem quod non ex fide est peccatum est (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> <a href="/romans/14-23.htm">Romans 14:23</a>) usque ad finem cuncta dissecuit." Tertullian also ('Contra Marcion') speaks of Marcion having mutilated this Epistle, though not specifying these two chapters. <p><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> In Codex Amiatinus (a manuscript of the Latin Bible of the sixth century) there is a prefixed table of contents, referring by numbers to the sections into which the Epistle was divided, and describing the subject of each section. In this table the fiftieth section is thus described: "On the peril of one who grieves his brother by his meat," plainly denoting <a href="/romans/14-15.htm">Romans 14:15-23</a>; and the next and concluding section is described thus: "On the mystery of the Lord kept secret before his Passion, but after his Passion revealed," which description can only refer to the doxology of <a href="/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25-27</a>. Hence it would seem that in some Latin copy of the Epistle to which the table of contents referred, the doxology followed <a href="/romans/14-23.htm">Romans 14:23</a> with nothing between.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/15-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">We</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;meis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
