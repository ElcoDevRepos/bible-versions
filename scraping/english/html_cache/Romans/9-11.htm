The mention of their birth highlights the sovereignty of God in His choices, independent of human actions or merits. This sets the stage for understanding God's election, emphasizing that His purposes are established before human intervention. The context of their birth in the ancient Near East, where lineage and birthright were significant, underscores the radical nature of God's choice.<p><b>or had done anything good or bad</b><br>This highlights the principle that God's election is not based on human works or moral actions. It echoes the theme found in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, where salvation is described as a gift of grace, not a result of works. This phrase challenges the cultural norms of merit-based favor, prevalent in both ancient and modern societies, and underscores the biblical teaching of grace.<p><b>in order that God&#8217;s plan of election might stand</b><br>This phrase points to the divine purpose and sovereignty in God's choices.

It underscores the idea that God's purposes are unchanging and reliable, providing assurance to believers of their secure position in God's plan.

It is here to be carefully observed that, though Jacob and Esau were individuals, yet it is not as such, but as the progenitors and representatives of races, that they are here spoken cf. So it was, too, in both the passages quoted from the Old Testament. In <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a> the words are, "Two <span class="accented">nations</span> are in thy womb, and two <span class="accented">manner of people</span> shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one <span class="accented">people</span> shall be stronger than the other <span class="accented">people</span>; and the elder shall serve the younger." In <a href="/malachi/1-2.htm">Malachi 1:2</a> the prophet's entire drift is to set forth the Divine favour shown, from the first and still, to the race of Israel as compared with the race of Edom. Hence, as well as from the purport of the chapter as announced at its beginning, it is evident that the subject <span class="accented">of individual</span> predestination does not really come in, as it did in ch. 8, but only that of nations or races of men to a position of privilege as inheritors of promises. It will be seen, also, as we go on, that the introduction in illustration of the case of the individual Pharaoh does not really affect the drift of the chapter as above explained. The strong expression, "Esau I hated" (applicable, as shown above, not to the individual Esau, but to the race of Edom) is capable of being explained as meaning, "I excluded him from the love I showed to Israel." The evidence of such alleged hatred the prophet expresses thus: "and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness;" whereas Israel, it is implied, had been protected from such desolation. As to the necessary force of the word in the Hebrew (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5db;&#x5d0;</span>), we may compare <a href="/genesis/29-30.htm">Genesis 29:30, 31</a>, where in ver. 30 it is said that Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah, and in ver. 31, as meaning the same thing, that Leah was hated; and <a href="/deuteronomy/21-15.htm">Deuteronomy 21:15</a>, "If a man have two wives, one beloved and another hated." In both these passages the same verb is used as in Malachi, and need not, in either case, mean more than disregarding one in comparison with another who is loved. For the use, in the New Testament, of the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> in a sense for the expression of which our English "to hate," in its usual acceptation, is evidently too strong, cf. <a href="/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a> (to be compared with <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>) and <a href="/john/12-25.htm">John 12:25</a>; so also, though not so distinctly, <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a> and <a href="/luke/16-13.htm">Luke 16:13</a>. It is, moreover, not improbable that the Prophet Malachi, in his patriotic ardour, had in his mind the idea of wrath against the race of Edom on the part of the LORD, as "the people," as he afterwards says, "against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever." But even so, the glowing language of prophets need not be taken as dogmatic assertion; and certainly not as binding us to believe that any race of men is, in the literal sense of the expression, hated of Cod. Such a view is in evident contradiction to the general teaching of Scripture, and notably so to that of St. Paul, who has so emphatically declared that God "made of one blood all nations of men," and is One to all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/9-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Yet</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
