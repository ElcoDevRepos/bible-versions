The term "His Son" underscores the divine nature of Jesus, affirming His unique relationship with God the Father. This is a foundational Christian belief, as seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, which highlights the love of God in sending His only Son. The concept of Jesus as the Son of God is also a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, which speaks of the Messiah as God's Son.<p><b>who was a descendant of David</b><br>This phrase establishes Jesus' legitimate claim to the throne of Israel, fulfilling the Old Testament prophecies that the Messiah would come from the line of David. This lineage is crucial for validating Jesus' messianic credentials, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>, where God promises David that his throne will be established forever. The genealogies in <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a> and <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a> trace Jesus' ancestry back to David, reinforcing His rightful place in Jewish history and prophecy.<p><b>according to the flesh</b><br>This phrase highlights the humanity of Jesus, affirming that He was truly human and shared in the physical nature of mankind. It underscores the doctrine of the Incarnation, where Jesus took on human flesh, as described in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>. This is significant because it means that Jesus experienced human life fully, including its limitations and sufferings, yet without sin. This dual nature of Christ&#8212;fully God and fully man&#8212;is a mystery central to Christian theology, allowing Him to be the perfect mediator between God and humanity, as explained in <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, referred to as "His Son" in this verse, emphasizing His divine nature and mission.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, a man after God's own heart, and a significant figure in Jewish history.

His having come humanly "of the seed of David" is suitably noted here, where "the Son" is being set forth as fulfilling the Old Testament promises; for they uniformly represent the Messiah as thus descended, and it was essential to the Jewish conception of him that he should be so (cf. <a href="/matthew/22-42.htm">Matthew 22:42</a>; <a href="/john/7-42.htm">John 7:42</a>; and for the stress laid by the writers of the New Testament on the fact that Jesus was so - of which fact no doubt was entertained - cf. <a href="/hebrews/7-14.htm">Hebrews 7:14</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, etc. See, among many other passages, <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>; <a href="/luke/2-4.htm">Luke 2:4, 5</a>; <a href="/acts/2-30.htm">Acts 2:30</a>; <a href="/acts/13-23.htm">Acts 13:23</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-8.htm">2 Timothy 2:8</a>). Meyer, commenting on the verse before us, goes somewhat out of his way to set forth that only Joseph's, not Mary's, descent from David was in St. Paul's mind, saying that "the Davidic descent of the mother of Jesus can by no means be established from the New Testament," and also that "Paul nowhere indicates the view of a supernatural generation of the bodily nature of Jesus." As to the first of these assertions, it may be observed that, in the opening chapters of our Gospel of St. Luke (representing certainly the early belief of the Church) our Lord seems to be regarded as actually descended from David - not legally so accounted only - though, at the same time, his supernatural generation is distinctly asserted (comp. <a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32</a> with Luke 1:35). Hence we are led to infer Mary's, as well as Joseph's, descent from David, whether or not either of the genealogies given in St. Matthew's and St. Luke's Gospels represents hers. Further, with respect to those two genealogies (evidently independent ones, and both probably got from genealogical records preserved at Jerusalem), a probable way of accounting for the two distinct lines of descent through which Joseph seems to be traced to David, is to suppose one of them to be really Mary's, the legal representative of whose family Joseph had become by marriage, so as to be entered in legal documents as the son of her father (see art. on "Genealogy of Jesus Christ," in 'Dictionary of the Bible,' W. Smith, LL.D.). As to Meyer's second assertion above alluded to, it is true that St. Paul nowhere refers to our Lord's supernatural conception spoken of in the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Luke. But it does not follow that it was not already included in the Church's creed, or that St. Paul himself was unaware of it or disbelieved it. This is not the place for enlarging on the evidence, at the present day increasing in force, of the early origin of our existing Gospels, and of their being a true embodiment of the Church's original belief. St. Paul's silence as to the manner how the Son of God became incarnate may be accounted for by his not having had occasion, in his extant Epistles, to speak of it. He is occupied, in accordance with his peculiar mission, in setting forth the meaning and purpose of the Incarnation rather than its mode, and in preaching rather than catechetical instruction; and on the essential idea involved he is sufficiently explicit, viz. the peculiar Divine paternity of Christ, notwithstanding the human birth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/1-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">regarding</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(peri)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4012.htm">Strong's 4012: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the base of peran; properly, through, i.e. Around; figuratively with respect to; used in various applications, of place, cause or time.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">His</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
