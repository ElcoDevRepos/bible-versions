It was a mark of identity and belonging to the people of Israel. However, Paul addresses Gentiles who were not part of this covenant and did not bear this physical sign. The early church faced significant tension over whether Gentile converts needed to adopt Jewish customs, including circumcision, to be true followers of Christ. This phrase challenges the notion that physical rituals alone determine one's standing before God.<p><b>keeps the requirements of the law</b><br>The "requirements of the law" refer to the moral and ethical commands found in the Mosaic Law. Paul emphasizes that true obedience to God is not merely about external rituals but about living according to His commandments. This echoes the teachings of Jesus, who prioritized the spirit of the law over its letter (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17-20</a>). The focus is on the inward transformation and genuine righteousness that fulfills the law's intent, as seen in the lives of those who follow Christ.<p><b>will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?</b><br>Paul argues that genuine obedience to God's law, even without the physical sign of circumcision, is what truly matters. This radical idea suggests that God values the heart's condition over external markers. It aligns with the prophetic tradition, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>, which calls for a "circumcision of the heart." This concept is further developed in <a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>, where Paul states that true circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit. This teaching underscores the inclusivity of the Gospel, where faith in Christ transcends cultural and ritualistic boundaries, uniting all believers in spiritual kinship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is addressing the church in Rome, which consists of both Jewish and Gentile believers.

Paul&#8217;s answer in Romans anticipates that debate: outward ritual is not the decisive issue.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>keeps the requirements of the law</b><p>The phrase points to actually doing what God commands, not merely possessing the Scriptures.<p>&#8226; Paul has just said, &#8220;It is not the hearers of the Law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified&#8221; (<a href="/romans/2-13.htm">Romans 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Long before, God called for a &#8220;circumcision of the heart&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>), showing that heartfelt obedience matters more than external marks.<p>&#8226; James echoes the same priority: &#8220;Be doers of the word, and not hearers only&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?</b><p>Now Paul delivers the punchline: when genuine obedience springs from faith, God credits the uncircumcised as covenant participants.<p>&#8226; Abraham himself &#8220;received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised&#8221; (<a href="/romans/4-9.htm">Romans 4:9-12</a>), proving that right standing precedes the ritual.<p>&#8226; <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-12</a> speaks of a &#8220;circumcision made without hands,&#8221; fulfilled in Christ, while <a href="/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a> declares, &#8220;In Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith working through love.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Thus God remains utterly consistent: He honors the reality (faith-born obedience) over the symbol, and He will justly judge every person impartially (<a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/2-26.htm">Romans 2:26</a> teaches that God counts inward, faithful obedience as true covenant fidelity, even when the outward Jewish sign is absent. Rituals have value only when they reflect a heart transformed by God. This verse prepares the ground for Paul&#8217;s later conclusion that both Jew and Gentile are justified only through faith in Christ, the perfect fulfiller of the Law.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/2-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#8048;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ean)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1437.htm">Strong's 1437: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
