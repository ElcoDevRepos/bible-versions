The context is crucial, as Paul is explaining how Abraham was justified by faith before the law was given and before he was circumcised. This sets a precedent for understanding justification by faith apart from works or adherence to the law. The "why" points to the reason for Abraham's righteousness being credited to him, emphasizing faith as the key component.<p><b>&#8220;it was credited to him</b><br>The concept of something being "credited" or "counted" is an accounting term, implying that righteousness was not inherent in Abraham but was accounted to him by God. This reflects the doctrine of imputed righteousness, where believers are considered righteous because of their faith, not because of their own merit. This idea is foundational in Christian theology, highlighting the grace of God in salvation.<p><b>as righteousness.&#8221;</b><br>Righteousness here refers to being in right standing with God. In the Jewish context, righteousness was often associated with adherence to the law. However, Paul uses Abraham's example to show that righteousness comes through faith. This connects to <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>, where it is first stated that Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness. This sets a typological precedent for the New Testament believer, where faith in Jesus Christ results in righteousness being credited to them. This also ties into the broader biblical narrative of salvation history, where faith is consistently shown as the means by which individuals are justified before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The central figure in <a href="/bsb/romans/4.htm">Romans 4</a>, Abraham is presented as the exemplar of faith.

(<a href="/romans/4-21.htm">Romans 4:21</a>).<p>- The phrase points back to that unwavering faith: it was Abraham&#8217;s confident trust, not any personal merit, that triggered God&#8217;s action.<p>- Similar faith-based reasoning appears in <a href="/hebrews/11-11.htm">Hebrews 11:11</a>, where Sarah receives power &#8220;since she considered Him faithful who had promised,&#8221; and in <a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a>, where Scripture &#8220;foresees&#8221; God justifying Gentiles by faith.<p>- The verse therefore ties the crediting of righteousness directly to Abraham&#8217;s belief, underscoring that faith is the decisive cause.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It was credited</b><p>- &#8220;Credited&#8221; speaks of an accounting transfer: righteousness placed in Abraham&#8217;s ledger while his sin-debt is not counted against him (<a href="/psalms/32-2.htm">Psalm 32:2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>).<p>- <a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a> repeats <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a> almost verbatim, stressing that this crediting is scriptural precedent, not a Pauline innovation.<p>- The passive voice (&#8220;was credited&#8221;) highlights God as the One doing the counting; Abraham simply receives.<p>- No wages are earned (<a href="/romans/4-4.htm">Romans 4:4&#8211;5</a>); grace moves the divine Accountant to write righteousness into an otherwise empty column.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To him</b><p>- The pronoun centers on Abraham, a real historical figure (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>), making clear that justification by faith is not theoretical.<p>- Paul extends the principle &#8220;to him&#8221; toward every believer: &#8220;The words &#8216;it was credited to him&#8217; were written&#8230; for us who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead&#8221; (<a href="/romans/4-23.htm">Romans 4:23-24</a>).<p>- <a href="/galatians/3-6.htm">Galatians 3:6-9</a> affirms that those who share Abraham&#8217;s faith are sons of Abraham, inheriting the same credited righteousness.<p>- The personal application invites each reader to see God&#8217;s willingness to deal individually, not just generically, with sinners.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As righteousness</b><p>- Righteousness is more than forgiven sin; it is the positive standing God requires (<a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>).<p>- Abraham did not possess such righteousness inherently; it had to be placed &#8220;as&#8221; or &#8220;for&#8221; righteousness in God&#8217;s sight.<p>- <a href="/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a> echoes this truth: believers are &#8220;found in Him, not having my own righteousness&#8230; but that which is through faith in Christ.&#8221;<p>- Thus the verse teaches imputed righteousness: God legally declares believers righteous because faith unites them to His promise-keeping character and, ultimately, to Christ Himself (<a href="/romans/5-19.htm">Romans 5:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/romans/4-22.htm">Romans 4:22</a> wraps Paul&#8217;s argument in a single statement: because Abraham believed God&#8217;s promise without wavering, God responded by crediting righteousness to his account. The verse affirms that:<p>&#8226; Faith is the sole reason (&#8220;This is why&#8221;) for justification,<p>&#8226; God performs the gracious accounting (&#8220;it was credited&#8221;),<p>&#8226; The blessing is personal and transferable (&#8220;to him&#8221;),<p>&#8226; What is granted meets God&#8217;s perfect standard (&#8220;as righteousness&#8221;).<p>Consequently, every believer who rests in God&#8217;s promises&#8212;now centered in the risen Lord Jesus&#8212;receives the same righteous standing before God, apart from works.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore also it was reckoned to him for righteousness.
