The concept of being "united" suggests a deep, intrinsic connection, akin to grafting a branch onto a tree. In the context of Romans, Paul is addressing the transformative power of Christ's death for believers. Historically, crucifixion was a common Roman execution method, symbolizing ultimate sacrifice and suffering. This union implies that believers share in the death of Christ, symbolically dying to sin. This is further illustrated in <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, where Paul states, "I have been crucified with Christ." Theologically, this union signifies the believer's break from the power of sin, as Christ's death conquered sin's dominion.<p><b>we will certainly also be united with Him in His resurrection</b><br>The assurance of being "united with Him in His resurrection" speaks to the hope and promise of eternal life. The resurrection of Jesus is a cornerstone of Christian faith, affirming His victory over death and sin. This future union in resurrection is not just a spiritual reality but also a physical one, as believers anticipate a bodily resurrection. This is supported by <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>, which describes Christ as the "firstfruits" of those who have died, indicating that His resurrection is a precursor to that of believers. Culturally, the resurrection was a radical concept in the Greco-Roman world, where many believed in a shadowy afterlife. The promise of resurrection offers a profound hope, transforming the believer's perspective on life and death. This union in resurrection is a fulfillment of the prophecy and typology seen in the Old Testament, such as the story of Jonah, which Jesus Himself referenced as a sign of His resurrection (<a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to this verse, Jesus' death and resurrection are the foundation of Christian faith, symbolizing victory over sin and death.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The original recipients of the letter, the Roman Christians were a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers living in the heart of the Roman Empire.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/union_with_christ.htm">Union with Christ</a></b><br>The Greek word for "united" (symphytoi) implies a deep, organic connection, like branches grafted into a tree.

The idea would correspond to the growth of a bud or graft regarded as part of that of the stock in which it is inserted. but without reference to the operation of budding or grafting. It is used here to express the closest intimacy and union.<p><span class= "bld">In the likeness of his death.</span>--Not here "His death itself," but "the <span class= "ital">likeness</span> of His death," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> an ethical condition corresponding to, or <span class= "ital">conformable</span> to, the death of Christ. If our nature has grown "into conformity with" His death, it will be also conform able to His resurrection.<p>This conformity means, of course, dying <span class= "ital">to</span> trespasses and sins, being completely removed from the sphere of their influence, and entering a new sphere corresponding to the glorified life of the Redeemer. The ethical resurrection of the Christian begins (or is ideally supposed to begin, and with the early Christian usually did begin) in baptism, is continued through life, and is completed with his physical resurrection.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection</span>. So the Authorized Version. But the English word "planted" (though the idea expressed by it has the support of Origen, Chrysostom, and other ancient Fathers; also of the Vulgate, and, among moderns, Beza, Luther, and others; while some, including Erasmus, Calvin, Estius, Cornelius a Lapide, understand "engrafted") probably suggests what was not intended. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is from <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> (not <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>), and need only express being made to grow together in close association. In classic authors it commonly means <span class="accented">innate.</span> It seems here used, not to introduce a new figure, whether of planting or grafting, but only to express the close union with Christ, already intimated, into which we entered in baptism. The Revised Version has "have become united with him," which may perhaps sufficiently express what is meant, though hardly a satisfactory rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, Tyndale and Cranmer translate "graft in deeth lyke unto him;" and perhaps "graft into" may be as good a rendering as any other. Meyer, Tholuck, Alford, and others take the dative <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> as governed by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f65;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> (Tholuck). But it may be better to understand <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>: "Graft into Christ, in the likeness of his death," <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> being added because Christ's death and ours, in the senses intended, are not the same kind of death literally, ours only corresponding to, and in a certain sense like his. The main purpose of this verse, as of ver. 4, is to press <span class="accented">resurrection</span> with Christ as following <span class="accented">death</span> with him. But why here the <span class="accented">future</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>? Did we not rise with Christ to a new life when we emerged from our baptismal burial? Future verbs are used also with a similar reference in ver. 8 and ver. 14.
