In the context of Romans, "the law" refers to the Mosaic Law given to Israel. The law serves as a divine standard of righteousness and reveals God's character. It is important to understand that the law is not just a set of rules but a reflection of God's holiness and justice. The phrase "we know" suggests a shared understanding among the audience, likely Jewish and Gentile believers familiar with the Old Testament.<p><b>it says to those who are under the law</b><br>This indicates that the law specifically addresses those who are subject to it, primarily the Jewish people who received the law through Moses. However, the broader implication is that the law's principles apply universally, as it reveals God's standards for all humanity. Historically, the Jewish people were given the law as a covenant, setting them apart as God's chosen people. This phrase underscores the accountability of those who have received the law directly.<p><b>so that every mouth may be silenced</b><br>The purpose of the law is to bring about a recognition of sin and guilt, leaving no room for self-justification. In a legal sense, this imagery suggests a courtroom where the evidence is so overwhelming that the defendant has no defense. Biblically, this aligns with passages like <a href="/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4</a> and <a href="/psalms/107-42.htm">Psalm 107:42</a>, where silence before God signifies acknowledgment of His righteousness and human unworthiness.<p><b>and the whole world held accountable to God</b><br>This expands the scope of the law's impact from the Jewish people to all humanity. The law reveals universal sinfulness, making everyone accountable to God. This accountability is not limited by geography or ethnicity but is a fundamental aspect of the human condition. <a href="/romans/1.htm">Romans 1-2</a> lays the groundwork for this argument, showing that both Jews and Gentiles are under sin. Theologically, this points to the need for a Savior, as all have fallen short of God's glory (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law given to the Israelites, which includes moral, ceremonial, and civil laws found in the first five books of the Old Testament.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_whole_world.htm">The Whole World</a></b><br>This phrase emphasizes the universal scope of accountability before God, extending beyond the Jewish people to include all humanity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_the_law.htm">The Purpose of the Law</a></b><br>The law serves to reveal sin and demonstrate humanity's inability to achieve righteousness on its own.

In this concluding verse the apostle briefly intimates the reason of law's inefficacy for justification, anticipating, after a manner usual with him, what is afterwards to be more fully set forth, as especially in ch. 7. The reason is that law in itself only defines sin and makes it sinful, but does not emancipate from it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/3-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">we know</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#7988;&#948;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Oidamen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">whatever</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(hosa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3745.htm">Strong's 3745: </a> </span><span class="str2">How much, how great, how many, as great as, as much.
