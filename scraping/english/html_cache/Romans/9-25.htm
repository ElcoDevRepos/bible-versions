Hosea's ministry was primarily to the Northern Kingdom of Israel in the 8th century BC. His life and prophetic messages symbolized God's relationship with Israel, often using the metaphor of marriage to illustrate faithfulness and unfaithfulness. The citation of Hosea in Romans underscores the continuity of God's plan from the Old Testament to the New Testament, highlighting the fulfillment of prophecy and the inclusion of the Gentiles into God's covenant community.<p><b>&#8220;I will call them &#8216;My People&#8217; who are not My people,</b><br>This phrase signifies a dramatic shift in God's redemptive plan, where those who were once outside the covenant community (Gentiles) are now being included. In Hosea, this originally referred to Israel's restoration, but Paul applies it to the Gentiles, showing the expansion of God's grace beyond ethnic Israel. This reflects the theme of God's sovereignty and mercy, as He chooses to extend His covenant love to those previously not considered His people. It also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's desire to bless all nations, as seen in the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>and I will call her &#8216;My Beloved&#8217; who is not My beloved,&#8221;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the transformation of status from rejection to acceptance. In Hosea, it symbolized Israel's restoration after a period of judgment. In Romans, Paul uses it to illustrate the inclusion of the Gentiles, who were once alienated from God's promises (<a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>). The term "My Beloved" reflects a deep, covenantal love, akin to the love Christ has for the Church (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>). This transformation is a testament to God's grace and the fulfillment of His promises, demonstrating that His love and election are not limited by ethnic or cultural boundaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is addressing the church in Rome, explaining God's sovereignty and the inclusion of the Gentiles in His plan of salvation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>An Old Testament prophet whose writings Paul references to illustrate God's plan to extend His mercy beyond Israel to the Gentiles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God in the Old Testament, often seen as the primary recipients of God's promises.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who, according to Paul, are now included in God's covenant through faith in Jesus Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rome.htm">Rome</a></b><br>The city where the recipients of Paul's letter reside, a diverse community of Jewish and Gentile believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_salvation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Salvation</a></b><br>God's plan of salvation is not limited by human boundaries or expectations.

By introducing the quotation with &#8220;He says,&#8221; Paul presents God Himself as the speaker, underscoring divine authority (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). His point is clear: God&#8217;s plan for mercy did not arise in the New Testament era; it was foretold long before (<a href="/acts/10-43.htm">Acts 10:43</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I will call them &#8216;My People&#8217; who are not My people&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; In Hosea, Israel&#8217;s rebellion led God to declare, &#8220;You are not My people&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/1-9.htm">Hosea 1:9</a>). Yet He immediately promised restoration: &#8220;In the place where it was said to them, &#8216;You are not My people,&#8217; they will be called &#8216;sons of the living God&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul applies that pattern to Gentiles, showing that those once outside the covenant are now welcomed through faith in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-13</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7-9</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores God&#8217;s sovereign freedom. He decides who belongs to Him, not human lineage or effort (<a href="/romans/9-16.htm">Romans 9:16</a>).<p>&#8226; It also affirms permanence: when God calls someone &#8220;My People,&#8221; the bond is covenantal and unwavering (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and I will call her &#8216;My Beloved&#8217; who is not My beloved,&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Hosea&#8217;s marriage to Gomer illustrated Israel&#8217;s unfaithfulness, yet God vowed to woo His wayward bride back: &#8220;I will allure her&#8230; and speak comfort to her&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/2-14.htm">Hosea 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul seizes on that promise to show the depth of divine affection: God not only restores status (&#8220;people&#8221;) but also affection (&#8220;beloved&#8221;). Compare <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a> where love, not merit, is the basis of election.<p>&#8226; For Gentile believers, this declaration means full inclusion in the intimacy of God&#8217;s love (<a href="/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>).<p>&#8226; For Israel, it previews future national restoration when &#8220;all Israel will be saved&#8221; (<a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26-27</a>), proving God&#8217;s love endures even after discipline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/9-25.htm">Romans 9:25</a> reveals God&#8217;s long-promised, sovereign decision to extend covenant identity and covenant love to those once outside&#8212;both straying Israel and believing Gentiles. The verse demonstrates that Scripture consistently portrays a God who restores, adopts, and cherishes people purely by His gracious call, fulfilling promises made centuries earlier through Hosea.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">As he saith also in Osee.</span>--The original of the prophecy in Hosea relates to the pardon and reconciliation promised to the apostate and idolatrous people of the northern kingdom.

So far nothing has been adduced to support the idea of <span class="accented">Gentiles</span>, to whom no original promises had been made, superseding the Jewish nation in the inheritance, though it had been shown generally that God may have mercy on whom he will; and in the earlier part of the argument (vers. 6-13) all that appeared plainly from the Old Testament was <span class="accented">selection</span> out of the total seed of Abraham - not the calling of a new one apart from his stock. Hence this section is necessary for completing the whole argument. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As he saith also in Osee, I will call my people that which was not my people, and beloved her who was not beloved. And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God</span>. The quotation in ver. 26 is from <a href="/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>, and is correctly cited; that in ver. 25 is from <a href="/hosea/2-23.htm">Hosea 2:23</a>, and varies from both the Hebrew and the LXX., but not so as to affect the meaning. Both refer to the same subject. The prophet had been directed to "take unto him a wife of wheredoms." He had so taken "Gomer the daughter of Diblaim," who had borne him a daughter, to whom was given the symbolical name Lo-ruhamah ("Not beloved;" or, as it is interpreted in <a href="/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>, "Hath not obtained mercy." "<span class="accented">Love</span> and <span class="accented">mercy</span> are both contained in the full meaning of the intensive form of the Hebrew word," Pusey on 'Hosea '); and afterwards a son, who received the name Lo-ammi ("Not my people"). Both are symbols of the ten tribes of Israel as distinct from Judah; the two names denoting (as Pusey explains) successive stages of God's repudiation of the people, and the last implying entire rejection. But in <a href="/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>, after the naming of Lo-ammi, it is said, "Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are Lo-ammi, it shall be said unto them, Ye are the children of the living God." The subject is pursued through <a href="/hosea/2.htm">Hosea 2</a>, at the end of which (ver. 23) comes the other passage quoted: "And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy on Lo-ruhamah; and I will say to Lo-ammi, Ammi ['My people'], and they shall say, My God." It might seem that these quotations are not apposite, since they referred originally, not to the Gentiles, but to the ten tribes of Israel. It is to be observed, however, that the words were spoken after these tribes had been declared to be cut off from being God's people at all, so that a principle of Divine dealing is ex- pressed which is applicable to the Gentile world. "This, which was true of Israel in its dispersion, was much more true of the Gentiles. These, too, the descendants of righteous Noah, God had cast off for the time, that they should be no more his people, when he chose Israel out of them, to make known to them his Being, and his will, and his laws, and (although in shadow and mystery) Christ who was to come. He had threatened to Israel that he should be <span class="accented">unpitied</span>, and no more his people; in reversing his sentence, he embraces in the arms of his mercy all who were not his people, and says to them all, that they should be <span class="accented">my people</span> and <span class="accented">beloved"</span> (Pusey on 'Hosea,' 2:23). In <a href="/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a> the same text from Hosea is quoted as applying to those who were addressed in the Epistle, and then with more obvious applicability; for it appears to have been written, mainly at least, to Israelites of the <span class="accented">dispersion</span> (see <a href="/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>). Still, Gentile converts may be concluded to have been included (cf. <a href="/romans/1-14.htm">Romans 1:14</a>; <a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>). It is to be observed that in ver. 25 the feminine <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> has reference to the <span class="accented">daughter</span> of the prophet, Lo-ruhamah; and that in ver. 26 "in the place where" must be understood, both in the original prophecy and the application, as meaning any region where those who were to be called <span class="accented">my people</span> might be. "And so St. Peter says that this Scripture, was fulfilled in them, while still <span class="accented">scattered abroad through Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.</span> The place, then, where they should be called <span class="accented">the sons of the living God</span> is wheresoever they should believe in Christ" (Pusey). <p><span class="accented">"'Tis Zion, wheresoe'er they dwell,<br />Who, with his own true Israel,<br />Shall own him strong to save."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Christian Year: Fifth Sunday in Lent.'</span>) The texts from Isaiah which follow are intended to show that, according to prophetic utterance, while those who were not God's people, in large numbers, would be called his people, a <span class="accented">remnant</span> only of the Jews would be so. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/9-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8033;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5613.htm">Strong's 5613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably adverb of comparative from hos; which how, i.e. In that manner.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He says</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(legei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
