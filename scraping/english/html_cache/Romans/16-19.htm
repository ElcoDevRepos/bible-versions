This echoes Paul's earlier commendations of the Roman believers' faith (<a href="/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>). In the ancient world, news traveled through letters and word of mouth, and the Roman church's obedience would have been a significant encouragement to other believers. This obedience is not merely adherence to rules but a heartfelt submission to the teachings of Christ, reflecting the transformative power of the gospel.<p><b>so I rejoice over you</b><br>Paul expresses personal joy and satisfaction in the faithfulness of the Roman believers. This joy is consistent with his pastoral heart, as seen in other letters where he rejoices over the faith and growth of other churches (<a href="/philippians/1-4.htm">Philippians 1:4</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:9</a>). His rejoicing is not just personal but also reflects the joy in heaven over believers who live out their faith (<a href="/luke/15-7.htm">Luke 15:7</a>).<p><b>But I want you to be wise about what is good</b><br>Paul urges the Roman Christians to cultivate wisdom, particularly in discerning and practicing what is good. This wisdom is rooted in a deep understanding of God's will and is a recurring theme in Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>, <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>). The call to be wise about what is good aligns with the biblical principle of seeking righteousness and living according to God's standards (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><b>and innocent about what is evil</b><br>The exhortation to be innocent about evil suggests a purity and simplicity in avoiding sin. This innocence is not ignorance but a conscious decision to reject evil and remain untainted by it. It reflects Jesus' teaching to be "wise as serpents and innocent as doves" (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>). The call to innocence is a reminder of the believer's call to holiness and separation from the corrupting influences of the world (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Romans, Paul is writing to the believers in Rome, encouraging them in their faith and providing guidance on Christian living.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the Roman Christians were known for their faith and obedience, which had become well-known among other churches.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/obedience.htm">Obedience</a></b><br>A key theme in this verse, referring to the Roman Christians' adherence to the teachings of the Gospel and their commitment to living out their faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_and_innocence.htm">Wisdom and Innocence</a></b><br>Paul emphasizes the importance of being wise in what is good and innocent in what is evil, highlighting a dual focus on discernment and purity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rejoicing.htm">Rejoicing</a></b><br>Paul expresses his joy over the Roman Christians' reputation for obedience, indicating the importance of a good testimony among believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Obedience to God's Word is a testimony to others and brings joy to fellow believers.

The spread of that obedience&#8212;&#8220;has reached everyone&#8221; (<a href="/romans/16-19.htm">Romans 16:19</a>)&#8212;mirrors earlier praise: &#8220;Your faith is being proclaimed all over the world&#8221; (<a href="/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>). Similar echoes appear in <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:8</a>, where the Thessalonians&#8217; testimony rings out everywhere. Obedience is never private; it becomes a lighthouse pointing others to Christ (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So I rejoice over you</b><p>Paul&#8217;s pastoral heart bursts with gladness because he sees the fruit of the gospel flourishing. Other letters show the same emotion: &#8220;What thanks can we render to God for you&#8230;for all the joy we have on your account?&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/3-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:9</a>). John writes, &#8220;I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth&#8221; (2 <a href="/bsb/john/4.htm">John 4</a>). Joy springs up whenever believers live what they believe. Spiritual leaders rejoice not in numbers or reputation but in obedient, transformed lives (<a href="/philippians/4-1.htm">Philippians 4:1</a>; 3 <a href="/bsb/john/4.htm">John 4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But I want you to be wise about what is good</b><p>Affirmation is followed by exhortation.

Paul urges the Corinthians, &#8220;Be infants in evil&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>). Practical steps:<p>&#8226; Flee youthful passions (<a href="/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Keep short accounts with God via confession (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Guard the gateways of heart and mind (<a href="/psalms/101-3.htm">Psalm 101:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Refuse even the appearance of evil (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-22.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:22</a>).<p>Staying &#8220;innocent&#8221; protects personal holiness and preserves the church&#8217;s witness (<a href="/romans/12-9.htm">Romans 12:9</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/16-19.htm">Romans 16:19</a> weds praise to caution.
