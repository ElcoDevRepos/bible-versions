In the early church, baptism was a public declaration of faith and a rite of initiation into the Christian community. The imagery of burial signifies the believer's identification with Christ's death, implying a complete break from the past life of sin. This concept is rooted in Jewish purification rituals and the practice of full immersion, which symbolizes cleansing and renewal. Theologically, it reflects the believer's participation in the death of Christ, as seen in <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>, which also speaks of being buried with Christ in baptism.<p><b>in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead</b><br>The resurrection of Christ is central to Christian faith, serving as the foundation for the believer's hope in eternal life. This phrase highlights the power of God in raising Jesus from the dead, which is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>. The resurrection is not only a historical event but also a transformative power that believers share in. It signifies victory over sin and death, as elaborated in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>, where Christ is described as the "firstfruits" of those who have fallen asleep.<p><b>through the glory of the Father</b><br>The "glory of the Father" refers to the divine power and majesty of God, which was manifested in the resurrection of Jesus. This phrase underscores the Trinitarian involvement in the resurrection, with the Father actively participating in raising the Son. The glory of God is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with His presence and power, as seen in <a href="/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16-17</a> and <a href="/john/11-40.htm">John 11:40</a>. It is this same glory that believers are called to reflect in their lives, as they are transformed into the image of Christ.<p><b>we too may walk in newness of life</b><br>The concept of "newness of life" speaks to the transformative effect of salvation. Just as Christ was raised to a new life, believers are called to live a life that reflects their new identity in Him. This new life is characterized by righteousness and holiness, as described in <a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22-24</a>. The "walk" implies a continuous, active lifestyle of faith and obedience, contrasting with the old way of living in sin. This transformation is made possible by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, who empowers believers to live according to God's will, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-25</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, addressing the believers in Rome, explaining the theological implications of baptism and the believer's union with Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in this passage, whose death and resurrection are the foundation for the believer's new life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The original recipients of this letter, a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers in Rome.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/baptism.htm">Baptism</a></b><br>A significant Christian sacrament symbolizing the believer's identification with the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/resurrection.htm">Resurrection</a></b><br>The event of Christ rising from the dead, which is the model and power for the believer's new life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_baptism.htm">Understanding Baptism</a></b><br>Baptism is not just a ritual but a profound spiritual reality that signifies our union with Christ in His death and resurrection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/n/newness_of_life.htm">Newness of Life</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to live a transformed life, reflecting the resurrection power of Christ in our daily walk.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_glory_of_the_father.htm">The Glory of the Father</a></b><br>Recognize that it is through the Father's glory and power that Christ was raised, and it is the same power that enables us to live a new life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/death_to_sin.htm">Death to Sin</a></b><br>Embrace the truth that being buried with Christ means we are dead to sin, and it no longer has dominion over us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_by_the_spirit.htm">Living by the Spirit</a></b><br>Walking in newness of life involves living by the Spirit, allowing Him to guide and empower us in our Christian journey.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_6_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 6:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_6_4_New_life_in_Christ.htm">How does Romans 6:4 encourage us to live a new life in Christ?

It is the seal set upon it, as it were, which shows that no revival is possible. Besides, it is the one step which separates it from resurrection. The idea of "buried with Christ" is therefore introduced, on the one hand, to show that the ethical death with Him was final and decisive, and on the other, to prepare the way for an ethical (as well <span class= "ital">as</span> physical) resurrection with Him.<p><span class= "bld">Into death.</span>--The ideas of physical and moral death and resurrection and life are inextricably blended in the thought of the Apostle.<p><span class= "bld">By the glory of the Father.</span>--The resurrection of Christ is more usually and more naturally ascribed to the power or Omnipotence of God. The word "Glory" is here to be taken as standing for the sum of the divine perfections, power being included among them, "the Majesty on High."<p><span class= "bld">Even so.</span>--It is to be observed that the mysticism is here resolved into a relation of resemblance. The resurrection of Christ, and the new life of the Christian, are <span class= "ital">compared</span> instead of being identified. The Apostle does not say "being dead with Christ, let us rise with Him;" but, "<span class= "ital">as</span> Christ rose again, <span class= "ital">so</span> we also should walk in newness of life." The mystical expression for this is given in the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore we were buried</span> (not <span class="accented">are</span>, as in the Authorized Version<span class="cmt_word">) with him by baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life</span>. The mention here of burial as well as death does not appear to be meant as a further carrying out of the idea of a fulfilment in us of the whole of Christ's experience, in the sense - As he died and was buried, so we die and are even buried too. Such a conception of burial being in our case a further process subsequent to our death in baptism, is indeed well expressed in our Collect for Easter Eve: but the form of expression, "buried into death," does not suit it here. The reference rather is to the form of baptism, viz. by immersion, which was understood to signify burial, and therefore death. So Chrysostom, on <a href="/john/3.htm">John 3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>. The main intention of the verse is to bring out the idea of resurrection following death in our case as in Christ's. The sense, therefore, is - As our burial (or total immersion) in the baptismal water was followed by entire emergence, so our death with Christ to sin, which that immersion symbolized, is to be followed by our resurrection with him to a new life. As to the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, through which Christ is here said to have been raised, see what was said under Romans 3:23. "<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> est <span class="accented">gloria</span> divinae vitae, incorruptiblitatis, potentiae, et virtutis, per quam et Christus resuscitatus est, et nos vitae novas restituimur, Deoque conformamur. <a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19</a>, <span class="accented">seqq."</span> (Bengel). In some passages our Lord is regarded as having been raised from the dead in virtue of the Divine life that was in himself, whereby it was impossible that he should be holden of death. (see under Romans 1:4). And he said of his own <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, "I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again" (<a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>). But . here as most commonly elsewhere, his resurrection is attributed to the operation of the glory of the Father - the same Divine power that regenerates us in him (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/6-14.htm">1 Corinthians 6:14</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-4.htm">2 Corinthians 13:4</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19</a>, etc.; <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>; also our Lord's own prayers to the Father previously to his suffering, as given by St. John). The two views are not inconsistent, and may serve to show Christ's oneness with the Father as touching his Godhead. The marked association here and elsewhere of union with Christ, so as to die and rise again with him, with the rite of baptism, supports the orthodox view of that sacrament being not only a <span class="accented">signum significans</span>, but a <span class="accented">signum efficax</span>; <span class="accented">as</span> not only representing, but being "a means whereby we receive" regeneration. The beginning of the new life of believers, with the power as well as the obligation to lead such a life, is ever regarded as dating from their baptism (cf. <a href="/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>). It is true, however, that in all such passages in the New Testament the baptism of adults is referred to; that is, of persons who at the time of baptism were capable of actual repentance and faith, and hence of actual <span class="accented">moral</span> regeneration, and they are supposed to have understood the significance of the rite, and to have been sincere in seeking it. Hence what is said or implied cannot fairly be pressed as applicable in all respects to infant baptism. This, however, is not the place for discussing the propriety of infant baptism, or the sense in which all baptized persons are regarded by the Church as in their very baptism regenerate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/6-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">We therefore were buried</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#940;&#966;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(synetaph&#275;men)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4916.htm">Strong's 4916: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bury along with.
