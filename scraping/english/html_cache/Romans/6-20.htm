In biblical context, slavery to sin refers to the inherent sinful nature of humans due to the Fall (Genesis 3). This slavery is spiritual bondage, where individuals are unable to break free from sin's power on their own. The concept of being a "slave to sin" is echoed in <a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34</a>, where Jesus states, "Everyone who sins is a slave to sin." Historically, slavery was a common institution in the Roman Empire, and Paul's audience would have understood the implications of being a slave&#8212;complete lack of freedom and autonomy. This metaphor emphasizes the total control sin has over an individual's life before redemption.<p><b>you were free of obligation to righteousness</b><br>This part of the verse contrasts the previous state of being enslaved to sin with the absence of righteousness. In this context, "free of obligation" suggests a lack of commitment or responsibility towards living a righteous life. Before coming to faith, individuals are not bound by the standards of righteousness that God requires. This freedom is not a positive liberty but rather an indication of spiritual neglect and moral indifference. Theologically, this reflects the idea that without the transformative power of the Holy Spirit, as described in <a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-25</a>, one cannot pursue true righteousness. The absence of obligation to righteousness underscores the need for divine intervention to enable a life that aligns with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the early Christian community in Rome, composed of both Jewish and Gentile believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/slavery_to_sin.htm">Slavery to Sin</a></b><br>A metaphor used by Paul to describe the state of being under the control of sin before accepting Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/righteousness.htm">Righteousness</a></b><br>The state of moral purity and alignment with God's will, which believers are called to pursue.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/freedom_in_christ.htm">Freedom in Christ</a></b><br>The new state of believers who are no longer bound by sin but are free to pursue righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_slavery_to_sin.htm">Understanding Slavery to Sin</a></b><br>Recognize that before accepting Christ, we were under the dominion of sin, unable to pursue true righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/freedom_from_sin's_control.htm">Freedom from Sin's Control</a></b><br>Embrace the freedom that comes through Christ, which allows us to live a life aligned with God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/pursuing_righteousness.htm">Pursuing Righteousness</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to actively pursue righteousness, understanding that it is now our obligation and privilege.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_through_christ.htm">Transformation through Christ</a></b><br>Reflect on the transformation that occurs when we move from being slaves to sin to being free in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_out_our_new_identity.htm">Living Out Our New Identity</a></b><br>Encourage believers to live out their new identity in Christ, making choices that reflect their freedom and commitment to righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_6_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 6:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_6_20_on_pre-Christ_righteousness.htm">How does Romans 6:20 describe our past relationship with righteousness before Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_slaves_to_sin_in_Romans_6_20.htm">What does being "slaves to sin" mean in Romans 6:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Romans_6_20_vs_John_8_34-36_on_freedom.htm">How does Romans 6:20 connect with Jesus' teachings on freedom in John 8:34-36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_be_righteous_today.htm">In what ways can we ensure we are "slaves to righteousness" today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Romans_6_20_s_role_in_resisting_sin.htm">How can understanding Romans 6:20 help us resist sin in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Romans_6_20_Freedom_vs_slavery_in_sin.htm">What does Romans 6:20 imply about the nature of freedom and slavery in sin?

He reminds us of the old chapter in our story, a chapter still unfolding for everyone outside Jesus. Scripture often steps into the past like this to highlight grace: &#8220;And you were dead in your trespasses and sins&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>). <a href="/titus/3-3.htm">Titus 3:3</a> echoes, &#8220;For at one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived.&#8221; By opening with &#8220;for when,&#8221; <a href="/romans/6-20.htm">Romans 6:20</a> anchors the teaching in a concrete, historical reality&#8212;our pre-conversion life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you were slaves to sin</b><p>Slavery here is not a figure of speech; it is a literal spiritual condition.<p>&#8226; Jesus said, &#8220;Truly, truly, I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/3-9.htm">Romans 3:9</a> explains, &#8220;Both Jews and Greeks alike are all under sin.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/7-14.htm">Romans 7:14</a> adds, &#8220;I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin,&#8221; showing even Paul felt the iron grip apart from the Spirit&#8217;s power.<p>Sin was the master, dictating desires, choices, and destiny. We did not negotiate with it; we served it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you were free</b><p>This &#8220;freedom&#8221; is tragically ironic. Outside Christ we felt unrestrained&#8212;no covenant ties, no holy boundaries. Yet <a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a> warns, &#8220;There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.&#8221; Peter describes the same illusion: &#8220;They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/2-19.htm">2 Peter 2:19</a>). In other words, independence from God is dependence on sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of obligation to righteousness</b><p>Before conversion, righteousness made no demands on us&#8212;not because we were sovereign, but because we were incapable. <a href="/romans/8-7.htm">Romans 8:7&#8211;8</a> says the mind set on the flesh &#8220;does not submit to God&#8217;s law, nor can it do so.&#8221; First Corinthians 2:14 adds that the natural man &#8220;cannot understand&#8221; spiritual things. We had no appetite for holiness, no power to perform it, and no sense of duty toward it. Only the new birth changes that (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>; <a href="/romans/6-22.htm">Romans 6:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/6-20.htm">Romans 6:20</a> looks back to expose the lie of sin&#8217;s freedom. Our former life was marked by real slavery to sin and real indifference to righteousness. Christ&#8217;s saving work flips that condition: we become free from sin&#8217;s mastery and joyfully bound to God&#8217;s righteousness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness</span> (more literally, <span class="accented">to righteousness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ye were not in any bondage to righteousness). <span class="cmt_word">What fruit had ye then</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> when you were formerly slaves of sin) <span class="cmt_word">in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?, for the end of those things is death. But now being made free from sin, and made servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification; and the end life eternal. For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of god is life eternal in Christ Jesus our Lord</span>. The logical connection with the previous context of the above series of verses, beginning with ver. 20, as well as the sequence of thought running through them (intimated by the particles <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>), is not at once obvious. It seems to be as follows: the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> in ver. 20 introduces a reason for the exhortation of ver. 19, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, etc. But ver. 20 is not in itself the reason, being only an introduction to the statement of it in the verses that follow. The drift of the whole passage seems to be this: Yield ye your members to the sole service of righteousness; <span class="accented">for</span> (ver. 20) ye were once in the sole service of sin, owning no allegiance to righteousness at all; <span class="accented">and</span> (ver. 21) what fruit had ye from that service? None at all; for ye know that the only end of the things ye did then, and of which ye are now ashamed, is death. <span class="accented">But</span> (ver. 22) your new service <span class="accented">has</span> its fruit: it leads to your sanctification now, and in the end eternal life. Authorities, however, both ancient and modern, are divided as to the punctuation, and consequent construction, of ver. 21. In the Vulgate and the Authorized Version (as in the interpretation given above) the stop of interrogation is placed after "ashamed;" the answer, <span class="accented">none</span>, being understood, and "for the end," etc., being the reason why there is no fruit The other way is to take the question as ending at "had ye then," and "those things whereof," etc., as the answer to it, and for the end, etc., as the reason why they are ashamed. Thus: "What fruit had ye then (when you were free from righteousness)? The works (or pleasures) of which you are now ashamed were the only fruit; you are ashamed of them now; <span class="accented">for their</span> end is death." The latter interpretation is defended by Alford on the ground that it is more consistent "with the New Testament meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which is 'actions,' the ' fruit of the man' considered as the tree, not 'wages' or 'reward,' the 'fruit of his actions.'" This is true. But, on the other hand, it may be argued that such use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> by St. Paul is always in a good sense; he usually regards <span class="accented">sin</span> as having no fruits at all; to the <span class="accented">fruit</span> of the Spirit is opposed, not any fruit of a different character, but <span class="accented">the works</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>) of the flesh (<a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19, 22</a>); and in <a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a> (again in opposition to the <span class="accented">fruit of the Spirit</span>) he speaks of the <span class="accented">unfruitful</span> works (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">of</span> darkness. Thus the idea of ver. 21, understood as in the Authorized Version, seems closely to correspond with that of the passage last cited. "The things of which ye are now ashamed," in ver. 21, are "the works of darkness" of <a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a>; and in both places they are declared to have no fruit. Sin is a barren tree, and only ends in death. Cf. what was said above with respect to <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 19. It is true, however, that the expression in the next chapter, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span> (<a href="/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5</a>), in opposition to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>, in some degree weakens the force of the above argument. We observe, lastly, on ver. 23, that to the "wages" of sin (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> , used usually to denote a soldier's pay) is opposed "free gift" (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> for sin earns death as its due reward; but eternal life is not earned by us, but granted us by the grace of God. As to the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>, in ver. 22, it can be used without the need of any such apology as seems to be implied in ver. 19 (according to the meaning of the verse that has been preferred) for speaking of our becoming <span class="accented">slaves</span> to righteousness. For we do belong to God as his <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, and to Christ, having been "bought with a price" (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/7-23.htm">1 Corinthians 7:23</a>); and St. Paul at the beginning of his Epistles often calls himself <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (cf. also <a href="/luke/17-10.htm">Luke 17:10</a>). But it does not follow that our service should be the service of slaves; it may be a free, willing, enthusiastic obedience notwithstanding; we obey, not because we are under bondage to obey, but because love inspires us (cf. <a href="/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>, etc., "Because ye are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore thou art no longer a servant, but a son"). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/6-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
