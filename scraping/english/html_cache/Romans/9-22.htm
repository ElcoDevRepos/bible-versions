The concept of God's wrath is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with His justice and holiness (e.g., <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>). The idea of making His power known can be linked to the Exodus narrative, where God's power was demonstrated through the plagues in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>). This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using events to reveal His character and authority.<p><b>bore with great patience</b><br>God's patience is a significant aspect of His character, as seen in <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, where it is stated that God is patient, not wanting anyone to perish. This patience is also evident in the Old Testament, where God repeatedly showed forbearance towards Israel despite their rebellion (<a href="/nehemiah/9-30.htm">Nehemiah 9:30</a>). The patience of God serves as an opportunity for repentance and is a testament to His mercy and grace.<p><b>the vessels of His wrath</b><br>The term "vessels" is metaphorical, often used in Scripture to describe people or nations as instruments in God's hands (<a href="/jeremiah/18.htm">Jeremiah 18:1-6</a>). In this context, "vessels of wrath" refers to those who are objects of God's judgment due to their persistent sin and rebellion. This concept is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/16-4.htm">Proverbs 16:4</a>, where it is stated that the Lord has made everything for its purpose, even the wicked for the day of trouble.<p><b>prepared for destruction</b><br>This phrase suggests a divine purpose and plan, aligning with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over all creation. The idea of being "prepared for destruction" can be seen in the context of divine judgment, as in the case of Pharaoh, whose heart was hardened to display God's power (<a href="/exodus/9-12.htm">Exodus 9:12</a>). It also reflects the eschatological reality of final judgment, as described in <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>, where those who reject God face eternal separation from Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who exercises His will and purpose in the world.

This patience serves both to highlight His mercy toward the redeemed (<a href="/romans/9-23.htm">Romans 9:23</a>) and to demonstrate that His judgments are never rash. The verse calls us to humble awe: God&#8217;s glory shines in justice as well as in mercy, and every soul is summoned to repentance while His patience still endures.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22-29) These verses supply the concluding section of the vindication. All this scheme of God's dealings, apparently so severe, is really most merciful. To those who really deserved His wrath, He showed longsuffering. While for us who now believe, Gentiles as well as Jews, He had mercy and glory in store. But in both cases the final result was strictly in accordance with prophecy. Hosea had foretold the admission of the Gentiles. Isaiah the exclusion of the greater part of the Jews.<p>(22) <span class= "bld">What if</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--The sentence in the original is incomplete. In its full form it would run, "If God willing to show His wrath" . . . (what can man reply?) This latter clause is dropped or lost in the course of the argument. The best and simplest expedient to supply its place is that adopted in the Authorised version, inserting "what" in italics at the beginning: "What if," &c. There is a second suppression later in the sentence. At the end of <a href="/romans/9-23.htm" title="And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had before prepared to glory,">Romans 9:23</a> we should have to insert some such clause as "He reserved His glory for them," in order to make the sentence strictly grammatical. These irregularities are due to the Apostle's habit of dictating, and to the lively flow of his thoughts.<p><span class= "bld">Willing.</span>--While His will was (ultimately) to execute His wrath and display His sovereign judicial power, nevertheless He bore with evildoers, and gave them time for repentance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What if</span> (literally, <span class="accented">but if</span>, involving an anacoluthon<span class="cmt_word">) God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering vessels</span> (not, as in the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">the vessels</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of wrath fitted to destruction: and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy which he afore prepared unto glory; whom he also called, even us, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles</span>. "And" at the beginning of ver. 23 is omitted in the uncial B, and there is considerable authority of versions and Fathers for rejecting it. Without it the sentence runs better, and its drift becomes more apparent. The purpose expressed in ver. 23 thus comes out distinctly as the grand ultimate Divine purpose, to which the display of wrath and power spoken of in the previous verse is but subsidiary; and this drift becomes the more apparent, if we supply in English, as we may do, "while" before "willing" in ver. 22. Thus the drift would be, "What If God, while willing to exhibit his wrath and manifest his power, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath that had become fitted for destruction, in order that he might manifest the riches of his glory," etc. The idea expressed by "endured," etc., seems suggested by Pharaoh's case (see on ver. 17 with regard to the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> in the LXX., which the apostle appears here to retain the idea of, though he varied from it); but it is the Jewish nation of his own day that he has now in view. They were rejected from inheritance of the promises, and under Divine wrath; as he says in another place, "The wrath had come upon them to the uttermost" (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>). But they were still borne with; they were not finally cut off; and what if their present rejection were but subservient to the great purpose of mercy to the true Israel? The thought, hinted here, is carried out in ch. 11, where even the idea is further entertained of Israel itself as a nation, after judgment endured, coming into God's true fold at last, according to the design of God, through ways inscrutable by us, to "have mercy upon all." The forms of expression used in the passage before us are to be noted in support of the view we have taken of St. Paul's general meaning. "The vessels of wrath" are said to be "fitted to destruction" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); of the "vessels of mercy" it is said that God "afore prepared" them unto glory. Predestination to salvation is certainly a doctrine of St. Paul, but he nowhere intimates predestination to reprobation. Further, "Non dicit quae <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, sod <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>: praescinditur a causa efficiente: tantum dicitur quales inveniat Deus quibus tram infert" (Bengel). Lastly, it may be observed that, though <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> carries with it the idea of individual salvation, yet this only comes in as the outcome and ultimate purpose of the calling of nations or races of men. The drift of the preceding argument remains still what it has been stated to be. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/9-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">What if</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(Ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
