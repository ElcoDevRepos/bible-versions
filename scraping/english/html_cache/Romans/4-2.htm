In the Jewish tradition, Abraham is often seen as a model of faith and obedience. <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a> states, "Abram believed the LORD, and He credited it to him as righteousness." This verse is foundational in understanding that Abraham's righteousness was based on faith, not works. The Apostle Paul uses Abraham as an example to argue against the notion that human efforts can achieve justification. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that emphasizes faith over works, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>.<p><b>he had something to boast about,</b><br>Boasting in the biblical context often refers to taking pride in one's own achievements or status. In the Greco-Roman world, boasting was a common practice, especially among those who achieved honor or status through their deeds. However, the biblical narrative consistently points out that true righteousness and justification come from God, not human effort. <a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23-24</a> warns against boasting in wisdom, might, or riches, but rather in understanding and knowing God. Paul emphasizes that if justification were by works, it would allow for human boasting, which contradicts the humility required before God.<p><b>but not before God.</b><br>This phrase underscores the idea that human standards of righteousness and boasting do not apply in the divine realm. God's standards are perfect and holy, and human efforts fall short of His glory, as stated in <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>. The cultural context of the time placed significant emphasis on honor and status, but Paul redirects the focus to God's perspective, where human boasting is irrelevant. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized humility and reliance on God's grace, as seen in the Beatitudes (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-12</a>). The ultimate example of this is Jesus Christ, who, though He had every reason to boast, humbled Himself and became obedient to death on a cross (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>A key patriarch in the Bible, Abraham is often referred to as the "father of faith."

His writings often address the relationship between faith, works, and grace.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/justification.htm">Justification</a></b><br>A theological term referring to being declared righteous before God.

True justification rests solely on believing God&#8217;s promise, leaving all glory where it belongs: with Him alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) We know that he obtained justification. If that justification had been earned by his own works it would then have been something to be proud of; it would be a pride that he might fairly hold both towards men and towards God; for to men he could point to the privileged position that he had gained, and in the sight of God he would be able to plead a certain merit of his own. But he has <span class= "ital">not</span> this merit. His justification was <span class= "ital">not</span> earned, but it was bestowed upon him, not for the sake of his works, but of his faith. This is the express statement of Scripture. And hence it follows that though his privileged position in the sight of men remains, he has nothing to boast of before God.<p><span class= "bld">But not before God.</span>--This is an instance of the rapid and eager dialectic of the Apostle. If the whole train of thought had been given it would probably have run much as above, but the greater part of it is suppressed, and the Apostle strikes straight at the one point which he intended to bring into relief. (Whatever there might be before men) there is no boasting before God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if Abraham was justified by works, be hath whereof to glory; but not before God.</span> Many commentators take this verse to imply that, even if he <span class="accented">was</span> justified by works, he still had no ground of glorying <span class="accented">before God</span>, though he might have <span class="accented">before men.</span> But the drift of the whole argument being to show that he was not justified by works at all, this interpretation can hardly stand. "Not before God" must therefore have reference to the whole of the preceding sentence, in the sense, "It was not so in the sight of God." Before God (as appears from the text to be quoted) he had not whereof to glory on the ground of being justified by works, and therefore it follows that it was not by works that he was justified. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/4-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
