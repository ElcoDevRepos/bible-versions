When Adam and Eve sinned, not only humanity but all of creation was affected. The term "futility" suggests a state of frustration and decay, indicating that creation is not fulfilling its intended purpose. This aligns with <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>, where life is described as "meaningless" or "vanity" under the curse of sin. The idea of creation groaning under this burden is further elaborated in <a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>.<p><b>not by its own will</b><br>Creation did not choose this state of futility; it was imposed upon it. This highlights the distinction between the will of creation and the will of God. The passive role of creation in this subjection underscores the impact of human sin on the natural world. This involuntary subjection is reminiscent of the way the earth was cursed because of Adam's sin (<a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>).<p><b>but because of the One who subjected it</b><br>God is the One who subjected creation to futility. This was part of His righteous judgment following the Fall. However, it is important to note that God's actions are always purposeful and redemptive. This subjection is not arbitrary but serves a greater divine plan. The sovereignty of God over creation is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/job/38.htm">Job 38-41</a>, where God&#8217;s control over the natural world is emphasized.<p><b>in hope</b><br>Despite the current state of futility, there is a promise of future restoration. This hope is rooted in God's redemptive plan through Jesus Christ. The phrase "in hope" points to the eschatological expectation of a new creation, as described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-5</a>, where God will make all things new. This hope is not wishful thinking but a confident expectation based on God's promises. The concept of hope is central to the Christian faith, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>, which defines faith as being sure of what we hope for.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>Refers to the entire universe and all living things within it, which have been affected by the fall of man and the resulting curse.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_one_who_subjected_it.htm">The One who subjected it</a></b><br>This is understood to be God, who subjected creation to futility as a result of sin, but with a purpose and hope for future redemption.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/futility.htm">Futility</a></b><br>Represents the state of frustration and decay that creation experiences due to sin, leading to a longing for restoration.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hope.htm">Hope</a></b><br>The expectation of future redemption and restoration through Jesus Christ, which is a central theme in Christian eschatology.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_futility.htm">Understanding Futility</a></b><br>Recognize that the frustration and decay in the world are a result of sin, but they serve a purpose in God's redemptive plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Trust in God's sovereignty, knowing that He subjected creation to futility with a hopeful purpose, pointing towards redemption.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_hope.htm">Living in Hope</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to live with the hope of future restoration, which should influence our perspective on current struggles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/creation's_groaning.htm">Creation's Groaning</a></b><br>Acknowledge that creation itself longs for redemption, and this should inspire us to care for the environment as stewards of God's creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Maintain an eternal perspective, focusing on the glory that will be revealed, rather than being overwhelmed by present difficulties.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_8_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 8:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_8_20_Creation_s_futility_today.htm">How does Romans 8:20 explain creation's "subjection to futility" in today's world?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/God_s_will_in_creation_s_subjection.htm">What role does God's will play in creation's subjection, according to Romans 8:20?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Romans_8_20_Genesis_3_17-19_curse.htm">How does Romans 8:20 connect with Genesis 3:17-19 about creation's curse?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_find_hope_amid_decay.htm">In what ways can we find hope despite creation's "bondage to decay"?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Romans_8_20_on_eco-stewardship.htm">How can understanding Romans 8:20 influence our stewardship of the environment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_creation_subjected_to_futility.htm">What does "creation was subjected to futility" mean in Romans 8:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Romans_8_20_s_link_to_original_sin.htm">How does Romans 8:20 relate to the concept of original sin?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_God_make_creation_futile.htm">Why would God subject creation to futility according to Romans 8:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_romans_8.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Romans 8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/can_christians_experience_depression.htm">Can Christians experience depression?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_does_god_allow_disabilities.htm">Why does God permit disabilities in people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_does_god_allow_kids_to_suffer.htm">Why does God permit suffering in innocent children?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_don't_disasters_spare_worship_sites.htm">Why do natural disasters not avoid places of worship?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Romans 8:20 Mean</div><b>For the creation</b><p>&#8220;For the creation&#8221; reaches back to everything God originally called &#8220;very good&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>).

Creation is fulfilling an unworthy instead of a worthy and noble end. (Comp. <a href="/context/genesis/3-17.htm" title="And to Adam he said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it: cursed is the ground for your sake; in sorrow shall you eat of it all the days of your life;">Genesis 3:17-18</a>.)

The one thing which takes out the sting from this impoverished and degraded condition is Hope.<p>It is needless to say that this is not Darwinism, but it is easily reconcilable with evolution. Indeed, such a theory seems to give it additional force and emphasis. It helps to bring out both the present "vanity" and hope for the future, and to show both as parts of one "increasing purpose" widening through the ages. "Allowing for irregularities and fluctuations, on the whole, higher and higher forms of life have appeared. There has been unquestionably an enormous advance between the times of the Eozoon Canadense and our own. And, further, we have to notice that a new kind of progress, of far greater intrinsic importance than mere physical improvement, has of late appeared. I mean intellectual and moral progress, as it is seen in man. . . . And this progress, I would say, is most important in our argument as to the character of God, for it is full of promise of far better things than this sad world has ever seen. It points most decidedly to a supremacy of the power for good, and a great hope of final happiness for our race." (Rev. S. T. Gibson, <span class= "ital">Religion and Science,</span> p. 34.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20, 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the creature</span> (or, <span class="accented">creation</span>, as before) <span class="cmt_word">was subjected to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who subjected it in hope. Because</span> (or, that; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">in hope that</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the creature</span> (or, <span class="accented">creation</span>) <span class="cmt_word">also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the sons of God</span>. The aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;</span> ("was subjected") seems to imply that the present "vanity" and "bondage of corruption" were not inherent in the original Creation, or of necessity to last for ever. Thus the assertions of <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>: and 31, stand unshaken, viz. that in the beginning God created all things, and that all at first was "very good." The ideas, resorted to in order to account for existing evil, of matter (<span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>) being essentially evil, and of a <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, other than the Supreme God, having made the world, are alike precluded. It might serve as an answer to the argument of Lucretius against a Divine origin of things- <p><span class="accented">"Nequaquam nobis divinius esse paratam<br />Naturam rerum, tanta star praedita culpa"</span> Why the "creature" was thus "subjected" is not here explained. No solution of the old insoluble problem of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> is given. All that is, or could be, said is that it was <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, meaning God. It was his will that it should be so; this is all we know; except that we find the beginning of evil, so far as it affects man, attributed in Scripture to human sin. But he so subjected his creation <span class="accented">in hope.</span> This expression may refer to the <span class="accented">protoevangelium</span> of <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, or to the never-dying hope in the human heart; to either or to both. The latter idea is expressed in the myth of Pandora's box. Further, the creature is said to have been so subjected "not willingly" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>). No sentient beings acquiesce in suffering; they resent evil, and would fain flee from it. Man especially unwillingly submits to his present bondage. When in ver. 21 the hope is expressed of the creature (or creation) itself being eventually freed from the present bondage of corruption, it may be that the human part of creation only is in the writer's eye; but it may be also (there being still no expressed limitation of the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) that he conceives a final emancipation of the whole creation from evil (cf. <a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23-27</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>). But if so, it is not said that the peculiar glory of the sons of God will extend to all creation, but only that all will be freed into the freedom of their glory; which may mean that the day of the revelation of the sons of God in glory will bring with it a general emancipation of all creation from its present bondage. Such a great final hope finds expression in the verse - <p><span class="accented">"That God, which ever lives and loves,<br />One God, one law, one element,<br />And one far-off Divine event,<br />To which the whole creation moves."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">In Memoriam.'</span>) The present condition of things is in ver. 20 denoted by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, and in ver. 21 by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>. The first of these words is the equivalent in the LXX. of the Hebrew XXX, which means properly "breath," or "vapour," and is used metaphorically for anything frail, fruitless, evanescent, vain. It is often applied to idols, and it is the word in Ecclesiastes where it is said that "all is vanity" (cf. also <a href="/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5, 6</a>). It seems here to denote the frailty, incompleteness, transitoriness, to which all things are now subject.
