This phrase highlights the miraculous works that God performed through Paul, similar to those seen in the ministry of Jesus and the apostles (<a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>, <a href="/acts/5-12.htm">Acts 5:12</a>). These signs and wonders were not merely for spectacle but were intended to confirm the truth of the gospel and demonstrate God's power over creation, sickness, and evil. They also fulfilled Old Testament prophecies that spoke of God's mighty works (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>).<p><b>and by the power of the Spirit of God</b><br>The Holy Spirit is central to the ministry of Paul, empowering him to preach, perform miracles, and endure hardships. This phrase emphasizes that Paul's ministry was not based on human strength or wisdom but on the divine enablement of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4-5</a>). The Spirit's power is a recurring theme in the New Testament, signifying the presence of God in the life of believers and the church (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, <a href="/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>). The Spirit's work in Paul's ministry is a continuation of the Spirit's activity throughout the biblical narrative, from creation (<a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>) to the new creation in Christ.<p><b>So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum</b><br>This geographical span illustrates the extensive reach of Paul's missionary journeys. Jerusalem, the starting point, is significant as the birthplace of the church and the site of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection. Illyricum, located in the western Balkans, represents the farthest extent of Paul's travels mentioned in the New Testament. This journey reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' command to be witnesses "in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth" (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). The mention of these locations underscores the spread of the gospel beyond Jewish boundaries to Gentile regions, aligning with God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ</b><br>Paul's statement of having "fully proclaimed" the gospel indicates the thoroughness and completeness of his missionary work. This proclamation involved not only preaching but also teaching, discipling, and establishing churches. The gospel of Christ is the central message of the New Testament, focusing on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus as the means of salvation for all who believe (<a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15:1-4</a>). Paul's commitment to this message is evident throughout his epistles, where he emphasizes the necessity of faith in Christ for both Jews and Gentiles (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16-17</a>). This phrase also reflects Paul's role as an apostle to the Gentiles, fulfilling the mission God had given him (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Romans, Paul is a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The starting point of Paul's missionary work, Jerusalem is significant as the birthplace of the early church and the location of many pivotal events in Christian history.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/illyricum.htm">Illyricum</a></b><br>A region in the Roman Empire, Illyricum represents the extent of Paul's missionary efforts, highlighting the geographical spread of the gospel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/signs_and_wonders.htm">Signs and Wonders</a></b><br>Miraculous events that accompanied the preaching of the gospel, serving as evidence of divine power and authority.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/spirit_of_god.htm">Spirit of God</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit, who empowers believers and authenticates the message of the gospel through spiritual gifts and miracles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit_in_ministry.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit in Ministry</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit empowers believers to proclaim the gospel effectively.

God validated Paul&#8217;s message with literal signs and wonders, empowered by the Holy Spirit. That divine backing propelled the apostle from Jerusalem to the edge of Europe, where he boldly delivered the full gospel. The verse reminds us that the same Spirit who energized Paul still authenticates and advances Christ&#8217;s good news through faithful proclamation today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Through mighty signs</span> <span class= "bld">and wonders.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">through the might of signs and wonders</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> through those extraordinary powers which found their expression in signs and wonders. "Signs and wonders" is the phrase regularly used throughout the New Testament for the Christian miracles: so frequently in the Gospels. (Comp. also <a href="/2_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.">2Corinthians 12:12</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,">2Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-4.htm" title="By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaks.">Hebrews 11:4</a>.) The two words are very similar in meaning. They denote the same acts, but they connote different aspects in which those acts may be regarded. The word "signs" tends to bring out the symbolical character of the miracle, the spiritual truth of which it was, as it were, the physical expression. In the word "wonders" stress is laid rather upon its character as a portent, a manifestation of supernatural, divine power. That St. Paul himself claimed miraculous powers is a face that cannot be doubted.<p><span class= "bld">By the power of the Spirit of God.</span>--The two clauses at the beginning of this verse correspond roughly to "by word and deed" at the end of the last. "Signs and wonders" are the manifestation of the effectual working of Christ in "deed." The "power of the Spirit of God" is exemplified both in "deed" and in "word."<p><span class= "bld">So that . . .</span>--It is to be noticed that the language of the Apostle becomes more and more definite and concrete, till he ends by describing the geographical extent of his own labours.<p><span class= "bld">Jerusalem.</span>--The Apostle naturally takes this as the <span class= "ital">terminus a quo,</span> partly because it was at this time the centre and head-quarters of Christianity, and also more especially because it was the extreme point eastwards and southwards of his own public ministry. (His sojourn in "Arabia," which may include the desert of Sinai, appears to have been of a more private character.)<p><span class= "bld">And round about . . .</span>--In a sort of rough curve, embracing a large portion of Asia Minor, and finally turning towards the starting-point again in Illyricum.<p><span class= "bld">Illyricum.</span>--A Roman province, stretching along the eastern coast of the Adriatic, and forming the northern boundary of Epirus, and the north-western of Macedonia. Whether St. Paul had actually visited Illyricum does not appear from his language in this passage. Illyricum is the <span class= "ital">terminus ad quem</span> of his journeyings, but it may be inclusive, or it may be exclusive. The description would be sufficiently satisfied if he had approached the outskirts of Illyricum during his journey through Macedonia. That journey must be the one recorded in <a href="/acts/20-2.htm" title="And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,">Acts 20:2</a>. The earlier journey of Acts 16, 17 can be traced clearly from place to place, and did not extend far enough inland, while the vague expression which we find in <a href="/acts/20-2.htm" title="And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,">Acts 20:2</a>, "When he had gone over those parts," affords ample room for the circuit in question.
