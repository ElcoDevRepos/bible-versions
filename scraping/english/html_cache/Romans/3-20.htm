In the context of Paul's letter to the Romans, he addresses both Jewish and Gentile believers, highlighting that adherence to the Mosaic Law cannot achieve righteousness. Historically, the Jewish people held the law in high regard, believing it to be the path to righteousness. However, Paul argues that justification comes through faith in Jesus Christ, not through legalistic observance. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who fulfilled the law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>) and offered a new covenant through His sacrifice. The concept of justification by faith is further supported in <a href="/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>, where Paul reiterates that no one is justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ.<p><b>For the law merely brings awareness of sin.</b><br>The law serves as a mirror, reflecting humanity's sinful nature and inability to achieve God's standard of holiness. In <a href="/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7</a>, Paul explains that the law reveals sin, such as coveting, which he would not have recognized without the law. This awareness is crucial because it underscores the need for a savior, pointing to Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of the law and the one who offers redemption. The law's role in highlighting sin is also seen in the Old Testament, where the sacrificial system was established to atone for sins, foreshadowing Christ's ultimate sacrifice. Theologically, this phrase underscores the purpose of the law as a tutor leading to Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>), emphasizing that salvation is a gift of grace, not a result of human effort.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the Roman Christians were a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers living in the capital of the Roman Empire.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law given to the Israelites, which includes moral, ceremonial, and civil laws.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/justification.htm">Justification</a></b><br>A theological term referring to being declared righteous before God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin.htm">Sin</a></b><br>The moral failing or transgression against God's law, which the law reveals to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_the_law.htm">The Purpose of the Law</a></b><br>The law serves to reveal sin, not to provide a means of justification.
