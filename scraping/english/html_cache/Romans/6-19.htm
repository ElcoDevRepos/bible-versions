Here, he acknowledges the limitations of human understanding due to the "weakness of your flesh." This phrase reflects the human condition post-Fall, where sin has impaired our ability to fully grasp divine concepts. The "flesh" refers to the sinful nature that opposes God's will, a theme Paul explores in <a href="/romans/7-18.htm">Romans 7:18-25</a>. The use of "human terms" suggests Paul's pastoral approach, making spiritual truths accessible to his audience, who were familiar with the struggles of the flesh.<p><b>Just as you used to offer the parts of your body in slavery to impurity and to escalating wickedness,</b><br>Paul draws a parallel between the believers' past and present lives. Before conversion, they were enslaved to sin, offering their bodies to "impurity" and "escalating wickedness." This reflects the Greco-Roman context, where idolatry and moral corruption were prevalent. The term "slavery" indicates total submission and lack of freedom, a condition from which Christ redeems believers. The progression from impurity to escalating wickedness highlights sin's destructive nature, as seen in <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>, where desire leads to sin and sin to death.<p><b>so now offer them in slavery to righteousness leading to holiness.</b><br>Paul contrasts the former life of sin with the new life in Christ. Believers are called to offer themselves to "righteousness," which leads to "holiness." This transformation is possible through the Holy Spirit's work, as described in <a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-25</a>. The concept of "slavery to righteousness" implies a willing submission to God's will, resulting in sanctification. Holiness is both a positional and progressive state, reflecting God's nature and fulfilling His command in <a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44</a>, "Be holy, for I am holy." This call to holiness is a central theme throughout Scripture, culminating in the believer's ultimate glorification.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Romans, Paul is addressing the believers in Rome, providing them with theological insights and practical instructions for living a Christian life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_believers.htm">Roman Believers</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, these early Christians were living in a diverse and often morally challenging environment, requiring guidance on how to live out their faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/slavery_to_sin.htm">Slavery to Sin</a></b><br>A metaphor used by Paul to describe the previous state of the believers before coming to faith in Christ, characterized by a life dominated by sin and impurity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/righteousness_and_holiness.htm">Righteousness and Holiness</a></b><br>The new state to which believers are called, characterized by living in accordance with God's will and growing in sanctification.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/human_weakness.htm">Human Weakness</a></b><br>Paul acknowledges the limitations and struggles of the human condition, which necessitates clear and relatable teaching.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_human_weakness.htm">Understanding Human Weakness</a></b><br>Recognize that Paul uses relatable language to address the struggles of the flesh, acknowledging our human limitations and the need for divine strength.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transition_from_sin_to_righteousness.htm">Transition from Sin to Righteousness</a></b><br>Reflect on the transformation from a life of sin to a life of righteousness, understanding that this is a process of sanctification empowered by the Holy Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/offering_ourselves_to_god.htm">Offering Ourselves to God</a></b><br>Consider how we can actively offer our bodies and lives to God as instruments of righteousness, making conscious choices that lead to holiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_holiness_in_the_christian_life.htm">The Role of Holiness in the Christian Life</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of holiness as the goal of our Christian walk, understanding that it is both a position we hold in Christ and a process we undergo.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_steps_to_live_righteously.htm">Practical Steps to Live Righteously</a></b><br>Identify practical steps to resist sin and pursue righteousness, such as regular prayer, Bible study, and fellowship with other believers.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_6_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 6:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_6_19_s_call_to_daily_righteousness.htm">How does Romans 6:19 encourage us to pursue righteousness in daily life?

St. Paul may mean, "In saying you were made <span class="accented">slaves to</span> righteousness, I am using human language not properly applicable to your spiritual relations. For you are not really in bondage now; you have been emancipated from your former bondage to sin, and are now called upon to render a free willing allowance to righteousness; being, in fact, sons, not slaves." This view of the true position of the Christian being one of freedom recurs so often and so forcibly with St. Paul that it is peculiarly likely to be the thought before him here; the very word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> would be likely to suggest it (cf. <a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-17.htm">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-7</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1, 13</a>). If (he would say) you fully realized your position as sons of God, you would feel it impossible even to think of sinning willingly; but, in accommodation to your human weakness, I put the case as if you had only been transferred from one bondage to another, so as to show that, even so, you are under an <span class="accented">obligation</span> not to sin. According to this view of the meaning of the passage, "the infirmity of your flesh" has reference to dulness of spiritual perception, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> being opposed in a general sense to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. Had they been <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, they would have discerned <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> without need of any such human view of the matter being put before them (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>). Some, however, taking <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> to denote <span class="accented">moral</span> weakness, which renders the attainment of holiness difficult for man (cf <a href="/mark/14-38.htm">Mark 14:38</a>), understand <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span> as meaning, "I require of you no more than is possible &Ntilde; for your frail humanity; for I call on you only to render to righteousness the same allegiance you once rendered to sin." This interpretation gives a totally different meaning to the clause. It has the support of Origen, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Calvin, Estius, Wetstein, and others; but it does not appear so natural or probable as the other, which is accepted by most modern commentators. <span class="cmt_word">For as ye yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto sanctification</span> (rather than <span class="accented">holiness</span>, as in the Authorized Version; the word is <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, always so translated elsewhere). This is a setting forth of what must follow in practice from the view that has been taken of the change in the Christian's position resembling the transference of bondservants from one master to another. They must devote their <span class="accented">members</span> (<span class="accented">see</span> above on ver. 13) to the service of the new master in the same way as they had done to that of the old one; the aims or results of the two services being also intimated. The old service was in giving themselves up to <span class="accented">uncleanness</span> (with reference to sins of sensuality), and generally to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e. lawlessness</span>, or disregard of duty; and its result is expressed by a repetition of the latter word. For sin leads to nothing positive; lawless conduct only results in a habit or state of lawlessness; whereas the service of righteousness in itself leads to sanctification to the abiding result of participation in the holiness of God.
