The dual nature of God's character is highlighted here, emphasizing both His kindness and severity. This duality is consistent with the biblical portrayal of God as both loving and just. The call to "take notice" suggests an active engagement with these attributes, urging believers to understand and appreciate the balance between God's mercy and His judgment. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, where God is described as compassionate and gracious, yet also just.<p><b>Severity to those who fell,</b><br>The "severity" mentioned here refers to God's judgment and discipline. The context of <a href="/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a> is Paul's discussion of Israel's unbelief and the resulting consequences. The "fall" of Israel is a reference to their rejection of the Messiah, which led to their temporary hardening and the opening of salvation to the Gentiles. This severity is not arbitrary but a response to unbelief and disobedience, aligning with the biblical principle that God disciplines those who turn away from Him, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>.<p><b>but kindness to you,</b><br>The "kindness" is directed towards the Gentile believers who have been grafted into the spiritual blessings of Israel. This kindness is a manifestation of God's grace, offering salvation and inclusion in His covenant people. It reflects the New Testament theme of God's grace being extended to all nations, fulfilling the promise to Abraham that all peoples would be blessed through him (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). This kindness is contingent upon faith and obedience, as seen in the broader context of Romans.<p><b>if you continue in His kindness.</b><br>The conditional "if" underscores the necessity of perseverance in faith. This continuation is not about earning God's favor but remaining in the grace already received. It echoes the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-6</a>, where abiding in Him is essential for spiritual vitality. The call to continue in kindness is a reminder of the believer's responsibility to live in accordance with God's grace, maintaining a relationship with Him through faith and obedience.<p><b>Otherwise you also will be cut off.</b><br>This warning serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's grace. The imagery of being "cut off" is reminiscent of the agricultural metaphor of grafting used earlier in <a href="/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a>, where branches that do not bear fruit are removed. It highlights the seriousness of apostasy and the importance of remaining faithful. This concept is consistent with other New Testament warnings about falling away, such as in <a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4-6</a>, emphasizing the need for vigilance in the Christian walk.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.

Attend carefully, cherish His grace, and continue steadfastly&#8212;so the kindness you now know will blossom into eternal joy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) As Providence had been appealed to, the Apostle states the true Providential aspect of God's rejection of Israel. It had a double side--one of goodness towards the Gentile, one of deserved severity towards the Jew. But, at the same time, the fact that the covenant was made originally with the Jew, and that he was the natural heir to the promises which it contained, is a guarantee for his restoration if he would only dismiss his unbelief.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22, 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: toward them that fell, severity</span> (to be a warning to thee); <span class="cmt_word">but toward thee, God's goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. And they, if they abide not still in their unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.</span> The reference here to God's <span class="accented">power</span> to graft them in again may be suggested by the apparent impossibility, from a human point of view, of the Jews as a nation, having rejected Christ in person, and being so inveterately set against the gospel as they were, ever coming into the Church. But "with God all things are possible" (cf. <a href="/matthew/19-26.htm">Matthew 19:26</a>; <a href="/mark/10-27.htm">Mark 10:27</a>; <a href="/luke/18-27.htm">Luke 18:27</a>). Nay - so the thought goes on - it would seem in itself more likely, and according to the nature of things, that the Jews should be brought into the Church, which is really their own, and the true fulfilment of their own oracles, than that Gentiles, who had had no similar preparation, should have been so. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/11-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Take notice,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7988;&#948;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Ide)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2400.htm">Strong's 2400: </a> </span><span class="str2">See!
