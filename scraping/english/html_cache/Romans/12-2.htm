In biblical context, "this world" refers to the present age, characterized by values and practices contrary to God's will. Historically, the early Christians in Rome faced pressure to conform to Roman societal norms, which often conflicted with Christian teachings. This call to non-conformity echoes throughout Scripture, such as in 1 <a href="/john/2-15.htm">John 2:15-17</a>, where believers are urged not to love the world or anything in it. The idea is to resist the moral and ethical standards that are not aligned with God's kingdom.<p><b>but be transformed by the renewing of your mind</b><br>Transformation here implies a fundamental change in character and conduct, akin to the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly. This transformation is achieved through the "renewing of your mind," suggesting a continuous process of spiritual growth and understanding. The Greek word for "transformed" is "metamorphoo," also used in the transfiguration of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>), indicating a profound change. Renewing the mind involves immersing oneself in Scripture, prayer, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit, aligning one's thoughts with God's truth as seen in <a href="/ephesians/4-23.htm">Ephesians 4:23-24</a>.<p><b>Then you will be able to test and approve what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will of God</b><br>This phrase highlights the result of a renewed mind: the ability to discern God's will. "Test and approve" suggests a process of examination and confirmation, akin to testing metals for purity. The "good, pleasing, and perfect will of God" refers to God's desires and plans, which are inherently beneficial and complete. This aligns with the biblical theme of wisdom and discernment, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, where trusting in the Lord leads to a straight path.

It would naturally lead us to expect a similar play upon words in the Greek. But it is not so; indeed, there is a clear distinction between the two different words employed. It is the difference between an outward conformity or disguise and a thorough inward assimilation. The Christian is not to copy the fleeting fashions of the present time, but to be wholly transfigured in view of that higher mode of existence, in strict accordance with God's will, that he has chosen.<p><span class= "bld">This world.</span>--Not here the same word as that which is used, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="/context/1_john/2-15.htm" title="Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.">1John 2:15-17</a>, but another, which signifies rather the state of the world as it existed at the Coming of Christ, as opposed to the newly-inaugurated Messianic reign. "To be conformed to this world" is to act as other men do, heathen who know not God; in opposition to this the Apostle exhorts his readers to undergo that total change which will bring them more into accordance with the will of God.<p><span class= "bld">By the renewing of your mind</span>.--"The mind" (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the mental faculties, reason, or understanding) is in itself neutral. When informed by an evil principle, it becomes an instrument of evil; when informed by the Spirit, it is an instrument of good. It performs the process of discrimination between good and evil, and so supplies the <span class= "ital">data</span> to conscience. "The mind" here is not strictly identical with what we now mean by "conscience;" it is, as it were, the rational part of conscience, to which the moral quality needs to be superadded. The "<span class= "ital">renewed</span> mind," or the mind acting under the influence of the Spirit, comes very near to "conscience" in the sense in which the word is used by Bishop Butler.<p><span class= "bld">Prove.</span>--As elsewhere, "discriminate, and so approve." The double process is included: first, of deciding what the will of God is; and, secondly, of choosing and acting upon it.<p><span class= "bld">What is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</span>--The "will of God" is here, not the divine attribute of will, but the thing willed by God, the right course of action. Are we to take the adjectives "good, and acceptable, and perfect" (with the Authorised version), as in agreement with this phrase, or are they rather in apposition to it, "that we may prove the will of God, that which is good, and acceptable, and perfect"? Most of the commentators prefer this latter way of taking the passage, but it is not quite clear that the former is impossible, "that good, and acceptable, and perfect thing, or course of action which God wills." "Acceptable," that is to say, to God Himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And be not conformed to</span> (rather, <span class="accented">fashioned after</span>; the verb is <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="cmt_word">this world; but be ye transformed</span> (the verb here is <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove</span> (or, <span class="accented">discern</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>what is the will of God, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.</span> (So, rather than as in the Authorized Version; the epithets <span class="accented">acceptable</span> and <span class="accented">perfect</span> not being properly applicable to <span class="accented">the will of God</span>; and the translation given above being close to the original.) It is a matter of no importance for exegesis that ancient authorities leave it uncertain whether the verbs at the beginning of this verse should be read as imperatives (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) <span class="accented">or</span> as infinitives (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). In the latter case they depend, with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in ver. 1, on <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;</span>. The meaning remains unaffected. As to the words themselves, Meyer's assertion that they stand in contrast only through the <span class="accented">prepositions</span>, without any difference of sense in the stem-words, is surely wrong. St. Paul is not in the habit of varying his expressions without a meaning; and he might have written <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">1 Corinthians 4:6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13, 14</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>) instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> (cf. <a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>) instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>. And there is an essential difference between the senses in which <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> may be used. The former denotes outward <span class="accented">fashion</span>, which may be fleeting, and belonging to accident and circumstance; the latter is used to express essential <span class="accented">form</span>, in virtue of which a thing is what it is; cf. <a href="/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>, and also (though Meyer denies any distinction here) <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6, 7</a>. The apostle warns his readers not to follow in their ways of life the <span class="accented">fashions</span> of this present world, which are both false and fleeting (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/7-31.htm">1 Corinthians 7:31</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), but to undergo such a change of essential <span class="accented">form</span> as to preclude their doing so. If they become <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> with Christ (cf. <a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>), the world's fashions will not affect them. The phrase, "this world" or "age"(<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>, may be understood with reference to the rabbinical division of time into <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; the latter denoting the age of the Messiah. The New Testament writers seem to regard themselves as still in the former, though to them it is irradiated by beams from the latter, which had already dawned in Christ, though not to be fully realized till the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (see note on Hebrews 1:2). The transformation here spoken of consists in the <span class="accented">renewal of the mind</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>), which denotes the Understanding, or thinking power, regarded as to its moral activity. And Christian <span class="accented">renewal</span> imparts not only the will and power to do God's will, but also intelligence to discern it. Hence follows <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, etc. (cf. <a href="/ephesians/4-17.htm">Ephesians 4:17, 23</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-5.htm">1 Timothy 6:5</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-8.htm">2 Timothy 3:8</a>; and also <span class="accented">supra</span> ch. 1:28, where the Gentiles were said to have been given up, in judgment, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, when <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> may <span class="accented">possibly</span> mean <span class="accented">undiscerning.</span> See note on that passage). It is to be observed, lastly, that the present tenses of the verbs <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, unlike the previous aorist <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, intimate progressive habits. The perfect Christian character is not formed all at once on conversion (of <a href="/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; see also previous note on Romans 6:13, with reference to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>).
