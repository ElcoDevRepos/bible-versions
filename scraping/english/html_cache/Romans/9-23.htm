It reflects the broader context of <a href="/romans/9.htm">Romans 9</a>, where Paul discusses God's sovereignty in election and His right to show mercy or harden hearts. This rhetorical question challenges readers to trust in God's wisdom and purpose, even when His actions are beyond human understanding.<p><b>to make the riches of His glory known</b><br>The "riches of His glory" refers to the abundant and multifaceted nature of God's glory, which encompasses His holiness, majesty, and grace. This phrase suggests that God's actions are ultimately aimed at revealing His character and divine attributes. The concept of God's glory is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/33-18.htm">Exodus 33:18-19</a>, where Moses asks to see God's glory, and in the New Testament, where Jesus is described as the radiance of God's glory (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<p><b>to the vessels of His mercy</b><br>"Vessels of His mercy" is a metaphorical expression indicating those whom God has chosen to receive His mercy. In the cultural context of the time, vessels were common household items, often used to hold valuable substances. This imagery suggests that believers are chosen by God to contain and display His mercy. The idea of being vessels is also seen in <a href="/2_timothy/2-20.htm">2 Timothy 2:20-21</a>, where Paul speaks of different kinds of vessels in a house, some for honorable use.<p><b>whom He prepared in advance for glory&#8212;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the doctrine of predestination, indicating that God has a predetermined plan for those He has chosen. The concept of being "prepared in advance" aligns with <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>, where Paul writes about believers being chosen before the foundation of the world. The "glory" mentioned here refers to the ultimate glorification of believers, a future state of eternal life and communion with God, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>, where those whom God justifies, He also glorifies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who displays His glory and mercy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/objects_of_his_mercy.htm">Objects of His Mercy</a></b><br>Believers who have been chosen and prepared by God to receive His mercy and glory.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, addressing the Roman church and explaining God's sovereign plan.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_church.htm">Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/glory.htm">Glory</a></b><br>The divine splendor and majesty of God, which He desires to reveal to His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_sovereignty.htm">Understanding God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God, in His sovereignty, chooses to reveal His glory and mercy to those He has prepared.
