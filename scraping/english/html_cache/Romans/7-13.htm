The rhetorical question highlights the tension between the law's goodness and its role in revealing sin. The law itself is not the cause of death; rather, it exposes sin, which leads to death. This reflects the Jewish understanding of the law as a divine gift, as seen in <a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>, which describes the law as perfect and life-giving.<p><b>Certainly not!</b><br>Paul emphatically denies that the law, which is good, becomes death. This strong negation is characteristic of Paul's style, emphasizing that the problem lies not with the law but with sin. This echoes his earlier arguments in <a href="/romans/3-31.htm">Romans 3:31</a>, where he upholds the law's value and purpose.<p><b>But in order that sin might be exposed as sin,</b><br>The law serves to reveal sin for what it truly is. Without the law, sin might remain hidden or misunderstood. This aligns with <a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>, where Paul states that through the law comes the knowledge of sin. The law acts as a mirror, showing humanity its sinful nature.<p><b>it produced death in me through what was good,</b><br>The law, though good, becomes the means by which sin is recognized and thus leads to spiritual death. This paradox highlights the law's role in God's redemptive plan, as it points to the need for a savior. The concept of death here is both physical and spiritual, reflecting the consequences of sin as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>.<p><b>so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.</b><br>The law intensifies the awareness of sin, making it exceedingly sinful. This phrase underscores the gravity of sin when contrasted with God's holy standards. The commandment magnifies sin's true nature, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>, where the law is described as added because of transgressions.
