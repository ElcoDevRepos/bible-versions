The "reason" refers to the preceding verses where humanity's rejection of God's truth and idolatry is described. The concept of God "giving them over" suggests a judicial act, where God allows individuals to pursue their sinful desires as a form of judgment. This aligns with the biblical principle of sowing and reaping (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>). The term "dishonorable passions" refers to desires that are contrary to God's design and moral order. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the consequences of sin, as seen in the fall of humanity in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.<p><b>Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.</b><br>This phrase highlights a specific example of the dishonorable passions mentioned. The focus on women first is notable, as it emphasizes the extent of the moral decline. The "exchange" of natural for unnatural relations suggests a deliberate choice to abandon God's created order. This mirrors the exchange of truth for a lie mentioned earlier in the chapter (<a href="/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>). The term "natural relations" refers to heterosexual relationships as designed by God, while "unnatural ones" indicates homosexual behavior, which is consistently viewed as contrary to God's design in both Old and New Testament passages (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/18-22.htm">Leviticus 18:22</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9-10</a>).
