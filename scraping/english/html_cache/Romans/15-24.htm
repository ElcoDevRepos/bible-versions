Spain, known as Hispania in the Roman Empire, was a distant and largely unreached region for the Gospel at that time. This reflects Paul's missionary zeal and his desire to spread the Gospel to the ends of the earth, aligning with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). Historically, Spain was a Roman province, and its mention indicates the vast reach of the Roman Empire, which facilitated travel and communication. Paul's ambition to preach in Spain demonstrates his commitment to fulfilling his calling as the Apostle to the Gentiles (<a href="/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>).<p><b>And after I have enjoyed your company for a while,</b><br>Paul anticipates a time of fellowship and mutual encouragement with the Roman Christians. This reflects the early Christian practice of hospitality and the importance of community among believers. The phrase suggests a temporary stay, indicating Paul's itinerant ministry style. The enjoyment of their company underscores the relational aspect of Paul's ministry, as seen in other epistles where he expresses affection and gratitude for fellow believers (<a href="/philippians/1-3.htm">Philippians 1:3-8</a>). This also highlights the unity and love that should characterize the body of Christ (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>).<p><b>you can equip me for my journey.</b><br>Paul seeks practical support from the Roman church for his mission to Spain. The term "equip" implies providing resources, such as financial assistance, supplies, or companions for the journey. This reflects the early church's practice of supporting missionaries, as seen in the support given to Paul by the Philippians (<a href="/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15-18</a>). It also illustrates the principle of partnership in the Gospel, where different members of the body of Christ contribute to the mission in various ways (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>). This request for support aligns with the biblical principle of sowing and reaping in ministry (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle and author of the letter to the Romans, expressing his missionary plans and desire to visit the Roman believers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_believers.htm">Roman Believers</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, whom he hopes to visit and be supported by on his journey.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/spain.htm">Spain</a></b><br>The intended destination of Paul's missionary journey, representing the westernmost part of the Roman Empire and a new frontier for the Gospel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/journey.htm">Journey</a></b><br>Paul's travel plans, which include visiting Rome and then proceeding to Spain, highlighting his commitment to spreading the Gospel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/equipping.htm">Equipping</a></b><br>The support and provision Paul seeks from the Roman believers for his missionary work, indicating the communal nature of early Christian missions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_fellowship_and_support.htm">The Importance of Fellowship and Support</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s desire to visit the Roman believers underscores the value of Christian fellowship and mutual encouragement.

Whether he ever succeeded in carrying out his purpose we cannot say positively, but it is, perhaps, rather more probable than not. A tradition which dates back to the Epistle of Clement of Rome (<span class= "ital">circ.</span> A.D. 95) says that he visited "the extreme limit of the West," a phrase which seems hardly satisfied by being interpreted simply of Rome. The author of the Muratorian Fragment (<span class= "ital">circ.</span> A.D. 170) speaks expressly of a journey to Spain, though his language looks as if it might be an inference from this Epistle. The Acts, it is true, do not carry the Apostle beyond Rome, but the phenomena of the Pastoral Epistles and tradition together seem to justify us in assuming the probability of a later journey or journeys not recorded in that volume, and the argument from silence, as the book in any case stops short of the death of the Apostle, counts for but little. This is just a case in which it cannot be wrong to accept the balance of the argument as it stands. At the same time it is impossible not to feel the grievous blank which lies over the later years of the life of St. Paul, and few things would be more deeply interesting, or would throw more light on the principles of criticism, than the discovery, if only it were possible, of the merest fragment bearing upon it. It is to be feared, however, that there is no reasonable hope of such a discovery being ever made.<p><span class= "bld">I will come to you . . .</span>--These words are wanting in the true text, and have to be supplied. The sentence is left unfinished.<p><span class= "bld">To be brought on my way.</span>--A graphic description of this "bringing upon the way," is given in the account of the departure of St. Paul after his seven days' sojourn at Tyre, <a href="/acts/21-5.htm" title="And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.">Acts 21:5</a>.
