The Apostle Paul is addressing the Jewish audience's lack of understanding regarding the inclusion of Gentiles in God's redemptive plan. This question echoes the theme of Israel's spiritual blindness found throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where the prophet speaks of a people who hear but do not understand.<p><b>First, Moses says:</b><br>Paul references Moses to establish authority and continuity with the Jewish Scriptures. By invoking Moses, Paul connects his argument to the Torah, which holds significant weight for his Jewish audience. This approach underscores the consistency of God's message throughout the history of Israel.<p><b>&#8220;I will make you jealous by those who are not a nation;</b><br>This phrase is a quotation from <a href="/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>, part of the Song of Moses. It prophesies that God will use a non-nation, referring to the Gentiles, to provoke Israel to jealousy. The concept of jealousy here is not merely emotional but is intended to lead Israel back to God by witnessing His blessings on others. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using unexpected means to fulfill His purposes, as seen in the inclusion of Gentiles in the New Covenant.<p><b>I will make you angry by a nation without understanding.&#8221;</b><br>The "nation without understanding" refers to the Gentiles, who were historically outside the covenant and lacked the law and prophetic tradition of Israel. This phrase emphasizes the reversal of roles, where those once considered outsiders are now recipients of God's grace. This provocation to anger is meant to awaken Israel to the reality of God's inclusive salvation plan. The idea of God using other nations to discipline or provoke Israel is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the Assyrian and Babylonian captivities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who received the Law and the promises of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader who delivered the Israelites from Egyptian bondage and through whom God gave the Law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Referred to as "those who are not a nation" and "a nation without understanding," representing non-Jewish peoples who were not originally part of God's covenant with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Romans, addressing both Jewish and Gentile believers in the early church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/deuteronomy_32_-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a></b><br>The Old Testament scripture Paul quotes, where God speaks through Moses about provoking Israel to jealousy through other nations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_plan.htm">God's Sovereign Plan</a></b><br>God's plan includes using unexpected means to fulfill His purposes, such as using the Gentiles to provoke Israel to jealousy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/jealousy_as_a_catalyst.htm">Jealousy as a Catalyst</a></b><br>Spiritual jealousy can be a tool God uses to bring people back to Him.

By quoting Moses, Paul proves that Israel&#8217;s present unbelief and the inclusion of Gentiles were foretold in the very Torah Israel claimed to honor (<a href="/john/5-45.htm">John 5:45&#8211;47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will make you jealous by those who are not a nation;</b><p>God promised to stir Israel&#8217;s emotions through outsiders who lacked Israel&#8217;s history, covenants, or temple worship.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hosea/2-23.htm">Hosea 2:23</a> and <a href="/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a> echo the theme of a &#8220;not-my-people&#8221; group becoming God&#8217;s people.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/13-44.htm">Acts 13:44&#8211;48</a> illustrates jealousy in action: when Gentiles flocked to hear Paul, many Jews reacted with envy.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a> confirms the goal: &#8220;through their trespass, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel jealous.&#8221;<p>The strategy is corrective, not punitive: God desires that witnessing Gentile faith will provoke Israel to reconsider her Messiah.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will make you angry by a nation without understanding.</b><p>&#8220;Without understanding&#8221; does not flatter the Gentiles; it simply notes they lacked the Law&#8217;s detailed revelation (<a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>).

Moses had long ago announced that God would use Gentile inclusion to provoke Israel&#8217;s jealousy and anger, exposing willful unbelief and encouraging repentance. The verse underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness to His Word: the Law foretold both Israel&#8217;s stumbling and the opening of salvation&#8217;s door to the nations, all part of His redemptive plan to draw both Jew and Gentile to the same Messiah.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) Did not Israel know that the preaching of the gospel would be thus universal, and pass over from them to the Gentiles?

It may be observed that in the Greek we have the same word, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>,, in both classes of the sentence, though, in order to bring out the supposed meaning in the first clause, it is there, in the Authorized Version, rendered "people," and in the second, "nation." The passage occurs in the song attributed to Moses in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>, and expresses the idea of God, in consequence of the defaults of Israel, favouring those who were so far, as it were, no nation at all, so as to provoke Israel to jealousy. It is therefore aptly cited as an intimation in the Pentateuch itself of the calling of the Gentiles in place of unbelieving Israel. The idea involved in "provoke you to jealousy" - in the sense of moving to emulation, so that Israel itself as a nation might, through the calling of the Gentiles, in the end be saved - is pursued, as will be seen, in the chapter that follows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/10-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I ask</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(leg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">instead:</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#955;&#955;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(Alla)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
