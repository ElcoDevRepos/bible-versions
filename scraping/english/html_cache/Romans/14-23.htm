In the context of <a href="/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>, Paul is discussing the disputes among believers regarding dietary laws and the observance of certain days. The early church was a mix of Jewish and Gentile believers, each with different backgrounds and practices. For Jewish Christians, dietary laws were deeply ingrained, while Gentile converts might not share these scruples. Paul emphasizes that if a person eats with doubt, they are condemned by their own conscience, not by God. This reflects the broader biblical principle that actions must align with personal faith and conviction (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-7.htm">1 Corinthians 8:7-12</a>).<p><b>because his eating is not from faith</b><br>Faith here is not merely belief but a deep-seated trust and assurance in one's relationship with God. The act of eating, or any action, should be done with a clear conscience and confidence in God's acceptance. This echoes <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>, which states that without faith, it is impossible to please God. The historical context of the Roman church, with its diverse membership, underscores the importance of unity and understanding in matters of personal conviction. Paul is teaching that faith should guide actions, and anything done without faith is not in alignment with God's will.<p><b>and everything that is not from faith is sin</b><br>This statement broadens the principle beyond dietary concerns to all aspects of life. It underscores the necessity of faith as the foundation for all actions. In the biblical narrative, sin is often depicted as missing the mark of God's standard (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>). Here, Paul defines sin as any action not rooted in faith, emphasizing the internal nature of true righteousness. This connects to the teachings of Jesus, who prioritized the heart's intentions over mere external compliance (<a href="/matthew/15-18.htm">Matthew 15:18-20</a>). Theologically, this phrase challenges believers to examine their motives and ensure that their actions are expressions of genuine faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is addressing the Roman church, providing guidance on how to live a life of faith and unity amidst differing opinions on non-essential matters.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_church.htm">Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile believers, who were navigating cultural and religious differences.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/dietary_practices.htm">Dietary Practices</a></b><br>The specific issue in this passage relates to eating food that some believers considered unclean, a point of contention between Jewish and Gentile Christians.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_conscience.htm">The Role of Conscience</a></b><br>Our conscience plays a crucial role in guiding our actions.

Earlier he noted, &#8220;One person&#8217;s faith allows him to eat everything, but another, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables&#8221; (<a href="/romans/14-2.htm">Romans 14:2</a>).<p>- Doubt here is not a mild preference; it is an inner hesitation that what one is about to do may displease God (compare <a href="/1_john/3-20.htm">1 John 3:20-21</a>).<p>- When we are unsure whether an action honors the Lord, we are called to pause rather than push through uncertainty (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is condemned if he eats</b><p>- Condemnation is not loss of salvation but the verdict of a guilty conscience. In context, Paul has just warned, &#8220;If your brother is distressed by what you eat, you are no longer acting in love&#8221; (<a href="/romans/14-15.htm">Romans 14:15</a>).<p>- Eating while doubting brings internal judgment, the Spirit-given awareness that we have stepped outside obedience (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-12.htm">1 Corinthians 8:12-13</a>).<p>- This confirms that motives matter as much as outward actions; God &#8220;examines the hearts&#8221; (<a href="/acts/15-8.htm">Acts 15:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because his eating is not from faith</b><p>- Faith is confident trust that an action pleases God (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>).<p>- When faith is absent, the act is self-focused rather than God-focused. Paul&#8217;s rule of thumb: &#8220;Whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all to the glory of God&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>).<p>- Practical take-away:<p>&#8226; Ask, &#8220;Can I thank God for this without reservation?&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>).<p>&#8226; If the answer is no, the safest step is to refrain until convinced by Scripture and prayer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and everything that is not from faith is sin</b><p>- Paul broadens the principle beyond food. Any deed performed apart from settled trust in God&#8217;s approval falls into the category of sin (<a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>).<p>- This elevates the daily walk: mundane choices become spiritual acts when done in faith (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p>- It also guards liberty. Freedom in Christ never cancels the need for a clean conscience before Him (<a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/14-23.htm">Romans 14:23</a> teaches that actions must flow from confident trust in God. If a believer moves forward while doubting, that inward conflict signals sin, even if the action is outwardly permissible. The Lord desires obedience that springs from faith-filled hearts, ensuring every choice&#8212;big or small&#8212;honors Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">And he that doubteth.</span>--The one thing which justifies a man in neglecting such nice and punctilious distinctions is a faith so strong that it can afford to make light of them. Where faith is not strong enough for this, and where the conscience deliberately approves one course, and the other course is chosen, this alone stamps the act as wrong. "He who hesitates as to what he ought to do is condemned, or does wrong, if he eats (in opposition to his conscience), for he has not the one faculty which can overrule the decisions of conscience, and give them a different direction."<p><span class= "bld">Whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</span>--This is intended as a general principle, but only as a general principle covering this particular kind of case. Where the conscience is in doubt, faith alone can make it right to choose the side against which conscience inclines. Nothing is said about those cases in which conscience is either not appealed to at all, or approves what is done. Hence St. Augustine was wrong in arguing from this passage that even good actions, when done by unbelievers, were of the nature of sin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he that doubteth</span> (or, <span class="accented">wavereth</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>is condemned if he eat,</span> <span class="cmt_word">because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</span> For sense of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, cf. ch. 4:20; <a href="/matthew/21-21.htm">Matthew 21:21</a>; <a href="/mark/11-23.htm">Mark 11:23</a>; <a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6</a>. <span class="accented">Faith</span> here denotes an assured belief that what one does is right; nor is it necessary to give the word a wider or different sense in the concluding clause (<span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, Chrysostom).
