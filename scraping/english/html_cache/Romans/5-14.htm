The reign of death signifies the pervasive impact of sin on humanity, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>, where God declares that man will return to dust. The period from Adam to Moses is significant because it predates the Mosaic Law, indicating that sin and its consequence, death, were present even without the law. This underscores the inherent sinful nature of humanity inherited from Adam, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>, "For as in Adam all die."<p><b>even over those who did not sin in the way that Adam transgressed</b><br>This part of the verse suggests that death affected all people, even those who did not commit a direct transgression like Adam's. Adam's sin was a direct violation of God's command (<a href="/genesis/2-16.htm">Genesis 2:16-17</a>), but this phrase indicates that death still reigned over those who did not have a specific command to disobey. This points to the concept of original sin, where Adam's sin is imputed to all his descendants, as explained in <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>. It highlights the idea that sin is not just about individual acts but a condition affecting all humanity.<p><b>He is a pattern of the One to come</b><br>Adam is described as a "pattern" or "type" of Christ, the One to come. This typology is significant in biblical theology, where Adam is seen as a foreshadowing of Christ. While Adam's disobedience brought sin and death, Christ's obedience brings righteousness and life (<a href="/romans/5-19.htm">Romans 5:19</a>). This typological connection is further explored in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>, where Christ is called the "last Adam," emphasizing His role in bringing spiritual life. The contrast between Adam and Christ highlights the redemptive work of Jesus, who reverses the curse brought by Adam's sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam.htm">Adam</a></b><br>The first man created by God, whose disobedience led to the fall of humanity and the entrance of sin and death into the world.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A prophet and leader in Israel's history, through whom God gave the Law.

With the word &#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221; he highlights a startling fact that remains true despite any objections: death has an unbroken grip on humanity. That connective word keeps us rooted in the flow of thought&#8212;sin came through Adam, and death followed, and nothing in human history up to Moses overturned that reality. We see the same sobering connection in <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a> (&#8220;in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die&#8221;) and in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a> (&#8220;the wages of sin is death,&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Death reigned from Adam until Moses</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Reigned&#8221; pictures death as a monarch exercising complete authority. From the very first grave in <a href="/bsb/genesis/4.htm">Genesis 4</a> to Moses&#8217; own burial in <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/34.htm">Deuteronomy 34</a>, every generation proved sin&#8217;s lethal paycheck.<p>&#8226; The period &#8220;from Adam until Moses&#8221; matters because Moses received the Law (<a href="/bsb/exodus/20.htm">Exodus 20</a>). Before that written standard, death still held sway, proving humanity&#8217;s guilt even without the detailed commandments later given at Sinai (cf. <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Physical death points to spiritual death&#8212;a separation from God that only His grace can reverse (<a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even over those who did not sin in the way that Adam transgressed</b><p>&#8226; Adam broke a specific, spoken command (&#8220;you must not eat,&#8221; <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>). Later generations died even though they never repeated that exact act.<p>&#8226; This shows that death is not merely for copycat violations; it flows from the sinful nature inherited from Adam (<a href="/psalms/51-5.htm">Psalm 51:5</a>; <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Infants, for instance, do not commit conscious acts of rebellion, yet they still die, revealing the pervasive reach of Adam&#8217;s fall (<a href="/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s point: universal death proves universal condemnation, preparing the ground for the universal offer of life in Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He is a pattern of the One to come</b><p>&#8226; Adam functions as a &#8220;type&#8221; or foreshadowing of Christ.

Yet Adam&#8217;s role as a &#8220;pattern&#8221; points forward to Christ, whose single, triumphant act of obedience overthrows death&#8217;s reign and offers eternal life to everyone who trusts Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">After the similitude of Adam's transgression</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, "in direct defiance of divine command."

Adam was the type of Christ, his sin and its effects the type of Christ's death and its effects. No doubt the way in which this point is introduced is, in a mere rhetorical sense, faulty. St. Paul was, however, much above caring for rhetoric. And beside, it must be remembered that he wrote by dictation, and, probably, never revised what the amanuensis had written. This fact has very rightly been insisted on by Dr. Vaughan (Preface to Third Edition, p. 22), "We must picture to ourselves in reading this profound Epistle to the Romans a man full of thought, his hands, perhaps, occupied at the moment in stitching at the tent-cloth, dictating one clause at a time to the obscure Tertius beside him, stopping only to give time for the writing, never looking it over, never, perhaps, hearing it read over, at last taking the style into his hand to add the last few words of affectionate benediction."<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/5-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Nevertheless,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(alla)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
