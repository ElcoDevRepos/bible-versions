In the context of Romans, Paul is addressing both Jewish and Gentile audiences, emphasizing that God is impartial and sovereign over all humanity. This aligns with the Old Testament understanding of God as a just and righteous judge, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a> and <a href="/psalms/9-8.htm">Psalm 9:8</a>.<p><b>&#8220;will repay&#8221;</b><br>The concept of God repaying individuals is rooted in the biblical principle of divine justice. This phrase echoes the Old Testament, particularly <a href="/proverbs/24-12.htm">Proverbs 24:12</a> and <a href="/psalms/62-12.htm">Psalm 62:12</a>, which affirm that God will render to each person according to their actions. It underscores the certainty of divine judgment and accountability, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. The future tense indicates an eschatological perspective, pointing to the final judgment.<p><b>each one</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the universality of God's judgment. It includes every individual, regardless of ethnicity, social status, or religious background. In the context of Romans, Paul is addressing both Jews and Gentiles, making it clear that all are subject to God's righteous judgment. This reflects the biblical teaching that God shows no partiality, as seen in <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>.<p><b>according to his deeds.&#8221;</b><br>The focus on "deeds" highlights the biblical principle that actions are a reflection of one's faith and character. While salvation is by grace through faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>), deeds are evidence of genuine faith (<a href="/james/2-14.htm">James 2:14-26</a>). This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative that emphasizes the importance of living a life that reflects God's righteousness and justice. It also serves as a warning against hypocrisy, as seen in Jesus' teachings in <a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is writing to the believers in Rome, addressing both Jewish and Gentile Christians.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, consisting of a diverse group of believers in Rome, facing issues of unity and understanding of the Gospel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge who will repay each person according to their deeds, emphasizing His justice and righteousness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_day.htm">Judgment Day</a></b><br>The future event when God will judge all people, rewarding or punishing them based on their actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/deeds.htm">Deeds</a></b><br>The actions and behaviors of individuals, which are the basis for God's judgment as mentioned in this verse.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_is_perfect.htm">God's Justice is Perfect</a></b><br>God's judgment is based on His perfect knowledge and justice.

There can be no question that this is the consistent doctrine of Scripture. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/16-27.htm" title="For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm" title="When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:">Matthew 25:31</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.;</span> <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad.">2Corinthians 5:10</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm" title="Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap.">Galatians 6:7</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.;</span> <a href="/ephesians/6-8.htm" title="Knowing that whatever good thing any man does, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.">Ephesians 6:8</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-24.htm" title=" Knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for you serve the Lord Christ.">Colossians 3:24</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-23.htm" title="And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the reins and hearts: and I will give to every one of you according to your works.">Revelation 2:23</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm" title="And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.">Revelation 20:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-12.htm" title="And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.">Revelation 22:12</a>.) How is this to be reconciled with the main theme of the Epistle, the doctrine of justification by <span class= "ital">faith</span>? . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who will render to every man according to his works</span>. This assertion is no contradiction of the main portion of the Epistle as it proceeds, as to justification being not of works; the phrase here being, not on <span class="accented">account of</span> his works, but <span class="accented">according</span> to them. "Nequaquam tamen quid valeant, sed quid illis debeatur pretii pronunciat" (Calvin). The <span class="accented">ground</span> of justification is not here involved. All that is asserted is what is essential to any true conception of God's justice, viz. that he has regard to <span class="accented">what men are</span> in assigning reward or punishment; it is what is given in <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a> as a first principle of faith about God, "that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently seek him." It is further evident from <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>, and still more from all that follows, that all such will be so rewarded, whether before Christ or after his coming, whether knowing him or not knowing him. Nor is the inclusion of the latter inconsistent with the doctrine that salvation is through Christ alone. For the effect of his atonement is represented as retrospective as well as prospective, and as availing virtually for all mankind (cf. <a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15, 18, 20</a>). Hence the narrow doctrine of some divines, who would confine the possibility of salvation to those who have had in some way during life a conscious faith in the atonement, is evidently not the doctrine of St. Paul. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/2-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[God]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8003;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;will repay</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#960;&#959;&#948;&#974;&#963;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Apod&#333;sei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Future Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_591.htm">Strong's 591: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and didomi; to give away, i.e. Up, over, back, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">each one</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7953;&#954;&#940;&#963;&#964;&#8179;</span> <span class="translit">(hekast&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1538.htm">Strong's 1538: </a> </span><span class="str2">Each (of more than two), every one.
