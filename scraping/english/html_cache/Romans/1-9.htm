This reflects the biblical theme of worshiping God "in spirit and truth" (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>). The phrase underscores the sincerity and authenticity of Paul's ministry, aligning with the Old Testament prophets who served God with their whole heart (<a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>).<p><b>in preaching the gospel of His Son</b><br>Paul's mission is centered on the proclamation of the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ. This phrase underscores the centrality of Christ in Paul's message, fulfilling the prophecies of a coming Messiah (Isaiah 53). The "gospel of His Son" indicates the divine nature of Jesus, affirming His role as the Son of God, a key tenet of Christian faith. Paul's dedication to this mission is evident throughout his epistles, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-16.htm">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>, where he states, "Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!"<p><b>is my witness</b><br>Paul calls upon God as his witness, a solemn declaration of truthfulness and integrity. This reflects the cultural and historical context of the time, where oaths and witnesses were crucial in affirming one's honesty (<a href="/hebrews/6-16.htm">Hebrews 6:16</a>). By invoking God as his witness, Paul assures the Roman believers of his genuine concern and commitment to them, even though he has not yet visited them.<p><b>how constantly I remember you</b><br>Paul's constant remembrance of the Roman believers in his prayers demonstrates his pastoral heart and deep love for the church. This aligns with his practice of praying for all the churches he established or hoped to visit, as seen in his letters to the Corinthians (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-4.htm">1 Corinthians 1:4</a>) and Ephesians (<a href="/ephesians/1-16.htm">Ephesians 1:16</a>).

Here it is somewhat metaphorical: "Whom I serve, not so much with outward acts as with the ritual of the spirit."<p><span class= "bld">With my spirit.</span>--"Spirit" is with St. Paul the highest part or faculty in the nature of man. It is the seat of his higher consciousness--the organ by which he communicates with God. "Certainly man is of kin to the beasts by his body; and if he be not of kin to God by his spirit, he is a base and ignoble creature." (Bacon, <span class= "ital">Essay on Atheism.</span>) Of itself the "spirit" of man is neutral. When brought into contact with the Spirit of God, it is capable of a truly religious life; but apart from this influence, it is apt to fall under the dominion of the "flesh"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> of those evil appetites and desires to which man is exposed by his physical organisation.<p><span class= "bld">In the gospel of his Son.</span>--The sphere to which the Apostle feels himself called, and in which this heart-worship of his finds its field of operation, is the defence and preaching, &c., of the gospel.<p>(9-11) It is the constant subject of the Apostle's prayers that he may succeed in making his way to Rome; so anxious is he to open his heart to that Church in personal- apostolic intercourse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you in my prayers</span>.
