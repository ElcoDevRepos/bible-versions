Adam's trespass brought sin and death into the world (Genesis 3), while the gift through Christ brings grace and life. The concept of a "gift" emphasizes the unearned and generous nature of God's grace, contrasting with the deserved consequences of sin.<p><b>For if the many died by the trespass of the one man,</b><br>Adam's sin had a universal impact, introducing death to all humanity (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>). This reflects the biblical principle of federal headship, where Adam acted as a representative for all mankind. The "many" refers to all who are affected by sin, highlighting the pervasive nature of the fall.<p><b>how much more did God&#8217;s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the superiority and abundance of Christ's redemptive work over Adam's sin. Jesus, often referred to as the "second Adam" (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>), reverses the curse through His sacrificial death and resurrection. The "grace of the one man, Jesus Christ" underscores the personal and intentional act of salvation.<p><b>abound to the many!</b><br>The term "abound" indicates the overflowing and superabundant nature of God's grace. While Adam's sin brought death to many, Christ's gift brings life and righteousness to all who believe (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).

For if by the trespass of the one the many died</span> (not, be <span class="accented">dead, as</span> in the Authorized Version. Observe also the articles before "one" and "many"), <span class="cmt_word">much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded unto the many. And not as through one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was of one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">unto condemnation, but the free gift is of</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">many offences unto justification</span>. <span class="cmt_word">For if by the offence of the one death reigned through the one, much more they which receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ</span>. The purport of these verses is (while keeping up the view of condemnation and justification being both derived to all from one) to show how the effects of the latter for good far transcend those of the former for evil. It is not easy, however, to explain the apostle's exact intention in the contrasts which he draws. He seems to have written, after his manner, full of ideas which he did not linger to arrange in clear form. In ver. 15 the contrast between "trespass" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) and "free gift" (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) seems to be the leading idea. The suggesting thought seems to be - If (as has been shown) one man's trespass had such far-reaching effects, much more must the <span class="accented">grace of God</span> (displayed also in One) have no less far-reaching effects. God's grace must be more powerful than man's trespass. And it is here asserted that it was so. The <span class="accented">much more</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is best taken (as it must be in ver. 17) in a <span class="accented">logical</span>, not a <span class="accented">quantitative</span> sense; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as enforcing the conclusion, not as intensifying the verb "abounded." So far the effects are not distinctly contrasted in respect to their <span class="accented">extent</span>; all that is implied in this verse is that both reach <span class="accented">to the many</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the whole human race collectively; unless, indeed, the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> implies excess of effect. It is to be observed that the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> does not here mean, as is usual in classical Greek, <span class="accented">the greater part</span>, but the <span class="accented">multitude</span>, mankind being regarded collectively. It depends, however, on the writer's mental horizon whether the phrase, taken by itself, is to be understood as comprehending <span class="accented">all</span>. The consideration is of importance in the case before us. On the one hand, it may be contended that, in the first clause of the verse, "the many" must mean <span class="accented">all</span>, for that undoubtedly all died (cf. ver. 12, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>), and that consequently <span class="accented">all</span> must be intended also in the second clause. So also in ver. 19, where it is said that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>. And it may be said, further, that the drift of the whole argument requires the view of the effects of the re- demption being at least coextensive with the effects of the fall. But, on the other hand, it is argued that St. Paul would not have used the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> in vers. 15 and 19 instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> as in vers. 12 and 18, unless he had intended some difference of meaning, and that he varied his expression in order to avoid the necessary inference that all would be saved in fact. Certainly he teaches that the redemption is <span class="accented">available</span> and <span class="accented">intended</span> for all, as in ver. 18 where it is said to be <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>; and this, it may be said, is enough to satisfy the view of its effects (i<span class="accented">.e.</span> in purpose and potentially) being coextensive with the effects of the fall But it does not seem to follow that man's resistance to grace might not come in as a bar to the entire fulfilment of the Divine purpose; and hence these passages cannot be pressed as conclusive for the doctrine of universal final salvation. But in vers. 16, 17 (to be taken together, ver. 16 being introduced by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, so as to suggest a new idea, and ver. 17 being connected with it by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>) the <span class="accented">extent</span> to which grace thus abounded, so as to <span class="accented">transcend</span> the effects of the original transgression, is distinctly set forth. The thought of these verses may, perhaps, be expressed otherwise, thus: The one trespass of the one original transgressor did indeed render all mankind liable to condemnation; but the free gift in Christ annulled the effect, not only of that one trespass, but also of all subsequent trespasses of mankind; an immense debt, accumulating through the ages of human history, in addition to the original debt, was by that one free grant obliterated. And further, while the original trespass introduced a temporary reign of <span class="accented">death</span>, the free gift of righteousness introduced <span class="accented">life</span>, in which the partakers of the gift themselves - triumphant over Death, who reigned before - shall reign; and, as in ver. 15 the idea was that God's grace must be more powerful than man's sin, so here it is implied that life in Christ must be more powerful than death in Adam. <span class="accented">Life</span> means here (as elsewhere when the life in Christ is spoken of) more than the present life in the flesh - more than the life breathed into. man when he first "became (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>) a living soul" (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>). It means the higher life imparted by "the last Adam," who "became a quickening Spirit" (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>); eternal life with God, in the life of Christ risen, swallowing up mortality (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-4.htm">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>; cf. also <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>). Thus the "free gift" not only reverses the far-reaching effects of the original transgression, but even transcends what is intimated in Genesis as given to man in Paradise before his fall. The next two verses (18, 19), introduced by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, are a summing up of what has been already said or implied. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/5-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#955;&#955;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(All&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
