The term "circumcised" refers to the Jewish people, who were given the covenant of circumcision as a sign of their unique relationship with God (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). Jesus' ministry was primarily among the Jews, fulfilling the prophecies and promises made to them. His servanthood is a fulfillment of <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which describes the Messiah as a suffering servant. This also reflects Jesus' own words in <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>, where He states that He came not to be served, but to serve.<p><b>on behalf of God&#8217;s truth</b><br>Christ's mission was to reveal and uphold God's truth, which is consistent with the Old Testament prophecies and the law given to Israel. This truth encompasses God's faithfulness and the fulfillment of His promises. Jesus' life and teachings were a testament to God's unchanging nature and His plan for salvation. In <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, Jesus declares Himself as "the way, the truth, and the life," underscoring His role in manifesting divine truth.<p><b>to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs</b><br>The patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;received promises from God regarding their descendants and the blessing of all nations through them (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>, <a href="/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3-4</a>, <a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-14</a>). Jesus' coming confirms these promises, as He is the fulfillment of the Abrahamic covenant. <a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a> identifies Christ as the "seed" through whom these promises are realized.

As it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy Name. This quotation from <a href="/psalms/18-49.htm">Psalm 18:49</a> or <a href="/2_samuel/22-50.htm">2 Samuel 22:50</a>, with those that follow, are for scriptural confirmation of God's purpose, which has just been spoken of, to include the Gentiles in his covenanted mercies to Israel, so that they too might glorify him. St. Paul, after a manner usual with him; follows cut a thought suggested in the course of his argument, so as to interrupt the latter for a while, but to return to it in ver. 13. All, in fact, from the beginning of ver. 8 to the end of ver. 12, is parenthetical, suggested by "even as Christ received you,." at the end of ver. 7. All this, it may be observed, is confirmatory of Pauline authorship. The first quotation introduces David, the theocratic king, confessing and praising God, not apart from the Gentiles, but among them. The second, from <a href="/deuteronomy/32-43.htm">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>, calls on the Gentiles themselves to join in Israel's rejoicing; the third, from <a href="/psalms/117-1.htm">Psalm 117:1</a>, does the same; the last, from <a href="/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>, foretells definitely the reign of the Messiah over Gentiles as well as Jews, and the hope also of the Gentiles in him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/15-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
