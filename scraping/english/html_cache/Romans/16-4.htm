In the early church, believers often faced persecution, and risking one's life for the sake of the Gospel was a real possibility. The specific incident where they risked their lives is not detailed in Scripture, but it underscores their deep commitment to Paul and the mission of spreading Christianity. This act of bravery can be compared to other biblical figures who risked their lives for God's purposes, such as Esther (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>) and Daniel (<a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10-23</a>). It also reflects the teaching of Jesus in <a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>, where He speaks of the greatest love being to lay down one's life for friends.<p><b>Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them.</b><br>This phrase indicates the widespread impact of Priscilla and Aquila's ministry. Their work was not limited to assisting Paul but extended to supporting the broader mission to the Gentiles. The early church was expanding rapidly among Gentile populations, and Priscilla and Aquila played a significant role in this movement. Their influence and support were felt across various regions, as they were known to have hosted a church in their home (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>) and were involved in teaching and discipling others, such as Apollos (<a href="/acts/18-24.htm">Acts 18:24-26</a>). This gratitude from the Gentile churches highlights the interconnectedness of the early Christian communities and the importance of collaboration in ministry. It also reflects the fulfillment of the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) as the Gospel spread beyond Jewish communities to the Gentile world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priscilla_and_aquila.htm">Priscilla and Aquila</a></b><br>A married couple who were tentmakers by trade and close companions of Paul.

Luke records their close partnership with Paul in Corinth and Ephesus (<a href="/acts/18-2.htm">Acts 18:2-3, 18</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>). At some moment&#8212;very possibly during the Ephesian riot (<a href="/acts/19-23.htm">Acts 19:23-41</a>)&#8212;they stepped between Paul and danger.<p>&#8211; Scripture consistently honors those who jeopardize their safety for the gospel: Epaphroditus &#8220;risked his life&#8221; for Christ&#8217;s work (<a href="/philippians/2-30.htm">Philippians 2:30</a>), and Jesus defines love as laying down one&#8217;s life for friends (<a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>).<p>&#8211; Their courage shows that ministry is often costly; yet believers trust the Lord who &#8220;delivers us from deadly peril&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-10.htm">2 Corinthians 1:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Not only I</b><p>&#8211; Paul does not keep the credit to himself. Though he personally owes them much, he refuses to make their sacrifice a private matter (<a href="/philemon/1-19.htm">Philemon 1:19</a>).<p>&#8211; The phrase reminds us that gratefulness should never be a one-on-one secret; blessings ripple out into the wider body (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-15.htm">2 Corinthians 4:15</a>).<p>&#8211; In a climate of persecution, public acknowledgment could put Prisca and Aquila at further risk, yet Paul still speaks up&#8212;teaching us to honor faithful servants openly (<a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but all the churches of the Gentiles</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;All&#8221; points to the wide influence of this couple.

Their home became a launchpad for gospel advance (<a href="/acts/19-1.htm">Acts 19:1-10</a>).<p>&#8211; The wording shows that every congregation, even those they never visited, recognized the blessing that flowed through their ministry&#8212;just as Macedonian and Achaian believers later contributed to Jerusalem saints they had never met (<a href="/romans/15-26.htm">Romans 15:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are grateful to them.</b><p>&#8211; Gratitude is more than polite words; it is the church&#8217;s duty (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12-13</a>).

Paul refuses to keep that heroism private: he publicly thanks them, then broadens the thanks to every Gentile church touched by their ministry. <a href="/romans/16-4.htm">Romans 16:4</a> therefore teaches that courageous service advances the gospel, and that the whole body of Christ should recognize, honor, and express heartfelt gratitude for such sacrificial partners in the faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Laid down their own necks.</span>--Whether this expression is to be taken literally or figuratively we do not know, neither can we do more than guess at the event to which it refers.
