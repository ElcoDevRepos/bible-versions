He is likely the same Rufus mentioned in <a href="/mark/15-21.htm">Mark 15:21</a>, where Simon of Cyrene, who carried Jesus' cross, is identified as the father of Alexander and Rufus. This connection suggests that Rufus was part of a family that had a significant encounter with Jesus, which may have influenced their faith and standing in the early church. The mention of Rufus in both Mark and Romans indicates his prominence and possibly his leadership within the Christian community.<p><b>Chosen in the Lord</b><br>The phrase "chosen in the Lord" highlights the doctrine of election, a key theological concept in Paul's writings. It emphasizes that Rufus's position in the faith is not by chance but by divine selection. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's sovereign choice, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>, where believers are described as chosen before the foundation of the world. This choice is not based on human merit but on God's grace and purpose.<p><b>And his mother</b><br>Rufus's mother is not named, but her mention signifies her importance in the early church. In a patriarchal society, the acknowledgment of a woman in this context underscores her significant role and influence. She may have been a spiritual leader or a provider of hospitality, which was crucial for the spread of the gospel and the support of itinerant preachers like Paul.<p><b>Who has been a mother to me as well</b><br>Paul's reference to Rufus's mother as a mother to him indicates a deep personal relationship. This suggests that she provided care, support, and perhaps guidance to Paul, akin to a maternal figure. Such relationships were vital in the early church, where believers formed close-knit communities that transcended biological family ties. This reflects the broader Christian teaching of the church as a family, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/12-49.htm">Matthew 12:49-50</a>, where Jesus speaks of those who do the will of God as his family.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rufus.htm">Rufus</a></b><br>Mentioned as "chosen in the Lord," Rufus is likely a prominent member of the early Christian community.
