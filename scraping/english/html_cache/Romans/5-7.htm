In biblical terms, a "righteous man" is one who adheres to the law and moral codes. The context here suggests that even those who are morally upright do not often inspire others to sacrifice their lives for them. This reflects the human tendency to prioritize self-preservation. The concept of righteousness is central in the Old Testament, where figures like Noah and Job are described as righteous. However, the rarity of such sacrificial acts underscores the extraordinary nature of Christ's sacrifice, which Paul is setting up in contrast.<p><b>though for a good man</b><br>The distinction between a "righteous man" and a "good man" is subtle but significant. A "good man" implies not only adherence to moral codes but also a benevolent and kind nature. In the cultural context of the time, a "good man" might be someone who actively benefits others, thus potentially inspiring greater loyalty and sacrifice. This distinction can be seen in the way Jesus describes the Good Samaritan, who goes beyond the call of duty to help another.<p><b>someone might possibly dare to die</b><br>This phrase suggests that while it is uncommon, there is a possibility that someone might choose to die for a "good man." The use of "dare" implies courage and a conscious decision to face danger or death. This reflects the highest form of human love and loyalty, which is rare and exceptional. The idea of daring to die for another is echoed in <a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>, where Jesus states, "Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one&#8217;s life for one&#8217;s friends." This sets the stage for understanding the magnitude of Christ's sacrifice, which goes beyond human examples of love and sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the early Christian community in Rome, composed of both Jewish and Gentile believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/righteous_man.htm">Righteous Man</a></b><br>A person who is morally upright and adheres to the law, yet not necessarily inspiring personal affection or sacrifice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/good_man.htm">Good Man</a></b><br>A person who is not only righteous but also kind and benevolent, potentially inspiring others to sacrifice for them.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ's_sacrifice.htm">Christ's Sacrifice</a></b><br>The ultimate event of selfless love, where Jesus Christ died for humanity, surpassing the examples of dying for a righteous or good man.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_sacrificial_love.htm">Understanding Sacrificial Love</a></b><br>The rarity of self-sacrifice for a righteous or good person highlights the extraordinary nature of Christ's love for sinners.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ's_unique_sacrifice.htm">Christ's Unique Sacrifice</a></b><br>Jesus' willingness to die for the ungodly surpasses human examples of sacrifice, demonstrating divine love and grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/inspiration_for_believers.htm">Inspiration for Believers</a></b><br>Believers are called to emulate Christ's sacrificial love in their relationships, prioritizing others' needs above their own.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/evaluating_our_love.htm">Evaluating Our Love</a></b><br>Reflect on whether our love for others is conditional or mirrors the unconditional love of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_in_evangelism.htm">Encouragement in Evangelism</a></b><br>Understanding the depth of Christ's sacrifice should motivate believers to share the gospel with others, emphasizing God's love for all.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_5_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 5:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_5_7_Rare_selfless_sacrifice.htm">How does Romans 5:7 illustrate the rarity of selfless sacrifice for others?

Think of Nicodemus or Cornelius: admired, yet no record of someone volunteering to die in their place.<p>&#8226; Scripture confirms the rarity of true self-sacrifice. In <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a> the Preacher notes, &#8220;Surely there is no righteous man on earth who does good and never sins,&#8221; underscoring why few consider another worthy of such a cost.<p>&#8226; Jesus echoes this reality: &#8220;Greater love has no one than this: that he lay down his life for his friends&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>). He calls it &#8220;greater&#8221; because it is scarce.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s warriors refusing to let him risk his life in battle (<a href="/2_samuel/18-3.htm">2 Samuel 18:3</a>) illustrate the point: even for a beloved king, dying in his place felt excessive.<p>The line exposes the limitation of human love and sets the stage for the contrast with God&#8217;s love that follows in verse 8.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die</b><p>&#8211; The wording shifts from &#8220;righteous&#8221; to &#8220;good.&#8221; A good person not only does what is right but also shows warmth and kindness that draw affection.<p>&#8226; Barnabas is called &#8220;a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith&#8221; (<a href="/acts/11-24.htm">Acts 11:24</a>). One could imagine believers in Antioch feeling strong personal attachment to him.<p>&#8226; Jonathan endangered himself for David (<a href="/bsb/1_samuel/20.htm">1 Samuel 20</a>); his sacrificial loyalty came from deep friendship with a &#8220;good&#8221; man whose heart thrilled him.<p>&#8226; Still, Paul keeps the bar low&#8212;&#8220;might possibly dare.&#8221; Humanity&#8217;s best moments of bravery remain exceptions. Even noble examples like Esther&#8217;s willingness to risk death (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>) stand out precisely because they are not the norm.<p>&#8226; The clause prepares readers to marvel at the next verse: if dying for a good person is only a remote possibility, what kind of love is it that dies for enemies and sinners?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/5-7.htm">Romans 5:7</a> spotlights the scarcity of genuine self-sacrifice. People rarely die for the merely righteous, and only on rare occasions for someone exceptionally good. The verse magnifies the limited reach of human love, paving the way for verse 8, where God&#8217;s love far surpasses human patterns: &#8220;But God proves His love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us&#8221;.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7-8) What makes the sacrifice of Christ so paradoxical is that it was undergone for <span class= "ital">sinners.</span> Even for a righteous man it is rare enough to find another who will be ready to lay down his life. Yet some such persons there are. The one thing which is most extraordinary in the death of Christ, and which most tends to throw into relief the love of God as displayed in it, is that He died for men as sinners, and at the very moment when they were sinning all around Him.<p>(7) <span class= "bld">Yet peradventure.</span>--The true reading is, undoubtedly, <span class= "ital">for peradventure.</span><p><span class= "bld">For a good man.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">for the good </span>(<span class= "ital">man</span>)<span class= "ital">, i.e.,</span> for the good man in question, the righteous man mentioned above. It would be possible to take the phrase "for the good" as neuter rather than masculine, and to understand by it "in a good cause." It would be possible also to give to the word translated "good" the special meaning of "benefactor"--"a man might be found to die for his benefactor." But if this had been intended, it might have been more clearly expressed, and upon the whole it seems best to take the passage as it is taken in the English version. There is a slight distinction in the Greek, as in English, between the words translated "righteous" and "good." To be "righteous" is to direct the will in obedience to an external standard; to be "good" is to have a natural goodness, especially kindness or benevolence of disposition. But this distinction is not insisted upon here. The two words are used almost convertibly.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/5-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[It is] rare</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#972;&#955;&#953;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(molis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3433.htm">Strong's 3433: </a> </span><span class="str2">With difficulty, hardly, scarcely.
