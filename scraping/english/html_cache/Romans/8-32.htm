In biblical context, the concept of not sparing is reminiscent of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac (Genesis 22), which is a type of Christ. Just as Abraham was willing to give up his son, God actually gave His Son, demonstrating His profound love and commitment to humanity's redemption. This act fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah being a sacrificial offering (<a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>).<p><b>but gave Him up for us all</b><br>The giving up of Jesus refers to His crucifixion, a central event in Christian theology. Historically, this took place in Jerusalem under Roman governance, highlighting the intersection of Jewish and Roman cultures. The phrase "for us all" underscores the universality of Christ's sacrifice, aligning with passages like <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, which affirm that Jesus died for the sins of the entire world, not just a select group. This act of giving is the ultimate expression of grace and love.<p><b>how will He not also, along with Him,</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the certainty of God's continued generosity. If God has already given the greatest gift&#8212;His Son&#8212;then it follows logically that He will provide for lesser needs. The phrase "along with Him" suggests that all blessings come through Christ, who is the mediator of God's grace. This aligns with <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>, which speaks of believers being blessed with every spiritual blessing in Christ.<p><b>freely give us all things?</b><br>The promise of "all things" refers to the comprehensive nature of God's provision, both spiritual and material. This echoes <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>, where Jesus assures that seeking God's kingdom will result in all necessary things being added to believers. The term "freely" highlights the grace-based nature of God's gifts, contrasting with the works-based righteousness found in other religious systems. This assurance is rooted in the security of the believer's relationship with God through Christ, as seen in the broader context of <a href="/romans/8.htm">Romans 8</a>, which speaks of the believer's victory and assurance in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The one who did not spare His own Son, demonstrating His immense love and generosity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Referred to as "His own Son," who was given up for the sake of humanity's salvation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>The recipients of God's grace and the ones for whom Christ was given.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cross.htm">The Cross</a></b><br>The event where Jesus was given up, symbolizing the ultimate sacrifice and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostle_paul.htm">The Apostle Paul</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, who wrote this letter to the believers in Rome to explain the gospel and its implications.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_ultimate_sacrifice.htm">God's Ultimate Sacrifice</a></b><br>Reflect on the magnitude of God's love in not sparing His own Son.
