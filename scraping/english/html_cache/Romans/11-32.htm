The term "consigned" suggests a deliberate act of God allowing humanity to experience the consequences of their sinful nature. This is not to imply that God causes sin, but rather that He permits human free will to operate within the bounds of a fallen world. The historical context of this passage is Paul's letter to the Romans, addressing both Jewish and Gentile believers, emphasizing that all are equally in need of salvation. Theologically, this aligns with the doctrine of original sin, which traces humanity's disobedience back to Adam and Eve in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.<p><b>so that He may have mercy on everyone</b><br>This phrase highlights God's ultimate purpose of extending mercy. The use of "everyone" indicates the inclusivity of God's plan of salvation, which is available to both Jews and Gentiles. This is consistent with the message of <a href="/romans/10-12.htm">Romans 10:12-13</a>, where Paul states, "For there is no difference between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on Him, for 'Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.'" Theologically, this reflects the New Covenant established through Jesus Christ, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of salvation reaching "to the ends of the earth." The mercy of God is a central theme throughout Scripture, culminating in the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus, who embodies God's grace and redemption for all humanity.<div

So, it may be said, must the verb he understood where St. Paul elsewhere uses it with a similar reference in <a href="/galatians/3-22.htm">Galatians 3:22</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f74;</span> being there the nominative to the verb. But <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> being the nominative here, the more obvious meaning seems to be that the shutting up was God's doing. Some, understanding it so, would soften the expression by explaining that God allowed them to become so shut up. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (Diodorus), But we need not shrink from the plain meaning of the expression, viz. that it was God's own act. He is not thus represented as plunging men into inevitable infidelity, having given them no choice. As in the case of the <span class="accented">hardening</span> spoken of' above, his dealings are <span class="accented">judicial</span>; the state into which. they are now by him shut up has not been undeserved. And, further, his ultimate purpose is here distinctly declared to be one of mercy. The way in which the apostle regards such present judicial dealing as conducive to final mercy appears to be such as this. It is the doctrine of the whole Epistle that salvation is to be attained by man's renouncing his own imagined righteousness, and submitting himself to the righteousness of God. It conduces to this end that his <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> should have its course and consequences; so that, conscience being at length awakened, he may long for deliverance from his hopeless state, and appreciate the offered salvation (see ch. 7.). So the Gentile world was long shut up in its self-induced, but also judicial, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>); that, "the wrath of God" being at length revealed to it from heaven, the "righteousness of God" might also be revealed to it and laid hold cf. In like manner God deals now with the Jews, who still persist in going about to establish their own righteousness instead of submitting themselves to the righteousness of God. He shuts them up for the present in their <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, to the end that at length, after their long judgment, and stirred up by the fulness of the Gentiles coming in, they may feel their need, and accept salvation. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in the concluding clause seems to mean generally all mankind, Jews as well as Gentiles; and <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> (as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> was understood above with respect to "all Israel," as suggested by the context and the general drift of the chapter) God's embracing all races of mankind at last in the arms of his mercy by calling them into the Church. Thus the latter expression is not in itself adducible in support of the doctrine of universalism. Certainly the prospect of a universal triumph of the gospel before the end rises here before the apostle in prophetic vision; and it may be that it carries with it to his mind further glories of eternal salvation for all, casting their rays backward over all past ages, so as to inspire an unbounded hope. Such a hope, which seems elsewhere intimated (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24-29</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9, 10, 20-23</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a>, would justify the glowing rhapsody of admiration and thanksgiving that follows more fully than if we supposed the apostle to contemplate still the eternal perdition of the multitudes who in all the ages have not on earth found mercy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/11-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
