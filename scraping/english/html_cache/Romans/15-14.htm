This phrase highlights Paul's pastoral heart and his role as an apostle, emphasizing his authority and personal investment in the spiritual well-being of the church. His conviction is not based on hearsay but on a thorough understanding of their faith and character.<p><b>my brothers</b><br>The term "brothers" signifies a familial relationship among believers, emphasizing unity and equality within the body of Christ. This reflects the early Christian understanding of the church as a family, transcending ethnic and social boundaries. It also underscores the mutual respect and affection Paul has for the Roman Christians, despite not having founded the church in Rome himself.<p><b>that you yourselves are full of goodness</b><br>Paul acknowledges the moral and ethical character of the Roman believers. "Goodness" here refers to a virtue that is a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>) and is indicative of a life transformed by the gospel. This goodness is not inherent but is a result of their relationship with Christ, reflecting the transformative power of the Holy Spirit in their lives.<p><b>brimming with knowledge</b><br>The Roman Christians are recognized for their understanding of Christian doctrine and the teachings of Jesus. This knowledge is not merely intellectual but is deeply rooted in their faith and practice. It suggests that they have been well-taught and are capable of discerning truth from error, a crucial aspect of maintaining doctrinal purity in the early church.<p><b>and able to instruct one another</b><br>Paul affirms their capability to teach and admonish each other, highlighting the importance of mutual edification within the church. This reflects the New Testament model of discipleship, where believers are encouraged to build each other up in love and truth (<a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15-16</a>).

Paul is not flattering; he is testifying to what he knows God has genuinely produced in this church. That same settled persuasion undergirds his appeals throughout Romans and mirrors his statement to Timothy: &#8220;I know whom I have believed&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/1-12.htm">2 Timothy 1:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>my brothers</b><p>By calling them &#8220;brothers,&#8221; Paul reminds the Roman believers&#8212;and us&#8212;that the ground at the foot of the cross is level (<a href="/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>). He writes as an apostle, but he speaks as family.

This counters the idea that only clergy instruct; the whole body ministers to itself under Christ the Head.

The greetings at the end are naturally introduced by a few words of explanation as to the way in which the more general exhortations that preceded are to be received by the Roman Christians, and a somewhat longer statement on the part of the Apostle of his own relations to the Church at Rome. This might seem to be the more necessary as the Church was not one of his own founding, and he might seem to be both going out of his way and acting in contradiction to his own principles in writing to them at all.<p>I write thus to you though you do not really need all these exhortations.

It is St. Paul's courteous as well as kindly way to compliment those to whom he writes on what he believes to be good in them, and to cling to a good opinion of them, even where he has some misgivings, or has had reason to find fault (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-4.htm">1 Corinthians 1:4</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-7.htm">2 Corinthians 1:7</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-1.htm">2 Corinthians 3:1</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; 7:3, <span class="accented">seq</span>.).
