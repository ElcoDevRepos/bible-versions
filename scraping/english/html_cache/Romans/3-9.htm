In the context of Romans, Paul has been discussing the universal nature of sin and the inability of both Jews and Gentiles to achieve righteousness through their own efforts. This question invites reflection on the human condition and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>Are we any better?</b><br>Paul addresses the potential misconception that Jews might have a moral or spiritual advantage over Gentiles due to their possession of the Law. This question challenges any sense of superiority, emphasizing that all humanity is equally in need of salvation. It reflects the biblical theme of humility and the recognition that no group is inherently more righteous than another.<p><b>Not at all.</b><br>This emphatic denial underscores the universality of sin. Paul is clear that neither Jews nor Gentiles have an inherent advantage when it comes to righteousness. This statement aligns with the biblical teaching that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>). It reinforces the idea that salvation is not based on ethnic or cultural identity but on faith in Jesus Christ.<p><b>For we have already made the charge</b><br>Paul refers to his previous arguments in the letter, where he systematically demonstrated that both Jews and Gentiles are guilty before God. This charge is a legal term, indicating a formal accusation. It highlights the apostolic authority with which Paul speaks and the seriousness of the indictment against humanity.<p><b>that Jews and Greeks alike</b><br>This phrase encompasses all of humanity, as "Jews" represent those under the Law and "Greeks" symbolize the Gentile world. In the cultural context of the time, these two groups covered the known world, emphasizing the comprehensive nature of Paul's message. It reflects the biblical theme of unity in diversity, where all people are equal before God.<p><b>are all under sin.</b><br>This final phrase captures the essence of Paul's argument: sin is a universal condition affecting every individual. The concept of being "under sin" suggests bondage and the inability to free oneself through personal effort. This aligns with the biblical narrative of the fall in Genesis and the need for a Savior. It points to the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who offers liberation from sin's power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, addressing both Jewish and Gentile believers in Rome.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jews.htm">Jews</a></b><br>The ethnic and religious group who received the Law and the Prophets, often seen as God's chosen people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/greeks.htm">Greeks (Gentiles)</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people, representing the broader pagan world in the context of the New Testament.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rome.htm">Rome</a></b><br>The city where the recipients of the letter resided, a diverse and influential center of the ancient world.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin.htm">Sin</a></b><br>The universal condition of humanity's rebellion against God, which Paul argues affects both Jews and Gentiles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/universal_sinfulness.htm">Universal Sinfulness</a></b><br>Paul emphasizes that both Jews and Gentiles are equally under sin.

The form of the Greek verb is peculiar. It seems upon the whole best to take it as middle for active, which would be apparently unexampled, but is tenable as a question of language, and seems to be compelled by the context.

It also affords an example of the corruptions in the text of the Old Testament to which this practice gave rise. The whole passage as it stands here is found in some manuscripts of the LXX. as part of Psalms 14, whence it has been copied not only into the Vulgate but also our own Prayer Book, which will be seen to differ from the Bible version.<p>The quotations have different degrees of appositeness, so far as they may be considered in the modern sense as probative rather than illustrative. The first, from Psalms 14, is couched in such general terms as to be directly in point; the second and third, from Psalms 5, 140, are aimed specially against the oppressors of the Psalmist; and so, too, the fourth, from Psalms 10, but in a more general and abstract form; that from Isaiah indicates the moral degradation among the prophet's contemporaries that had led to the Captivity; while the last, from Psalms 36, is an expression applied, not to all men, but particularly to the wicked.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-20.</span> - (3) <span class="accented">The testimony of the Old Testament to human sinfulness.</span> Objections having been thus raised and met, the apostle now confirms his position, that all mankind, Jew as well as Gentile, are under sin, by adducing the Scriptures of the Jews themselves. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What then? are we better than they?

For there is nothing in the context to suggest the Gentiles as the speakers, nor does what follow suit the supposition. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The main question is as to the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>, which occurs here only in the New Testament, and has, therefore, to be interpreted from consideration of the sense of which the verb is capable, and the probable drift of the argument. Some have taken it as a passive verb, with the meaning, "Are we surpassed?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> are we Jews in <span class="accented">worse</span> case than the Gentiles on account of our greater privileges? The active verb, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, in the sense of "to excel," being both transitive and intransitive, its passive may be used in the same sense. An instance quoted in commentaries is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (Plut., 'Mor.,'), "cum Jove minores non sint." So the recent Revisers, though dissented from by the American Committee. The strong objection to this interpretation is that there has been nothing so far even to suggest any <span class="accented">superiority</span> of the Gentile to the Jew, and that what follows does not bear upon any such idea. Thus to interpret would be to sacrifice the sense to supposed grammatical exigence, which, after all, is uncertain. Taking, then, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> as the middle voice, we have two interpretations before us; either, with Meyer, to render, <span class="accented">Do we put forward</span> (anything) <span class="accented">in our defence? - which</span> he maintains (though not conclusively) to be the only proper sense of the middle verb - or (as in the Authorized Version), <span class="accented">Are we</span> better (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in better ease) <span class="accented">than they?</span> This rendering, though it gives essentially the same sense as if <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> (intransitive) had been written, is commended by its suitableness to the course of argument, and the middle voice may, perhaps, he accounted for as denoting the Jews' supposed claim of superiority for themselves. Thus the connection of thought is plain. The conclusion of ch. 2. had left the Jews on the same footing with the Gentiles before God in respect of sinfulness. But then objections had been raised on the ground of the acknowledged privileges of the chosen people; and such objections have been met. The apostle now sums up the result: What, then, is the state of the case? Have we any advantage to allege? No, not at all in the sense intended; the previous argument stands; and he proceeds to confine his position from the testimony of the Old Testament itself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/3-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">What</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Ti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
