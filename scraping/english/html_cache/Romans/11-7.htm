In <a href="/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a>, Paul addresses the issue of Israel's unbelief and God's sovereign plan. The question serves as a transition to summarize the argument about Israel's spiritual state and God's redemptive purpose.<p><b>What Israel was seeking, it failed to obtain,</b><br>Israel sought righteousness and a right standing with God through the law and their own efforts (<a href="/romans/9-31.htm">Romans 9:31-32</a>). Despite their zeal for God, they missed the righteousness that comes by faith in Christ (<a href="/romans/10-3.htm">Romans 10:3-4</a>). This failure is not due to a lack of effort but a misunderstanding of how righteousness is attained. The historical context of Israel's pursuit of the law highlights their reliance on works rather than faith, which Paul contrasts with the righteousness that comes through faith in Jesus.<p><b>but the elect did.</b><br>The "elect" refers to those chosen by God, both Jews and Gentiles, who have obtained righteousness through faith in Christ. This concept of election is rooted in God's sovereign choice and grace, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29-30</a>. The elect are those who respond to God's call and are justified by faith, fulfilling God's promise to Abraham that he would be the father of many nations (<a href="/genesis/17-4.htm">Genesis 17:4-5</a>).<p><b>The others were hardened,</b><br>The hardening of the others refers to those in Israel who rejected the gospel. This hardening is both a judicial act of God and a result of their own unbelief (<a href="/romans/9-18.htm">Romans 9:18, 11</a>:25). It echoes the hardening of Pharaoh's heart in Exodus, where God's purposes are accomplished through human resistance. This hardening serves a redemptive purpose, allowing the gospel to go to the Gentiles and ultimately leading to Israel's future restoration (<a href="/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11-12, 26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the nation of Israel, God's chosen people, who were seeking righteousness through the law but failed to obtain it.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_elect.htm">The Elect</a></b><br>Those chosen by God to receive His grace and salvation, often understood as believers in Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_others.htm">The Others</a></b><br>Refers to those within Israel who were not part of the elect and were thus hardened in their unbelief.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Romans, addressing both Jewish and Gentile believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hardening.htm">The Hardening</a></b><br>A spiritual condition where individuals are unable to perceive or accept the truth of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_election.htm">Understanding Election</a></b><br>Recognize that God's election is based on His sovereign will and grace, not human effort or merit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_hardening.htm">The Danger of Hardening</a></b><br>Be aware of the spiritual danger of hardening one's heart against God's truth, which can lead to a state of unbelief.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/pursuing_righteousness_by_faith.htm">Pursuing Righteousness by Faith</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of seeking righteousness through faith in Christ, not through works of the law.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_to_his_promises.htm">God's Faithfulness to His Promises</a></b><br>Trust in God's faithfulness to fulfill His promises to both Israel and the Church, despite human unfaithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_grace_in_salvation.htm">The Role of Grace in Salvation</a></b><br>Acknowledge that salvation is a gift of grace, underscoring the need for humility and gratitude in the believer's life.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_11_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 11:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_11_7_God_s_sovereign_choice.htm">How does Romans 11:7 illustrate God's sovereignty in choosing His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_the_elect_say_about_grace.htm">What does "the elect obtained it" teach about God's grace and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prevent_spiritual_hardening.htm">How can we avoid being "hardened" as described in Romans 11:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Romans_11_7_Exodus_7_3_Hardened_Hearts.htm">Connect Romans 11:7 with Exodus 7:3 on the theme of hardening hearts.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Romans_11_7_on_evangelism.htm">How does understanding Romans 11:7 impact our approach to evangelism today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Romans_11_7_on_God_s_elect_choice.htm">What does Romans 11:7 reveal about God's sovereignty in choosing the elect?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Romans_11_7_on_spiritual_blindness.htm">How does Romans 11:7 address the concept of spiritual blindness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_were_Israelites_hardened_in_Romans_11_7.htm">Why were some Israelites hardened according to Romans 11:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_romans_11.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Romans 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_are_the_times_of_the_gentiles.htm">What are the Times of the Gentiles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_about_israel.htm">What does the Bible say about Israel in End Times?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_romans_11_1_contradict_ot_judgment.htm">Romans 11:1 &#8211; Does Paul&#8217;s claim that God has not rejected Israel contradict Old Testament accounts of divine judgment against Israel?

With &#8220;What then?&#8221; he invites readers to weigh the evidence, much like his earlier summary moments in <a href="/romans/3-9.htm">Romans 3:9 and 6</a>:15. The question signals: let&#8217;s gather the facts and see what God is doing right now with Israel and the nations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What Israel was seeking, it failed to obtain,</b><p>&#8226; Israel as a nation pursued righteousness but on the basis of works, not faith (<a href="/romans/9-31.htm">Romans 9:31&#8211;32</a>; 10:2&#8211;3).<p>&#8226; The goal was good&#8212;acceptance with God and fulfillment of covenant promises&#8212;yet their approach was self-reliant.<p>&#8226; Like the rich young ruler who &#8220;went away sad&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/19-16.htm">Matthew 19:16&#8211;22</a>), they wanted life but refused the only door, Christ (<a href="/john/10-7.htm">John 10:7&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a> speaks of the stone the builders rejected; Israel&#8217;s national leadership stumbled over that same stone (<a href="/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>).<p>The tragedy is not that God failed but that the people would not embrace God&#8217;s way.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but the elect did.</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The elect&#8221; refers to the remnant chosen by grace (<a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>; see also 8:33).<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture God preserves a believing minority&#8212;Noah (<a href="/genesis/6-8.htm">Genesis 6:8</a>), the 7,000 in Elijah&#8217;s day (<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>), faithful Jews in exile like Daniel (<a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a>).<p>&#8226; These believers receive what Israel sought because they trust God&#8217;s promise, not their own merit (<a href="/galatians/3-6.htm">Galatians 3:6&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Their salvation confirms that God&#8217;s word stands; His covenant love reaches its target every time (<a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The others were hardened,</b><p>&#8226; Hardening is God&#8217;s judicial response to persistent unbelief, seen in Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>; <a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17&#8211;18</a>) and foretold for Israel in <a href="/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a>.<p>&#8226; It involves a spiritual dullness&#8212;eyes that cannot see, ears that cannot hear (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-4.htm">Deuteronomy 29:4</a>; <a href="/john/12-40.htm">John 12:40</a>).<p>&#8226; This hardening is partial and purposeful: it opens the door for Gentile salvation (<a href="/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>) and stirs Israel to eventual jealousy and repentance (<a href="/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25&#8211;26</a>).<p>&#8226; Responsibility remains with those hardened; they chose unbelief, and God confirmed them in that choice (<a href="/psalms/95-8.htm">Psalm 95:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/11-7.htm">Romans 11:7</a> teaches that national Israel, pursuing righteousness by works, missed the goal, while God&#8217;s chosen remnant obtained it by grace, and the rest experienced a divinely permitted hardening.
