It echoes the biblical teaching found in <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>, where God observes the wickedness of man. Paul's acknowledgment aligns with the doctrine of original sin, which suggests that sin has tainted every part of human nature. This understanding is crucial for recognizing the need for divine intervention and grace.<p><b>that is, in my flesh;</b><br>Here, "flesh" refers to the sinful nature or the human condition apart from God's influence. In biblical terms, "flesh" often symbolizes human weakness and propensity to sin, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>, where the works of the flesh are contrasted with the fruit of the Spirit. This distinction is important in understanding the internal conflict believers face between their sinful nature and their new life in Christ.<p><b>for I have the desire to do what is good,</b><br>Paul expresses the internal struggle between his spiritual desires and his fleshly inclinations. This reflects the universal human experience of knowing what is right but struggling to do it, as seen in the broader context of <a href="/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>. This desire to do good is a result of the Holy Spirit's work in a believer's life, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>, where God works in believers to will and to act according to His good purpose.<p><b>but I cannot carry it out.</b><br>This admission highlights the limitations of human effort in achieving righteousness. It underscores the necessity of relying on God's grace and the power of the Holy Spirit, as human strength alone is insufficient. This struggle is further elaborated in <a href="/romans/8.htm">Romans 8</a>, where Paul discusses living according to the Spirit. The inability to carry out good intentions without divine help points to the need for salvation through Jesus Christ, who empowers believers to overcome sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is addressing the Roman Christians, sharing his personal struggle with sin and the law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_christians.htm">Roman Christians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, living in a diverse and often morally challenging environment, needing guidance on living a Christian life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flesh.htm">The Flesh</a></b><br>Refers to the sinful nature inherent in humanity, which Paul describes as being devoid of anything good.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>The Mosaic Law, which Paul discusses extensively in Romans, highlighting its role in revealing sin but not in providing salvation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_inner_conflict.htm">The Inner Conflict</a></b><br>The struggle between the desire to do good and the inability to carry it out, a universal human experience Paul articulates.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_flesh.htm">Understanding the Flesh</a></b><br>Recognize that the "flesh" refers to our sinful nature, which is inherently opposed to God's will.

No one had to convince him of his inner condition; experience and the mirror of God&#8217;s law made it plain. Just as David confessed, &#8220;For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/51-3.htm">Psalm 51:3</a>), so Paul owns the truth about himself. First <a href="/john/1-8.htm">John 1:8</a> echoes the same self-awareness: &#8220;If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves.&#8221;<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; Genuine spiritual life begins with honest self-assessment.<p>&#8226; The closer we draw to the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>), the more clearly we see our need of grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nothings good lives in me, that is, in my flesh</b><p>Here &#8220;flesh&#8221; refers to the fallen, sin-warped human nature, untouched by the Spirit. Scripture repeatedly affirms its corruption:<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>&#8212;&#8220;The heart is deceitful above all things.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>&#8212;&#8220;The flesh profits nothing.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/8-7.htm">Romans 8:7</a>&#8212;&#8220;The mind of the flesh is hostile to God.&#8221;<p>Even our best independent efforts are tainted: &#8220;All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>). Paul is not denying the image of God in humanity; he is confessing that, apart from divine life, nothing spiritually good issues from him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For I have the desire to do what is good</b><p>Conversion planted a new longing in Paul&#8217;s heart. The Spirit births holy desires (<a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>), so the apostle can sincerely say, &#8220;I delight in the law of God in my inner being&#8221; (<a href="/romans/7-22.htm">Romans 7:22</a>). Jesus acknowledged a similar tension in His disciples: &#8220;The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>). <a href="/galatians/5-17.htm">Galatians 5:17</a> describes the conflict plainly&#8212;&#8220;the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit.&#8221;<p>Encouragement:<p>&#8226; A desire for righteousness is evidence of new birth (<a href="/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The struggle itself shows we belong to God; dead hearts feel no battle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But I cannot carry it out</b><p>Left to himself, Paul finds no power in the flesh to translate holy intentions into consistent obedience. He echoes Jesus&#8217; words: &#8220;Apart from Me you can do nothing&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>). <a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a> explains why: &#8220;What the law was powerless to do&#8230; God did by sending His own Son.&#8221; Our inability magnifies Christ&#8217;s sufficiency.<p>Practical implications:<p>&#8226; Self-effort always ends in frustration (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Victory comes only through the Spirit (<a href="/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Dependence, not determination, is the pathway to freedom (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-5.htm">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/7-18.htm">Romans 7:18</a> exposes the heart of every believer: an awakened conscience, a new godly desire, yet a stubborn incapacity in the old nature. Paul&#8217;s honest confession drives us to the Savior who alone indwells, empowers, and completes what we cannot.
