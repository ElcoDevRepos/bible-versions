The early church was marked by a spirit of generosity and unity, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>, where believers shared everything they had. This willingness reflects the transformative power of the Gospel, which breaks down barriers and fosters a sense of community and mutual support.<p><b>and indeed they owe it to them</b><br>Here, Paul emphasizes a sense of indebtedness that the Gentile believers have towards the Jewish Christians. This is rooted in the understanding that salvation and the message of the Gospel came through the Jews, as Jesus Himself stated in <a href="/john/4-22.htm">John 4:22</a>, "Salvation is from the Jews." The Jewish people were the original recipients of God's promises, and through them, the Gentiles have been grafted into the spiritual blessings of Israel (<a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-18</a>).<p><b>For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual blessings</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the spiritual heritage that the Gentiles have received from the Jewish people. The "spiritual blessings" refer to the promises of God, the covenants, the law, and ultimately, the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who was born a Jew. <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-13</a> speaks of how Gentiles, once far off, have been brought near by the blood of Christ, sharing in the rich spiritual blessings that were first given to Israel.<p><b>they are obligated to minister to them with material blessings</b><br>Paul argues that the sharing of spiritual blessings creates a reciprocal responsibility for the Gentiles to support the Jewish believers materially. This principle of reciprocity is consistent with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized caring for one another's needs (<a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>). The early church practiced this mutual care, as seen in <a href="/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29</a>, where the disciples decided to provide help for the brothers and sisters living in Judea. This reflects the broader biblical principle that those who receive spiritual nourishment should support those who provide it (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-11.htm">1 Corinthians 9:11</a>).<div

pleased to do it</b><p>Paul points out that the Macedonian and Achaian believers contributed to the collection for the Jerusalem saints &#8220;with pleasure.&#8221; Their giving was not grudging but joyful, echoing <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>: &#8220;Each one should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.&#8221; Genuine joy in generosity springs from gratitude for salvation (cf. <a href="/psalms/116-12.htm">Psalm 116:12</a>) and from love for fellow members of Christ&#8217;s body (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34&#8211;35</a>).<p>Key thoughts<p>&#8226; Joyful giving reflects the fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Voluntary generosity testifies to God&#8217;s grace at work (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-1.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and indeed they owe it to them</b><p>While the gift was voluntary, Paul stresses moral obligation. The Gentile churches &#8220;owe&#8221; help to Jewish believers because the gospel originated with them (<a href="/john/4-22.htm">John 4:22</a>; <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). Obligation here is not a burdensome debt but a thankful response to spiritual heritage, much like honoring parents (<a href="/ephesians/6-2.htm">Ephesians 6:2</a>) or supporting gospel workers (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-11.htm">1 Corinthians 9:11</a>).<p>Key thoughts<p>&#8226; Love turns duty into delight (<a href="/1_john/5-3.htm">1 John 5:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Recognizing one&#8217;s spiritual roots fosters humility and gratitude (<a href="/romans/11-18.htm">Romans 11:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual blessings</b><p>Gentile Christians &#8220;shared&#8221; (literally &#8220;became partners&#8221;) in the spiritual riches given first to Israel&#8212;covenants, promises, Scriptures, and ultimately Messiah (<a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4&#8211;5</a>). Through faith in Christ, Gentiles are &#8220;fellow heirs, fellow members of the body&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>). This shared grace creates a family bond in which blessings flow both ways (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34&#8211;35</a>).<p>Key thoughts<p>&#8226; Salvation unites diverse peoples into one new man (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritual partnership calls for mutual care (<a href="/philippians/2-1.htm">Philippians 2:1&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they are obligated to minister to them with material blessings</b><p>Because Gentiles received spiritual treasures, they should respond with tangible aid. Paul uses &#8220;minister&#8221; (diakone&#333;) to show that giving is sacred service, similar to priests presenting offerings (<a href="/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>). Material support honors God, meets real needs (<a href="/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17</a>), and strengthens the unity of the Church (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44&#8211;45</a>).<p>Practical applications<p>&#8226; Set aside a portion of income for gospel causes (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-2.htm">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>).<p>&#8226; View generosity as worship, not mere philanthropy (<a href="/hebrews/13-16.htm">Hebrews 13:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Remember that faith without deeds is dead (<a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/15-27.htm">Romans 15:27</a> teaches that joyful, voluntary giving is also a grateful obligation: Gentile believers, enriched by Israel&#8217;s spiritual gifts, rightly share their material resources with Jewish saints in need. This reciprocal flow of blessing demonstrates family love in Christ, fulfills the law of love, and magnifies God by uniting His people in both spiritual and practical fellowship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">It hath pleased them.</span>--It pleased the Macedonians and Achaians to make their contribution.
