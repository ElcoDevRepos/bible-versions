This establishes a connection between the experiences of the early Christians and the historical struggles of Israel. It underscores the continuity of God's people facing persecution and suffering throughout history.<p><b>For Your sake</b><br>The phrase "For Your sake" highlights the motivation behind the suffering. It is not due to personal failings or random misfortune, but because of allegiance to God. This reflects the biblical theme of suffering for righteousness' sake, as seen in the lives of prophets and apostles who endured hardship for their faithfulness to God.<p><b>we face death all day long;</b><br>This expression emphasizes the constant and ongoing nature of the threat faced by believers. In the historical context of the early church, Christians were often persecuted by both Jewish authorities and the Roman Empire. The phrase suggests a life lived under the shadow of martyrdom, echoing the experiences of early Christian martyrs who faced execution for their faith.<p><b>we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.</b><br>This imagery of sheep destined for slaughter conveys vulnerability and innocence. It reflects the cultural and historical context of sacrificial practices in ancient Israel, where sheep were commonly used in sacrifices. The metaphor also connects to the portrayal of Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God, who was led to the slaughter for the sins of humanity, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a> and <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>.

Our hardships are neither random nor wasted; they testify to God&#8217;s faithfulness and lead straight into the triumphant promise of the next verse: &#8220;But in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">For thy sake we are killed.</span>--The quotation is taken from <a href="/psalms/44-22.htm" title="Yes, for your sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.">Psalm 44:22</a>, which was apparently written at some period of great national distress, at what precise period the <span class= "ital">data</span> do not enable us to say, but probably not earlier than Josiah. The sufferings of God's people at all times are typical of each other. There is the further reason for the application in the text that the Psalm does not lay stress upon the guilt of the people, but regards their sufferings as undergone in the cause of the theocracy.
