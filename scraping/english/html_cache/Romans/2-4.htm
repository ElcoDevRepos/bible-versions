The "riches" signify the vastness and generosity of God's attributes. In biblical context, God's kindness (Greek: "chr&#275;stot&#275;s") is His benevolent and gracious nature, often demonstrated through His actions towards humanity. Tolerance (Greek: "anoch&#275;") refers to God's forbearance, His willingness to withhold immediate judgment. Patience (Greek: "makrothumia") indicates His long-suffering nature, allowing time for repentance. These attributes are seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, where God is described as "compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness." Historically, this reflects God's dealings with Israel, showing mercy despite their repeated disobedience.<p><b>not realizing that God&#8217;s kindness leads you to repentance?</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the purpose of God's kindness: to bring about repentance. Repentance (Greek: "metanoia") involves a transformative change of heart and mind, turning away from sin and towards God. Theologically, this underscores the idea that God's grace is not a license to sin but a call to change. The connection to other scriptures, such as <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, highlights God's desire for all to come to repentance, not wanting anyone to perish. This reflects the prophetic nature of God's plan for salvation, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who embodies God's kindness and calls sinners to repentance (<a href="/luke/5-32.htm">Luke 5:32</a>). The cultural context of the Roman audience, familiar with the concept of divine wrath, would find this message of divine patience and kindness as a radical invitation to transformation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, addressing the believers in Rome, emphasizing the importance of understanding God's character and His call to repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers, who are being reminded of the importance of God's grace and the call to live righteously.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, whose attributes of kindness, tolerance, and patience are highlighted as leading to repentance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_character.htm">Understanding God's Character</a></b><br>God's kindness, tolerance, and patience are not to be taken for granted.

Ignoring such riches is perilous; responding with heartfelt repentance opens the floodgates of His transforming grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4, 5) Another alternative is put forward, which has less to do with the distinction of Jew and Gentile, and in which the Apostle keeps more closely to the general form that his argument has assumed: "Or do you think to take refuge in the goodness, the benevolence and long-suffering of God?" True it is that He is <span class= "ital">good,</span> and "willeth not the death of a sinner," but His goodness is not absolute and unconditional. Its object is not to interfere with the just punishment of sin, but <span class= "ital">to</span> lead men to repent of their sins, and so to obtain remission.<p>(4) <span class= "bld">Riches.</span>--In this metaphorical sense, with reference to the divine attributes, this word is peculiar to and characteristic of St. Paul. It is thus used twelve times in his Epistles, and not besides in the rest of the New Testament, including the Epistle to the Hebrews. This is one of those instances where the evidence of style is important. Of the twelve places where this use occurs, eight are in the Epistles of the Imprisonment, three in the Epistle to the Romans, and one in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians. The later and earlier Epistles are thus linked together. A similar use is not found in the Pastoral Epistles, but it should be remembered that arguments of this kind are more important on the positive side than on the negative. It is an inference of some strength that if a peculiar word or usage is found in two separate books, those books are by the same author, but the absence of such a word or usage goes a very short way towards the opposite negative conclusion if other resemblances on characteristic points are not wanting.<p><span class= "bld">Forbearance and longsuffering.</span>--We may compare with this the Sinaitic revelation given in <a href="/context/exodus/34-6.htm" title="And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, "The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering." The moral character and relation to His people thus attributed to the Deity was a feature which specially distinguished the religion of the Old Testament from that of the surrounding heathen nations.<p>We may observe that the fallacy against which the Apostle is protesting in these verses is not yet extinct. The goodness of God--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> His disposition to promote the happiness of His creatures--is insisted upon as if it were unconditional, as if it were a disposition to promote their happiness simply and without any reference to what they were in themselves. We do not find that this is the case; but rather the constitution of nature, as well as revelation, tells us that happiness is annexed to certain acts and a certain frame of mind, and that it is withheld from all that is not consonant with this. The bliss of the Christian is reserved for the Christian, and is not showered promiscuously upon all men. Otherwise free-will would have no office, and righteous dealing no reward.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/2-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Or</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7970;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2228.htm">Strong's 2228: </a> </span><span class="str2">Or, than.
