His commitment to this mission is the reason for his actions and decisions. It highlights the apostolic priority of spreading the Gospel to unreached areas, aligning with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>.<p><b>I have often been hindered</b><br>Paul's missionary journeys were frequently met with obstacles, both spiritual and physical. The word "hindered" suggests divine providence and the reality of spiritual warfare, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a> where Paul mentions Satan hindering him. This reflects the challenges faced by early Christians in spreading the Gospel, including opposition from both Jewish and Gentile communities.<p><b>from coming to you</b><br>Paul's desire to visit the Roman believers is evident throughout the epistle (<a href="/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11-13</a>). Rome was a significant center of power and culture, and the church there was influential. His inability to visit earlier underscores the strategic importance of his mission work elsewhere. This also reflects the interconnectedness of the early Christian communities and Paul's role in strengthening and unifying the church across different regions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Romans, Paul is a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rome.htm">Rome</a></b><br>The capital of the Roman Empire, Rome was a significant city for early Christians.
