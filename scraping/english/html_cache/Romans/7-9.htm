In Jewish tradition, children are considered innocent until they reach the age of accountability, often associated with the Bar Mitzvah at age 13. Paul, as a Pharisee, would have been deeply familiar with the law, yet he speaks of a time when he was "alive" without its full weight. This suggests a period of ignorance or innocence regarding the law's demands and consequences. Theologically, this can be seen as a state of spiritual naivety, where one is unaware of the law's power to reveal sin.<p><b>but when the commandment came,</b><br>The "commandment" refers to the specific laws given by God, particularly the Ten Commandments. In Jewish history, the giving of the law at Mount Sinai was a pivotal moment, marking a covenant between God and Israel. For Paul, the "coming" of the commandment signifies a personal realization or conviction of the law's requirements. This mirrors the experience of many believers who, upon encountering God's word, become acutely aware of their sinfulness. The law serves as a mirror, reflecting the holiness of God and the sinfulness of man.<p><b>sin sprang to life</b><br>Here, Paul personifies sin, suggesting that it was dormant or inactive until the law illuminated it. This aligns with the biblical teaching that the law reveals sin but does not cause it. In Genesis, sin is first introduced with Adam and Eve's disobedience, but it is the law that defines and exposes it. The phrase indicates that sin, once exposed by the law, becomes active and evident in one's life. This is a common theme in Scripture, where the law is seen as a catalyst that brings awareness of sin, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>.<p><b>and I died.</b><br>This death is spiritual rather than physical, signifying separation from God due to sin. In <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>, Paul states, "For the wages of sin is death," underscoring the idea that sin leads to spiritual death. Theologically, this reflects the doctrine of original sin, where humanity inherits a sinful nature from Adam, resulting in spiritual death. Paul's personal experience mirrors the universal human condition, where the realization of sin through the law leads to an awareness of spiritual death. This sets the stage for the need for redemption through Jesus Christ, who offers life and reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is addressing the believers in Rome, explaining the relationship between the law and sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law, which includes commandments given to the Israelites.

And the commandment, which was unto life, this I found to be unto death, For sin, taking occasion, through the commandment deceived me, and through it slew me</span>. If, in saying, "I was alive once," the writer is at all remembering his own experience, the reference may be to the time of the innocence of childhood, before he had any distinct consciousness of the behests of law. Or it may be that he is only imagining a possible state without any consciousness of law, so as to bring out more forcibly the operation of law. On the general drift of ver. 9, Calvin says tersely, "Mors peccati vita est hominis: rursum vita peccati mors hominis." In ver. 11 the conception of sin's action is the same as in ver. 8; but the verb now used is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, with obvious reference to Eve's temptation, which is regarded as representing ours (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>). The view of the origin of human sin presented to us in Genesis is that man at first <span class="accented">lived</span> at peace with God; but that <span class="accented">the command</span>ment," Thou shalt not eat of it, lest thou die," was taken advantage of by the "serpent" (answering to personified <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in the passage before us), inspiring sinful <span class="accented">lust</span>; and that so the <span class="accented">commandment</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">law</span>), though in itself holy, became the occasion of <span class="accented">sin</span>, and of <span class="accented">death</span> as its consequence; and further, that all this came about through <span class="accented">delusion</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>). The thing desired was not really good for man; but the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> inspired by the tempter caused it to seem so. One great purpose of regenerating grace is to dispel this delusion; to bring us back to the true view of things as they are, and so to peace with God. Thus, in part, does the apostle teach us to regard the inscrutable mystery of sin, and the remedy for it in Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/7-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Once</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#964;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(pote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4218.htm">Strong's 4218: </a> </span><span class="str2">At one time or other, at some time, formerly.
