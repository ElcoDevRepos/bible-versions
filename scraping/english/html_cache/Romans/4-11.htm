It was a mark of identity and separation for the Jewish people, signifying their unique relationship with God. In the ancient Near Eastern context, covenants often included physical signs or rituals to confirm the agreement. This practice was not unique to Israel but was given a distinct theological significance in the biblical narrative.<p><b>as a seal of the righteousness</b><br>A seal in ancient times was used to authenticate documents or agreements, much like a signature today. Here, circumcision is described as a seal, indicating that it confirmed or authenticated the righteousness that Abraham already possessed. This righteousness was not based on works or adherence to the law, but on faith. The concept of a seal also points to the permanence and assurance of God's promises.<p><b>that he had by faith</b><br>Abraham's righteousness was credited to him because of his faith, as stated earlier in <a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>, referencing <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>. This emphasizes the principle that righteousness before God is based on faith, not on works or physical signs. This foundational truth is central to Paul's argument in Romans, highlighting the continuity of God's plan of salvation from the Old Testament to the New Testament.<p><b>while he was still uncircumcised</b><br>Abraham was declared righteous before he was circumcised, which is crucial to Paul's argument that righteousness is apart from the law. This historical fact underscores that the covenantal relationship with God is based on faith, not on ethnic or ritualistic identity. It also prefigures the inclusion of Gentiles into the people of God, as they too can be justified by faith without adhering to Jewish ceremonial laws.<p><b>So then, he is the father of all who believe but are not circumcised</b><br>Abraham is presented as the spiritual father of all believers, not just those who are physically descended from him or who follow Jewish customs. This expands the scope of God's promise to include Gentiles, fulfilling the promise that all nations would be blessed through Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). This spiritual fatherhood is based on shared faith, not on physical lineage or ritual observance.<p><b>in order that righteousness might be credited to them</b><br>The purpose of Abraham's example is to show that righteousness is credited to all who have faith, regardless of their cultural or religious background. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of salvation by grace through faith, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>. It also reflects the prophetic vision of a diverse people of God, united not by law but by faith in Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of the promises made to Abraham.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Abraham is considered the father of faith.

Circumcision authenticated what God had already declared in <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>: &#8220;Abram believed the LORD, and He credited it to him as righteousness.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The righteousness was &#8220;by faith,&#8221; anticipating <a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>: &#8220;This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The sequence matters: righteousness first, seal second. Abraham was not made righteous by the act, but the act confirmed the righteousness already given&#8212;paralleling baptism as an outward affirmation of an inward reality (<a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>While he was still uncircumcised</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;while he was still uncircumcised.&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Fourteen years separate <a href="/bsb/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a> (faith credited) and <a href="/bsb/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17</a> (circumcision).

By arranging history this way, God opened the door for uncircumcised believers&#8212;Gentiles&#8212;to call Abraham &#8220;father&#8221; and to receive the same credited righteousness through faith in Christ. The verse underscores salvation by grace alone, through faith alone, for every person who believes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">The sign of circumcision</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> circumcision <span class= "ital">as a</span> sign. The expression is an instance of what is known in Greek as the "genitive of apposition," but it is common in English. Thus we speak of the City <span class= "ital">of</span> London, the County <span class= "ital">of</span> Kent.<p>Abraham is the father (1) of faithful uncircumcised--he himself being so--and (2) of circumcised, <span class= "ital">but only</span> of faithful circumcised.<p><span class= "bld">A seal of the righteousness</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--The Apostle here puts forth his view of the real import of circumcision. It was not (as so many of his contemporaries supposed) the cause or condition of Israel's privileges so much as the sign or ratification of them. It ratified a state of things already existing when it was instituted. Hence, to those who inherited that state of things (justification by faith) the want of circumcision was no bar.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had in uncircumcision</span> (this was all that circumcision was - a visible sign and seal to his own descendants of the righteousness that is of faith; but not confining it to them, or in itself conferring it) <span class="cmt_word">that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned unto them also. And the father of circumcision to them who are not of circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had in uncircumcision</span>. The intention of ver. 12 is to express that, though the faithful who are not of Israel are Abraham's children, yet his circumcised descendants have not lost their privilege. They are already his children according to the flesh, and his spiritual children too, if they walk in the steps of his faith (cf. <a href="/john/8-37.htm">John 8:37</a>, "I know that ye are Abraham's seed," compared with ver. 39, "If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham"). What now follows is to show (as above explained) that the Law could not be the fulfilment of the promise to Abraham, or appropriate its blessing to the Jews. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/4-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">he received</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#955;&#945;&#946;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(elaben)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2983.htm">Strong's 2983: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I receive, get, (b) I take, lay hold of. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the] sign</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#275;meion)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4592.htm">Strong's 4592: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of a presumed derivative of the base of semaino; an indication, especially ceremonially or supernaturally.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of circumcision</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#8134;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(peritom&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4061.htm">Strong's 4061: </a> </span><span class="str2">Circumcision.
