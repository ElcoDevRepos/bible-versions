This phrase is a common rhetorical device in his letters, indicating that he is addressing a potential misunderstanding or lack of knowledge among his audience. The term "brothers" signifies the familial bond among believers, emphasizing unity and equality within the body of Christ, transcending ethnic and social barriers.<p><b>how often I planned to come to you</b><br>Paul's desire to visit Rome reflects his missionary strategy to reach major urban centers of the Roman Empire, which were influential in spreading the Gospel. His repeated planning indicates a strong commitment to the Roman believers and his strategic vision for the church's growth. This also highlights the apostle's human limitations and the sovereignty of God in directing his ministry efforts.<p><b>(but have been prevented from visiting until now)</b><br>The prevention of Paul's visit can be understood in light of spiritual warfare, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a>, where Paul attributes hindrances to Satan. It also reflects the practical challenges of travel in the ancient world, including political, social, and logistical obstacles. This phrase underscores the theme of divine timing and providence in Paul's ministry.<p><b>in order that I might have a harvest among you</b><br>The metaphor of a "harvest" is frequently used in Scripture to describe the gathering of believers and the fruitful results of evangelistic efforts. This imagery connects to Jesus' teachings, such as in <a href="/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37-38</a>, where He speaks of the plentiful harvest and the need for laborers. Paul's use of this metaphor indicates his hope for spiritual growth and the conversion of souls in Rome.<p><b>just as I have had among the other Gentiles</b><br>Paul's reference to his success among other Gentiles highlights his role as the apostle to the Gentiles, as stated in <a href="/galatians/2-8.htm">Galatians 2:8</a>. This phrase underscores the inclusivity of the Gospel message, breaking down the dividing wall between Jews and Gentiles, as elaborated in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>.

He had intended to add the Roman Church to the harvest that he was engaged in gathering in.<p><span class= "bld">Let.</span>--This is, of course, an archaism for "hindered," "prevented." The Greek is literally, "<span class= "ital">and</span> was prevented hitherto."<p>It is hardly worth while to speculate, as some commentators have done, on the causes that may have hindered the Apostle from going to Rome. In a life like his there may have been many.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you (and was hindered hitherto), that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles</span>. Some take the "but" at the beginning of this verse (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>) as the apodosis to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 8, with the meaning, "I am aware, and am thankful, that your faith is already notorious; <span class="accented">but</span> still I wish you to know that I have long had a desire to visit you." But the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> are too far separated to commend this view. It is more after St. Paul's style that there should be no apodosis to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span>; his train of thought carries him on so that he forgets how he began his sentence; and ver. 13 comes naturally as the sequence of ver. 12, whether we render <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> by "but," or (as in the Authorized Version) by "now," or (as in the Revised Version) by "and." The long-cherished intention here spoken of had been expressed by him when at Ephesus, before his departure to Macedonia (<a href="/acts/19-21.htm">Acts 19:21</a>). Feeling himself to be peculiarly the apostle to the Gentile world, and having already been the first agent in carrying the gospel into Europe (<a href="/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9, 10</a>), and having established it there in important centres of population, he ever kept in view an eventual visit to the imperial city itself, in the hope of its thence permeating the whole western world. What had so far hindered him appears from <a href="/romans/15-22.htm">Romans 15:22</a> to have been principally missionary work which had first to be accomplished elsewhere. At last Providence carried him there in a way not of his own choosing. Thus man proposes, God disposes. In this verse the Roman Church seems certainly to be regarded as a Gentile one. What classes of converts probably at that time composed it has been considered in the Introduction. Whatever its nucleus, St. Paul plainly feels that, in sending this Epistle to it, he is carrying out his especial mission of extending the gospel to the Gentile world, though at the same time he writes mainly from a Jewish standpoint, appealing frequently to the Jewish Scriptures, with which he presupposes an acquaintance on the part of his readers. But the latter fact is not inconsistent with the supposition of their being, either then or prospectively, mainly of Gentile race. The gospel was everywhere preached as the fulfilment of Judaism (see note on ver. 2); and for understanding both its purport and its evidences, all would have to be to some extent indoctrinated in the ancient Scriptures. It is to be observed, too, that in the next verse the apostle implies a sense of now addressing a peculiarly civilized and cultivated community; he seems to have before him the prospect of his address reaching the educated and intelligent classes of society in the imperial city. And the Epistle, as it goes on, is in accordance with such an aim. For its arguments are addressed, not merely to believers in the Old Testament, but also generally to philosophical thinkers. The state of the world is reviewed, human consciousness is analyzed, deep problems which had long exercised the minds of philosophers are touched on, and the gospel is, in fact, commended to the world as God's answer to man's needs. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/1-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I do not want</span><br /><span class="grk">&#952;&#941;&#955;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(thel&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2309.htm">Strong's 2309: </a> </span><span class="str2">To will, wish, desire, be willing, intend, design. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hymas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
