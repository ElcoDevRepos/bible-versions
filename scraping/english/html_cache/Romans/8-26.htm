The term "helps" suggests a partnership, indicating that the Spirit comes alongside believers to support them. The "weakness" refers to human limitations, particularly in spiritual matters, echoing the human condition described in <a href="/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>. This assistance is not just physical but deeply spiritual, addressing the frailty of human nature in understanding and executing God's will.<p><b>For we do not know how we ought to pray,</b><br>This acknowledges the limitations of human understanding in spiritual communication. The disciples asked Jesus to teach them to pray (<a href="/luke/11.htm">Luke 11:1</a>), indicating that prayer is not instinctive but learned. The phrase suggests a lack of clarity or confidence in approaching God, which is a common human experience. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of human dependency on divine guidance, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, where trust in the Lord is emphasized over personal understanding.<p><b>but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us</b><br>The Spirit's intercession is a profound mystery, indicating a direct involvement in the believer's spiritual life. This intercession is distinct from Christ's role as mediator (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>) and highlights the Trinitarian work in salvation. The Spirit's intercession is a continuous process, suggesting an ongoing relationship and support system for believers. This reflects the promise of God's presence and assistance in times of need, as seen in <a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>.<p><b>with groans too deep for words.</b><br>This phrase suggests a depth of communication beyond human language, indicating the Spirit's intimate knowledge of God's will and the believer's needs. The "groans" can be seen as expressions of the Spirit's empathy and deep concern for the believer's spiritual welfare. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's deep compassion and understanding, as seen in <a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a>, where God hears the groaning of the Israelites. The ineffable nature of these groans points to the profound mystery of divine communication and the Spirit's role in bridging the gap between human frailty and divine perfection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, who plays a crucial role in the life of believers by interceding and helping in their weaknesses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>The recipients of the Holy Spirit's help and intercession, who are often in a state of weakness and uncertainty in their prayer life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/intercession.htm">Intercession</a></b><br>The act of intervening on behalf of another, which in this context refers to the Holy Spirit's role in communicating our needs to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit is our Helper, especially in times of weakness.

Here, then, is a further source of help and comfort to Christians under present trials. Of themselves they know not what relief to crave. St. Paul himself knew not what to pray for as he ought, when he asked for removal of his thorn in the flesh; if left to themselves, their long waiting and their manifold perplexities might damp their hope; but a Helper beyond themselves comes in to succour them, viz. the Holy Spirit himself, who intercedes (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) for them. But how? Not as the Son intercedes for them, apart from themselves, at the mercy-seat; but within themselves, by inspiring them with these unutterable (or, <span class="accented">unuttered</span>) groanings; and they are conscious that such deep and intense yearnings are from the Divine Spirit moving them, and teaching them to pray. They may not still be able to put their requests of God into definite form, or even express them in words; but they know that God knows the meaning of what his own Spirit has inspired. This is a deep and pregnant thought. Even apart from the peculiar faith and inspiration of the gospel, the internal consciousness of the human soul, with its yearnings after something as yet unrealized, affords one of the most cogent evidences of a life to come to those who feel such yearnings. For ideals seem to postulate corresponding realities; instinctive longings seem to postulate fulfilment. Else were human nature a strange riddle indeed. But Christian faith vivifies the ideal, and intensifies the longing; and thus the prophecy of internal consciousness acquires a new force to the Christian believer; and this all the more from his being convinced that the quickening of spiritual life of which he is conscious is Divine. The psalmist of old, when he sang, "As the hart panteth after the waterbrooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God," felt in these ardent though inarticulate pantings a presage of fulfilment of his "hope in God." So the devout Christian; and all the more in proportion to the intenseness and definiteness of his yearnings, and his conviction that they are from God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/8-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In the same way,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8041;&#963;&#945;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(H&#333;saut&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5615.htm">Strong's 5615: </a> </span><span class="str2">In like manner, likewise, just so.
