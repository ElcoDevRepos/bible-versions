In the context of Romans, Paul addresses the Jewish understanding of being God's chosen people through Abraham. The "children of the flesh" refers to those who are biologically descended from Abraham, such as the Israelites. However, Paul argues that mere physical lineage does not guarantee one's status as God's child. This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39-40</a>, where He challenges the Jews' reliance on Abrahamic descent. Historically, this reflects the shift from the Old Covenant, based on ethnic Israel, to the New Covenant, which includes all who have faith in Christ, regardless of ethnic background.<p><b>but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as offspring</b><br>The "children of the promise" refers to those who are part of God's covenant through faith, as exemplified by Isaac, the child of promise to Abraham and Sarah. This promise is rooted in <a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>, where God promises Abraham that Sarah will bear a son, Isaac, through whom the covenant will be established. Paul uses this to illustrate that true descendants of Abraham are those who share in the faith of Abraham, not just his bloodline. This aligns with <a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>, where Paul states that if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise. This concept underscores the spiritual nature of God's family, which transcends ethnic and cultural boundaries, and points to the fulfillment of God's promise through Jesus Christ, the ultimate seed of Abraham.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is addressing the believers in Rome, explaining the nature of God's promises and who truly belongs to the family of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The child of promise, born to Abraham and Sarah, representing those who are considered true children of God through faith and promise, not merely by physical descent.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch to whom God made promises regarding his descendants, illustrating the difference between physical lineage and spiritual inheritance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation descended from Abraham, representing the broader context of Paul's discussion on who constitutes the true Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who, through faith in Christ, are included in the promise and considered children of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_spiritual_lineage.htm">Understanding Spiritual Lineage</a></b><br>True children of God are identified by faith and promise, not merely by physical descent.

For the word of promise is this, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son</span> (<a href="/genesis/18-10.htm">Genesis 18:10</a>). In other words, it is not in virtue of mere carnal descent, but of the promise, that any are so counted; mere carnal descent establishes no claim. It is to be observed that in the first recorded promises to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/13-15.htm">Genesis 13:15</a>; <a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>) there was no restriction; and so through Ishmael, who is also called Abraham's seed (<a href="/genesis/21-13.htm">Genesis 21:13</a>), as well as through Isaac, the fulfilment might have been. But the subsequent promise (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19, 21</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-10.htm">Genesis 18:10, 14</a>) limited it to Isaac; which limiting promise is, therefore, in ver. 9, referred to. With <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in ver. 8 Compare <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;</span> (ver. 4), and also <a href="/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>. The apostle may have been led to use the expression here in view of the spiritual sonship to God of Christians (cf. <a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>, etc.)which was typified and prepared for by the <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of the chosen seed. A still further limitation of "the children of the promise" is next referred to; and one still more telling for the apostle's argument. It might be said that Ishmael was not, even carnally, the true seed, as being born, not of the wife, but of the bondwoman; or perhaps that he had forfeited any claim he might have had by his proved unworthiness (<a href="/genesis/21-9.htm">Genesis 21:9</a>, etc.). But Esau and Jacob were twin children, not only of the same patriarch (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fbe;&#x1fef;&#x3c2;</span>), but also of the same wedded wife; and yet one was chosen and the other rejected, and this even before birth; so that, as the selection was not due to carnal descent, so neither could it be due to proved desert. Thus by this second consideration is disposed of the Jew's assertion of an indefeasible claim to inheritance of the promises on the ground of his boasted works, as by the other is disposed of his claim on the ground of his race. St. Paul's argument to the Jews of his own day would be - You cannot set up a claim to be all of you the necessary inheritors of the promises for all time on the ground either of your carnal descent or of your works, since the selection of Israel himself did not depend on either of these grounds; nor can you say that my position (viz. that Christian believers, to the exclusion of most of you, are now the true inheritors of the promises) implies unfaithfulness in God to his ancient promises; for it is in accordance with the principle on which, according to your own Scriptures, he fulfilled of old his promises to the patriarchs. St. Paul, however, is not to be understood here as writing with a direct polemical intention, but rather as discussing a problem which had at one time perplexed himself, and which seemed to him to call for solution. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/9-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(tout&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">it is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
