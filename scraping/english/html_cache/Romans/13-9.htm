Adultery was considered a grave sin in ancient Israel, undermining the sanctity of marriage and family, which were foundational to societal stability. In the New Testament, Jesus expands on this commandment in <a href="/matthew/5-27.htm">Matthew 5:27-28</a>, emphasizing that even lustful thoughts are equivalent to adultery, highlighting the importance of purity in both action and thought.<p><b>&#8220;Do not murder,&#8221;</b><br>This commandment, the sixth in the Decalogue (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-17.htm">Deuteronomy 5:17</a>), underscores the sanctity of human life, created in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>). The prohibition against murder is foundational to maintaining justice and order in society. Jesus further deepens this commandment in <a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>, teaching that anger and hatred towards others are akin to murder, thus calling for reconciliation and love.<p><b>&#8220;Do not steal,&#8221;</b><br>The eighth commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-19.htm">Deuteronomy 5:19</a>) addresses the respect for others' property and the importance of honesty and integrity. In biblical times, theft could destabilize communities and erode trust. <a href="/ephesians/4-28.htm">Ephesians 4:28</a> encourages believers to work honestly and share with those in need, transforming the commandment into a call for generosity and community support.<p><b>&#8220;Do not covet,&#8221;</b><br>This commandment, the tenth in the list (<a href="/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-21.htm">Deuteronomy 5:21</a>), targets the inner desires and attitudes that can lead to sin. Coveting disrupts contentment and can lead to actions that harm others. In <a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15</a>, Jesus warns against all kinds of greed, emphasizing that life does not consist in the abundance of possessions, thus promoting a heart of gratitude and trust in God's provision.<p><b>and any other commandments,</b><br>This phrase suggests the comprehensive nature of the moral law, encompassing not only the Ten Commandments but also other ethical teachings found throughout Scripture. It reflects the holistic approach to righteousness that goes beyond mere rule-following to embodying the spirit of the law in all aspects of life.<p><b>are summed up in this one decree:</b><br>The idea of summing up the law is rooted in the Jewish tradition of seeking the essence of the commandments. This concept is echoed in Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>, where He states that all the Law and the Prophets hang on the commandments to love God and love one's neighbor.<p><b>&#8220;Love your neighbor as yourself.&#8221;</b><br>This commandment, originally found in <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, is central to both the Old and New Testaments. It calls for empathy, compassion, and selflessness, reflecting God's love for humanity. Jesus elevates this commandment in the parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25-37</a>), illustrating that neighborly love transcends ethnic and social boundaries. This love is a reflection of Christ's sacrificial love, as seen in His life and teachings, and is the fulfillment of the law (<a href="/galatians/5-14.htm">Galatians 5:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the Roman Christians were a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers living in the heart of the Roman Empire.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ten_commandments.htm">The Ten Commandments</a></b><br>Originally given to Moses on Mount Sinai, these commandments form the moral foundation of the Old Testament law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>His teachings emphasized love as the fulfillment of the law, which Paul echoes in this passage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_commandment.htm">The Great Commandment</a></b><br>Jesus' teaching that the greatest commandment is to love God and the second is like it: to love your neighbor as yourself.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fulfillment_of_the_law_through_love.htm">The Fulfillment of the Law through Love</a></b><br>Love is the essence and fulfillment of the law.

Jesus taught that obedience to &#8220;the least of these commandments&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-19.htm">Matthew 5:19</a>) flows from a heart aligned with God&#8217;s own character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summed up in this one decree</b><p>Jesus declared the entire Law and Prophets &#8220;hang on&#8221; love for God and neighbor (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>). <a href="/galatians/5-14.htm">Galatians 5:14</a> and <a href="/james/2-8.htm">James 2:8</a> echo that theme. The commands are not random rules but facets of a single jewel: love. When the Spirit pours God&#8217;s love into our hearts (<a href="/romans/5-5.htm">Romans 5:5</a>), we naturally fulfill what the written code requires.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Love your neighbor as yourself</b><p>Quoting <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, Paul points to active, practical care:<p>&#8226; Initiate good (<a href="/luke/10-30.htm">Luke 10:30-37</a>).<p>&#8226; Speak truth graciously (<a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Bear burdens (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Forgive as Christ forgave (<a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>).<p>Such love is the mark of genuine discipleship (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>). It is not sentimentalism but self-giving action, measured by the standard we instinctively apply to our own needs.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/13-9.htm">Romans 13:9</a> teaches that every prohibition and precept God gives regarding our relationships&#8212;with spouse, life, property, desires, words, and more&#8212;finds its fulfillment in one simple, profound mandate: &#8220;Love your neighbor as yourself.&#8221; When believers embrace God&#8217;s definition of love and rely on His Spirit, we keep the commandments not by grim duty but by joyful devotion, revealing Christ to a watching world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Thou shalt not commit adultery.</span>--It will be seen that in this arrangement the seventh commandment precedes the sixth. The same arrangement is found in <a href="/mark/10-19.htm" title="You know the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honor your father and mother.">Mark 10:19</a>, <a href="/luke/18-20.htm" title="You know the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and your mother.">Luke 18:20</a>, and <a href="/james/2-11.htm" title="For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if you commit no adultery, yet if you kill, you are become a transgressor of the law.">James 2:11</a>. On the other hand, the ordinary arrangement appears in <a href="/matthew/19-18.htm" title="He said to him, Which? Jesus said, You shall do no murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,">Matthew 19:18</a>. There can be no doubt that St. Paul followed an order that was found in the copies of the LXX. that he was in the habit of using. The famous <span class= "ital">Codex Vaticanus</span> still presents the same order in <a href="/deuteronomy/5-17.htm" title="You shall not kill.">Deuteronomy 5:17</a>. In <a href="/context/exodus/20-13.htm" title="You shall not kill.">Exodus 20:13-15</a> it places the seventh commandment, first, then the eighth, then the sixth. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/13-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The [commandments]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
