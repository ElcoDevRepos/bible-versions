The letter to the Romans is addressed to both Jewish and Gentile Christians, highlighting the universal nature of the gospel. The use of "you also" suggests that the Roman believers share in the same calling and privileges as other Christians, regardless of their ethnic or cultural background. This reflects the early church's struggle and eventual acceptance of Gentiles as equal members of the faith community, as seen in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a> during the Jerusalem Council.<p><b>who are called</b><br>The concept of being "called" is significant in biblical theology, indicating a divine initiative. In the New Testament, this calling is often associated with God's sovereign choice and grace, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>, where believers are chosen before the foundation of the world. This calling is not based on human merit but on God's purpose and grace, underscoring the doctrine of election. The calling also implies a response, as believers are called to live in a manner worthy of their calling (<a href="/ephesians/4.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>).<p><b>to belong to Jesus Christ.</b><br>Belonging to Jesus Christ signifies a personal and communal relationship with the Savior. This relationship is central to Christian identity, as believers are united with Christ in His death and resurrection (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-5</a>). The phrase also implies ownership and allegiance, as Christians are no longer their own but have been bought with a price (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>). This belonging is both a privilege and a responsibility, as it calls believers to live in obedience to Christ and to reflect His character in their lives. The idea of belonging to Christ also connects to the imagery of the church as the body of Christ, with each member playing a vital role in the community of faith (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the Book of Romans, addressing the believers in Rome.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers_in_rome.htm">Believers in Rome</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile Christians.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, to whom believers are called to belong.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rome.htm">Rome</a></b><br>The capital of the Roman Empire, a significant city for early Christianity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_calling.htm">The Calling</a></b><br>The divine invitation extended to believers to belong to Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_calling.htm">Understanding Our Calling</a></b><br>Recognize that being called to belong to Jesus Christ is a divine invitation that comes with purpose and responsibility.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_christ.htm">Identity in Christ</a></b><br>Embrace your identity as one who belongs to Jesus, which provides assurance and a sense of belonging in the family of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_out_the_calling.htm">Living Out the Calling</a></b><br>Strive to live a life that reflects the calling you have received, demonstrating Christ-like character and values.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_among_believers.htm">Unity Among Believers</a></b><br>Acknowledge that this calling unites all believers, regardless of background, into one body in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_the_call.htm">Responding to the Call</a></b><br>Actively respond to God's call by engaging in spiritual disciplines, serving others, and sharing the gospel.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_1_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 1:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_1_6_Our_call_to_Jesus_Christ.htm">How does Romans 1:6 affirm our calling to belong to Jesus Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_called_to_belong_daily.htm">What does being "called to belong" mean for your daily Christian walk?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Romans_1_6_Eph_4_1_Living_worthily.htm">How does Romans 1:6 connect with Ephesians 4:1 about living a worthy life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_actively_respond_to_Romans_1_6.htm">In what ways can you actively respond to your calling in Romans 1:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Romans_1_6_Strengthen_your_faith.htm">How can Romans 1:6 inspire you to strengthen your relationship with Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_called_to_belong_to_Jesus.htm">What does Romans 1:6 mean by "called to belong to Jesus Christ"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Romans_1_6_and_divine_calling_link.htm">How does Romans 1:6 relate to the concept of divine calling?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_shaped_Paul_s_message_in_Romans_1_6.htm">What historical context influenced Paul's message in Romans 1:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_romans_1.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Romans 1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_do_jesus_christ_and_christ_jesus_differ.htm">What is the difference between Jesus Christ and Christ Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_is_known_about_chorazin,_bethsaida.htm">What does 'you are not your own' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_military_imagery_conflict_with_christ.htm">2 Timothy 2:3-4 -
