The use of "as it is written" is a common formula in the New Testament to reference the authority of the Hebrew Scriptures. Paul often uses this method to show that his teachings are in continuity with God's revealed word. This particular citation is from <a href="/isaiah/52-15.htm">Isaiah 52:15</a>, which is part of the Servant Songs, prophetic passages that Christians interpret as referring to Jesus Christ.<p><b>&#8220;Those who were not told about Him will see,</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the theme of revelation to the Gentiles, a key aspect of Paul's ministry. The "Him" refers to the Messiah, Jesus Christ. The prophecy in Isaiah originally spoke to the surprise of nations and kings at the revelation of God's servant. In the context of Romans, Paul is emphasizing the spread of the Gospel beyond the Jewish people to the Gentiles, fulfilling the mission to bring light to those who were previously in darkness. This aligns with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>and those who have not heard will understand.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the transformative power of the Gospel message. Even those who have not been part of the covenant community of Israel will come to understand and accept the truth of Christ. This reflects the inclusivity of the Gospel and the breaking down of barriers between Jew and Gentile, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>. The understanding mentioned here is not merely intellectual but involves a deep, spiritual comprehension that leads to faith and salvation.

He immediately grounds that aim in Scripture, signaling that his strategy is not personal ambition but prophetic fulfillment (cf. <a href="/acts/26-22.htm">Acts 26:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; By prefacing with &#8220;Rather,&#8221; he contrasts preaching where Christ is named with going where He is not, aligning himself with Isaiah&#8217;s vision (<a href="/isaiah/52-15.htm">Isaiah 52:15</a>, the source of the quote).<p>&#8226; Scripture itself becomes the warrant for evangelizing unreached peoples, illustrating how &#8220;all Scripture is God-breathed&#8221; and authoritative (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Those who were not told about Him</b><p>&#8226; Isaiah foresaw nations untouched by revelation; Paul sees Gentiles in that role.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s heart for the outsider threads through the Bible:<p>&#8211; Promise to Abraham: &#8220;all the families of the earth will be blessed through you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p>&#8211; Jesus&#8217; Great Commission targets &#8220;all nations&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p>&#8211; Paul and Barnabas quote Isaiah again when turning to the Gentiles: &#8220;I have made you a light for the Gentiles&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46&#8211;47</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores human inability to know Christ unless someone tells them (<a href="/romans/10-14.htm">Romans 10:14&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will see</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;See&#8221; speaks of spiritual sight granted by God:<p>&#8211; &#8220;The people walking in darkness have seen a great light&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8220;God&#8230;has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of God&#8217;s glory in the face of Jesus Christ&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul is confident that proclamation produces revelation; the gospel itself opens blind eyes (<a href="/acts/26-18.htm">Acts 26:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And those who have not heard</b><p>&#8226; The unreached have no prior exposure to covenant promises (<a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul longs to bridge that gap, fulfilling his priestly calling to present the Gentiles as an offering to God (<a href="/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The line reminds believers that lostness is real where the gospel is absent (<a href="/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will understand</b><p>&#8226; Understanding follows seeing; God grants both perception and comprehension (<a href="/luke/24-45.htm">Luke 24:45</a>).<p>&#8226; The Spirit enables the previously ignorant to grasp truths &#8220;prepared for those who love Him&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-9.htm">1 Corinthians 2:9-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Fulfillment is already visible: multitudes from every people are coming to faith (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/15-21.htm">Romans 15:21</a> reveals Paul&#8217;s biblical basis for pioneering mission.

He had now planted the gospel in all the principal centres, leaving disciples and converts, and probably an ordained ministry, to carry on the work and extend it in the regions round. In this his proper apostolic work consisted; cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-14.htm">1 Corinthians 1:14-17</a><span class="cmt_word">), and having a great desire these many years to come unto you; whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I hope to see you on my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company</span>. The sense of this verse is no way affected by the omission of "I will come unto you," which authorities are against retaining. If "for," after this omission, be retained, the sentence is incomplete, as St. Paul's sometimes are. The omission of "for" (for which there is some little authority) leaves the sentence improved. The apostle's selection of Spain as his next intended sphere of labour might be due to the notoriety of that Roman province, and the facility of communication with it by sea. His omission of Italy, except for a passing visit, is accounted for by his principle, already enunciated, of not building on other men's foundation, there being already a flourishing Church at any rate at Rome. He hoped, as appears from this verse, that some of the members of it might join him in his mission to Spain.
