Biblically, being an "enemy of God" refers to living in sin and opposition to God's will (<a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>). The concept of enmity with God is rooted in the fall of man (Genesis 3), where sin created a separation between humanity and God. This enmity is not just a passive state but an active rebellion against God's holiness and righteousness.<p><b>we were reconciled to Him through the death of His Son</b><br>Reconciliation is a key theme in the New Testament, emphasizing the restoration of a broken relationship between God and humanity. The death of Jesus Christ is central to this reconciliation, as it fulfills the sacrificial system established in the Old Testament (Leviticus 16). Christ's death is seen as the ultimate atonement for sin, satisfying God's justice and allowing for peace between God and man (<a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>). This act of reconciliation is a fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who bears the sins of many.<p><b>how much more, having been reconciled</b><br>This phrase introduces a logical argument from the lesser to the greater. If God has already accomplished the difficult task of reconciling us while we were His enemies, it follows that He will certainly complete the process of salvation now that we are reconciled. This reflects the assurance of salvation and the security believers have in Christ (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>). The reconciliation is not just a past event but has ongoing implications for the believer's life.<p><b>shall we be saved through His life!</b><br>The life of Christ refers to His resurrection and ongoing intercession for believers (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). Salvation is not only about being saved from sin but also involves being saved to eternal life, which is made possible through Christ's resurrection (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>). His life ensures the believer's future resurrection and eternal life with God. This phrase underscores the hope and assurance of eternal life, a central tenet of Christian faith, and connects to the promise of new life found in passages like <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator and Sustainer of all, who desires reconciliation with humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_god.htm">Enemies of God</a></b><br>Refers to humanity in its sinful state, opposed to God's holiness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/reconciliation.htm">Reconciliation</a></b><br>The restoration of a relationship between God and humanity, achieved through Jesus Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ (His Son)</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, whose death and resurrection provide the means for reconciliation and salvation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/salvation.htm">Salvation</a></b><br>The deliverance from sin and its consequences, granted through faith in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_reconciliation.htm">Understanding Reconciliation</a></b><br>Reconciliation is a divine initiative.

And yet there is a difference. Reconciliation is the initial act; the removal of the load of guilt, justification. Salvation is the end of the Christian career, and of the process of sanctification. Justification is regarded as being specially due to the death of Christ. Sanctification is brought about rather by His continued agency as the risen and exalted Saviour. The relations in which the risen Saviour still stands to the individual Christian are more fully worked out in <a href="/romans/6-4.htm" title="Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.">Romans 6:4</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.;</span> <a href="/romans/8-34.htm" title="Who is he that comdemns?
