The concept of a "righteous decree" suggests a divine law that is universally understood, echoing the moral law given to Israel and the inherent understanding of right and wrong in all humanity. This awareness is not limited to those with direct access to Scripture but is a universal knowledge of God's expectations.<p><b>that those who do such things are worthy of death</b><br>The phrase "worthy of death" reflects the severity of sin in God's eyes, aligning with the Old Testament law where certain sins warranted capital punishment (<a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10-16</a>). It underscores the gravity of sin and its ultimate consequence, which is spiritual death and separation from God (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). This echoes the justice of God, who cannot tolerate sin, and the need for atonement, which is fulfilled in Christ.<p><b>they not only continue to do these things</b><br>This highlights the persistence in sin despite knowing its consequences. It reflects a hardened heart and a willful rebellion against God. The continuation in sin is indicative of a depraved mind, as described earlier in <a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>, where God gives people over to their sinful desires as a form of judgment. This persistence is a rejection of God's mercy and a refusal to repent.<p><b>but also approve of those who practice them</b><br>Approving of sin in others compounds the guilt, as it not only involves personal sin but also encourages and endorses sin in the community. This approval can be seen as a societal acceptance of immorality, which was prevalent in the Roman culture of Paul's time, known for its decadence and moral relativism. It reflects a deeper level of corruption where sin is not only practiced but celebrated, drawing a parallel to <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>, where evil is called good.

The verse warns that knowledge without submission hardens the heart, and approval of evil multiplies judgment. Yet within the warning lies hope: the same God whose justice demands death offers life through the gospel (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16-17</a>).

In this concluding verse the main point of the whole argument, with which also it began (ver. 19), is repeated, viz. that all this sin was in spite of better knowledge - the original knowledge of God revealed, as above set forth, to the human race, and (as is implied further) an inward witness of conscience still remaining, however stifled, even in the most corrupt society.

There is no need to inquire what conception of future retribution the heathen themselves may be supposed to have had, or to have been capable of entertaining. St. Paul constantly denotes by <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, in a general and comprehensive sense, the penal consequence of unatoned sin due to the Divine <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> (cf. <a href="/romans/6-21.htm">Romans 6:21-23</a>; <a href="/romans/8-6.htm">Romans 8:6</a>, etc.). It is to be observed that in the latter part of this verse the distinction between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, meaning habitual <span class="accented">practice</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, is not shown in the Authorized Version. The evidence of the "reprobate mind" is not simply that such things are done occasionally under temptation, but that they are the habits of people's lives. And still more: such habits are not only participated in by those who have knowledge enough to perceive their guilt (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), but even condoned and approved (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>); there was no general protest or indignation in society against the prevalent abominations; and those familiar with the writers of the Augustan age must be well aware that this was so. Here we have the final proof of the prevalence of the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, the climax of the picture of general moral degradation. "Ideo autem sic interpreter, quod video apostolum voluisse hic gravius aliquid et sceleratius ipsa vitioram perpetratione per-stringere. Id quale sit non intelligo, nisi referamus ad istam nequitiae summam, ubi miseri homines contra Dei justitiam, abjecta verecundia, vitiorum patrocinium suscipiunt" (Calvin). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/1-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Although they]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7989;&#964;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hoitines)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3748.htm">Strong's 3748: </a> </span><span class="str2">Whosoever, whichsoever, whatsoever. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">know</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#947;&#957;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(epignontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1921.htm">Strong's 1921: </a> </span><span class="str2">From epi and ginosko; to know upon some mark, i.e. Recognize; by implication, to become fully acquainted with, to acknowledge.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">God&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="grk">&#920;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(Theou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2316.htm">Strong's 2316: </a> </span><span class="str2">A deity, especially the supreme Divinity; figuratively, a magistrate; by Hebraism, very.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">righteous decree</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#943;&#969;&#956;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(dikai&#333;ma)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1345.htm">Strong's 1345: </a> </span><span class="str2">From dikaioo; an equitable deed; by implication, a statute or decision.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">those who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
