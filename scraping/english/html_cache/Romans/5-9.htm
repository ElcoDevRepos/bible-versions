It serves as a conclusion to the previous points made about the benefits of being justified through faith in Jesus Christ. This logical connector indicates that what follows is a result of the truths previously established.<p><b>since we have now been justified by His blood</b><br>Justification is a legal term signifying a declaration of righteousness. In the context of Romans, it refers to the believer's status before God, achieved through the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ. The phrase "by His blood" emphasizes the sacrificial nature of Christ's death, aligning with Old Testament sacrificial systems where blood was required for atonement (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). This highlights the fulfillment of the sacrificial system in Christ, who is the ultimate Passover Lamb (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p><b>how much more shall we be saved from wrath through Him!</b><br>This phrase underscores the assurance of salvation for those justified by Christ's blood. The "wrath" refers to God's righteous judgment against sin, a theme consistent throughout Scripture (<a href="/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>, <a href="/revelation/6-16.htm">Revelation 6:16-17</a>). The argument is from the greater to the lesser: if God has already accomplished the greater work of justification through Christ's death, He will certainly accomplish the lesser work of saving believers from future wrath. This assurance is rooted in the ongoing intercessory work of Christ (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>) and the security of the believer in Him (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28-29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to this verse, Jesus is the one whose sacrificial death and shed blood provide justification and salvation from God's wrath.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The original recipients of the letter, the Roman Christians were a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers living in the heart of the Roman Empire.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/justification.htm">Justification</a></b><br>A theological event where believers are declared righteous before God through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wrath_of_god.htm">Wrath of God</a></b><br>Refers to God's righteous judgment against sin, from which believers are saved through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_justification.htm">Understanding Justification</a></b><br>Justification is a legal declaration by God, made possible through the blood of Jesus.

For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by</span> (literally, in) <span class="cmt_word">his life</span>. In these verses, the second being an amplification of the first, our relations to God are set forth, as before, by the analogy of such as may subsist between man and man. Men do not usually die for their enemies, but they do seek the good of their friends. If, then, God's superhuman love reconciled us to himself through the death of his Son when we were still his enemies, what assurance may we not now feel, being no longer at enmity, of being saved from the wrath (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, ver. 9) to which, as sinners and enemies, we were exposed! There is also a significance (ver. 10)in the words "death" and "life." Christ's death was for atonement, and in it we are conceived as having died with him to our former state of alienation from God. His resurrection was the inauguration of a new life to God, in which with him we live (cf. <a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3</a>, <span class="accented">et seqq.</span>). The words "enemies" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>) and "reconciled" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) invite attention. Does the former word imply mutual enmity, or only that we were God's enemies? We may answer that, though we cannot attribute enmity in its proper human sense to God, or properly speak of him as under any circumstances the enemy of man, yet the expression might perhaps be used with regard to him in the way of accommodation to human ideas, as are anger, <span class="accented">jealousy</span>, and the like. There seems, however, to be no necessity for this conception here, the idea being rather that of man's alienation from God, and from peace with him, through sin; as in <a href="/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21</a>, "And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works."

With regard to reconciled," it may be first observed that, however orthodox and capable of a true sense it may be to speak of God being reconciled to man through Christ (as in Art. 2, "to reconcile his Father to us"), the expression is not scriptural. It is always man who is said to be reconciled to God; and it is God who, in Christ, reconciles the world unto himself (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>; cf. also <a href="/ephesians/2-16.htm">Ephesians 2:16</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20, 21</a>). Still, mere is evidently implied than that God reconciles men to himself by changing their hearts and converting them from sin by the manifestation of his love in Christ. The reconciliation is spoken of as effected once for all for all mankind in the atonement, independently of, and previously to, the conversion of believers. Faith only appropriates, and obedience testifies, the appropriation of an accomplished reconciliation available for all mankind. That such is the view in the passage before us is distinctly evident from all that follows after ver. 12. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/5-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
