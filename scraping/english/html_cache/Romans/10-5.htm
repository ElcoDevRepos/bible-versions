In the Jewish tradition, righteousness was often associated with the observance of the law given to Moses on Mount Sinai. This law included moral, ceremonial, and civil commandments. The Apostle Paul, in his letter to the Romans, contrasts this form of righteousness with the righteousness that comes through faith in Jesus Christ. The law was seen as a covenant between God and Israel, and adherence to it was a means of maintaining a right relationship with God. However, Paul argues that the law, while holy and good, cannot bring about true righteousness because of human inability to fully keep it.<p><b>Moses writes:</b><br>Moses is traditionally credited as the author of the first five books of the Bible, known as the Pentateuch. In this context, Paul is referencing <a href="/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a>, where Moses conveys God's commandments to the Israelites. Moses is a central figure in Jewish history, serving as the lawgiver and leader who brought the Israelites out of Egypt. His writings are foundational to Jewish law and theology, and Paul uses Moses' authority to make a point about the limitations of the law in achieving righteousness.<p><b>&#8220;The man who does these things will live by them.&#8221;</b><br>This quotation from <a href="/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a> emphasizes the principle that life and blessing are contingent upon obedience to the law. In the Old Testament context, "living" by the law meant experiencing God's favor and the fullness of life promised to Israel. However, Paul uses this to highlight the impossibility of achieving righteousness through the law alone, as no one can perfectly keep it. This sets the stage for the introduction of righteousness through faith in Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the law on behalf of humanity. The phrase underscores the conditional nature of the law and points to the need for a savior who can provide the righteousness that the law demands but cannot impart.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses is the lawgiver who received the Ten Commandments from God on Mount Sinai.

Anything less leaves a person guilty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Moses writes</b><p>By citing Moses, Paul grounds his argument in the very Scriptures Israel treasured. Moses&#8212;author of the Pentateuch&#8212;recorded God&#8217;s own standard.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-26.htm">Deuteronomy 27:26</a> pronounces a curse on anyone who does not &#8220;confirm the words of this law by doing them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19</a> reminds us that whatever the Law says, it speaks &#8220;to those who are under the Law, so that every mouth may be silenced.&#8221;<p>When Moses writes, it is not mere opinion; it carries the full authority of God&#8217;s covenant revelation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;The man who does these things will live by them.&#8221;</b><p>Paul quotes <a href="/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a> (also echoed in <a href="/ezekiel/20-11.htm">Ezekiel 20:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The promise sounds straightforward: obey the commands, enjoy life.<p>&#8226; Yet <a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a> clarifies the hidden catch&#8212;break one point and you are guilty of all.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a> concludes that &#8220;no one will be justified in His sight by works of the law,&#8221; because the law reveals sin rather than removes it.<p>&#8226; <a href="/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11-12</a> draws the same line: &#8220;The law is not of faith; rather, &#8216;The one who does them will live by them,&#8217;&#8221; and then insists that &#8220;no one is justified before God by the law.&#8221;<p>So the quotation exposes our dilemma. Perfect performance would bring life, but none of us performs perfectly. The verse therefore prepares the way for <a href="/romans/10-6.htm">Romans 10:6-13</a>, where righteousness by faith is offered through the risen Lord Jesus.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/10-5.htm">Romans 10:5</a> reminds us that the law-based route to righteousness requires absolute, continual obedience. Moses himself put it in writing: &#8220;The man who does these things will live by them.&#8221; Scripture&#8217;s plain statement leaves no wiggle room&#8212;either keep everything or fall short. That impossibility drives us to the better way God has provided, the righteousness that comes through faith in Christ, who fulfilled the law on our behalf and offers life freely to all who believe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">For Moses describeth.</span>--The Law required an actual literal fulfilment.

"The man who doeth this righteousness" (according to a more correct text) "shall live in and by it."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the Law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by</span> (literally, in) them (<a href="/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a>). This quotation is intended to express, in the words of Moses himself, the principle of Law, viz. the requirement of entire observance of it, such as the apostle elsewhere contends is impossible (cf. <a href="/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10-12</a>). It may be objected that Moses himself, in the original passage, does not seem to be setting forth any such impossible requirement. He says, in the name of the Lord, "Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, which, if a man do, he shall live in them;" implying, it would seem, that a man might so keep them as to live in them; else were the injunction delusive. In the quotation also of the same text in <a href="/ezekiel/20-11.htm">Ezekiel 20:11, 13, 21</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/9-29.htm">Nehemiah 9:29</a>, only such a requirement as might have been fulfilled appears to be understood. But St. Paul (as appears from the context, and from <a href="/galatians/3-12.htm">Galatians 3:12</a>, where the text is similarly cited) refers to it as expressing the strict principle of law, as above defined. It, then, the text, in its original connection, seems to fall short of the sense put upon it, we may understand the apostle to quote it as a well-known one, sufficiently suggestive, if taken, as he intends it to be, in connection with others, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/27-26.htm">Deuteronomy 27:26</a>, cited with it in <a href="/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>, "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the Law to do them." It is his way to refer to familiar texts, or such as most readily occur to him, as suggestive of Old Testament ideas which he expects his readers to be acquainted with. Calvin's remarks on this whole passage deserve attention: "Lex bifariam accipitur. Nunc enim significat universam doctrinam a Mose proditam, nunc pattern illam quae ministerii ejus propria erat; quae scilicet praeceptis, praemis, et poenis continetur Quod ergo hic de justitia Legis dicitur referre convenit non ad totam Mosis functionem, sed ad partem istam quae peculiariter quodammodo ei commissa fuit." His drift is, that the passage before us intimates the strict principle of law, which it was the peculiar function of Moses to promulgate, whereas the passage which follows from Deuteronomy is significant of its <span class="accented">universa doctrina.</span> This distinction may help us to understand St. Paul's drift, in referring, as he proceeds to do, to <a href="/deuteronomy/30-11.htm">Deuteronomy 30:11-14</a>. The determination of this drift is attended with some difficulty. First, we observe that, whereas the original passage certainly refers to the Law given to the Israelites through Moses - to the same "statutes and judgments" that were the subject of the previous quotation - St. Paul applies it to describe justification through faith in Christ; and, secondly, that, in order to apply it, he alters some parts of it, and interposes comments of his own. One view is that he is only making a free-use of the words of the passage to clothe his own thoughts. So Bengel: "Ad hunc locum quasi parodia suavissime alludit, sine expressa allegatione." But his obvious intention, here as elsewhere, to support his positions from the old Scriptures surely precludes this view. Nor can he be supposed to cite the passage as simply prophetical of the gospel which was to supersede the Law, since it evidently was not so. The proper view seems to be that he adduces it as illustrating, in the first place. what Calvin calls the <span class="accented">universa doetrina</span> of the Law itself, with regard to its actual application as a <span class="accented">norma vivendi to</span> the needs of man. Here, he would say, the very Mosaic dispensation is presented to us, not as exacting any impossible obedience to the strict behests of law, but only such as the "circumcised in heart" could render, and be accepted still; it is presented to us, not as a rigid external code, enjoining and threatening, but as a word very nigh unto us, even in our heart, that we may do it; it is, in fact, an anticipation and foreshadowing of gospel salvation. In confirmation of this view of the apostle's meaning, it is to be observed that the passage occurs, not in the earlier books of Moses, but in Deuteronomy, which appears as an appendix to them, containing for the most part long discourses in the style of the prophets, wherein the Law is, as it were, spiritualized, and its <span class="accented">universa doctrina</span> opened out. In it we feel ourselves as rising out of the region of strict legal exaction into a higher and more spiritual one. Observe also that the passage before us is based on the idea of a people circumcised in heart, and loving the Lord with all the heart and all the soul (vers. 6, 20); on an ideal view of a state of favour and acceptance never realized in Jewish history, but such as we find often in the prophetic writings (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, the famous passage referred to more than once in the New Testament as having its eventual fulfilment in Christ). Thus the passage before us is legitimately referred to by St. Paul, as an intimation in the Pentateuch itself of the "righteousness which is of faith." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/10-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
