In the context of the early church, Paul addresses both Jewish and Gentile Christians, urging unity and mutual edification. The use of "each" underscores that no one is exempt from this call to action, reflecting the communal nature of the Christian faith as seen in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>, where the church is described as one body with many parts.<p><b>should please his neighbor</b><br>The term "neighbor" here extends beyond immediate proximity to include fellow believers and, by extension, all people. This echoes the commandment to love your neighbor as yourself (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, <a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>). Pleasing one's neighbor involves selflessness and a willingness to prioritize others' needs, reflecting Christ's own example of servanthood (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>).<p><b>for his good</b><br>The focus is on the well-being and spiritual growth of others. This aligns with the biblical principle of seeking the welfare of others, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/29-7.htm">Jeremiah 29:7</a>, where the Israelites are instructed to seek the peace and prosperity of the city. The "good" here is not merely temporal or material but encompasses spiritual edification and encouragement.<p><b>to build him up</b><br>This phrase highlights the goal of edification, a recurring theme in Paul's letters (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:11</a>, <a href="/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a>). The imagery of building suggests a process of strengthening and supporting, akin to constructing a solid structure. This reflects the church's role as a spiritual house (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>), where each member contributes to the growth and stability of the whole. The ultimate model for this is Christ, the cornerstone, who supports and unites the entire structure (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the Roman Christians were a diverse group of Jewish and Gentile believers living in the heart of the Roman Empire.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbors.htm">Neighbors</a></b><br>In this context, "neighbors" refers to fellow believers and those within the community whom Christians are called to serve and edify.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/selflessness_in_community.htm">Selflessness in Community</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to prioritize the well-being of others, putting their needs and spiritual growth above our own preferences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/edification_as_a_goal.htm">Edification as a Goal</a></b><br>Our interactions with others should aim to strengthen and encourage them in their faith journey, contributing to their spiritual maturity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>In a diverse community like the Roman church, pleasing our neighbors involves understanding and respecting different backgrounds and perspectives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_acts_of_kindness.htm">Practical Acts of Kindness</a></b><br>Demonstrating love through tangible actions can build up our neighbors and reflect Christ's love to the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_christ's_example.htm">Reflecting Christ's Example</a></b><br>Jesus' life exemplified serving others selflessly, and we are called to follow His example in our relationships.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_15_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 15:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_please_neighbors_daily.htm">How can we "please his neighbor" in our daily interactions with others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_build_him_up_mean.htm">What does "for his good, to build him up" mean in practical terms?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Romans_15_2_Phil_2_3-4_on_others.htm">How does Romans 15:2 connect with Philippians 2:3-4 about considering others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_Romans_15_2_in_church.htm">In what ways can we apply Romans 15:2 within our church community?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Romans_15_2_Prioritize_others_needs.htm">How does Romans 15:2 encourage us to prioritize others' needs over our own?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Romans_15_2_Prioritize_others_daily.htm">How does Romans 15:2 encourage us to prioritize others over ourselves in daily life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_shaped_Paul_s_message_in_Romans_15_2.htm">What historical context influenced Paul's message in Romans 15:2?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Romans_15_2_and_unity_in_Romans.htm">How does Romans 15:2 align with the overall theme of unity in the Book of Romans?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_romans_15.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Romans 15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_christian_edification.htm">What is Christian edification?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_adlerian_therapy.htm">What defines Adlerian Therapy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what's_the_bible's_view_on_politeness.htm">What is the Bible's stance on political correctness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/should_churches_take_on_debt.htm">Is it wrong for churches to incur debt?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Romans 15:2 Mean</div><b>Each of us</b><p><a href="/romans/15-2.htm">Romans 15:2</a> opens with &#8220;Each of us,&#8221; reminding every believer that no one is exempt.
