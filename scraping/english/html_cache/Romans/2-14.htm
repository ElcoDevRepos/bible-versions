Historically, the Gentiles were considered outside the covenant community of Israel. The absence of the law for Gentiles highlights the distinction between Jews and Gentiles in the biblical narrative. This distinction is significant in understanding the early church's struggle with integrating Gentile believers, as seen in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a> and the Jerusalem Council.<p><b>do by nature what the law requires</b><br>This suggests that Gentiles, without having the written law, instinctively follow its moral principles. This aligns with the concept of natural law, which posits that God's moral order is evident in creation and accessible to human reason. The idea that moral understanding is inherent in humanity is echoed in <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>, where humans are created in the image of God, implying an innate sense of right and wrong.<p><b>they are a law to themselves</b><br>This indicates that Gentiles, through their actions, demonstrate an internal moral compass that aligns with the law's requirements. This internal law is not written on tablets but on their hearts, as suggested in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, where God promises a new covenant with His law written on the hearts of His people. This internalization of the law points to the work of the Holy Spirit in guiding moral behavior.<p><b>even though they do not have the law</b><br>Reiterating the absence of the Mosaic Law for Gentiles, this phrase emphasizes that moral actions are not exclusive to those who possess the written law. This challenges the Jewish understanding of righteousness being tied solely to the law. It also foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles in God's redemptive plan, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of salvation reaching the ends of the earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who were not given the Mosaic Law.

The "for" at the beginning of ver. 14 connects it with the preceding one thus: "Not <span class="accented">hearers</span> but <span class="accented">doers</span> of law will be justified." The Jew, therefore, has no advantage in the way of justification over the Gentile from being in a peculiar sense a <span class="accented">hearer. For</span> Gentiles also may be <span class="accented">doers</span>, though not of a positive revealed law, yet of the law of conscience. It is not, of course, implied that on the <span class="accented">ground</span> of any such <span class="accented">doing</span> they "shall be justified;" only that, so far as they <span class="accented">do</span>, they will, equally with the Jews, be rewarded. Nor is it said that any, in fact, do <span class="accented">all</span> that law enjoins. We observe the hypothetical form of expression, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc7;</span>, and also, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> any of the Law's requirements. The Law, for instance, says, "Thou shalt not steal;" and if a Gentile, though knowing nothing of the ten commandments, on principle refrains from stealing, his conscientious honesty will have its own reward as much as that of the Jew who refrains in obedience to the revealed commandment. A few of the expressions in these verses call for consideration. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> What is meant by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, said to be "written in their hearts"? <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> cannot be pleonastic, as supposed by Tholuck. One view is that it is equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, which is an expression frequently used elsewhere (<a href="/romans/3-27.htm">Romans 3:27, 28</a>; <a href="/romans/9-32.htm">Romans 9:32</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2, 5, 10</a>); and the singular number has been explained as <span class="accented">collective</span>, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-4.htm">Galatians 6:4</a>, and ver. 7 above (so Meyer), or as "<span class="accented">applying</span> to each of the particular cases supposed in the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (so Alford). The objection to this view is that it is not the <span class="accented">works</span> of the Law that can be said to be <span class="accented">written</span>, but rather the Law itself from which the works proceed. Seeing that <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> implies evident reference to the tables of the Law, it seems best to take <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> as denoting the <span class="accented">efficacy</span> of the Law, as opposed to the <span class="accented">letter</span>, which alone was written on the tables.

The very possibility of their doing this is evidence of an innate moral sense in the human heart, which, however it may often be obscured or perverted, remains as a characteristic of humanity, and is more or less operative in all communities. "Nulls enim gens unquam sic ab humanitate abhorruit ut non se intra leges aliquas contineret. Constat absque dubio quasdam justitiae et rectitudinis conceptiones, quas Graeci <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> recant, hominum animis esse naturaliter ingenitas" (Calvin). <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> What is exactly meant by the <span class="accented">conscience</span> witnessing, and the <span class="accented">thoughts</span> accusing or else excusing? <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is not the Law in the heart, but rather our <span class="accented">consciousness</span>, whereby wittingly, in accordance with that Law, we approve or condemn. The compound verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> seems to denote a <span class="accented">joint</span> witness of conscience. In <a href="/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16</a> and Romans 9:1, where alone the word occurs elsewhere, it is followed by a dative, and means certainly <span class="accented">concurrent</span> witness. But, if so here, with what? Probably with the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> already spoken cf. Right conduct on principle, and conscience approving, witness together to the inward law; or, conduct and conscience together witness to a man's merits or demerits in accordance with that law. Then, what is added about the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> shows how conscience operates. Reason comes into play, evoked by conscience, to reflect on its witness, and definitely condemn or approve what has been done. A kind of court of judicature is supposed. Man calls himself to the bar of his own moral judgment; his conscience adduces witness to the character of his deeds, or rather, with his deeds bears witness for or against himself; his thoughts are as advocates on both sides, arguing for condemnation or acquittal. "Observa quam erudite describat conscientiam, quum dicit nobis venire in mentem rationes, quibus quod recte factum est defendimus; rursum quae nos flagitiorum accusent et redarguant" (Calvin). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/2-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Indeed,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
