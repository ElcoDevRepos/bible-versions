This grace is a divine enablement for his ministry, emphasizing that his message is not from personal merit but from God's favor. This aligns with <a href="/ephesians/3-7.htm">Ephesians 3:7-8</a>, where Paul speaks of the grace given to him to preach to the Gentiles. The concept of grace is central to Paul's theology, highlighting God's unmerited favor and empowerment for service.<p><b>I say to every one of you:</b><br>Paul addresses all believers in the Roman church, indicating the universal applicability of his message. This inclusivity reflects the nature of the church as a body of diverse members, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>, where Paul discusses the unity and diversity of the body of Christ. The Roman church was composed of both Jewish and Gentile believers, and Paul's message transcends cultural and ethnic boundaries.<p><b>Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought,</b><br>Paul warns against pride and self-exaltation, a common human tendency. This admonition is rooted in the biblical principle of humility, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, which warns that pride precedes destruction. In the cultural context of Rome, where social status and honor were highly valued, this teaching challenges believers to adopt a countercultural mindset. Jesus exemplified humility, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>, where He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to death on a cross.<p><b>but think of yourself with sober judgment,</b><br>Paul calls for a balanced and realistic self-assessment. The term "sober judgment" implies clarity and self-control, avoiding both pride and false humility. This aligns with <a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>, which encourages believers to humble themselves under God's mighty hand. The Greek word for "sober" (s&#333;phrone&#333;) suggests soundness of mind, emphasizing the importance of a clear and accurate understanding of one's identity in Christ.<p><b>according to the measure of faith God has given you.</b><br>Paul introduces the concept of a "measure of faith," which suggests that God apportions faith to each believer for their specific role and function within the body of Christ. This is consistent with <a href="/1_corinthians/12-7.htm">1 Corinthians 12:7-11</a>, where spiritual gifts are distributed by the Holy Spirit for the common good. The "measure of faith" implies that believers should operate within the sphere of faith God has granted them, recognizing their dependence on Him for their abilities and service. This measure is not a comparison with others but a personal endowment for fulfilling God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Romans, Paul is writing to the Christian community in Rome.

Doing so preserves unity, honors the Giver of all gifts, and enables the body of Christ to function as He intended.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) Having thus stated the broad principle which is to govern the conduct of the Christian, the Apostle now goes on to apply it to certain details, and, first, his object is to secure that temper in the members of the Roman Church which will best enable them to act with union and efficiency.<p><span class= "bld">Through the grace given unto me</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in virtue of his apostolic authority.<p><span class= "bld">To every man that is among you.</span>--A rather more pointed expression than simply "to you all," "to each one of you severally and individually."<p><span class= "bld">Not to</span> <span class= "bld">think</span> <span class= "bld">of himself</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--There is a play upon words in this phrase, and those which follow, which is not preserved, and can hardly be preserved, in the English. "Not to be high-minded beyond that which he ought to be minded, but to be minded unto sober-mindedness." Our words, "to be minded," "high-minded," &c., very nearly express the sense of the Greek, which is to have the thoughts and feelings habitually turned in a certain direction. This is brought out with emphatic repetition in the phrase "to be minded unto the being sober-minded," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to keep sobriety of mind constantly in view as the object or ideal towards which all the thoughts and feelings converge.<p><span class= "bld">According as God hath dealt to every man.</span>--The standard of action which each Christian ought to propose to himself should be in proportion to the amount of his faith as given to him by God. He who has the strongest faith may assume the highest standard, and offer himself for the highest offices, and so on down the scale. It is, however, essential that the estimate which each man puts upon the strength of his own faith, should be thoroughly single-minded and sincere, nor biased by self-love. The Apostle assumes that this will be the case.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I say, through the grace given unto me</span> (the grace of apostleship to the Gentiles (cf. <a href="/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>; <a href="/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15</a>). He is about to warn against either neglecting or exceeding the special graces given to each person; and he may, perhaps, mean to imply here that he himself, in giving these admonitions, is exercising, without exceeding, his own special grace) <span class="cmt_word">to every man that is among you</span> (this is emphatic. The pretensions to superiority of some at Corinth who possessed more showy gifts than others had shown how the admonition might need to be pressed on all; and in a community like that of the Romans there might well be a special tendency to assumption on the part of some), <span class="cmt_word">not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly</span> (rather, as in the Revised Version <span class="accented">so to think as to think soberly</span>, or, more literally, <span class="accented">to be minded so as to be sober-minded</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith</span>. Why <span class="accented">of faith?</span> One might have expected the expression to be, "of grace," as in ver. 6, "according to the grace that is given to us;" or as in <a href="/ephesians/4-7.htm">Ephesians 4:7</a>, "according to the measure [<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as here] of the <span class="accented">gift</span> of Christ." It seems to be because by faith we become <span class="accented">receptive</span> of the grace given to each of us. Hence the faith assigned by God to each is regarded as "the regulative standard; the subjective condition" (Meyer)of the several gifts or graces. Cf. also <a href="/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>, where miraculous powers are spoken of as dependent on the amount of faith. Tholuck explains thus: "Faith in an unseen Christ brings man into connection with a world unseen, in which he moves without distinctly apprehending it; and in proportion as he learns to look with faith to that world, the more is the measure of his spiritual powers elevated." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/12-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
