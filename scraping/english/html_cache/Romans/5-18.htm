Adam's disobedience to God's command not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil resulted in sin entering the world, bringing spiritual death and separation from God to all humanity (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>). This concept of original sin is foundational in Christian theology, emphasizing the fallen nature of mankind and the need for redemption. The idea of one man's sin affecting all is echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>, "For as in Adam all die..."<p><b>so also one act of righteousness brought justification and life for all men</b><br>This phrase highlights the redemptive work of Jesus Christ through His obedience and sacrificial death on the cross. The "one act of righteousness" refers to Christ's atonement, which provides the means for justification&#8212;being declared righteous before God. This is a central theme in the New Testament, where Christ is seen as the second Adam, who rectifies the fall of the first Adam (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>). The concept of justification by faith is further elaborated in <a href="/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24-26</a>, where it is explained that believers are justified freely by God's grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. The phrase "life for all men" underscores the availability of eternal life to all who accept Christ's sacrifice, aligning with <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, which speaks of God's love and the promise of eternal life through belief in His Son.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam.htm">Adam</a></b><br>The first man created by God, whose disobedience in the Garden of Eden led to the fall of humanity and the introduction of sin and death into the world.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The Son of God, whose sacrificial death and resurrection provided the means for justification and eternal life for all who believe.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fall.htm">The Fall</a></b><br>The event in which Adam and Eve disobeyed God, resulting in the entrance of sin into the world and the subsequent condemnation of all humanity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/justification.htm">Justification</a></b><br>A legal term signifying the act of God declaring a sinner righteous on the basis of faith in Jesus Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/condemnation.htm">Condemnation</a></b><br>The state of being declared guilty and deserving of punishment due to sin, as a result of Adam's trespass.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_sin_and_redemption.htm">The Universality of Sin and Redemption</a></b><br>Adam's sin affected all humanity, bringing universal condemnation.
