"Through Him" indicates that it is only by the power and authority of Christ that the apostles can carry out their mission. The phrase "on behalf of His name" underscores the purpose of their mission: to glorify and represent Jesus. In biblical times, a name was more than just a label; it represented the character and authority of a person. Thus, the apostles' work is done under the authority and for the glory of Jesus Christ, aligning with passages like <a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>, which speaks of salvation being found in no other name.<p><b>we received grace and apostleship</b><br>The "grace" mentioned here refers to the unmerited favor and empowerment given by God to the apostles. This grace is not only for personal salvation but also for the specific calling and equipping for ministry. "Apostleship" denotes the office and mission given to the apostles, particularly Paul, who was called to be an apostle to the Gentiles (<a href="/galatians/2-8.htm">Galatians 2:8</a>). This dual gift of grace and apostleship highlights the divine initiative and empowerment in the spread of the Gospel, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/3-7.htm">Ephesians 3:7-8</a>, where Paul speaks of becoming a servant of the Gospel by the gift of God's grace.<p><b>to call all those among the Gentiles</b><br>The mission to the Gentiles is a significant theme in Paul's ministry. This phrase indicates the universal scope of the Gospel, breaking the boundaries of Jewish exclusivity and extending God's salvation to all nations. This aligns with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations. Historically, the inclusion of Gentiles was a radical shift, challenging Jewish cultural and religious norms. Paul's role as the apostle to the Gentiles is further emphasized in <a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>, where God declares that Paul is His chosen instrument to carry His name before the Gentiles.<p><b>to the obedience that comes from faith</b><br>This phrase highlights the relationship between faith and obedience in the Christian life. True faith in Christ results in a transformed life characterized by obedience to God's commands. This is not a legalistic obedience but one that flows naturally from a genuine faith. <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a> reinforces this by stating that faith without works is dead. The obedience of faith is a recurring theme in Paul's writings, as seen in <a href="/romans/16-26.htm">Romans 16:26</a>, where he speaks of the mystery of the Gospel being revealed to lead to the obedience of faith among all nations. This obedience is a response to the grace received and is empowered by the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, who received grace and apostleship to spread the Gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The "Him" through whom grace and apostleship are received, central to the message of the Gospel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who are called to obedience through faith, highlighting the universal scope of the Gospel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rome.htm">Rome</a></b><br>The city to which the letter is addressed, representing a diverse audience of both Jews and Gentiles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/grace_and_apostleship.htm">Grace and Apostleship</a></b><br>The divine gifts and mission given to Paul to spread the Gospel message.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/grace_as_a_gift.htm">Grace as a Gift</a></b><br>Recognize that grace is an unmerited favor from God, empowering us to fulfill our calling.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/apostleship_and_mission.htm">Apostleship and Mission</a></b><br>Understand that apostleship involves being sent with a purpose, and each believer has a role in God's mission.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_from_faith.htm">Obedience from Faith</a></b><br>True obedience stems from a faith relationship with Christ, not merely from following rules.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/universal_call.htm">Universal Call</a></b><br>The Gospel is for all people, regardless of background, and we are called to share it inclusively.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_for_his_name.htm">Living for His Name</a></b><br>Our actions and mission should be motivated by a desire to honor and glorify Jesus' name.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_1_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 1:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_1_5_s_daily_faith_guidance.htm">How does Romans 1:5 encourage us to live out our faith daily?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_obedience_of_faith_in_Rom_1_5.htm">What does "obedience of faith" mean in the context of Romans 1:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_Christ_s_grace_today.htm">How can we apply the "grace and apostleship" received through Christ today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Romans_1_5_to_Matthew_28_19-20.htm">How does Romans 1:5 connect with the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19-20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_promote_global_faith_obedience.htm">In what ways can we promote "obedience of faith" among all nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_obedience_of_faith_in_Rom_1_5_2.htm">What does "obedience of faith" mean in Romans 1:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_is_apostleship_s_purpose_in_Romans_1_5.htm">How does Romans 1:5 define the purpose of apostleship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_link_grace_with_apostleship_in_Romans.htm">Why is grace mentioned alongside apostleship in Romans 1:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_romans_1.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Romans 1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_the_true_gospel.htm">What defines the true gospel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_self-forgiveness.htm">What does the Bible say about self-forgiveness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/meaning_of_'by_grace_through_faith'.htm">What does "by grace through faith" mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_does_2_cor_3_17_align_with_obedience.htm">How can Paul&#8217;s claim in 2 Corinthians 3:17 that &#8220;where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom&#8221; be reconciled with other biblical texts that emphasize strict obedience to divine commands?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Romans 1:5 Mean</div><b>Through Him</b><p>Jesus Christ is the sole channel of God&#8217;s saving work.

St. Augustine notes that grace is common to the Apostle with all believers--his apostleship is something special and peculiar; yet apostleship is an instance, or case, of grace. Origen distinguishes between the two--"grace for the endurance of labours, apostleship for authority in preaching;" but both terms are perhaps somewhat wider than this. Apostleship includes all those privileges which St. Paul possessed as an Apostle; grace is all those privileges that he possessed as a Christian. At the same time, in either case the meaning tends in the direction of that particular object which is expressed in the next clause. The light in which the Apostle valued most the gifts that had been bestowed upon him, was inasmuch as they enabled him to preach the gospel to the Gentiles.<p><span class= "bld">For obedience to the faith among all nations.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">For</span> (to produce) <span class= "ital">obedience of faith</span> (the obedience which springs from faith) <span class= "ital">among all the Gentiles.</span><p>Faith is not here equivalent to "<span class= "ital">the</span> faith"--a positive body of doctrine received and believed--but, in its strict sense, that active habit and attitude of mind by which the Christian shows his devotion and loyalty to Christ, and his total dependence on Him (<a href="/galatians/2-19.htm" title="For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live to God.">Galatians 2:19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">For his name.</span>--<span class= "ital">For His name's sake.</span> "His," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Christ's. The whole of that divine economy of which St. Paul himself forms part, tends to the glory of Christ. The Apostle's call to his office, his special endowment for his ministry, the success of his preaching among the Gentiles, as they proceed from Christ, so also have for their object the extension of His kingdom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Through whom we received grace and apostleship, unto obedience of faith among all the nations, for his Name's sake</span>. "We" here means, not Christians generally, but Paul himself (though probably, as also in all other cases where he similarly uses this plural, with the intention of including others, here his fellow-apostles); for the "grace" spoken of is evidently from what follows a special grace for the apostolic office to which he had been called. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span> occurs in a like sense in <a href="/acts/1-25.htm">Acts 1:25</a>. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., denotes the purpose of his apostleship, viz. to bring men everywhere, of whatever race, to believe and obey the gospel; not to a belief in it only, but to the obedience which comes of faith, or which faith renders.

So Meyer, who refers to passages where a genitive after <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;</span> has this meaning: <a href="/2_corinthians/10-5.htm">2 Corinthians 10:5</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <a href="/1_peter/1-22.htm">1 Peter 1:22</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); and also to <a href="/acts/6-7.htm">Acts 6:7</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f58;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The last of these quotations would have been peculiarly apposite in support of the interpretation contended for, were not <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> in the text now before us anarthrous, so as to suggest <span class="accented">subjective</span> faith, rather than "the faith delivered to the saints," as in <a href="/acts/6-7.htm">Acts 6:7</a>. The question is, after all, of no importance with regard to the essential idea intended to be conveyed. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> seems to point especially to St. Paul's own apostleship (cf. <a href="/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-8.htm">Galatians 2:8, 9</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1, 8</a>), though, of course, the apostleship of all, wherever exercised, had a similar worldwide purpose. In using the expression here, he anticipates what he is about to say as to his not shrinking from addressing even the Romans with authority; his mission being to <span class="accented">all</span> the nations. <span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> is best connected with "obedience of faith." The phrase is of frequent occurrence (cf. <a href="/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>; <a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>; <a href="/acts/15-26.htm">Acts 15:26</a>; <a href="/acts/21-13.htm">Acts 21:13</a>; also <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:12</a>). It is most usually connected with the idea of suffering in behalf of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/1-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Through</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(di&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Him]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;</span> <span class="translit">(hou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[and] on behalf of</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#960;&#8050;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(hyper)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5228.htm">Strong's 5228: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gen: in behalf of; acc: above. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">His</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
