The call to submit is not limited to a specific group but applies to all believers. In the context of the Roman Empire, where Paul was writing, the governing authorities were often oppressive and pagan. Yet, Paul instructs Christians to submit, reflecting a broader biblical principle of respecting and obeying authority (<a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13-17</a>). This submission is not absolute, as seen in <a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>, where Peter and the apostles assert that obedience to God takes precedence over human authority when the two are in conflict.<p><b>for there is no authority except that which is from God</b><br>This phrase underscores the sovereignty of God over all earthly powers. It reflects the biblical worldview that God is the ultimate source of all authority, as seen in <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, where God is described as the one who "changes times and seasons; he deposes kings and raises up others." This understanding provides comfort and assurance to believers, knowing that even imperfect human governments are under God's control. It also serves as a reminder of God's providence and the divine order established in creation.<p><b>The authorities that exist have been appointed by God</b><br>This statement reinforces the idea that all existing authorities are established by divine appointment. It echoes the Old Testament teaching found in <a href="/proverbs/8-15.htm">Proverbs 8:15-16</a>, where wisdom personified declares, "By me kings reign and rulers issue decrees that are just; by me princes govern, and nobles&#8212;all who rule on earth." This perspective encourages believers to view political and social structures as part of God's plan, even when they do not align with personal or cultural preferences. It also calls for a recognition of God's ultimate purpose and plan, which can work through any government, as seen in the lives of biblical figures like Joseph and Daniel, who served under foreign rulers yet remained faithful to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans,

Cooperation with rightful authority honors God, steadies society, and bears witness to the gospel. Resistance is reserved only for commands that contradict God&#8217;s higher law, and even then is carried out with respect and trust in His sovereign rule.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XIII.</span><p>(1-7) <span class= "bld">Subject unto the higher powers.</span>--Looking impartially at the passage which follows, it would seem at first sight--and perhaps not only at first sight--that the Apostle distinctly preaches two doctrines, both of which are now discredited, the doctrines of divine right and of passive obedience. The duty of obedience is grounded upon the fact that the power wielded by the magistrate is derived from God, and that duty itself is stated without qualification.<p>What are we to understand by this? Are we to say, for instance, that Hampden was wrong in refusing the payment of ship-money? Or if he was not wrong--and the verdict of mankind has generally justified his act--what are we to think of the language that is here used by St. Paul?<p>1. In the first place it should be noticed that though the duty of obedience is here stated without qualification, still the existence of qualifications to it is not therefore denied or excluded. Tribute is to be paid to whom tribute is due. But this still leaves the question open, whether in any particular case tribute is rightfully due or not. There may possibly be a conflict of rights and duties, and the lower may have to yield to the higher. All that is alleged is that, <span class= "ital">prima facie,</span> the magistrate can claim the obedience of the subject. But supposing the magistrate calls upon the subject to do that which some other authority co-ordinate with that of the magistrate forbids--supposing, for instance, as in the case of Hampden, under a constitutional monarchy, the king commands one thing, and the Parliament another--there is clearly a conflict of obligations, and the decision which accepts the one obligation is not necessarily wrong because it ignores the other. There will always be a certain debatable ground within which opposite duties will seem to clash, and where general principles are no longer of any avail. Here the individual conscience must assume the responsibility of deciding which to obey.<p>We are not called upon to enter into the casuistry of the subject. It may only be well to add one caution. Any such seemingly direct collision of duties must be at the very lightest a most serious and difficult matter; and though the burden of deciding falls ultimately on the individual, still he must be careful to remember that his particular judgment is subject to that fallibility to which, all individual judgments are liable. Where the precept is appealed to, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's," one man will say that the particular point in question comes under the first head, another that it comes under the second. In either case a great responsibility is assumed, and it is especially desirable that the judgment of the individual should be fortified by the consent of others, if possible by the suffrages of the majority of those who are in a position to judge. It is one thing to say that a conflict of duties may arise, and that the higher is to be obeyed. It is another thing to say that in a certain given case such conflict has arisen, and that the duty which commends itself to the individual is the higher of the two. Whatever the decision arrived at, it ought not to be made in a spirit of levity, nor ought it to be supposed that the dictum of the single conscience bears anything like the same validity as the universal principles of morals. And there will be the further drawback, that in such cases the individual usually acts as judge in his own cause, where his conscience is pretty sure to be biased. There is therefore a very strong <span class= "ital">onus probandi</span> thrown upon the person who takes upon himself to overrule what is in itself a clear obligation.<p>2. But the question of political obedience cannot be rightly considered without taking into account the relation of Christianity to political life generally, neither can this isolated passage in an Epistle of St. Paul's be considered apart from other teaching upon the same subjects in the rest of the New Testament. Very similar language, it will be remembered, is found in <a href="/context/1_peter/2-13.htm" title="Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;">1Peter 2:13-17</a>. And going back to the fountain-head of Christian doctrine, we find, indeed, no express statements, but several significant facts and some important intimations. When He was arrested by the civil power, and unjustly tried and condemned, our Lord made no resistance. Not only so, but when resistance was made on His behalf, He rebuked the disciple who had drawn the sword for Him. When the didrachma was demanded of Him, which it was customary for the Jew to pay towards the repair and maintenance of the Temple, He, though as Lord of the Temple He claimed exemption, nevertheless, for fear of putting a stumbling-block in the way of others, supplied the sum required by a miracle. On another occasion, when a question was asked as to the legitimacy of the Roman tribute, He replied in words already quoted, "Render to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's." And, lastly, when appeal was made to Him to settle a disputed inheritance, He refused, saying to His petitioner, "Man, who made Me a judge or a divider over you?" Here we have really the key to the whole question. So far as His practice was concerned, our Lord pursued a course of simple obedience; into the theory of political or civil obligation He absolutely refused to enter. The answer, "Render to Caesar," &c., left matters precisely as they stood, for the real question was, "What was Caesar's, and what was not?<span class= "ital">"</span> The ambiguity of the reply was intended. It was practically a refusal to reply at all.<p>The significance of this comes out very strikingly when it is contrasted with the state of feeling and opinion current among the Jews at the same time. With them politics and religion were intimately blended. They carried into the former sphere the fanaticism natural to the latter. Their religious hopes took a political form. The dominion of the Messiah was to be not a spiritual, but a literal dominion, in which they, as a people, were to share.<p>Clearly, the relations which our Lord assumed towards politics had especial reference to this attitude of the Jews. He wished to disabuse His disciples once and for all of this fatal confusion of two spheres in themselves so distinct. He wished to purify and to spiritualise their conception of the "Kingdom of Heaven," which He came to found. And, lastly, He finally submitted to the civil power, as the instrument divinely employed to inflict upon Him those sufferings which were to be the cause of our redemption. <span class= "ital">Vicit patiendo.</span><p>It would seem as if by some intuitive perception the disciples entered into the intention of their Master. Towards the civil power they maintained an attitude of absolute submission. They refused to avail themselves of the elements of fanaticism which existed wherever there were Jews, and at the head of which they might easily have placed themselves. Instead of this, they chose to suffer and die, and their sufferings did what force could never have done--they leavened and Christianised the world.<p>3. It is an expression of this deliberate policy (if by that name it may be called) which we find in these first seven verses of Romans 13. At the same time, the Apostle may very well have had a special as well as a general object. The Church at Rome was largely composed of Jews, and these would naturally be imbued with the fanatical spirit of their countrymen. The very mention of the Messiah would tend to fan their smouldering passions into flame. The Apostle would be aware of this. His informants at Rome may have told him of excitement prevailing among the Jewish portion of the community. His experience in Palestine would tell him to what unscrupulous acts of violence this might lead. And he forestalls the danger by an authoritative and reasoned description of the attitude which the Christian ought to assume. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - From admonitions to keep peace, if possible, with all men, whether or not within the Christian circle, and to act honourably and benevolently towards all, the apostle now passes to <span class="accented">the duty of Christians towards the civil government and the laws of the country in which they lived.</span> It is well known that the Jews were impatient of the Roman dominion, and that some held it to be unlawful, on religious grounds, to pay tribute to Caesar (<a href="/matthew/22-17.htm">Matthew 22:17</a>). Insurrections against the government had consequently been frequent. There had been the notable one under Judas the Gaulonite of Gamala (called <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="/acts/5-37.htm">Acts 5:37</a>), who left followers behind him, called Gaulonites, and to whose tenets Josephus attributes all subsequent insurrections of the Jews ('Ant.,' 18:01. &sect; 1). Recently one had broken out in Rome, which had caused Claudius to order the expulsion of all Jews from the city (<a href="/acts/17-2.htm">Acts 17:2</a>; cf. Suetonius, 'Claud.,' 25; Din Cassius, 60:6). The Christians, being regarded as a Jewish sect, and known for their acknowledgment of a Messiah and their refusal to comply with heathen usages, were not unnaturally confounded with such disturbers of the peace (cf. <a href="/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6, 7</a>; <a href="/acts/21-37.htm">Acts 21:37</a>). It was, therefore, peculiarly needful that the Christian communities should be cautioned to disprove such accusations by showing themselves in all respects good, law-abiding subjects. They might easily be under a temptation to be otherwise. Feeling themselves already subjects of Christ's new kingdom, and regarding the second advent as probably near at hand, they might seem to themselves above the powers and institutions of the unbelieving world, which were so soon to pass away. St. Paul himself condemned resort to heathen tribunals in matters which Christians might settle among themselves (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-1.htm">1 Corinthians 6:1</a>, etc.); and many might go so far as to ignore the authority of such tribunals over the saints at all. Peter and John had at the first defied the authority even of the Sanhedrin in matters touching conscience (<a href="/acts/4-19.htm">Acts 4:19</a>); and many might be slow to distinguish between temporal and spiritual spheres of jurisdiction. St. Paul, therefore, lays down the rule that the civil government, in whatsoever hands it might be, was, no less than the Church, a Divine institution for the maintenance of order in the world, to be submitted to and obeyed by Christians within the whole sphere of its legitimate authority. He does not refer to cases in which it might become necessary to obey God rather than man: his purpose here does not call on him to do so; nor were the circumstances so far such as to bring such cases into prominence; for he was writing in the earlier part of Nero's reign, before any general persecution of Christians had begun. Nor does he touch on the question whether it may be right in some cases for subjects to resist usurped power or tyranny, or to take part in political revolutions, and even fight for freedom. Such a question was apart from his subject, which is the general duty of obedience to the law and government under which we are placed by Providence. This is the only passage in which he treats the subject at length and definitely. In a doctrinal and practical treatise like this Epistle, addressed as an <span class="accented">apologia pro fide sua</span> to the metropolis of the world and the seat of government, it was fitting that he should express clearly the attitude of the Church with regard to the civil order. But his teaching in other Epistles is in accordance with this; as where (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-21.htm">1 Corinthians 7:21</a>) he bids slaves acquiesce in the existing law of slavery, and (<a href="/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1</a>, etc.) he desires especially prayers to be made in behalf of kings and rulers. And he himself notably carried out his principles in this regard (cf. <a href="/acts/23-5.htm">Acts 23:5</a>; <a href="/acts/25-8.htm">Acts 25:8-11</a>). There is a closely similar passage in the First Epistle of St. Peter (<a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12-18</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of</span> (rather, <span class="accented">from</span>) <span class="cmt_word">God: the powers that be are ordained of God</span>. It is of God's ordering that there should be human governments and human laws. Without them there could be no order, security, or progress among mankind. Imperfect as they may often be, and in some instances oppressive and unjust, still they exist for a purpose of good, and form part of the Divine order for the government of the world. In this sense all are from God, and ordained of God; and in submitting to them we are submitting to God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/13-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Everyone</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#8118;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Pasa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
