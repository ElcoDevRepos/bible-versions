Welcoming someone "in the Lord" suggests a spiritual kinship and unity among believers. It reflects the idea that all Christians are part of the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>) and should treat each other with love and respect. The early church often met in homes, and hospitality was crucial for the spread of the Gospel (<a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46-47</a>).<p><b>in a manner worthy of the saints</b><br>The term "saints" refers to all believers, set apart for God&#8217;s purposes.

It echoes the call to live a life worthy of the calling received (<a href="/ephesians/4.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>).

The early church was known for its generosity and care for one another (<a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>). The phrase suggests a readiness to provide for physical, emotional, and spiritual needs, reflecting the teachings of Jesus to love one another (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>).<p><b>For she has been a great help to many people</b><br>This acknowledges the significant contributions of the individual being referred to, likely Phoebe, mentioned in <a href="/romans/16.htm">Romans 16:1</a>. Her role as a helper or benefactor indicates she may have been a person of means or influence, using her resources to support the church. This aligns with the biblical principle of stewardship and using one's gifts for the kingdom (<a href="/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>).<p><b>including me</b><br>Paul's personal acknowledgment of her help underscores the interconnectedness of the early Christian community. It reflects the apostle's gratitude and recognition of the vital role that women played in the ministry.
