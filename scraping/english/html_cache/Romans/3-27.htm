In the Jewish tradition, boasting could be linked to adherence to the Law of Moses, which was seen as a source of righteousness. Paul challenges this notion by questioning the place of boasting in the light of God's grace. This echoes <a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23-24</a>, where the Lord declares that the only legitimate boasting is in understanding and knowing Him.<p><b>It is excluded.</b><br>Paul emphatically states that boasting is not permissible in the context of salvation. This exclusion is rooted in the understanding that salvation is a gift from God, not a result of human effort or merit. <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a> reinforces this by stating that salvation is by grace through faith, not by works, so that no one can boast. This principle underscores the humility required in the Christian faith, recognizing that all glory belongs to God.<p><b>On what principle?</b><br>The principle in question refers to the basis or foundation upon which boasting is excluded. Paul is addressing the underlying reason for the exclusion of boasting, which is crucial for understanding the nature of salvation. This rhetorical question sets the stage for contrasting two different systems: works and faith.<p><b>On that of works?</b><br>The principle of works refers to the belief that one can earn righteousness through adherence to the Law or through good deeds. In the Jewish context, the Law was central to religious life, and many believed that following it meticulously could lead to justification before God. However, Paul argues that the Law cannot justify, as seen in <a href="/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>, which states that a person is not justified by works of the Law but through faith in Jesus Christ.<p><b>No, but on that of faith.</b><br>Paul concludes that the principle excluding boasting is faith, not works. This faith is a trust in Jesus Christ and His redemptive work on the cross. <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a> highlights that "the righteous will live by faith," a concept rooted in <a href="/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>. This faith-based righteousness is a key theme in Paul's letters, emphasizing that it is through faith in Christ, not human effort, that one is justified. This principle aligns with the broader biblical narrative of God's grace and the fulfillment of the Law through Christ, who is the ultimate expression of God's promise and salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Romans, Paul is addressing the Roman church, emphasizing the doctrine of justification by faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roman_church.htm">The Roman Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile believers, who were grappling with the implications of faith and works in salvation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_and_gentile_believers.htm">Jewish and Gentile Believers</a></b><br>The two groups within the Roman church, each with different backgrounds and understandings of the law and grace.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/exclusion_of_boasting.htm">Exclusion of Boasting</a></b><br>Boasting is excluded because salvation is not based on human effort or achievement but on faith in Christ.

How does it affect the pretensions of the Jew? It shuts them out by laying stress no longer on works, which were the proper fulfilment of the first law as it stood, but upon faith. Faith is the true medium of justification. And faith belongs as much to Gentile as to Jew. For faith is the appointed means by which all mankind will be justified; and they will all be justified before the same tribunal, whether they be circumcised or not. Still this involves no abrogation of the Law, but rather a confirmation of it.<p>(27) <span class= "bld">It is excluded.</span>--Strictly, <span class= "ital">It was excluded</span>--at the moment when the law of faith--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the gospel--was brought in.<p><span class= "bld">By what law?</span>--Properly, <span class= "ital">By what kind of law?</span> Is this law which gets rid of boasting one which calls for works; or is it one that calls for faith?<p><span class= "bld">The law of faith.</span>--Another name for the gospel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where then is the boasting?</span> (that of the Jew, referred to in ch. 2, of his superiority to the Gentile with regard to justification).
