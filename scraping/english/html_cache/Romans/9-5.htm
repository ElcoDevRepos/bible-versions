These figures are foundational in the history of Israel and are seen as the forefathers of the Jewish nation. <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12-50</a> details their lives and God's covenant with them, which includes promises of land, descendants, and blessing. The patriarchs are significant because they are the recipients of God's promises, which are fulfilled in Christ. The covenantal relationship established with them is a key theme throughout the Old Testament and is foundational for understanding God's redemptive plan.<p><b>and from them proceeds the human descent of Christ</b><br>This highlights the Jewish lineage of Jesus, affirming His humanity and fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. Jesus is a descendant of David, as prophesied in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a> and confirmed in the genealogies of <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a> and <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a>. This lineage is crucial for establishing Jesus as the legitimate Messiah, fulfilling the promises made to the patriarchs and the Davidic covenant. It underscores the continuity of God's plan from the Old Testament to the New Testament.<p><b>who is God over all</b><br>This phrase affirms the deity of Christ, a central tenet of Christian theology. It echoes <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>, where Jesus is identified as the Word who was with God and was God. This declaration of Christ's divinity is consistent with other New Testament passages, such as <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a> and <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>, which describe Jesus as the image of the invisible God and the exact representation of His being. The phrase emphasizes the supremacy and sovereignty of Christ over all creation.<p><b>forever worthy of praise!</b><br>This doxology reflects the eternal nature and worthiness of Christ to receive worship. It aligns with <a href="/revelation/5-12.htm">Revelation 5:12-13</a>, where Jesus is praised by every creature in heaven and on earth. The eternal praise of Christ is a theme throughout Scripture, highlighting His role in creation, redemption, and His ultimate reign. This phrase calls believers to acknowledge and worship Jesus as Lord and Savior.<p><b>Amen</b><br>"Amen" is a Hebrew word meaning "truly" or "so be it," often used to affirm the truthfulness of a statement. In this context, it serves as a conclusion to the doxology, affirming the truth of Christ's divinity and worthiness of praise. It is a common liturgical response in both Jewish and Christian traditions, signifying agreement and certainty in the truths expressed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_patriarchs.htm">The Patriarchs</a></b><br>Refers to the forefathers of the Israelite nation, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

Trinitarian and English interpreters, as a rule, take them with the punctuation of the Authorised version, as referring to Christ. Socinian interpreters, with some of the most eminent among the Germans, put a full stop after "came," and make the remainder of the verse a doxology addressed to God, "Blessed for ever be God, who is over all." Both ways are possible. The question is, Which is the most natural and probable? and this is to be considered, putting altogether on one side prepossessions of every kind. We are not to read meaning <span class= "ital">into</span> Scripture, but to elicit meaning <span class= "ital">from</span> it. The balance of the argument stands thus:--(1) The order of the words is somewhat in favour of the application to Christ. If the clause had really been a formal doxology, the ascription of blessing would more naturally have come at the beginning in Greek as in English, "Blessed be God," &c. (2) The context is also somewhat in favour of this application. The break in the form of the sentence becomes rather abrupt on the other hypothesis, and is not to be quite paralleled. Intruded doxologies, caused by a sudden access of pious feeling, are not uncommon in the writings of St. Paul, but they are either worked into the regular order of the sentence, as in <a href="/romans/1-25.htm" title="Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.">Romans 1:25</a>, <a href="/galatians/1-5.htm" title="To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.">Galatians 1:5</a>, or else they are formally introduced as in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-31.htm" title="The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for ever more, knows that I lie not.">2Corinthians 11:31</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-17.htm" title="Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.">1Timothy 1:17</a>. (3) But on the other hand, to set somewhat decidedly against this application, is the fact that the words used by the Apostle, "Who is over all," and the ascription of blessing in all other places where they occur, are referred, not to Christ, but to God. (Comp. <a href="/romans/1-25.htm" title="Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.">Romans 1:25</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;">2Corinthians 1:3</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-31.htm" title="The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for ever more, knows that I lie not.">2Corinthians 11:31</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:">Ephesians 1:3</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-6.htm" title="One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.">Ephesians 4:6</a>.) There is, indeed, a doxology addressed to Christ in <a href="/2_timothy/4-18.htm" title="And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me to his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.">2Timothy 4:18</a>; it should, however, be remembered that the Pauline origin of that Epistle has been doubted by some, though it is also right to add that these doubts do not appear to have any real validity. The title "God" does not appear to be elsewhere applied to our Lord by St. Paul, though all the attributes of Godhead are ascribed to Him: <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:">Philippians 2:6</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.,</span> <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span> In <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1Timothy 3:16</a>, which would be an apparent exception, the true reading is, * Who was manifested," and not "God was manifested." On the other hand, St. John certainly makes use of this title, not only in <a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>; <a href="/john/20-28.htm" title="And Thomas answered and said to him, My LORD and my God.">John 20:28</a>, but also in the reading, adopted by many, of <a href="/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>, "God only begotten" for "Only begotten Son." Weighing the whole of the arguments against each other, the <span class= "ital">data</span> do not seem to be sufficient to warrant a positive and dogmatic conclusion either way. The application to our Lord appears perhaps a little the more probable of the two. More than this cannot be said. Nor is a stronger affirmation warranted by any considerations resting on the division of authorities. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/romans/9-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Theirs are]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8039;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Genitive Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
