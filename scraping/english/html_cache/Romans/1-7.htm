The early Christian community in Rome was diverse, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile believers. This letter addresses the entire Christian community in Rome, indicating the universal nature of the gospel message. The church in Rome was not founded by Paul, but he writes to them with authority as an apostle.<p><b>who are loved by God</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the special relationship between God and believers. The love of God is a central theme in Scripture, highlighting His grace and mercy. This love is not based on human merit but is a divine initiative. It echoes the covenantal love God has shown throughout the Old Testament, such as His love for Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a>).<p><b>and called to be saints:</b><br>The term "saints" refers to those set apart for God's purposes. In the New Testament, all believers are considered saints, not just a select few. This calling is both a privilege and a responsibility, as it involves living a life that reflects God's holiness. The concept of being "called" is significant, as it denotes God's sovereign choice and purpose for His people, similar to the calling of Israel as a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>).<p><b>Grace and peace to you</b><br>"Grace" and "peace" are common greetings in Paul's letters, combining Greek and Hebrew salutations. Grace refers to God's unmerited favor, a foundational concept in Christian theology. Peace, or "shalom," signifies wholeness and well-being, a state of reconciliation with God. Together, they encapsulate the essence of the gospel message, which brings both grace and peace to believers.<p><b>from God our Father</b><br>This phrase highlights the intimate relationship believers have with God, who is not only the Creator but also a loving Father. This familial language underscores the adoption of believers into God's family, a theme Paul elaborates on in <a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15-17</a>. It reflects the new covenant relationship established through Christ.<p><b>and the Lord Jesus Christ.</b><br>The title "Lord" affirms the divinity and authority of Jesus, acknowledging Him as sovereign over all. "Jesus" is His human name, and "Christ" signifies Him as the Messiah, the anointed one promised in the Old Testament. This dual reference to God the Father and Jesus Christ emphasizes the unity and co-equality within the Godhead, a foundational doctrine of the Christian faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Romans, addressing the believers in Rome.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rome.htm">Rome</a></b><br>The capital of the Roman Empire, a significant city for early Christianity, where the recipients of this letter resided.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Father, who loves the believers and calls them to be saints.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The Lord through whom grace and peace are extended to the believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/saints.htm">Saints</a></b><br>The believers in Rome, called to live holy lives, set apart for God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_identity_in_christ.htm">Understanding Our Identity in Christ</a></b><br>Recognize that as believers, we are loved by God and called to be saints.

There is no hierarchy here&#8212;whether house-church leaders (<a href="/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3-5</a>) or new converts, everyone is addressed. This echoes <a href="/acts/28-14.htm">Acts 28:14-15</a>, where Luke notes the vibrant Roman fellowship that welcomed Paul. Just as Peter&#8217;s audience at Pentecost included &#8220;visitors from Rome&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-10.htm">Acts 2:10</a>), the gospel&#8217;s reach has now circled back to them. The phrase reminds us that the church is always both local and global&#8212;rooted in a place yet part of Christ&#8217;s one body (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who are loved by God</b><p>Before Paul says a word about duty, he anchors the believers in God&#8217;s steadfast affection. &#8220;We love because He first loved us&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/4-19.htm">1 John 4:19</a>). This love is not earned; it flowed toward them while they were still sinners (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>). Knowing we are loved frees us from striving for acceptance and empowers obedience born of gratitude (<a href="/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and called to be saints</b><p>&#8220;Called&#8221; highlights God&#8217;s initiative; He summons people from darkness into light (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). &#8220;Saints&#8221; means &#8220;set-apart ones,&#8221; not a spiritual elite but every Christian. Paul uses the same term for the Corinthians despite their struggles (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-2.htm">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>). Holiness, then, is both status and pursuit: we are declared holy in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>) and daily grow in godliness (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Grace and peace to you</b><p>This twin blessing captures the essence of the gospel. Grace is God&#8217;s unmerited favor that saves (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>) and empowers (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>). Peace is the reconciliation that flows from grace&#8212;peace with God (<a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>) and the inner calm that guards our hearts (<a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>). By placing peace after grace, Paul shows that true peace can never be separated from God&#8217;s saving kindness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ</b><p>The source of every spiritual blessing is the triune God. Calling Him &#8220;Father&#8221; points to intimacy and adoption (<a href="/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6-7</a>). Linking the Father with &#8220;the Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; affirms Jesus&#8217; full deity and authority (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>). All grace and peace come through their united work&#8212;planned by the Father, accomplished by the Son, applied by the Spirit (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a> greets every believer in Rome&#8212;and by extension, every Christian today&#8212;as deeply loved, divinely called, and eternally secure.

The same MS., with some others, alters the next phrase, "beloved of God" to "in the love of God," thus substituting for the special address to the Romans a general address to all "who are in the love of God." Traces of a similar reading appear to be found in the two earliest commentators on the Epistle, Origen (<span class= "ital">ob.</span> A.D. 253) and the Ambrosian Hilary (A.D. 366-384). The Codex Boernerianus also omits the words "at Rome" in <a href="/romans/1-15.htm" title="So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.">Romans 1:15</a>, while at the end of the Epistle it interposes a blank space between Romans 14, 15. These peculiarities give some support to the theory that the Epistle to the Romans was circulated, most probably with the sanction of the Apostle himself, in the form of a general treatise, with the personal matter eliminated. This theory will be found more fully discussed in the Notes on the last two chapters.<p><span class= "bld">Beloved</span> <span class= "bld">of</span> <span class= "bld">God.</span>--Reconciled to God through the death of His Son, and therefore with the barrier that separated you from His love removed.<p><span class= "bld">Called to be</span> <span class= "bld">saints.</span>--Consecrated or set apart by His own special summons, brought within the sphere and range of the holy life.<p>These epithets, high-sounding as they are, if applied by a modern writer to a modern church would seem to be indiscriminating or conventional, but as coming from St. Paul they have not yet lost their freshness and reality. They correspond to no actual condition of things, but to that ideal condition in which all Christians, by the mere fact of their being Christians, are supposed to be. They are members of the new Messianic kingdom, and share in all its privileges. The Apostle will not let them forget this, but holds it up before them as a mirror to convict them if they are unfaithful.<p><span class= "bld">Grace . . . and peace.</span>--May God and Christ look favourably upon you, and may you enjoy, as the result of that favour, the peace and composure of mind which is the proper attribute of the Christian.<p>The terms "grace" and "peace" nearly correspond to two ordinary forms of Jewish salutation, the first of which has also something of a counterpart among the Greeks and Romans. But here, as elsewhere, the Apostle has given to them a heightened and deepened Christian signification. Grace is the peculiar state of favour with God and Christ, into which the sincere Christian is admitted. Peace is the state of mind resulting from the sense of that favour.<p>"The <span class= "ital">joy</span> Thy <span class= "ital">favour</span> gives,<p>Let me again obtain."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called</span> to be <span class="cmt_word">saints</span> (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, in ver. 1).

Both phrases are applicable to all. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, be it observed, is elsewhere used to denote all Christians, without implying eminence in personal holiness (cf. <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ</span>. The union, here and elsewhere, of Jesus Christ with the Father as imparting heavenly blessing, implies his Deity no less than any dogmatic statement could do; for it is surely impossible to conceive the apostle thus associating with the Godhead one whom he regarded as a mere human being. The same form of benediction is found at the beginning of all St. Paul's Epistles, and there can be no doubt that its meaning is as given above. For, though here, in 1 and 2 Corinthians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, and Philemon, this collocation of words might allow the rendering, "Grace... from God, the Father of us and of the Lord Jesus Christ," yet in Galatians, 1 and 2 Timothy, and Titus, it is obviously inadmissible. And even without these instances the true meaning would have been probable from <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> coming <span class="accented">before</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>.
