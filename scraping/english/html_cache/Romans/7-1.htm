The term "brothers" signifies a familial relationship among believers, emphasizing unity and shared faith. This is consistent with Paul's style in addressing fellow Christians, as seen in other epistles (e.g., <a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>).<p><b>(for I am speaking to those who know the law)</b><br>Paul is addressing an audience familiar with Jewish law, likely including Jewish Christians or Gentiles well-versed in Jewish customs. This context is crucial, as it implies a foundational understanding of the Mosaic Law, which is central to the argument Paul is making. The law here refers to the Torah, the first five books of the Old Testament, which were well-known among Jews and early Christians.<p><b>that the law has authority over a man</b><br>The concept of the law having authority suggests a binding legal and moral obligation. In Jewish tradition, the law was seen as a covenant between God and His people, providing guidelines for righteous living. This authority is akin to a legal jurisdiction, where the law governs behavior and dictates consequences for transgressions.<p><b>only as long as he lives?</b><br>This phrase introduces the idea that the law's jurisdiction is limited to a person's lifetime. It implies that death releases one from legal obligations, a concept understood in both Jewish and Roman law. This principle sets the stage for Paul's later argument about being released from the law through Christ's death and resurrection, drawing a parallel to the believer's spiritual death to sin and new life in Christ (<a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle and author of the Book of Romans, addressing the believers in Rome.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/brothers.htm">Brothers</a></b><br>Refers to the Christian believers in Rome, both Jews and Gentiles, who are familiar with the law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Mosaic Law, which was given to the Israelites and is a central theme in Paul's discussion of sin and grace.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_law's_authority.htm">Understanding the Law's Authority</a></b><br>The law's authority is limited to one's lifetime, illustrating the temporal nature of legalistic adherence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/freedom_in_christ.htm">Freedom in Christ</a></b><br>Believers are released from the law's authority through Christ's death and resurrection, allowing them to live under grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_the_law.htm">The Purpose of the Law</a></b><br>The law serves to reveal sin and our need for a Savior, pointing us to Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_a_new_life.htm">Living a New Life</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to live a new life in the Spirit, free from the constraints of the law.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_law_in_sanctification.htm">The Role of the Law in Sanctification</a></b><br>While the law cannot save, it guides us in understanding God's standards and our need for continual growth in holiness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Romans_7_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Romans 7:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Romans_7_1_Law_s_life_authority.htm">How does Romans 7:1 illustrate the law's authority over a person&#8217;s life?

Christ&#8217;s death inaugurated the new covenant that frees us from the old covenant&#8217;s penalties while writing God&#8217;s law on our hearts (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1</a> reminds believers of a simple but profound truth: law rules only over the living. By addressing brothers who already &#8220;know the law,&#8221; Paul establishes common ground, then uses the death-breaks-obligation principle to explain how our union with Christ&#8217;s death releases us from the Law&#8217;s condemnation. This truth doesn&#8217;t dismiss God&#8217;s moral standards; it shifts our relationship to them&#8212;no longer striving under threat, but walking in newness of Spirit-empowered life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/romans/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>VII.</span><p>(1-6) The Apostle takes up an idea to which he had alluded in <a href="/context/romans/7-14.htm" title="For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.">Romans 7:14-15</a> of the preceding chapter, "Ye are not under the Law, but under grace;" and as he had worked out the conclusion of the death of the Christian to sin, so now he works out that of his death to the Law. This he does by an illustration borrowed from the marriage-bond. That bond is dissolved by the death of one of the parties to it. And in like manner the death of the Christian with Christ releases him from his obligation to the Law, and opens out to him a new and spiritual service in place of his old subjection to a written code.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Know ye not.</span>--Here again insert "or": <span class= "ital">Or know ye not,</span> &c., carrying on the thought from the end of the last chapter. Is not, argues the Apostle, what I say true? Or do I hear the old objection raised again, that the system under which the Christian is living is not one of grace in which eternal life is given freely by God, but the Mosaic law? That would show an ignorance--which in <span class= "ital">you</span> I cannot believe--of the fact that the dominion of the Law ceases with death, of which fact it is easy to take a simple illustration.<p><span class= "bld">To them that know the law.</span>--The Roman Church, as we have seen, was composed in about equal proportions of Jewish and of Gentile Christians. The Jews would naturally know the provisions of their own law, while the Gentile Christians would know them sufficiently to be aware of the fact, from their intercourse with Jewish members of their own community, and from hearing the Old Testament read in the synagogues, where their public worship was still conducted. The practice of reading from the Old Testament did not cease on the transition from Jewish to Christian modes of worship; it survives still in the "First Lesson."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/romans/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - Here comes in the third illustration of the moral obligation of the baptized. It rests on the recognized principle that <span class="accented">death</span> cancels the claims of human law on a person (cf. <a href="/romans/6-7.htm">Romans 6:7</a>); and this with especial reference to the law of marriage, as being peculiarly applicable to the subject to be illustrated, since the Church is elsewhere regarded as married to Christ. As has been observed above, it is from <span class="accented">the Law</span> that Christians are now said to be emancipated in the death of Christ; not from <span class="accented">sin, as</span> in the previous sections. Hence this section might at first sight seem to introduce a new line of thought. But it is really a continuation of the same, though differently viewed; for, in the sense intended by St. Paul, being under the Law is equivalent to being under sin. How this is has already more or less appeared; and it will be shown further in the latter part of this chapter. For elucidating the connection of thought between this and the preceding sections, it may be here briefly stated thus: A fundamental axiom with the apostle is that "where no law is, there is no transgression" (<a href="/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>; cf. 5:13; 7:9); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> without law of some kind (including in the idea both external law and the law of conscience) to reveal to man the difference between right and wrong, he is not held responsible; to be a sinner before God he must know what sin is. Human sin consists in a man doing wrong, knowing it to be wrong; or, at any rate, with an original power and opportunity of knowing it to be so. (This, be it observed, is the idea running through the whole of ch. 1, in which all mankind are convicted of sin; the whole drift of the argument being that they had sinned against knowledge.) Law, then, in making sin known to man, subjects him to its guilt, and consequently to its condemnation. But this is all it does; it is all that, in itself, it can do. It can remove neither the guilt nor the dominion of sin. Its principle is simply to exact entire obedience to its requirements; and there it leaves the sinner. The above view applies to all law, and of course peculiarly to the Mosaic Law (which the writer has all along mainly in view) in proportion to the authority of its source and the strictness of its requirements. Thus it is that St. Paul regards being under the Law as the same thing as being under sin, and dying to the Law as the same thing as dying to sin. Grace, on the other hand, under which we pass in rising again with Christ, does both the things which law cannot do: it both cancels the guilt of sin (repentance and faith presumed), and also imparts power to overcome it. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are ye ignorant, brethren (for I speak to persons knowing law), how that the Law hath dominion over a man for so long time as he liveth?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> so long as <span class="accented">the man</span> liveth; not so long as <span class="accented">the Law</span> liveth in the sense of <span class="accented">viget</span>, or "remains in force," though Origen, Ambrose, Grotius, Erasmus, and others, for reasons that will appear, understood the latter sense.
