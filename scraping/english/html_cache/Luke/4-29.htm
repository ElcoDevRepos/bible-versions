In the context of <a href="/luke/4.htm">Luke 4</a>, Jesus was in the synagogue in Nazareth, His hometown, where He had just read from the scroll of Isaiah and declared its fulfillment. The reaction of the people was one of anger and disbelief, leading to this unified movement against Him. This reflects the common biblical theme of rejection of prophets by their own people, as seen in the experiences of prophets like Jeremiah and Elijah.<p><b>drove Him out of the town</b><br>The act of driving Jesus out of the town signifies a forceful rejection. Nazareth, being a small and close-knit community, would have been familiar with Jesus and His family, which may have contributed to their inability to accept His messianic claims. This rejection prefigures the broader rejection Jesus would face from the Jewish leaders and people, culminating in His crucifixion. It also fulfills the prophetic theme of the suffering servant found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<p><b>and led Him to the brow of the hill</b><br>Nazareth is situated in a hilly region, and the mention of the "brow of the hill" suggests a specific geographical feature. This location would have been known to the inhabitants and used here as a place of intended execution. The act of leading Jesus to this spot shows premeditated intent to harm, reflecting the hostility He faced throughout His ministry.<p><b>on which the town was built</b><br>This detail emphasizes the precarious position of Nazareth, both physically and spiritually. The town's location on a hill is symbolic of its elevated status in the minds of its inhabitants, who were unable to see beyond their preconceived notions of the Messiah. This setting also highlights the irony of their attempt to cast out the one who is the true foundation, as referenced in <a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, "The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone."<p><b>in order to throw Him over the cliff</b><br>The intention to throw Jesus over the cliff is a stark representation of the ultimate rejection and desire to eliminate Him. This act of violence foreshadows the crucifixion, where Jesus would be rejected and killed outside the city. It also echoes the scapegoat ritual in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>, where the sins of the people are placed on a goat and sent away, symbolizing Jesus as the one who bears the sins of the world. Despite their intentions, Jesus' time had not yet come, and He miraculously passed through the crowd unharmed, demonstrating His divine authority and control over His destiny.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is in His hometown of Nazareth, where He faces rejection after proclaiming His mission.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_nazareth.htm">The People of Nazareth</a></b><br>The residents of Nazareth, who initially marvel at Jesus' words but quickly turn against Him when He challenges their expectations and beliefs.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazareth.htm">Nazareth</a></b><br>A small town in Galilee, known as Jesus' hometown.

The congregation in Nazareth abruptly rose in unified outrage right after Jesus declared, &#8220;Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing&#8221; (<a href="/luke/4-21.htm">Luke 4:21</a>).<p>&#8211; Their action shows the volatility of a heart confronted with truth it does not want: much like the Sanhedrin that &#8220;rose up&#8221; against Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-57.htm">Acts 7:57-58</a>) and the Thessalonian mob that &#8220;stirred up the crowd&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5</a>).<p>&#8211; Even among His own people, Jesus meets rejection&#8212;<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a> says, &#8220;He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him.&#8221;<p>&#8211; This verse proves the prophetic reality of <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, &#8220;He was despised and rejected by men,&#8221; and warns that simple exposure to truth never guarantees acceptance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Drove Him out of the town</b><p>&#8211; Nazareth&#8217;s citizens did not merely ignore Jesus; they forced Him outside the city limits, mirroring later moments when crowds sought to seize Him (<a href="/john/7-30.htm">John 7:30</a>; <a href="/john/10-39.htm">John 10:39</a>).<p>&#8211; Their hostility fulfills <a href="/luke/4-24.htm">Luke 4:24</a>, &#8220;No prophet is accepted in his hometown,&#8221; and prefigures the eventual rejection culminating at Calvary (<a href="/matthew/27-22.htm">Matthew 27:22-23</a>).<p>&#8211; The push to expel Jesus is the same spirit that asked Him to depart from Gadara after the deliverance of the demoniac (<a href="/matthew/8-34.htm">Matthew 8:34</a>), illustrating that miracles or teaching alone cannot soften hearts hardened by unbelief.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And led Him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built</b><p>&#8211; Nazareth sits on rugged high ground; the mob strategically chooses a vantage point suitable for execution.<p>&#8211; Their calculated march echoes <a href="/genesis/37-20.htm">Genesis 37:20</a>, where Joseph&#8217;s brothers plotted, &#8220;Come, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits,&#8221; reminding us that murderous intent often masquerades as righteous zeal.<p>&#8211; <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a> foretells, &#8220;The kings of the earth rise up&#8230;and the rulers take counsel together against the LORD and against His Anointed.&#8221; Even this small-town crowd aligns with that ancient prophecy.<p>&#8211; Yet, Jesus calmly allows Himself to be &#8220;led,&#8221; demonstrating sovereign control; later He will say, &#8220;No one takes My life from Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In order to throw Him over the cliff</b><p>&#8211; The goal is not intimidation but execution. Like later attempts to stone Him (<a href="/john/8-59.htm">John 8:59</a>; 10:31) or push Him from the Temple precincts (<a href="/john/7-19.htm">John 7:19</a>), this is premeditated murder.<p>&#8211; Their method bypasses Roman oversight; a cliff-fall mimics Old Testament judgment scenes such as those implied in <a href="/2_chronicles/25-12.htm">2 Chronicles 25:12</a>.<p>&#8211; Nevertheless, <a href="/luke/4-30.htm">Luke 4:30</a> records that Jesus &#8220;passed through the crowd and went on His way,&#8221; proving His hour had not yet come (<a href="/john/7-30.htm">John 7:30</a>). Divine timeline overrules human rage.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/4-29.htm">Luke 4:29</a> reveals hometown hearts unmasked: rising in anger, forcing Jesus outside, positioning Him for a deadly shove, and plotting His death&#8212;all because truth confronted their comfort. The verse underscores humanity&#8217;s innate opposition to the Savior, the literal fulfillment of prophecy, and the absolute sovereignty of Christ, who walks away untouched until the appointed cross.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">The brow of the hill.</span>--See Notes on <a href="/luke/1-26.htm" title="And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,">Luke 1:26</a>.
