This approach not only demonstrates His wisdom but also challenges the authority of the religious leaders questioning Him. By asking a question in return, Jesus places the burden of proof back on His challengers, highlighting their inability to answer truthfully without incriminating themselves. This method is seen elsewhere in the Gospels, such as in <a href="/matthew/21-24.htm">Matthew 21:24-25</a>, where Jesus uses a similar tactic.<p><b>Jesus replied.</b><br>The context here is crucial. Jesus is in the temple courts, a place of teaching and authority, and He is being confronted by the chief priests, scribes, and elders. His response is not just a simple answer but a strategic move to reveal the hearts and intentions of His opponents. This setting underscores the tension between Jesus and the religious authorities, who feel threatened by His growing influence and His challenge to their interpretations of the Law.<p><b>Tell Me:</b><br>This phrase indicates Jesus' authoritative position in the dialogue. By commanding them to "Tell Me," He asserts His role as a teacher and prophet, one who speaks with divine authority. This is consistent with His identity throughout the Gospels, where He often speaks with authority that astonishes the crowds (<a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28-29</a>). The demand for an answer also serves to expose the hypocrisy and fear of the religious leaders, who are more concerned with public opinion than with truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to the religious leaders who are questioning His authority.

His strategy exposes motives, upholds truth, and keeps the discussion in the open. The verse shows that Christ&#8217;s inquiries are designed to lead hearts to accountability before God, demonstrating both His wisdom and His sovereign authority over every conversation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he answered and</span> said <span class="cmt_word">unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me: The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men!

But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.</span> The reply of Jesus was one of strange wisdom. He - Jesus - as was well known, had been introduced to the people by this very John. If the Sanhedrin acknowledged John the Baptist as a divinely accredited messenger, then surely they could not question the claims of one borne special witness to by him, brought forward and introduced to public notice by him! If, on the other hand, the Sanhedrin refused to acknowledge the authority of John as a Heaven-sent messenger, which would have been the course they would have preferred, then the popularity and influence of the Sanhedrin would have been sorely imperilled, for the people generally held firmly that John the Baptist was really a prophet of the Lord. They even feared - as we read, "All the people will stone us" - personal violence on the part of the people whose favour they so zealously courted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/20-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;I will also ask</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#942;&#963;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(Er&#333;t&#275;s&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Future Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2065.htm">Strong's 2065: </a> </span><span class="str2">Apparently from ereo; to interrogate; by implication, to request.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hymas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
