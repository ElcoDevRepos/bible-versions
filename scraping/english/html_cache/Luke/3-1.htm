Tiberius Caesar was the Roman Emperor from AD 14 to AD 37. The fifteenth year of his reign would be around AD 28-29. This precise dating is significant as it anchors the narrative in a specific historical timeframe, providing a backdrop for the ministry of John the Baptist and the beginning of Jesus' public ministry. Tiberius was known for his reclusive and often harsh rule, which contributed to the political tension in the region.<p><b>while Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea</b><br>Pontius Pilate served as the Roman prefect (governor) of Judea from AD 26 to AD 36. His governance is marked by a complex relationship with the Jewish population, often characterized by insensitivity to Jewish customs and religious practices. Pilate's role in the trial and crucifixion of Jesus is a pivotal moment in the Gospels, highlighting the political and religious tensions of the time. His presence in this verse underscores the Roman authority over Judea and sets the stage for the later interactions with Jesus.<p><b>Herod tetrarch of Galilee</b><br>This refers to Herod Antipas, son of Herod the Great, who ruled as tetrarch of Galilee and Perea from 4 BC to AD 39. Herod Antipas is known for his role in the execution of John the Baptist, as well as his involvement in the trial of Jesus. The title "tetrarch" indicates a ruler of a quarter of a region, reflecting the division of Herod the Great's kingdom among his sons. Herod's rule is characterized by political maneuvering and a desire to maintain favor with Rome, which is evident in his interactions with both John the Baptist and Jesus.<p><b>his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and Trachonitis</b><br>Philip, another son of Herod the Great, ruled as tetrarch of the regions of Ituraea and Trachonitis from 4 BC to AD 34. These regions were located to the northeast of Galilee, encompassing parts of modern-day Syria and Lebanon. Philip is often noted for his relatively peaceful and stable rule compared to his brothers. His governance provides a contrast to the more tumultuous regions of Judea and Galilee, and his mention here helps to delineate the political landscape of the time.<p><b>and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene</b><br>Lysanias is a less well-documented figure, but he is mentioned as the tetrarch of Abilene, a region located northwest of Damascus. The mention of Lysanias helps to complete the political picture of the region during this period. Abilene's inclusion in this list of rulers emphasizes the extent of Roman influence and control over the various territories surrounding Judea and Galilee. This political backdrop is crucial for understanding the environment in which John the Baptist and Jesus began their ministries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tiberius_caesar.htm">Tiberius Caesar</a></b><br>The Roman Emperor during the time of John the Baptist's ministry.

On the division of Herod's kingdom he received Batanaea, Trachonitis, Auranitis, and a district near Jamnia, and governed with equity and moderation. The city of Caesarea Philippi, on the site of Paneas, was built by him (see Note on <a href="/matthew/16-13.htm" title="When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?">Matthew 16:13</a>), and he raised the eastern Bethsaida to the rank of a city under the name of Julias.

St. Luke's Gospel is framed after the model of approved histories. He commenced with an elaborate rhetorical preface, most carefully worded, stating, in a few well-chosen sentences, the reasons which had induced him to undertake the work. He then (<a href="/luke/1-5.htm">Luke 1:5-2:52</a>) skillfully wove into the text of his narrative one or more original documents; these he translated, preserving, with great art, as closely as possible, the spirit, and oftentimes the very words, of his original authority. Now, in this chapter he comes to a period more generally known. Here he has a vast number of sources for his story, written and oral; these he shapes into a regular history, beginning, as was the ordinary custom with works of this description, with the names of the chief rulers of the countries in which the events, which he proposed to relate, took place. He first speaks generally of the great Roman Empire under whose shadow the Holy Land at that time cowered. Then he proceeds to describe more fully the political divisions of Palestine; and, lastly, he writes of the great Jewish ecclesiastical governors of the day. Tiberius was the stepson of the Emperor Augustus, whom he succeeded. It was about this time that this monarch retired to the island of Capreae, where his life was disfigured with the grossest crimes. The government of his ministers, who ruled absolutely in his name, has become a byword for evil and tyrannical government. The influence of the Roman emperors at this time in Palestine appears from the attempts at adulation on the part of the local rulers, who, among many other localities, renamed the Lake of Galilee, where so many of the scenes narrated in our story took place, "the Sea of Tiberius." The city of Tiberius, on the shores of this inland sea, was named after the emperor<span class="cmt_word">. Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea</span>. His proper title was <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, procurator. In Judaea this civil functionary was also military commander. This double office gave the procurator of Judaea a higher rank and title; his official superior was the Roman Governor of Syria. Pilate became procurator in A.D. , and held the appointment for ten years. <span class="cmt_word">Herod being tetrarch of Galilee</span>. This Herod is usually known as "Antipas" (properly, Antipater). He was a son of Herod the Great, and reigned for more than forty years; he was eventually deposed by the Roman authorities and' banished to Gaul. Galilee at this period was the most flourishing and densely populated portion of the land of promise. Roughly speaking, it occupied all the center of Palestine, the rich plain of Esdraelon (Jezreel) and the surrounding districts<span class="cmt_word">. His brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis</span>. Herod Philip, another of the great Herod's sons, is well spoken of as a fair and judicious ruler. Caesarea Philippi was built by him. His tetrarchate included the ancient Bashan and the Hauran, and the country lying round the base of Hermon. <span class="cmt_word">Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene</span>. This district lay to the east of the mountain range of Anti-Libanus, the river Barada flowing through it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/3-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(En)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
