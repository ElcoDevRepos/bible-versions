This act is significant in demonstrating His physical resurrection. In Jewish culture, sharing a meal was a sign of fellowship and acceptance. By taking the food, Jesus is affirming His real, physical presence among the disciples, countering any notion that He was merely a spirit or apparition. This act fulfills His earlier promise that He would rise bodily from the dead (<a href="/luke/24-39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>).<p><b>and ate it</b><br>Eating the fish serves as a tangible proof of Jesus' bodily resurrection. In the ancient Near Eastern context, spirits or ghosts were believed not to eat physical food. By eating, Jesus provides undeniable evidence to His disciples that He is alive in a physical body. This act also connects to the broader biblical theme of God providing sustenance and fellowship, as seen in the feeding miracles (e.g., feeding of the 5,000 in <a href="/luke/9-10.htm">Luke 9:10-17</a>).<p><b>in front of them</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the public and verifiable nature of Jesus' actions. The disciples are witnesses to His resurrection, which is a foundational truth for the Christian faith. The public nature of this act is crucial for the credibility of the resurrection accounts. It aligns with the requirement for multiple witnesses in Jewish law to establish the truth of an event (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).
