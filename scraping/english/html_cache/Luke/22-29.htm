In the context of the Last Supper, Jesus is preparing His followers for their future roles in the establishment of the Church. The concept of a "kingdom" here is not a political entity but a spiritual reign, reflecting the Kingdom of God. This echoes the promise of authority given to Peter in <a href="/matthew/16-19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a> and the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18-20</a>. The idea of bestowing a kingdom also connects to the Davidic covenant, where God promised an everlasting kingdom through David's lineage, fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>just as My Father has bestowed one on Me</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine authority and mission given to Jesus by God the Father. It reflects the intimate relationship between the Father and the Son, as seen in <a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19-23</a>, where Jesus speaks of doing the works of the Father. The bestowal of the kingdom on Jesus is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a> and <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, which speak of the Messiah's eternal reign.
