In biblical context, trees often symbolize people or nations (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a>). The fruit represents actions or results of one's life (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). Jesus uses this metaphor to teach that the true nature of a person is revealed by their actions, aligning with the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, such as <a href="/proverbs/20-11.htm">Proverbs 20:11</a>. This principle is also echoed in <a href="/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16-20</a>, where Jesus warns against false prophets, indicating that their true character will be revealed by their deeds.<p><b>Indeed, figs are not gathered from thornbushes,</b><br>Figs were a common and valuable fruit in ancient Israel, symbolizing prosperity and well-being (<a href="/1_kings/4-25.htm">1 Kings 4:25</a>, <a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>). Thornbushes, on the other hand, were often associated with desolation and curse (<a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>, <a href="/hebrews/6-8.htm">Hebrews 6:8</a>). This contrast highlights the impossibility of obtaining good results from a corrupt source. The imagery would resonate with Jesus' audience, familiar with agricultural practices. It underscores the importance of integrity and authenticity, as genuine spiritual fruit cannot come from a deceitful heart.<p><b>nor grapes from brambles.</b><br>Grapes were another significant crop in Israel, used for wine, a symbol of joy and blessing (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, <a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1-5</a>). Brambles, like thornbushes, represent barrenness and futility. This part of the verse reinforces the message that one's true nature cannot produce contrary results. The imagery of the vine and branches in <a href="/john/15.htm">John 15</a> further develops this theme, where Jesus describes Himself as the true vine, and His followers as branches that must remain in Him to bear fruit. This connection emphasizes the necessity of a genuine relationship with Christ to produce spiritual fruit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering a sermon that includes teachings on judging others, love for enemies, and the importance of bearing good fruit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples_and_followers.htm">Disciples and Followers</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teachings, including this parable about trees and fruit, which serves as a metaphor for recognizing true character and righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sermon_on_the_plain.htm">The Sermon on the Plain</a></b><br>The context in which this teaching is delivered, a series of teachings by Jesus that parallel the Sermon on the Mount found in Matthew.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_through_fruit.htm">Discernment through Fruit</a></b><br>Just as trees are identified by their fruit, so are people recognized by their actions and character.

Ongoing obedience, love, and righteousness spring from a regenerated heart, while habitual sin signals a heart still bound by unbelief (<a href="/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; We are not called to judge motives we cannot see, but we are commanded to recognize fruit we can see (<a href="/matthew/12-33.htm">Matthew 12:33</a>); discernment protects the church from false teachers and encourages genuine believers to grow in holiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Figs are not gathered from thornbushes</b><p>&#8220;Indeed, figs are not gathered from thornbushes&#8221; (<a href="/luke/6-44.htm">Luke 6:44</a>b)<p>&#8226; Thornbushes hurt, entangle, and choke&#8212;no one expects sweet figs among their barbs.<p>&#8226; Likewise, a life characterized by bitterness, envy, and self-promotion cannot suddenly produce the sweetness of godly love (<a href="/james/3-14.htm">James 3:14&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus contrasts two natures: the unredeemed &#8220;thornbush&#8221; nature inherited from Adam (<a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1&#8211;3</a>) versus the new nature given in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Transformation begins at the root level&#8212;repentance and faith in Christ&#8212;before any lasting fruit appears (<a href="/acts/26-20.htm">Acts 26:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nor grapes from brambles</b><p>&#8220;nor grapes from brambles.&#8221; (<a href="/luke/6-44.htm">Luke 6:44</a>c)<p>&#8226; Brambles are dense, sprawling, and unproductive; they symbolize the futility of works apart from God (<a href="/hebrews/6-8.htm">Hebrews 6:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Grapes, often linked to joy and blessing (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>; <a href="/john/15-11.htm">John 15:11</a>), can never sprout from a bramble&#8217;s barren stock.<p>&#8226; This stresses the impossibility of mixing worldly, flesh-driven living with Spirit-produced fruit (<a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19&#8211;23</a>). The source determines the outcome every time.<p>&#8226; Therefore, believers are urged to abide in Christ daily so that the &#8220;vine and branches&#8221; relationship bears authentic grapes&#8212;good works flowing from saving faith (<a href="/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/titus/3-14.htm">Titus 3:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/6-44.htm">Luke 6:44</a> teaches that the nature of a person is unmistakably displayed in the pattern of that person&#8217;s conduct. Just as apple trees can only yield apples, so a heart transformed by Christ will inevitably show the fruit of the Spirit, while an unregenerate heart can only reproduce the thorns and brambles of sin. Jesus&#8217; vivid illustration calls us to honest self-examination, gracious discernment of others, and continual dependence on Him, the true source of every good fruit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(44) <span class= "bld">Of thorns men do not gather figs.</span>--The form of the illustration differs slightly from that in St. Matthew, where the thorns are connected with grapes, and the figs with thistles.
