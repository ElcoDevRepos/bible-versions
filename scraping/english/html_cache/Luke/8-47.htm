Her condition would have isolated her socially and religiously, making her desperate for healing. Her attempt to remain unnoticed reflects her awareness of the social stigma and the potential rebuke for touching Jesus, a rabbi, while in her unclean state. Her realization that she could not escape notice indicates the divine nature of Jesus' awareness and the futility of hiding from His presence.<p><b>came trembling and fell down before Him.</b><br>Her trembling signifies both fear and reverence. The act of falling down before Jesus is an expression of humility and submission, acknowledging His authority and power. This posture is often seen in scripture as a response to divine encounters (e.g., <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>). Her fear may also stem from the potential repercussions of her actions, yet her faith compels her to approach Jesus openly.<p><b>In the presence of all the people,</b><br>This public setting underscores the communal aspect of Jesus' ministry. The woman's healing is not just a personal miracle but a testimony to the crowd. The public nature of her confession and healing serves to glorify God and affirm Jesus' messianic identity. It also challenges societal norms by highlighting Jesus' compassion and willingness to engage with those considered unclean.<p><b>she explained why she had touched Him</b><br>Her explanation reveals her faith in Jesus' power to heal. By touching His garment, she believed she would be healed, demonstrating her understanding of Jesus' divine authority. This act of faith is reminiscent of other biblical instances where faith precedes healing (e.g., <a href="/matthew/9-29.htm">Matthew 9:29</a>). Her confession also serves as a witness to the crowd, illustrating the transformative power of faith in Christ.<p><b>and how she had immediately been healed.</b><br>The immediacy of her healing emphasizes the completeness and authority of Jesus' power over physical ailments. This instantaneous healing is a testament to Jesus' divine nature and fulfills Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah's healing ministry (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>). It also prefigures the ultimate healing and restoration that Jesus offers through His death and resurrection.
