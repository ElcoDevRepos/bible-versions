Jesus often used questions to provoke thought and self-examination among His followers. This method is consistent with rabbinic teaching styles of the time, which encouraged disciples to engage deeply with the lessons being imparted.<p><b>&#8220;When I sent you out</b><br>Refers to the earlier mission of the Twelve Apostles, as recorded in <a href="/luke/9.htm">Luke 9:1-6</a>. During this mission, Jesus empowered them to preach the Kingdom of God and heal the sick. This sending out was a practical exercise in faith and reliance on God's provision, as they were instructed to take nothing for their journey.<p><b>without purse or bag or sandals,</b><br>The purse, bag, and sandals symbolize material provisions and personal security. By sending them without these items, Jesus was teaching the disciples to depend entirely on God's provision and the hospitality of those they would encounter. This instruction is reminiscent of the Israelites' reliance on God during their wilderness journey, where they were sustained without the usual means of provision.<p><b>did you lack anything?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question is designed to remind the disciples of God's faithfulness and provision during their mission. It underscores the principle that when God sends, He also provides. This is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, as seen in the provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16) and Elijah's sustenance by the ravens (<a href="/1_kings/17-4.htm">1 Kings 17:4-6</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; they answered.</b><br>The disciples' response confirms the sufficiency of God's provision. Their experience serves as a testimony to the reliability of God's promises and care. This acknowledgment of divine provision is echoed in other biblical narratives, such as the feeding of the 5,000 (<a href="/luke/9-10.htm">Luke 9:10-17</a>), where Jesus multiplies limited resources to meet the needs of the people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing His disciples, reminding them of a previous mission.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who were sent out on a mission without provisions, relying on God's provision.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mission.htm">The Mission</a></b><br>Refers to the earlier sending of the disciples (<a href="/luke/9.htm">Luke 9:1-6</a>), where they were instructed to take nothing for their journey.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>Jesus' question to the disciples serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness.

This teaches us to trust in God's provision in our own lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflect_on_past_faithfulness.htm">Reflect on Past Faithfulness</a></b><br>Reflecting on past experiences where God has provided can strengthen our faith.

The disciples&#8217; &#8220;Nothing&#8221; stands as a testimony: when Christ sends, He supplies.

In that period, generally speaking, they had been welcomed and kindly entertained by the people, sometimes, they would remember, even with enthusiasm. But they must prepare now for a different life - cold looks, opposition, even bitter persecution, would be their lot for the future. They must order themselves now to meet these things. No ordinary prudent forethought must be omitted by them. He had more than hinted that this future lay before them in his words, "Behold I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves;" now he plainly tells them what kind of life awaited them in the immediate future. Of course, the advice as to the sword was not meant to be taken literally. It was one of those metaphors the Lord used so often in his teaching.
