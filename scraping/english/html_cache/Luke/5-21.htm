Their role was to interpret and enforce the Mosaic Law, and they held significant influence over Jewish society. In this context, they were often skeptical of Jesus' teachings and actions, as He challenged their authority and interpretations. Their internal questioning reflects their suspicion and inability to comprehend Jesus' divine authority. This moment highlights the growing tension between Jesus and the religious establishment, which is a recurring theme throughout the Gospels.<p><b>&#8220;Who is this man who speaks blasphemy?</b><br>Blasphemy, in Jewish law, was a serious offense, punishable by death (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>). It involved showing contempt or lack of reverence for God. The religious leaders considered Jesus' claim to forgive sins as blasphemous because, in their understanding, only God had the authority to forgive sins. This accusation foreshadows the charges that would later be brought against Jesus during His trial (<a href="/mark/14-61.htm">Mark 14:61-64</a>). The question posed by the scribes and Pharisees reveals their misunderstanding of Jesus' identity and mission.<p><b>Who can forgive sins but God alone?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores a fundamental theological truth recognized by the Jewish leaders: only God has the power to forgive sins. This belief is rooted in passages such as <a href="/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>, where God declares His sole authority to forgive. The statement inadvertently affirms Jesus' divine nature, as He demonstrates His authority to forgive sins, thus revealing His identity as God incarnate. This moment is pivotal in the Gospel narrative, as it challenges the audience to recognize Jesus not merely as a teacher or prophet, but as the Son of God with divine authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, performing a miracle and teaching about His divine authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/scribes_and_pharisees.htm">Scribes and Pharisees</a></b><br>Religious leaders of the time, known for their strict adherence to the Law and skepticism towards Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_paralytic.htm">The Paralytic</a></b><br>The man who was healed by Jesus, demonstrating Jesus' power to forgive sins and heal.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>The town where this event took place, often serving as a backdrop for Jesus' ministry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house.htm">The House</a></b><br>The setting of the miracle, where Jesus was teaching and healing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_authority_of_jesus.htm">Divine Authority of Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus demonstrates His divine authority by forgiving sins, a prerogative of God alone.

Their inward dialogue shows a heart closed to revelation, similar to the older brother in the parable (<a href="/luke/15-28.htm">Luke 15:28-30</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly warns that hidden thoughts are fully known to God (<a href="/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). Jesus will shortly prove this by answering their unspoken reasoning.<p>&#8226; Their inward criticism illustrates how mere external religiosity can resist God&#8217;s work when it threatens tradition (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Who is this man who speaks blasphemy?"</b><p>&#8226; They assume Jesus is an ordinary rabbi.

The scribes miss that prophecy standing before them.<p>&#8226; Earlier, angels identified Jesus as &#8220;Savior&#8230;Christ the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-11.htm">Luke 2:11</a>). Simeon and Anna confirmed His divine mission (<a href="/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25-38</a>). Every sign points to His deity, yet hardened hearts label Him a blasphemer.<p>&#8226; Their charge foreshadows the accusation later leveled at the cross (<a href="/matthew/26-65.htm">Matthew 26:65</a>), underscoring the consistent unbelief of the religious establishment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</b><p>&#8226; The statement is theologically correct: ultimate forgiveness is God&#8217;s prerogative (<a href="/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>; <a href="/micah/7-18.htm">Micah 7:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus does not dispute the premise; instead, He demonstrates that He shares that exclusive authority. By healing the paralytic instantly (<a href="/luke/5-24.htm">Luke 5:24-25</a>), He provides physical proof of spiritual power.<p>&#8226; The miracle functions as a visible sign of an invisible reality, echoing <a href="/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3</a>&#8212;&#8220;He forgives all your iniquities; He heals all your diseases.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The crowd&#8217;s amazement&#8212;&#8220;We have seen remarkable things today&#8221; (<a href="/luke/5-26.htm">Luke 5:26</a>)&#8212;confirms that God has visited His people through His Son (<a href="/luke/7-16.htm">Luke 7:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/5-21.htm">Luke 5:21</a> captures a silent clash: religious leaders accuse Jesus of blasphemy because only God can forgive sins. Jesus deliberately stakes that claim, then authenticates it by healing the paralytic. Their objection ironically affirms the truth: Jesus is God in flesh, possessing full authority to pardon. The passage challenges every reader to move from skeptical questioning to worshipful faith, recognizing that the One who heals our bodies also has the power to erase our sins.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies?
