This practice signifies the child's inclusion in the covenant community of Israel. The eighth day is significant as it symbolizes a new beginning, aligning with the creation week and the concept of renewal. This act also demonstrates Jesus' fulfillment of the Law from the very start of His life, emphasizing His role as the one who would perfectly keep the Law on behalf of humanity.<p><b>He was named Jesus</b><br>The naming of Jesus at His circumcision follows Jewish custom, where a child is officially named during this rite. The name "Jesus" is the Greek form of the Hebrew name "Yeshua" or "Joshua," meaning "The Lord is salvation." This name is significant as it encapsulates His mission to save His people from their sins (<a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>). The act of naming at circumcision also reflects the importance of identity and purpose in Jewish culture, as names often carried prophetic or significant meanings.<p><b>the name the angel had given Him</b><br>The angel Gabriel announced the name "Jesus" to Mary before His conception (<a href="/luke/1-31.htm">Luke 1:31</a>), indicating divine authority and purpose. This pre-announcement underscores the divine origin and mission of Jesus, setting Him apart from all others. It also fulfills the prophetic tradition where significant figures in salvation history, such as Isaac and John the Baptist, were named by divine revelation.<p><b>before He was conceived</b><br>This phrase highlights the miraculous nature of Jesus' conception, emphasizing the role of the Holy Spirit in the virgin birth (<a href="/luke/1-35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>). It points to the pre-existence of Christ, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a> and fulfilled in <a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>, where the virgin birth is a sign of God's intervention in human history.

By following this command, Mary and Joseph showed obedience to the Law, and Jesus identified Himself with the covenant people (<a href="/luke/1-59.htm">Luke 1:59</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; His very first recorded act in life is perfect submission to God&#8217;s written Word, underscoring that He &#8220;did not come to abolish the Law, but to fulfill it&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Even as an infant, Jesus is already accomplishing righteousness on our behalf, foreshadowing His lifelong obedience that would culminate at the cross (<a href="/romans/5-19.htm">Romans 5:19</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-8.htm">Hebrews 5:8&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He was named Jesus</b><p>&#8226;

Naming Him at the time of circumcision connects the sign of the covenant with the Savior who brings the new covenant (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31&#8211;34</a>; <a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>).<p>&#8226;

<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; By repeating Gabriel&#8217;s words, Luke highlights the certainty and precision of God&#8217;s Word; nothing in Christ&#8217;s life is accidental.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/2-21.htm">Luke 2:21</a> presents a snapshot of Christ&#8217;s early life that is rich with meaning: Jesus is perfectly obedient to God&#8217;s Law, publicly named as the Savior, and manifesting a plan conceived in eternity.

The contrast between this and the narrative of John's circumcision is striking. Here there are no friends and neighbours. Mary and Joseph were but poor strangers, in a city far from their own home. On the name of Jesus, see Note on <a href="/matthew/1-21.htm" title="And she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.">Matthew 1:21</a>. In St. Paul's words, "made of a woman, made under the law" (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a>), we may, perhaps, see a reference to a narrative with which his friendship with St. Luke must almost of necessity have made him familiar.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-40.</span> - <span class="accented">Circumcision and presentation of the Child Jesus</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the circumcising of the Child</span>. These ancient rites - circumcision and purification - enjoined in the Mosaic Law were intended as perpetual witnesses to the deadly taint of imperfection and sin inherited by every child of man. In the cases of Mary and her Child these rites were not necessary; but the mother devoutly submitted herself and her Babe to the ancient customs, willingly obedient to that Divine Law under which she was born and hitherto had lived. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/2-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(hote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3753.htm">Strong's 3753: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, at which time.
