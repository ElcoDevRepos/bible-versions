In Jewish culture, a teacher or rabbi was a respected figure who provided spiritual and practical guidance. This title reflects the disciples' recognition of Jesus' role in their lives and His authority to interpret the Scriptures and future events.<p><b>&#8220;when will these things happen?</b><br>The disciples are inquiring about the timing of the events Jesus had just described, specifically the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem. This question reflects a common human desire to know the future and prepare for it. In the context of Jewish eschatology, the destruction of the temple would have been a significant and catastrophic event, signaling a major shift in God's dealings with His people.<p><b>And what will be the sign</b><br>The disciples seek a sign, a common request in biblical times, as signs were often seen as divine indicators of God's will or forthcoming events. In the Old Testament, signs were used by God to confirm His promises or to guide His people, such as the rainbow after the flood or the plagues in Egypt. The request for a sign indicates the disciples' desire for assurance and clarity regarding the future.<p><b>that they are about to take place?&#8221;</b><br>The disciples are asking for specific indicators that would precede the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy. This reflects a broader biblical theme of watchfulness and readiness for God's intervention in history. In the New Testament, Jesus often speaks of the importance of being prepared for His return, using parables and teachings to emphasize vigilance and faithfulness. The question also highlights the tension between human curiosity and the divine mystery of God's timing, as seen in other scriptural passages where the exact timing of future events remains undisclosed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to questions from His disciples about the future and the signs of the end times.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are asking Him about the signs that will indicate the fulfillment of His prophecies regarding the destruction of the temple and the end times.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Jesus and His disciples are located during this discourse.

They are coming to the One who &#8220;teaches with authority and not as the scribes&#8221; (<a href="/luke/4-32.htm">Luke 4:32</a>). As in <a href="/john/13-13.htm">John 13:13</a>, Jesus is rightly addressed as &#8220;Teacher and Lord,&#8221; which underlines His divine right to explain future events. By using this respectful title, the disciples affirm that the answers they seek are grounded in the trustworthiness of Scripture&#8212;echoing passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>, where God promises to raise up a prophet to speak His words.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they asked</b><p>The disciples&#8217; question is earnest and personal. <a href="/mark/13-3.htm">Mark 13:3&#8211;4</a> shows that Peter, James, John, and Andrew initiate it privately, much like previous moments when they pulled Jesus aside for clarity (<a href="/mark/4-10.htm">Mark 4:10</a>). Their request underscores how true faith seeks understanding rather than remaining in the dark (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>). Luke repeatedly highlights such moments&#8212;see <a href="/luke/11-1.htm">Luke 11:1</a>, where they ask to be taught to pray&#8212;demonstrating that discipleship involves bringing every concern to Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when will these things happen?</b><p>&#8220;These things&#8221; points back to verse 6, where Jesus foretells that &#8220;Not one stone will be left on another; every one will be thrown down&#8221;. Historically, this was fulfilled in A.D. 70 when Rome destroyed the temple&#8212;just as Jesus literally said. The disciples, therefore, are asking for a timetable. <a href="/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6&#8211;7</a> shows a similar longing for dates, but Jesus reminds them that timing &#8220;is not for you to know.&#8221; Still, His prophecy&#8217;s precise fulfillment affirms God&#8217;s sovereign control (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41-44</a>), teaching us to trust every word He speaks.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And what will be the sign</b><p>Biblically, God often authenticates major events with signs&#8212;Noah&#8217;s rainbow (<a href="/genesis/9-12.htm">Genesis 9:12-13</a>), Gideon&#8217;s fleece (<a href="/judges/6-36.htm">Judges 6:36-40</a>). The disciples want a clear indicator that will alert them, reflecting how &#8220;Jews demand signs&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-22.htm">1 Corinthians 1:22</a>). Jesus does not rebuke the desire itself; instead, He provides warnings of deception, wars, and natural upheavals (<a href="/luke/21-8.htm">Luke 21:8-11</a>). These are not mere metaphors but literal events that will unfold in history and culminate in His visible return (<a href="/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that they are about to take place?</b><p>The phrase &#8220;about to&#8221; stresses imminence. Jesus&#8217; answer blends the near-term fall of Jerusalem with long-range end-time realities, illustrating the prophetic pattern where events can have both immediate and ultimate fulfillments. Paul echoes this expectancy: &#8220;While people are saying, &#8216;Peace and safety,&#8217; destruction will come upon them suddenly&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>). <a href="/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a> urges believers to meet together &#8220;all the more as you see the Day approaching.&#8221; The instruction is practical&#8212;stay watchful, live holy, and encourage one another as prophecy moves toward completion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/21-7.htm">Luke 21:7</a> captures the disciples&#8217; heartfelt desire to understand God&#8217;s plan: they recognize Jesus as the trustworthy Teacher, they freely bring their questions, and they seek concrete signs so they can live prepared lives. Jesus&#8217; subsequent discourse assures them&#8212;and us&#8212;that every prophecy will unfold precisely as spoken. The temple&#8217;s fall confirms His words, and the promised global signs keep us alert for His return. Confidence in Scripture&#8217;s literal accuracy fuels watchfulness, obedience, and hope until the day He fulfills the final promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7-19) <span class= "bld">Master, but when shall these things be?</span>--See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/24-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the world?">Matthew 24:3-14</a>; <a href="/context/mark/13-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,">Mark 13:3-13</a>. St. Luke omits the Mount of Olives as being the scene of the question and the prophecy, and the names of the questioners, the latter being given by St. Mark only. The variations in the report throughout imply an independent source--probably oral--of information, as distinct from transcription either from one of the Gospels or from a document common to both of them. On the whole, he agrees much more with St. Mark than St. Matthew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?</span> St. Mark (<a href="/mark/13-3.htm">Mark 13:3</a>) tells us that these questioners were Peter and James, John and Andrew. They said to their Master, "When shall these things be, and what sign shall precede them?" They asked their question with mingled feelings of awe and gladness: <span class="accented">of awe</span>, for the ruin of their loved temple, and all that would probably accompany the catastrophe, was a dread thought; <span class="accented">of gladness</span>, for they associated the fall of city and temple with the manifestation of their Lord in glory. In this glory they would assuredly share. But they wished to know more respecting the times and seasons of the dread event. Of late the disciples had begun dimly to see that no Messianic restoration such as they had been taught to expect was contemplated by their Master. They were recasting their hopes, and this solemn prediction they read in the light of the late sad and gloomy words which he had spoken of himself and his fortunes. Perhaps he would leave them for a season and then return, and, amid the crash of the ruined city and temple, set up his glorious kingdom. But they longed to know when this would be; hence the question of the four. The Lord's answer treated, in its first and longer portion, exclusively of the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple - the fair city and the glorious house on which they were then gazing, glorified in the light of the sunset splendor; then, as he spoke, gradually the horizon widened, and the Master touched upon the fortunes of the great world lying beyond the narrow pale of the doomed, chosen people. He closes his grand summary of the world's fortunes By a sketch of his own return in glory. The disciples' hearts must have sunk as they listened; for how many ages lay Between <span class="accented">now</span> and <span class="accented">then!</span> Yet was the great prophecy full of comfort, and in later days was of inestimable practical value to the Jerusalem Christians.
