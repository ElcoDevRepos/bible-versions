The context is one of confusion and reflection, as they discuss the recent events surrounding Jesus' crucifixion and the reports of His resurrection. The Greek words used here suggest a deep, engaged conversation, indicating their struggle to understand the significance of what has happened. This reflects a common human experience of grappling with unexpected events and seeking meaning, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture.<p><b>Jesus Himself came up</b><br>This emphasizes the personal nature of Jesus' appearance. It is not an angel or a vision, but Jesus Himself who joins them. This highlights the reality of the resurrection, affirming that Jesus is alive in bodily form. Theologically, this underscores the Christian belief in the physical resurrection of Jesus, a cornerstone of Christian faith. It also fulfills Jesus' promise that He would rise again, as foretold in passages like <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a> and <a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-22</a>.<p><b>and walked along with them</b><br>The act of walking with them signifies companionship and guidance. In the cultural context of the time, walking together was a common way to travel and converse, symbolizing fellowship and shared journey. This mirrors the biblical theme of God walking with His people, as seen in <a href="/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a> with Enoch and <a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a> with Noah. It also prefigures the Christian life as a walk with Jesus, as seen in passages like <a href="/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>.

Neither of the two travellers belonged to the Twelve. They may possibly have been of the number of the Seventy. May we think that it was in tender sympathy with the trials to which their thoughtful and yearning temper specially exposed them, that their Master thus drew near to them? They had cherished the hope that the kingdom of God would immediately appear (<a href="/luke/19-11.htm" title="And as they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.">Luke 19:11</a>), and now it seemed further off than ever. And He came, partly, it may be, with altered garb and tone, partly as holding their senses under supernatural control, so that they knew Him not. He was to them as a man of like passions with themselves. (Comp. the appearance to Mary Magdalene, <a href="/john/20-15.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, why weep you? whom seek you?
