The rocky ground represents a superficial heart that lacks depth. In the geographical context of Israel, rocky soil is common, where a thin layer of soil covers a bedrock. This imagery would have been familiar to Jesus' audience, illustrating the challenge of cultivating deep roots in such conditions. Spiritually, it symbolizes individuals who initially respond to the Gospel but lack the depth needed for sustained growth.<p><b>are those who hear the word and receive it with joy</b><br>This describes an initial enthusiastic reception of the Gospel message. The joy signifies an emotional response, which is a common reaction to the good news of salvation. However, this joy is not accompanied by a deep understanding or commitment. The immediate reception parallels the initial excitement seen in other biblical accounts, such as the crowds following Jesus for miracles rather than true discipleship (<a href="/john/6-26.htm">John 6:26</a>).<p><b>but they have no root</b><br>The lack of root indicates a shallow faith without a firm foundation. In biblical terms, roots often symbolize stability and nourishment (<a href="/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a>). Without roots, plants cannot survive adverse conditions. Spiritually, this suggests a lack of grounding in the Word of God and a failure to develop a personal relationship with Christ, which is essential for enduring faith.<p><b>They believe for a season</b><br>This phrase highlights the temporary nature of their faith. The term "season" suggests a limited time frame, indicating that their belief is not enduring. This transient faith is contrasted with the enduring faith described in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, where true faith perseveres despite trials. The temporary belief reflects a lack of true conversion and commitment.<p><b>but in the time of testing, they fall away</b><br>Testing refers to trials and tribulations that challenge one's faith. In the biblical context, testing is often used by God to refine and strengthen believers (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>). However, for those on rocky ground, these tests reveal the superficiality of their faith. The falling away, or apostasy, is a warning against the dangers of a shallow commitment to Christ. This echoes the warning in <a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4-6</a> about the impossibility of renewal for those who fall away after having once been enlightened.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of the parable, teaching His disciples and the crowd about the Kingdom of God through the Parable of the Sower.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teaching, who are being instructed on the nature of true discipleship and the challenges of faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The larger group of listeners who are receiving Jesus' teachings, representing various responses to the Word of God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rocky_ground.htm">The Rocky Ground</a></b><br>Symbolic of those who receive the Word with initial enthusiasm but lack depth and perseverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_time_of_testing.htm">The Time of Testing</a></b><br>Represents trials and tribulations that test the genuineness and depth of one's faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_deep_roots.htm">The Importance of Deep Roots</a></b><br>True faith requires depth and perseverance.

Jesus uses this image to warn that not every apparent response to the gospel is durable (<a href="/matthew/13-5.htm">Matthew 13:5-6, 20</a>-21). Paul later echoes the same contrast when he calls for hearts that are &#8220;rooted and established in love&#8221; rather than shallow professions (<a href="/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>those who hear the word</b><p>Every story in the parable starts with hearing. <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a> reminds us, &#8220;So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.&#8221; Hearing, however, is only the doorway; what happens next reveals the condition of the heart (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>receive it with joy</b><p>Initial excitement is not unusual. The Ethiopian eunuch &#8220;went on his way rejoicing&#8221; after believing (<a href="/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39</a>). Joy is good, even expected, yet Scripture cautions that good feelings alone do not equal saving faith (<a href="/john/2-23.htm">John 2:23-25</a>). Emotional enthusiasm must be anchored in truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they have no root</b><p>Roots speak of depth, stability, and hidden life. <a href="/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6-7</a> urges believers to be &#8220;rooted and built up in Him.&#8221; The rocky-ground hearer lacks this secret life with Christ&#8212;no regular intake of the Word, no communion in prayer, no fellowship that encourages perseverance (<a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2-3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they believe for a season</b><p>This belief is real as far as it goes, yet it is temporary.

When persecution arose, many early disciples &#8220;turned back and no longer walked with Him&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-66.htm">John 6:66</a>). Peter warns that fiery trials come &#8220;so that the proven character of your faith&#8221; may result in praise (<a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>). Shallow hearts collapse under pressure&#8212;whether ridicule, temptation, or hardship&#8212;because the root of steadfast trust never formed (<a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/8-13.htm">Luke 8:13</a> cautions that a joyful, short-lived response to the gospel is not enough.

These hastily make a religious profession, but they forget altogether to count what the real cost of such a profession amounts to. Upon these superficial but kindly natures come trouble, perplexity, discouragement, perhaps persecution; then quickly the once-loved religion withers away like corn growing on rocky places beneath the burning summer sun. John Mark, the would-be missionary companion of Paul and Barnabas, was one of this impulsive but little-enduring class; and Demas, once the friend of Paul, but who loved too well the present world. Another instance would be the man who offered to follow Jesus "whithersoever thou goest," as he phrased it, till he found, by the Lord's grave answer, that the Master he offered to follow had neither home nor resting-place; then he seems quickly to have turned back. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The [ seeds ]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(Hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
