In the context of a meal at the house of a Pharisee, this setting is significant as it highlights the tension between Jesus and the religious leaders. The Pharisees often scrutinized Jesus' actions, especially on the Sabbath, to find grounds for accusation. This encounter is a setup for a teaching moment, emphasizing Jesus' authority and compassion.<p><b>was a man with dropsy</b><br>Dropsy, known today as edema, is a condition characterized by swelling due to fluid retention. In biblical times, such a condition was often seen as a sign of uncleanness or divine disfavor. The presence of this man at a Pharisee's house is unusual, as Pharisees typically avoided those considered unclean. This situation underscores Jesus' mission to reach out to the marginalized and afflicted. The healing of this man serves as a demonstration of Jesus' power over physical ailments and His willingness to challenge societal norms. This act of healing on the Sabbath also connects to other instances where Jesus heals on the Sabbath, such as in <a href="/luke/13-10.htm">Luke 13:10-17</a>, highlighting His lordship over the Sabbath and His emphasis on mercy over legalism.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is at a Pharisee's house for a meal on the Sabbath.

The sick man was not one of the invited guests; with the freedom which attends a feast in a large Oriental house, the afflicted man was introduced, as though by chance, with other lookers-on. The skilful plotters stationed him in a prominent position, where the eyes of the strange Guest would at once fall on him. The situation is described by the evangelist with dramatic clearness: "And, behold, there was a certain man before him which," etc. In an instant Jesus grasped the whole situation. It was the sabbath, and there before him was one grievously sick with a deadly chronic malady. Would he pass by - contrary to his wont-such a sufferer? Would he heal him on the sabbath day? <span class="accented">Could</span> he? perhaps thought the crafty foes of the great Physician-Teacher.
