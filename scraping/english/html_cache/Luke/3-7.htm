His ministry took place in the wilderness of Judea, a region with significant historical and spiritual symbolism for the Israelites, reminiscent of their ancestors' journey through the desert. The crowds coming to John indicate a widespread recognition of his authority and the urgency of his message. Baptism, a ritual of purification, was not new to Jewish tradition, but John's baptism signified a deeper, spiritual cleansing and repentance.<p><b>&#8220;You brood of vipers</b><br>This phrase is a strong rebuke, using vivid imagery to describe the moral and spiritual corruption of the people. In the ancient Near East, vipers were seen as dangerous and deceitful creatures. By calling the crowds a "brood of vipers," John highlights their hypocrisy and the insidious nature of their sin. This language echoes the prophetic tradition of the Old Testament, where prophets often used harsh imagery to call out the people's unfaithfulness (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/59-5.htm">Isaiah 59:5</a>).<p><b>who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</b><br>John's question implies that the people are seeking baptism as a way to escape divine judgment without true repentance. The "coming wrath" refers to God's impending judgment, a theme prevalent in both the Old and New Testaments. This warning aligns with prophetic messages found in books like Malachi, which speak of a day of reckoning. John's message serves as a precursor to Jesus' teachings on judgment and salvation, emphasizing the need for genuine repentance and transformation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A prophetic figure and the forerunner of Jesus Christ, known for his call to repentance and baptism for the forgiveness of sins.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowds.htm">The Crowds</a></b><br>Groups of people from various backgrounds coming to John for baptism, including Pharisees and Sadducees, as indicated in parallel accounts.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The location where John conducted his ministry, symbolizing a place of spiritual renewal and preparation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/baptism.htm">Baptism</a></b><br>A ritual of purification and repentance, signifying a turning away from sin and a commitment to a new way of life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wrath.htm">Wrath</a></b><br>Refers to God's impending judgment on sin, a theme prevalent in John's preaching.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_genuine_repentance.htm">Call to Genuine Repentance</a></b><br>John's harsh words challenge us to examine the sincerity of our repentance.

They were alarmed and disturbed at his preaching; they feared that that drear time of awful suffering, generally known as the "woes of Messiah," a period which their great rabbis had told them would precede Messiah's advent, was at hand; they would provide themselves with some talisman against this time of sore calamity. The inspired predictor of these "woes" - men evidently looked on John as such - bade them come to his baptism; this baptism would be surely a safeguard, an easy bit of ritual, thought they, and one that readily approved itself to men trained in the rabbis' schools of that age, so they came to him in numbers. But John read their hearts; hence his stern fiery rebukes. "Let it be horse in mind that only teachers of transcendent holiness, and immediately inspired by God with fervency and insight, may dare to use such language" (Farrar). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/3-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
