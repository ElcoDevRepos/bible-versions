The act of sending is significant in the Gospels, as it often denotes a mission or task given by Jesus. The disciples' obedience to Jesus' command reflects their trust in Him. This mirrors the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus sends His followers to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>went out</b><br>The act of going out signifies obedience and action. In the biblical context, going out often involves leaving a place of comfort or familiarity to fulfill God's purposes. This is reminiscent of Abraham's call to leave his homeland (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>) and the Israelites' exodus from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31-42</a>).
