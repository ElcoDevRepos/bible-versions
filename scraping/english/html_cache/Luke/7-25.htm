It emphasizes the importance of understanding the true nature of John's mission. In biblical context, this question highlights the contrast between worldly expectations and spiritual realities. Jesus is urging the listeners to reflect on their motives and the significance of John's prophetic role, which was not about outward appearances but about preparing the way for the Messiah.<p><b>A man dressed in fine clothes?</b><br>This phrase contrasts John the Baptist's ascetic lifestyle with the opulence often associated with religious or political leaders. John was known for his simple clothing made of camel's hair and a leather belt, as described in <a href="/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>. This attire symbolized his prophetic calling and rejection of worldly wealth and status. The reference to fine clothes serves to underscore the humility and authenticity of John's ministry, which was focused on repentance and the coming kingdom of God.<p><b>Look, those who wear elegant clothing and live in luxury</b><br>Here, Jesus points out that those who indulge in luxury and wear elegant clothing are typically found in positions of power and wealth, such as in royal courts. This statement draws a clear line between the worldly kingdom and the spiritual kingdom of God. It suggests that true greatness in God's eyes is not measured by external wealth or status but by faithfulness and obedience to God's calling. This echoes the biblical theme that God's values often invert human expectations, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God looks at the heart rather than outward appearance.<p><b>are found in palaces.</b><br>This final phrase reinforces the idea that those who seek comfort and luxury are aligned with earthly kingdoms rather than the kingdom of God. Palaces symbolize earthly power and authority, contrasting with the humble settings where God's work often takes place. This serves as a reminder of the transient nature of worldly power compared to the eternal significance of God's kingdom. The mention of palaces also alludes to the political and social structures of the time, where rulers like Herod lived in opulence, yet were often morally and spiritually bankrupt. This contrast highlights the radical nature of Jesus' message and the call to follow a different path, one marked by humility and service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, addressing the crowd about John the Baptist.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>The subject of Jesus' discourse, known for his ascetic lifestyle and prophetic ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/crowd.htm">Crowd</a></b><br>The audience to whom Jesus is speaking, who had gone out to see John the Baptist.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/palaces.htm">Palaces</a></b><br>Symbolic of luxury and wealth, contrasting with John the Baptist's lifestyle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The place where John the Baptist conducted his ministry, emphasizing simplicity and repentance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/simplicity_over_luxury.htm">Simplicity Over Luxury</a></b><br>Jesus highlights the value of a simple, purpose-driven life over one of luxury and indulgence.

Recognizing God&#8217;s messengers requires looking past outward trappings and valuing the truth they proclaim.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">They which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately.</span>--The words are more vivid than those in St. Matthew ("they that wear soft clothing"), and bring out the idea of ostentatious display and extravagant excess of luxury, as well as effeminate self-indulgence. Such forms of selfishness were common among the house of Herod and their followers. So Josephus describes the "royal apparel" of Agrippa (<a href="/acts/12-21.htm" title="And on a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat on his throne, and made an oration to them.">Acts 12:21</a>) as glittering with gold and silver tissues. The words must have gone home to some of the Herodians, and we may trace a touch of brutal vindictiveness in the "gorgeous" or "<span class= "ital">bright</span> robe," in which they arrayed the Prophet of Nazareth when they had Him in their power. (See Notes on <a href="/luke/23-11.htm" title="And Herod with his men of war set him at nothing, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.">Luke 23:11</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-8.htm" title="But what went you out for to see?

John was no court favourite, no powerful or princely noble. Dean Plumptre thinks that here a reference is made to the fact that, in the early days of Herod the Great, a section of the scribes had attached themselves to his policy and party, and in doing so had laid aside the sombre raiment of their order, and had appeared in the gorgeous raiment worn by Herod's other courtiers. "We may trace," adds the dean, "with very little hesitation, a vindictive retaliation for these very words in the 'gorgeous robe' with which Herod arrayed him in mockery, when the tetrarch and Christ stood for one brief hour face to face with each other" (<a href="/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/7-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If not,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(alla)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
