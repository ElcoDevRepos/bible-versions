In the cultural context of first-century Judea, where poverty was widespread, Jesus' instruction challenges His followers to adopt a radical approach to giving. The act of giving is not limited by the worthiness of the recipient but is a reflection of God's grace. This teaching aligns with the Old Testament principles found in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>, where God commands the Israelites to be open-handed toward the poor and needy. It also echoes the wisdom literature, such as <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>, which states that whoever is kind to the poor lends to the Lord. Jesus' teaching here is a call to mirror the generosity of God, who gives freely to all.<p><b>and if anyone takes what is yours, do not demand it back</b><br>This part of the verse addresses the response to personal loss and injustice. In a historical context, the Roman occupation often led to the confiscation of property, and Jesus' audience would have been familiar with such experiences. The instruction to not demand back what is taken is a radical departure from the prevailing cultural norms of retribution and justice. It reflects the teachings of Jesus on non-retaliation and love for enemies, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-38.htm">Matthew 5:38-42</a>. This principle is also a foreshadowing of Jesus' own sacrifice, where He willingly gave up His rights and endured suffering without seeking retribution. The call to relinquish one's claim to personal possessions is a demonstration of trust in God's provision and justice, as well as a reflection of the kingdom values that Jesus came to establish.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is delivering a sermon that includes teachings on love, mercy, and generosity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teachings, representing all followers of Christ who are called to live according to His instructions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sermon_on_the_plain.htm">The Sermon on the Plain</a></b><br>The context in which this teaching is given, similar to the Sermon on the Mount, focusing on ethical and moral teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_needy.htm">The Needy</a></b><br>Implicit in the text, representing those who ask for help or take what belongs to others.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_community_of_believers.htm">The Community of Believers</a></b><br>The broader audience who would later receive and apply these teachings in their lives.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/generosity_as_a_reflection_of_god's_love.htm">Generosity as a Reflection of God's Love</a></b><br>Believers are called to reflect God's unconditional love through acts of generosity, giving freely without expecting anything in return.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>By not demanding back what is taken, believers demonstrate trust in God's provision and sovereignty over their possessions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart_of_giving.htm">The Heart of Giving</a></b><br>The focus is on the heart's attitude in giving, emphasizing willingness and joy rather than obligation or reluctance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_counter-culturally.htm">Living Counter-Culturally</a></b><br>This teaching challenges societal norms of ownership and reciprocity, calling believers to live in a way that prioritizes others' needs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_generosity.htm">Practical Generosity</a></b><br>Encourages practical steps in daily life to be generous, such as supporting local charities, helping neighbors, and being open-handed with resources.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_6_30_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 6:30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_give_to_all_who_ask.htm">How can we practice "give to everyone who asks you" in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Challenges_of_Luke_6_30_today.htm">What challenges arise when applying Luke 6:30 in modern society?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Luke_6_30_s_link_to_love_generosity.htm">How does Luke 6:30 connect with Jesus' teachings on love and generosity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Luke_6_30_boost_trust_in_God.htm">In what ways can Luke 6:30 deepen our trust in God's provision?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Luke_6_30_show_Christ_s_love.htm">How does Luke 6:30 encourage us to reflect Christ's love to others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_6_30_s_view_on_ownership.htm">How does Luke 6:30 challenge our understanding of personal property and ownership?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Is_Luke_6_30_about_unconditional_giving.htm">Does Luke 6:30 imply unconditional giving, even to those who exploit generosity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Balancing_Luke_6_30_with_safety.htm">How should Christians balance Luke 6:30 with personal safety and responsibility?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_6.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/can_you_heal_yourself,_doctor.htm">Can you heal yourself, doctor?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/did_the_centurion_ask_jesus_himself.htm">Did the centurion personally ask Jesus to heal his slave in Capernaum?

Here, again, it is clear that faithfully to cling to the literal interpretation would be utterly to ignore the true spirit of the Lord's words here, where he sets forth his sublime ideal of a charity which ignores its own rights and knows no limits to its self-sacrifice. Augustine quaintly suggests that in the words themselves will be found the limitation required. "'Give to every man,' but not <span class="accented">everything</span>,' suggesting that in many cases a medicine for the hurt of the soul would better carry out the words of the Lord than the gift of material help for the needs of the body ('Serm.' 359.). But such ingenious exposition, after all, is needless. What the Lord inculcated here was that broad, unselfish generosity which acts as though it really believed those other beautiful words of Jesus, that "it is more blessed to give than to receive." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/6-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Give</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#943;&#948;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(didou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1325.htm">Strong's 1325: </a> </span><span class="str2">To offer, give; I put, place.
