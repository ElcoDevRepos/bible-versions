In the cultural context of the time, the family unit was central to Jewish society, and the role of the father was to provide and protect. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God as a loving Father, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>, which speaks of the Lord's compassion for those who fear Him.<p><b>if his son asks for a fish</b><br>Fish was a staple in the diet of people living in Galilee and surrounding regions, due to the proximity to bodies of water like the Sea of Galilee. The request for a fish symbolizes a basic need or desire for sustenance. This can be connected to Jesus' provision of fish in the feeding of the 5,000 (<a href="/luke/9-13.htm">Luke 9:13-17</a>), illustrating God's provision for His people.<p><b>will give him a snake instead?</b><br>The snake, often associated with danger and deceit, contrasts sharply with the harmless and nourishing fish. This imagery evokes the serpent in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, symbolizing evil and temptation. The rhetorical question underscores the absurdity of a loving father giving something harmful when asked for something good. This reflects the nature of God, who gives good gifts to His children, as further explained in <a href="/matthew/7-11.htm">Matthew 7:11</a>, emphasizing God's goodness and the trustworthiness of His provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, teaching His disciples about prayer and the nature of God as a loving Father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who seek to understand prayer and God's character.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/father_in_heaven.htm">Father in Heaven</a></b><br>Refers to God, emphasizing His role as a loving and generous parent to His children.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/children.htm">Children</a></b><br>Symbolic of believers who are encouraged to ask God for what they need, trusting in His goodness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_spirit.htm">Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The ultimate gift that God promises to give to those who ask, representing His presence and power in the lives of believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_nature.htm">Understanding God's Nature</a></b><br>God is portrayed as a loving Father who desires to give good gifts to His children.

The assumption is plain: even flawed human dads instinctively care for their children (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-7.htm">Hebrews 12:7&#8211;10</a>).<p>- The Lord appeals to common sense. Listeners nod in agreement because good parenting is self-evident.<p>- By inviting this agreement, Jesus sets the stage to reveal something bigger: if ordinary fathers can be trusted, how much more can our perfect heavenly Father (<a href="/matthew/7-9.htm">Matthew 7:9&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>if his son asks for a fish</b><p>- A fish was ordinary, nourishing, and safe&#8212;daily bread for Galilean families.<p>&#8226; It pictures a legitimate, basic need, echoing Jesus&#8217; earlier prayer request: &#8220;Give us each day our daily bread&#8221; (<a href="/luke/11-3.htm">Luke 11:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The child approaches with confidence, expecting provision (<a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>).<p>- The Father delights in hearing His children&#8217;s petitions. Throughout Scripture He responds to genuine needs&#8212;manna and quail in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-11.htm">Exodus 16:11-15</a>), Elijah fed by ravens (<a href="/1_kings/17-4.htm">1 Kings 17:4-6</a>), and every &#8220;good and perfect gift&#8221; that &#8220;comes down from the Father of lights&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will give him a snake instead?</b><p>- A snake represents danger and harm, recalling the serpent of <a href="/bsb/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. No loving father would swap nourishment for peril.<p>- Jesus drives home an argument from the lesser to the greater:<p>&#8226; If imperfect fathers refuse to injure their children, the sinless Father will never sabotage His own (<a href="/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s plans are &#8220;for welfare and not for calamity&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>). Even when His answers differ from our requests, they are always beneficial (<a href="/isaiah/55-9.htm">Isaiah 55:9</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7-9</a>).<p>- The verse therefore corrects two errors: doubting God&#8217;s willingness and fearing His motives. We can pray boldly, knowing He will not disguise a curse as a blessing (<a href="/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/11-11.htm">Luke 11:11</a> reassures believers that the Father&#8217;s heart is flawlessly good. Just as no decent dad tricks a hungry child with something harmful, God will never respond to sincere prayer with destructive gifts.
