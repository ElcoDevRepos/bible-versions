In the context of the Last Supper, Jesus is addressing His disciples, preparing them for His impending crucifixion and the establishment of the Church. His declarations often carry weight as they reveal divine truths and principles for living.<p><b>The kings of the Gentiles</b><br>Here, "Gentiles" refers to non-Jewish nations, often seen as pagan or outside the covenant community of Israel. The mention of "kings" highlights the political structures common in the Roman Empire and other surrounding nations. These rulers were often seen as oppressive and self-serving, contrasting with the servant leadership Jesus exemplifies. This phrase sets the stage for a critique of worldly power structures.<p><b>lord it over them</b><br>This phrase describes the authoritarian and domineering style of leadership typical among Gentile rulers. It reflects a system where power is used for personal gain and control rather than service. This contrasts with the biblical ideal of leadership, which is rooted in humility and service, as seen in Jesus' own life and teachings (<a href="/matthew/20-25.htm">Matthew 20:25-28</a>).<p><b>and those in authority over them</b><br>This refers to the hierarchical nature of Gentile governance, where authority is concentrated at the top and often abused. The phrase underscores the disparity between those in power and the common people, highlighting the lack of servant leadership. This is in stark contrast to the biblical model of leadership, which calls for leaders to be shepherds and servants (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-3</a>).<p><b>call themselves benefactors</b><br>The term "benefactors" was a title used by rulers to portray themselves as generous and benevolent, often through public works or gifts. However, this was frequently a facade to maintain power and control. Jesus critiques this self-serving attitude, pointing to the hypocrisy of claiming to serve others while actually seeking personal glory. This critique aligns with His teachings on humility and true greatness (<a href="/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples about leadership and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, they are being prepared for their roles in the early Church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentile_kings.htm">Gentile Kings</a></b><br>Representing secular authority, they are used as a contrast to the type of leadership Jesus advocates.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/benefactors.htm">Benefactors</a></b><br>A term used to describe those in authority who are often seen as patrons or providers, yet their leadership is self-serving.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/servant_leadership.htm">Servant Leadership</a></b><br>Jesus calls His followers to lead by serving, contrasting with the self-serving nature of worldly leaders.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/true_authority.htm">True Authority</a></b><br>Authority in the Kingdom of God is not about power or control but about humility and service.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/imitating_christ.htm">Imitating Christ</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to follow Jesus' example of humility and selflessness in their interactions with others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/counter-cultural_values.htm">Counter-Cultural Values</a></b><br>The values of the Kingdom often stand in stark contrast to societal norms, challenging believers to live differently.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_influence.htm">Role of Influence</a></b><br>Christians are called to use their influence for the benefit of others, reflecting Christ's love and service.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_22_25_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 22:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_22_25_vs_worldly_leadership_views.htm">How does Luke 22:25 challenge worldly views of leadership and authority?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Qualities_for_Christian_leaders_in_Luke_22_25.htm">What qualities should Christian leaders embody according to Luke 22:25?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Luke_22_25_Matt_20_26-28.htm">How does Luke 22:25 connect with Jesus' teachings in Matthew 20:26-28?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Using_servant_leadership_daily.htm">How can we apply the servant leadership model in our daily interactions?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_resist_power_s_lure_in_Luke_22_25.htm">In what ways can we resist the temptation of power described in Luke 22:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_22_25_Jesus_leadership_view.htm">What does Luke 22:25 reveal about Jesus' view on leadership and authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Luke_22_25_s_impact_on_power_norms.htm">How does Luke 22:25 challenge traditional power structures in society?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Luke_22_25_differ_from_leaders.htm">In what ways does Luke 22:25 contrast with worldly leadership models?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_22.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/did_peter_deny_jesus_thrice.htm">Did Peter deny knowing Jesus three times?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_embodies_the_essence_of_power.htm">Are they like God's angels in heaven?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_did_jesus_mean_by_'not_worldly'.htm">What did Jesus mean by "My kingdom is not worldly"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_does_jesus_tell_them_to_buy_swords.htm">In Luke 22:36, why does Jesus instruct His followers to buy swords if His message is peace?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Luke 22:25 Mean</div><b>So Jesus declared</b><p>&#8211; This moment comes while the disciples are debating who is greatest.

True benefaction flows from self-sacrifice, modeled by the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-33.htm">Luke 10:33&#8211;35</a>) and ultimately by Christ, who &#8220;went about doing good&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jesus contrasts worldly leadership&#8212;marked by domination and self-promotion&#8212;with the servant leadership He demands. Earthly rulers flaunt titles and power; kingdom leaders stoop to serve.
