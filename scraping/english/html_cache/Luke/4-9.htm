Jerusalem, the spiritual and religious center of Israel, holds significant importance as the city of David and the location of the temple. It is a place where God's presence was believed to dwell, making it a fitting setting for a test of Jesus' divine mission. The devil's choice of Jerusalem underscores the gravity of the temptation, as it is a city associated with God's covenant and promises.<p><b>and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple.</b><br>The pinnacle of the temple refers to the highest point of the temple complex, possibly the southeastern corner overlooking the Kidron Valley. This location would have been a dramatic and public place, emphasizing the spectacle of the temptation. The temple itself was the center of Jewish worship and a symbol of God's presence among His people. By setting Jesus here, the devil is challenging Him in a place of profound religious significance, testing His identity and mission in the heart of Jewish faith.<p><b>&#8220;If You are the Son of God,&#8221; he said,</b><br>The devil's challenge begins with a conditional statement, "If You are the Son of God," questioning Jesus' divine identity. This echoes the temptation in the Garden of Eden, where the serpent cast doubt on God's word. The title "Son of God" affirms Jesus' unique relationship with the Father, as seen in His baptism (<a href="/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>). The devil's words aim to provoke doubt and pride, tempting Jesus to prove His divine sonship through a miraculous act.<p><b>&#8220;throw Yourself down from here.&#8221;</b><br>The devil's temptation involves a call for Jesus to demonstrate His divine power by throwing Himself from the temple's pinnacle. This act would require divine intervention to prevent harm, thus proving His identity. The devil's challenge is a misuse of Scripture, as he later quotes <a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11-12</a>, twisting its meaning to suit his purpose. This temptation tests Jesus' trust in the Father and His commitment to His mission, contrasting with the faithful obedience expected of the Messiah. Jesus' refusal to succumb highlights His reliance on God's word and His rejection of using divine power for self-serving purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is being tempted by the devil.

The adversary is the initiator here, just as in <a href="/luke/4-1.htm">Luke 4:1&#8211;2</a>, reminding us that Satan sometimes engineers the setting of a temptation, hoping we will cooperate.<p>- The Lord permits this movement; His sovereignty is never in doubt (<a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>). Jesus is &#8220;full of the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/luke/4-1.htm">Luke 4:1</a>), so He is not a passive victim but a willing combatant who meets Satan on the battlefield.<p>- Jerusalem is the city where God placed His name (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-6.htm">2 Chronicles 6:6</a>) and the place where Jesus will ultimately win the war at the cross (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>). Satan tries to turn that holy setting into a snare, echoing his earlier presence in Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Set Him on the pinnacle of the temple</b><p>- The pinnacle was likely the southeast corner of the Temple complex, towering over the Kidron Valley. A breathtaking drop made the temptation tangible.<p>- The temple represented God&#8217;s dwelling among His people (<a href="/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>). Satan twists the symbol of divine presence into a platform for doubt.<p>- Public visibility was extreme; a leap from this height would have attracted immediate attention from crowds in the courts below. Satan hints that spectacular self-display is a shortcut to messianic acclaim, contrasting sharply with Isaiah&#8217;s prophecy of the Servant who &#8220;will not cry out or raise His voice&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/42-2.htm">Isaiah 42:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"If You are the Son of God"</b><p>- The phrase repeats the taunt from the wilderness (<a href="/luke/4-3.htm">Luke 4:3</a>). Satan tries to spark insecurity where the Father had spoken certainty: &#8220;You are My beloved Son&#8221; (<a href="/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>).<p>- He employs conditional language to insinuate doubt: &#8220;If &#8230; then prove it.&#8221; The same strategy appears at Calvary when mockers sneer, &#8220;If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself&#8221; (<a href="/luke/23-37.htm">Luke 23:37</a>).<p>- Our enemy often attacks identity before behavior. If he can unsettle our assurance that we are children of God (<a href="/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16</a>), disobedience becomes easier.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Throw Yourself down from here"</b><p>- This is a temptation to manufacture a miracle and force the Father&#8217;s hand. Satan will soon quote <a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11&#8211;12</a> (<a href="/luke/4-10.htm">Luke 4:10&#8211;11</a>), twisting a promise of protection into a dare.<p>- The demand violates <a href="/deuteronomy/6-16.htm">Deuteronomy 6:16</a>, &#8220;Do not test the Lord your God,&#8221; which Jesus will soon quote in reply (<a href="/luke/4-12.htm">Luke 4:12</a>). Testing God assumes He might fail unless compelled; faith trusts Him without gimmicks.<p>- Satan&#8217;s offer looks spectacular but is hollow. Jesus could call &#8220;more than twelve legions of angels&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>), yet He chooses the path of humble obedience (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>). The cross, not a stunt, will declare Him Son of God in power (<a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/4-9.htm">Luke 4:9</a> shows Satan transporting Jesus to the temple&#8217;s highest point to bait Him into a dramatic leap. Each element&#8212;the devil&#8217;s leading, the holy setting, the challenge to Sonship, and the invitation to self-exaltation&#8212;exposes a common tactic: seed doubt in God&#8217;s Word, urge self-promotion, and entice us to test God rather than trust Him. Jesus&#8217; steadfast refusal (<a href="/luke/4-12.htm">Luke 4:12</a>) assures believers that He understands every pressure we face and has already triumphed, enabling us to stand firm in the same confidence that &#8220;the word of God is truth&#8221; (<a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple.</span> In St. Matthew Jerusalem is here called "the holy city," a name still preserved in the East, where it is still termed El-Khuds, <span class="accented">the holy</span>. Pinnacle; literally, "wing" of the temple. "Pinnacle" comes from the Vulgate translation, pinnaculum. The part of the great building evidently referred to here was that magnificent southern wing of the Lord's house constructed by Herod the Great, which was known as the royal portico. Josephus calls it <span class="accented">the most remarkable building under the sun</span> ('Ant.,' 15:11. 5). One who stood on the roof of this portion of the temple would look from a dizzy height into the Valley of the Kidron. Such a spectator, writes Josephus ('Ant.,' 2:05), "would be giddy while his sight could not reach to such an immense depth." To this spot, "whether in the body or out of the body" we cannot tell, Jesus was taken by the evil spirit. "Now," said his tempter, "if you really are what you seem to think, cast thyself down. You know what is written in the Divine writing, how the Eternal would give his angels charge concerning thee, they were to bear thee up, 'lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.' If thou art he of whom all this is written, there will be no risk. <span class="accented">You</span> are <span class="accented">sure</span> that you are the Son of God: try this once, and see. If you triumphantly come out of this trial, all men will recognize you, and your reign as Messiah will commence forthwith." This temptation was of a more subtle nature than the other two. It appeals again to all ranks of men, and warns them of the sore danger of <span class="accented">selfishly</span> courting danger. The angels will ever watch over us with a tender care when, to accomplish a duty or to perform an act of self-denying love, we confront peril; not so when we presumptuously and for our own ends rush into danger. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/4-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the devil] led</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7980;&#947;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#274;gagen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_71.htm">Strong's 71: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary verb; properly, to lead; by implication, to bring, drive, go, pass, or induce.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Him</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(auton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
