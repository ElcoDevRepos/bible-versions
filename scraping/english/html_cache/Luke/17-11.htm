Jesus' journey to Jerusalem is a recurring theme in the Gospels, symbolizing His mission and the fulfillment of His destiny, including His crucifixion and resurrection. Jerusalem is the city where major events in Jesus' life and ministry culminate, aligning with Old Testament prophecies such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>. The journey also reflects Jesus' obedience to the Father's will, as He resolutely heads towards the place of His ultimate sacrifice.<p><b>He was passing between Samaria and Galilee</b><br>This geographical detail highlights the route Jesus took, which is significant given the historical tensions between Jews and Samaritans. Samaria was a region that Jews typically avoided due to longstanding animosities, rooted in differences in worship practices and historical conflicts dating back to the Assyrian conquest and the subsequent intermarriage of Israelites with foreign settlers. Galilee, on the other hand, was a predominantly Jewish region where Jesus spent much of His ministry. By passing between these regions, Jesus demonstrates His ministry's inclusivity, reaching out to both Jews and Samaritans, as seen in His interactions with the Samaritan woman in <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4</a>. This journey underscores the breaking down of barriers and the extension of God's grace to all people, foreshadowing the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is on His way to Jerusalem, signifying His journey towards His crucifixion and ultimate sacrifice for humanity's sins.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The holy city, significant in Jewish history and prophecy, where Jesus is heading.

Each step is deliberate: He is heading toward the Passover where He will lay down His life (<a href="/luke/13-33.htm">Luke 13:33</a>; 18:31-33; <a href="/mark/10-32.htm">Mark 10:32-34</a>).<p>- Jerusalem is not simply a city; it is the appointed stage for the fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/bsb/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, and for the ratification of the new covenant foretold in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>.<p>- Luke&#8217;s wording highlights resolve. Jesus &#8220;set His face&#8221; toward the cross (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>), and nothing&#8212;crowds, opposition, or looming suffering&#8212;can deflect Him (<a href="/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17-18</a>; <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<p>- Even so, He keeps ministering en route, proving that divine compassion and divine purpose never conflict (<a href="/matthew/20-29.htm">Matthew 20:29-34</a>; <a href="/luke/18-35.htm">Luke 18:35-43</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He Was Passing Between Samaria and Galilee</b><p>- &#8220;&#8230;He was passing between Samaria and Galilee.&#8221; places Him on a contested border where Jews and Samaritans lived in mutual suspicion (<a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9</a>; <a href="/luke/9-52.htm">Luke 9:52-53</a>).<p>- By choosing this route, Jesus foreshadows the gospel&#8217;s reach beyond ethnic lines, a pattern later commanded in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> and illustrated when Samaritans receive the Spirit in <a href="/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4-17</a>.<p>- The location prepares readers for the healing of ten lepers (<a href="/luke/17-12.htm">Luke 17:12-19</a>); the lone Samaritan who returns to thank Him will exemplify faith that transcends heritage (<a href="/luke/10-33.htm">Luke 10:33</a>).<p>- Mentioning Galilee recalls <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a> and <a href="/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12-16</a>, where &#8220;Galilee of the nations&#8221; becomes a place of dawning light. Jesus once again shines that light where people least expect it.<p>- In short, the border setting underscores that grace flows freely from the Savior on His march to Jerusalem, touching both covenant insiders and long-rejected outsiders (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/17-11.htm">Luke 17:11</a> is more than a travel note. It reveals the Savior&#8217;s unwavering march toward the cross and His intentional presence at a border where division reigns. In one verse we see resolve and reach: Christ moves unflinchingly toward His sacrifice in Jerusalem while extending mercy to all, previewing the worldwide scope of His redeeming work.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem.</span>--This is the first distinct note of time in St. Luke's narrative since <a href="/luke/9-51.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,">Luke 9:51</a>.

The fact, peculiar to St. Luke, that it led Him through Samaria, apparently through that part of it which lay on the borders of Galilee, is obviously reported in connection with the miracle that follows, the other Gospels dwelling on the departure from Galilee, and the continuance of the journey to Jerusalem by the route on the east of the Jordan valley.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem</span>.
