Known for his role in the execution of John the Baptist, Herod was a ruler who sought to maintain his power through political maneuvering. His pleasure at seeing Jesus was not due to spiritual insight or reverence but rather curiosity and entertainment. Herod's interest in Jesus was superficial, reflecting a desire for spectacle rather than truth. This encounter highlights the contrast between worldly power and the spiritual kingdom Jesus proclaimed.<p><b>He had wanted to see Him for a long time,</b><br>Herod's longstanding desire to see Jesus suggests that Jesus' reputation had spread widely, even reaching the ears of political leaders. This desire was not born out of faith or repentance but rather a fascination with Jesus' fame and the reports of His miraculous works. Herod's interest was similar to that of many who followed Jesus for signs and wonders rather than His teachings. This phrase underscores the widespread impact of Jesus' ministry and the varied responses it elicited.<p><b>because he had heard about Him</b><br>The fame of Jesus had permeated the region, and Herod had likely heard reports of His teachings, miracles, and growing following. This reflects the historical context of Jesus' ministry, where news traveled through word of mouth and the testimony of those who witnessed His works. Herod's knowledge of Jesus was secondhand, lacking personal encounter or understanding of His true mission. This phrase illustrates the difference between hearing about Jesus and truly knowing Him.<p><b>and was hoping to see Him perform a miracle.</b><br>Herod's hope to witness a miracle reveals his misunderstanding of Jesus' purpose. He viewed Jesus as a performer of wonders rather than the Messiah bringing salvation. This expectation of a miracle for entertainment or proof is reminiscent of the temptations Jesus faced in the wilderness, where He was challenged to demonstrate His power for self-serving purposes. Herod's desire for a miracle reflects a common human tendency to seek signs rather than faith, a theme addressed throughout the Gospels.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_antipas.htm">Herod Antipas</a></b><br>The tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, Herod was a ruler known for his moral weaknesses and political cunning.

The passage warns that exposure to Christ&#8212;even direct, physical proximity&#8212;cannot save a heart that refuses to bow. True faith welcomes Jesus as Lord, not entertainer, and responds to His presence with humble obedience, not idle fascination.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">He was desirous to see him of a long</span> season.--The vague feeling of wonder had begun soon after the death of the Baptist. (See Notes on <a href="/matthew/14-2.htm" title="And said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.">Matthew 14:2</a>; <a href="/mark/6-14.htm" title="And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.">Mark 6:14</a>.) It had its beginning in hearing of wonders; it ended in a desire to see one. It was mingled, possibly, with a feeling of bitter enmity which no miracle could remove. (See Note on <a href="/luke/13-31.htm" title="The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying to him, Get you out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill you.">Luke 13:31</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him</span>. This was Herod Antipas, the slayer of John the Baptist. He was at that time living in open incest with that princess Herodias concerning whom the Baptist had administered the public rebuke which had led to his arrest and subsequent execution. Godet graphically sums up the situation: "Jesus was to Herod Antipas what a juggler is to a sated court - an object of curiosity. But Jesus did not lend himself to such a part; he had neither words nor miracles for a man so disposed, in whom, besides, he saw with horror the murderer of John the Baptist. Before this personage, a monstrous mixture of bloody levity and sombre superstition, he maintained a silence which even the accusation of the Sanhedrin (ver. 10) could not lead him to break. Herod, wounded and humiliated, took vengeance on this conduct by contempt." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/23-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Herod</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7977;&#961;&#8180;&#948;&#951;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(H&#275;r&#333;d&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2264.htm">Strong's 2264: </a> </span><span class="str2">Compound of heros and eidos; heroic; Herod, the name of four Jewish kings.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saw</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7984;&#948;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(id&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;soun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7974;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
