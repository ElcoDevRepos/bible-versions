The setting is the temple courts in Jerusalem, a central place for teaching and discussion. This public declaration underscores the importance of the message and the transparency of Jesus' teachings. It reflects the Jewish tradition of public teaching and debate, which was common in the temple area.<p><b>Jesus said to His disciples</b><br>Here, Jesus addresses His disciples, but the message is intended for a broader audience, as indicated by the previous phrase. This dual audience highlights the role of the disciples as both learners and future teachers. The disciples are often seen as representatives of the early church, and Jesus' instructions to them are foundational for Christian doctrine and practice.
