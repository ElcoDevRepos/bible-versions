The disciples were sent out by Jesus to spread the message of the Kingdom of God, and their reception in a town was a sign of openness to their message. This reflects the broader biblical theme of hospitality, as seen in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a> with Abraham and the three visitors. The act of welcoming is also a metaphor for accepting the teachings of Jesus, as seen in <a href="/matthew/10-40.htm">Matthew 10:40</a>, where Jesus says, "He who receives you receives Me."<p><b>eat whatever is set before you</b><br>This instruction emphasizes the importance of accepting hospitality without complaint or discrimination, reflecting the unity and fellowship among believers. In the context of Jewish dietary laws, this command suggests a temporary suspension of such restrictions for the sake of the mission, similar to Peter's vision in <a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9-16</a>, where God declares all foods clean. This phrase underscores the principle of adaptability and respect for the customs of others, as Paul later articulates in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-22.htm">1 Corinthians 9:22</a>, "I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some."

The command assumes active obedience; His messengers are on the move, intentionally stepping into new communities.<p>&#8226; This movement mirrors earlier instructions to the Twelve: &#8220;Take nothing for the journey&#8221; (<a href="/luke/9-3.htm">Luke 9:3</a>) and &#8220;Whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-11.htm">Matthew 10:11</a>). The Lord expects His servants to trust His provision rather than their own resources.<p>&#8226; Entering a town signals the beginning of gospel opportunity. Jesus&#8217; strategy was to prepare hearts before His own arrival, just as John prepared the way (<a href="/luke/3-4.htm">Luke 3:4&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; The application is straightforward: be willing to go where He sends, whether the place is familiar or foreign. <a href="/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9&#8211;10</a> shows Paul responding immediately to a Macedonian call; the missionary impulse remains the same.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they welcome you</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; and they welcome you &#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/luke/10-8.htm">Luke 10:8</a>)<p>&#8226; Reception is the first indicator of spiritual openness. Earlier, Jesus said, &#8220;If a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on it&#8221; (<a href="/luke/10-6.htm">Luke 10:6</a>). A welcoming home or town often precedes a welcoming heart.<p>&#8226; Hospitality was a test of sincerity. When Lydia &#8220;urged us, saying, &#8216;If you consider me a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my house,&#8217;&#8221; the apostles recognized genuine faith (<a href="/acts/16-15.htm">Acts 16:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Christ instructs His messengers to stay put when welcomed (<a href="/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>); hopping from house to house in search of better accommodations would undermine the gospel&#8217;s integrity. Compare 3 <a href="/bsb/john/5.htm">John 5&#8211;8</a>, where workers &#8220;for the sake of the Name&#8221; depend on believers&#8217; hospitality.<p>&#8226; Not every place will be welcoming; for the towns that aren&#8217;t, Jesus prescribes shaking off the dust (<a href="/luke/10-10.htm">Luke 10:10&#8211;11</a>; cf. <a href="/acts/13-50.htm">Acts 13:50&#8211;51</a>).

Even simple fare is evidence of His care.<p>&#8226; Fellowship: Sharing a meal knits hearts together. <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a> pictures Jesus dining with those who open the door; table fellowship remains a potent sign of acceptance.<p>&#8226; Freedom: The command anticipates potential dietary scruples. Later, Peter is told, &#8220;What God has made clean, you must not call common&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>), and Paul writes, &#8220;If an unbeliever invites you &#8230; eat whatever is set before you&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-27.htm">1 Corinthians 10:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Focus: By removing food worries, Jesus keeps the mission central&#8212;preaching the kingdom (<a href="/luke/10-9.htm">Luke 10:9</a>). Secondary issues must not derail the primary task.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/10-8.htm">Luke 10:8</a> teaches Christ&#8217;s messengers to go where He sends, discern genuine welcome, and receive God&#8217;s provision with gratitude.

The Evangelist preachers were to accept whatever was provided for them by a willing host, and to avoid even the appearance of caring for outward comforts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Eat such things as are set before you</span>. Most commentators have simply seen in this charge <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> an instruction to be content with whatever their host should set before them, avoiding even the appearance of caring or wishing for dainties; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that his servants should look upon such maintenance in the light of a fairly earned wage, rather than as an alms bestowed upon a beggar. In other words, his servants, while perfectly content with the most frugal fare, at the same time should preserve their manly independence. The bare austere sustenance, the simple lodging, - <span class="accented">these</span> things they had surely earned. But in addition to this meaning, true and appropriate though it be, there seems a quiet recommendation not to be rigid in inquiring as to the cleanness or uncleanness of the viands. One very able commentator (Godet) remarks that of this there is no question, for we are yet in a Jewish world. But remembering only in the last chapter a mission was specially sent to a Samaritan village, such an assertion can scarcely be maintained. It seems probable that extreme rigidness in this particular, now that mission work on a broad scale had commenced, here began to be relaxed; and that in this charge of Jesus we have, at least, the basis of that yet broader commandment set out by St. Paul in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-27.htm">1 Corinthians 10:27</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/10-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If you enter</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#941;&#961;&#967;&#951;&#963;&#952;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(eiserch&#275;sthe)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Subjunctive Middle or Passive - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1525.htm">Strong's 1525: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go in, come in, enter.
