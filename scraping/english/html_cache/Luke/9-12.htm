In the context of first-century Palestine, this would be a time when people would begin to seek shelter and food for the night. The setting sun would also symbolize the end of a day's work and the need for rest, reflecting the human need for physical sustenance and spiritual renewal. This moment foreshadows the miraculous provision that Jesus is about to perform, highlighting His role as the provider.<p><b>the Twelve came to Jesus and said</b><br>The Twelve refers to the twelve apostles, who were chosen by Jesus to be His closest followers and to carry on His mission. Their coming to Jesus shows their dependence on Him for guidance and solutions, emphasizing the relationship between the disciples and their Master. This interaction also demonstrates the apostles' growing awareness of the logistical challenges of ministry, as they are concerned about the practical needs of the crowd.<p><b>Dismiss the crowd so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside</b><br>The apostles suggest sending the crowd away to find food and lodging, which reflects their concern for the people's well-being. This request also highlights the limitations of human resources and understanding, as the disciples see the solution in terms of natural means. The mention of "surrounding villages and countryside" indicates the rural setting of the event, likely in the region of Bethsaida, as mentioned earlier in the chapter. This area was sparsely populated, which would make finding provisions more challenging.<p><b>for lodging and provisions</b><br>Lodging and provisions refer to the basic necessities of shelter and food. In the cultural context of the time, hospitality was a significant social value, and travelers often relied on the kindness of strangers for these needs. The disciples' suggestion underscores the importance of these essentials and sets the stage for Jesus to demonstrate His divine ability to provide abundantly beyond human expectations.<p><b>For we are in a desolate place here</b><br>The description of the location as a "desolate place" emphasizes the isolation and lack of resources available to the crowd. This setting is significant as it mirrors the wilderness experiences of Israel, such as the Exodus journey, where God provided manna from heaven. It also serves as a backdrop for Jesus to reveal His identity as the Bread of Life, drawing a parallel to God's provision in the Old Testament. The desolation underscores the miraculous nature of the feeding that is about to occur, as Jesus transforms scarcity into abundance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, who is approached by the Twelve for guidance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_twelve.htm">The Twelve</a></b><br>Refers to the twelve apostles, who are concerned about the crowd's need for food and lodging.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A large group of people who have been following Jesus, eager to hear His teachings and witness His miracles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/desolate_place.htm">Desolate Place</a></b><br>The setting of the event, indicating a remote area without immediate access to food or shelter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/surrounding_villages_and_countryside.htm">Surrounding Villages and Countryside</a></b><br>The nearby areas where the apostles suggest the crowd could find provisions and lodging.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_divine_provision.htm">Dependence on Divine Provision</a></b><br>The apostles' concern highlights human limitations and the need to rely on God's provision.
