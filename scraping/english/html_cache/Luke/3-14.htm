These soldiers were likely part of the Roman military or local forces under Herod's command. Their inquiry reflects a genuine desire for ethical living, even within a profession often associated with violence and corruption. This moment highlights the universal call to repentance and ethical conduct, transcending social and occupational boundaries. The soldiers' question parallels the inquiries of other groups in the chapter, emphasizing the inclusive nature of John's message.<p><b>&#8220;Do not take money by force or false accusation,&#8221; he said.</b><br>John's response addresses common abuses of power among soldiers, such as extortion and false accusations to extract money. This directive aligns with the broader biblical theme of justice and integrity, as seen in passages like <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, which calls for justice, mercy, and humility. The instruction also echoes the ethical teachings found in the Law of Moses, which condemned theft and false witness (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15-16</a>). By advising soldiers to refrain from these practices, John emphasizes the importance of moral conduct over societal norms that might condone such behavior.<p><b>&#8220;Be content with your wages.&#8221;</b><br>Contentment with one's wages is a call to trust in God's provision and reject greed. This teaching resonates with the broader biblical narrative that warns against the love of money and encourages reliance on God (<a href="/1_timothy/6-6.htm">1 Timothy 6:6-10</a>). The exhortation to contentment also reflects the teachings of Jesus, who later emphasized the futility of wealth accumulation and the importance of seeking God's kingdom (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-34</a>). For soldiers, who might have been tempted to supplement their income through dishonest means, this command underscores the virtue of living within one's means and maintaining integrity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A prophet and forerunner of Jesus Christ, known for his call to repentance and baptism for the forgiveness of sins.

Their question shows genuine repentance: not &#8220;What must we believe?&#8221; but &#8220;What must we do?&#8221; (compare <a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a>, <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>). They recognize that faith produces action and seek specific guidance for their vocation, echoing <a href="/psalms/119-60.htm">Psalm 119:60</a>, &#8220;I hurried and did not delay to keep Your commandments.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not take money by force</b><p>Soldiers held power to intimidate or extort. John&#8217;s warning&#8212;&#8220;Do not take money by force&#8221;&#8212;targets abuse of authority. Scripture consistently condemns oppression: <a href="/exodus/23-6.htm">Exodus 23:6&#8211;8</a> forbids twisting justice; <a href="/proverbs/3-31.htm">Proverbs 3:31</a> cautions, &#8220;Do not envy a violent man or choose any of his ways.&#8221; Paul later instructs believers with influence, &#8220;Let nothing be done out of selfish ambition&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>). For soldiers then and for any believer now, physical or positional strength must never translate into financial exploitation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or false accusation</b><p>A second temptation was leveraging the legal system for personal gain&#8212;charging citizens falsely, threatening reports to superiors, or fabricating evidence. John&#8217;s directive aligns with God&#8217;s command, &#8220;You shall not bear false witness&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). Jesus underscores the seriousness in <a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36</a>: &#8220;Men will give account on the day of judgment for every careless word.&#8221; For those wearing a uniform or holding authority, integrity in testimony is non-negotiable (compare <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Be content with your wages</b><p>Contentment is the positive counterpart to the two prohibitions. Rather than squeezing extra coins through coercion, the soldier is to rest satisfied with the stipend provided. <a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a> repeats the principle: &#8220;Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have.&#8221; Paul models the attitude in <a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11&#8211;13</a>, finding sufficiency in Christ whether abounding or in need. Contentment dismantles greed at the root, freeing the believer to trust God&#8217;s provision (<a href="/psalms/37-25.htm">Psalm 37:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>John&#8217;s counsel is simple yet penetrating: genuine repentance transforms daily conduct. For soldiers&#8212;and for anyone wielding influence&#8212;this means rejecting exploitation, telling the truth, and embracing contentment. These commands reflect God&#8217;s unchanging character of justice, honesty, and faithful provision, calling every follower of Christ to live distinctly, whatever the uniform or workplace may be.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">And the soldiers likewise . . .</span>--The Greek word has not the definite article, and is a participle.

It is supposed to have been primarily used of those who informed against the export of figs from Attica at a time when that trade was prohibited. They were known, it is said, as "sycophants," though no actual instance of this use of the word is extant. The word came, in course of time, to be applied to informers generally, and then, in its modern sense, to those who court the favour of princes by informing against others--the <span class= "ital">delatores, </span>who at this time were so conspicuous in the imperial court, on which that of the Tetrarch's had been modelled.<p><span class= "bld">Be content with your wages.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">pay. </span>The word meant primarily the "rations" of a soldier, and then the money received in lieu of rations. As used in the New Testament, the idea of pay for soldier's work as distinct from the wages of a labourer, is almost always connected with it.

The question is of little moment whether they were legionaries of Rome, or mercenaries in the pay of one of the tetrarchs or neighboring princes. The lesson is clear.
