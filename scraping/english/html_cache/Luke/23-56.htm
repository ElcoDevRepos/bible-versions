In the Jewish burial customs of the time, it was common to anoint the body with spices and perfumes to honor the deceased and to mitigate the odor of decay. The preparation of these spices indicates their devotion and love for Jesus, as well as their intention to give Him a proper burial. This act also highlights the role of women in Jesus' ministry and their faithfulness even in the face of despair. The spices and perfumes were likely a mixture of myrrh and aloes, substances that were valuable and often used in burial practices, as seen in <a href="/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39-40</a> with Nicodemus bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes for Jesus' burial.<p><b>And they rested on the Sabbath, according to the commandment.</b><br>The Sabbath rest is a direct reference to the Fourth Commandment, which instructs the observance of the Sabbath as a day of rest (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>). This demonstrates the women's adherence to Jewish law, even in their grief. The Sabbath, from Friday evening to Saturday evening, was a time when all work ceased, and this included the preparation of the body. Their obedience to the commandment underscores the importance of the law in Jewish life and the tension between the old covenant and the new covenant that Jesus' resurrection would soon inaugurate. This rest also sets the stage for the resurrection, as Jesus rose on the first day of the week, symbolizing a new creation and the fulfillment of the law. The observance of the Sabbath here is a reminder of the anticipation of rest and redemption that Jesus' resurrection would bring, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who would bring salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_women.htm">The Women</a></b><br>These are the women who followed Jesus from Galilee.

Possibly, we have two groups of women--the two Maries and "Joanna and the others" (<a href="/luke/24-10.htm" title="It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things to the apostles.">Luke 24:10</a>)--taking part in the same work; possibly, what they did on the Friday afternoon or evening was not enough, and it was necessary to buy more spices as soon as shops were open on Saturday evening.<p><span class= "bld">Rested the sabbath day.</span>--It is noticeable that this is the only record in the Gospels of that memorable Sabbath. Can we picture to ourselves how it was spent by those who had taken part in the great drama of the previous day;--Caiaphas and the priests officiating in the Temple services of that day, after their hurried Passover, just in time to fulfil the bare letter of the law, on the previous afternoon; the crowds that had mocked and scoffed on Golgotha crowding the courts of the Temple, or attending in the synagogues of Hebrew or Hellenistic Jews; scribes and Pharisees preaching sermons on the history and meaning of the Passover, and connecting it with the hope of a fresh deliverance for Israel? And the disciples, where were they? scattered each to his own lodging, or meeting in the guest-chamber where they had eaten their Paschal supper, or, as that was apparently a new room to them (<a href="/context/luke/22-8.htm" title="And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.">Luke 22:8-9</a>), in some other inn or lodging in the city, or its suburbs? On that Sabbath, John and Peter must have met, and the penitent must have found in his friend's love the pledge and earnest of his Lord's forgiveness; and the Twelve and the Seventy must, in groups of twos or threes, have mourned over the failure of their hopes; and the women have comforted themselves with the thought that they could at least show their reverence for the Lord they loved as they had never shown it before; and Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathaea have rested with satisfaction in the thought that they could honour a dead prophet without the danger that had attached to honouring a living one, or have reproached themselves for the cowardice which had kept them from any open confession till it was too late, and mourned over the irrevocable past. The records are silent, but the imagination which turns the dead chronicles of history into a living drama has here, within due limits, legitimate scope for action. May we go a step yet further, and think of what was then being accomplished behind the veil, of the descent into Hades and the triumph over Death, the soul of the robber in the rest of Paradise, and the good news proclaimed to "the spirits in prison" (<a href="/1_peter/3-19.htm" title="By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;">1Peter 3:19</a>)? If we dare not fill up the gap with the legends of the Apocryphal Gospel that bears the name of Nicodemus, we may, at least, venture to dwell reverently on the hints that Scripture actually gives.<p><span class= "bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/23-56.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they returned</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#941;&#968;&#945;&#963;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hypostrepsasai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5290.htm">Strong's 5290: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, return.
