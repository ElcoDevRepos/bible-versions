The devil, also known as Satan, is a fallen angel who opposes God and His purposes. This confrontation is significant as it mirrors the temptation of Adam and Eve in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, highlighting the devil's role as the tempter. The wilderness setting is reminiscent of Israel's 40 years of testing in the desert, drawing a parallel between Jesus and Israel as God's chosen.<p><b>&#8220;If You are the Son of God</b><br>The phrase "If You are the Son of God" is a direct challenge to Jesus' identity and mission. At His baptism, God declared Jesus as His beloved Son (<a href="/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>). The devil's use of "if" is an attempt to sow doubt and provoke Jesus to prove His divine sonship. This temptation is similar to the serpent's questioning of God's word in the Garden of Eden. The title "Son of God" is messianic, affirming Jesus' divine nature and His role as the promised Savior.<p><b>tell this stone to become bread.&#8221;</b><br>This temptation targets Jesus' physical hunger after His prolonged fast, appealing to the natural human desire for sustenance. The act of turning stone into bread would demonstrate Jesus' divine power but would also signify a misuse of His abilities for personal gain, contrary to His mission of self-sacrifice and reliance on God. This echoes Israel's reliance on God for manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16), emphasizing trust in God's provision. Jesus' response, quoting <a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>, underscores the importance of spiritual nourishment over physical needs, aligning with His teaching that man does not live by bread alone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is in the wilderness, having been led there by the Holy Spirit after His baptism.

It has been quaintly said of the tempter "that he had sped so successfully to his own mind by a temptation about a matter of eating with the first Adam, that he practiced the old manner of his trading with the second." These diabolical promptings have been spoken of already in this Commentary as "typical." They represent, indeed, some of the principal temptations to which different classes of men and women in all ages are subject; the hard task of bread-winning, after all, suggests very many of the evil thoughts and imaginings to which men are subject, though, perhaps, they suspect it not. Weakened and exhausted by long abstinence from food, the temptation to supply his wants by this easy means at once was great. Still, had he consented to the tempter's suggestion, Jesus was aware that he would have broken the conditions of that human existence to which, in his deep love for us fallen beings, he had voluntarily consented and submitted himself. Should he, then, use his miraculous power for his own advantage? Then, re-membering his own late experience, the long fast from all human food, and yet life enduring through it all; calling to mind the miraculous supply of manna in the old desert days, the preservation of Elijah's life through a similar fast, - Jesus, all faint and weary, exclaims in reply, "Man shall not live by bread alone." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/4-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
