The discourse includes teachings on love, mercy, and judgment, emphasizing the ethical and moral standards of the Kingdom of God. The phrase "in the hearing of the people" indicates that Jesus' teachings were public and accessible, meant for all who were present. This openness reflects the inclusive nature of Jesus' ministry, reaching out to diverse audiences, including Jews and Gentiles.<p><b>He went to Capernaum</b><br>Capernaum was a significant location in Jesus' ministry, often described as His "own city" (<a href="/matthew/9.htm">Matthew 9:1</a>).

Archaeological findings, such as the remains of a synagogue and a house believed to be Peter's, provide insight into the town's historical and cultural context. Capernaum served as a strategic base for Jesus' Galilean ministry, allowing Him to reach a wide audience. The town's location on major trade routes facilitated the spread of His teachings.

Looking, however, at the manifest dislocation of facts in one or both of the Gospels, St. Matthew placing between the Sermon on the Mount and the healing of the centurion's servant, the healing of the leper, which St. Luke gives in <a href="/context/luke/5-12.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and sought him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.">Luke 5:12-16</a>, the agreement in this instance can hardly be looked at as more than accidental.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-10.</span> - The <span class="accented">servant</span> (<span class="accented">or slave</span>) <span class="accented">of the centurion of Capernaum is healed.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now when he had ended all his sayings</span>. This clearly refers to the sermon on the mount. That great discourse evidently occupied a position of its own in the public ministry of the Lord. Its great length, its definite announcement of the kind of reign he was inaugurating over the hearts of men, its stern rebuke of the dominant religious teaching of the day, its grave prophetic onlooks, - all marked it out as the great manifesto of the new Master, and as such it seems to have been generally received. <span class="cmt_word">He entered into Capernaum</span>.
