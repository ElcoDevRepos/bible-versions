Children often played in these busy areas, mimicking the activities of adults. This setting highlights the public nature of the message and the behavior being critiqued. The marketplace represents the world, where people are exposed to the message of the Gospel.<p><b>and calling out to one another:</b><br>The act of calling out suggests an attempt to communicate or gain attention. In this context, it reflects the efforts of both John the Baptist and Jesus to reach the people with their messages. The calling out also implies a sense of urgency and importance, as the children (representing the people) are trying to convey something significant.<p><b>&#8216;We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;</b><br>The flute playing symbolizes a joyful message or celebration, akin to the message of salvation and the coming of the Kingdom of God. Dancing would be the expected response to such a joyful tune, representing acceptance and rejoicing in the message. The lack of response indicates a refusal or indifference to the joyous news brought by Jesus, who often spoke of the joy of the Kingdom (e.g., <a href="/luke/15-7.htm">Luke 15:7, 10</a>).<p><b>we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.&#8217;</b><br>A dirge is a mournful song, often associated with funerals or lamentation. This represents the call to repentance and recognition of sin, as preached by John the Baptist. Weeping would be the appropriate response to such a message, symbolizing contrition and repentance. The failure to weep indicates a hard-heartedness and unwillingness to repent, similar to the response of the people to John&#8217;s call for repentance (<a href="/luke/3-7.htm">Luke 3:7-9</a>).<br><br>This passage as a whole critiques the generation's failure to respond appropriately to the distinct messages of John and Jesus, highlighting their spiritual apathy and resistance to both the call to repentance and the invitation to joy in the Kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, Jesus uses this analogy to describe the generation's response to both His ministry and that of John the Baptist.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/children_in_the_marketplace.htm">Children in the Marketplace</a></b><br>Represents the people of Jesus' generation who are compared to children who are dissatisfied regardless of the situation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>His ascetic lifestyle and call to repentance are part of the context, as he is contrasted with Jesus' more celebratory approach.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_marketplace.htm">The Marketplace</a></b><br>A public place where people gather, symbolizing the public nature of Jesus' and John&#8217;s ministries.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_generation.htm">The Generation</a></b><br>The people of Jesus' time who are being critiqued for their lack of response to both John the Baptist and Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_spiritual_indifference.htm">Understanding Spiritual Indifference</a></b><br>The parable highlights the spiritual indifference and critical nature of the people who neither accepted John&#8217;s call to repentance nor Jesus&#8217; message of grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_the_signs_of_the_times.htm">Recognizing the Signs of the Times</a></b><br>Just as the people failed to recognize the significance of John and Jesus, we must be attentive to God&#8217;s work in our own time.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_god's_call.htm">Responding to God&#8217;s Call</a></b><br>The parable challenges us to respond appropriately to God&#8217;s call, whether it comes in a form that is comfortable or challenging to us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_a_critical_spirit.htm">Avoiding a Critical Spirit</a></b><br>The generation&#8217;s critical spirit serves as a warning against being overly critical and missing God&#8217;s work due to preconceived notions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/embracing_both_repentance_and_joy.htm">Embracing Both Repentance and Joy</a></b><br>The contrasting images of dancing and weeping remind us of the balance between repentance and the joy of salvation in the Christian life.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_7_32_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 7:32?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_7_32_Jesus_rejection_shown.htm">How does Luke 7:32 illustrate the rejection of Jesus by His generation?

The image highlights immaturity and a refusal to engage with what truly matters.<p>&#8226; Scripture often contrasts childlike faith with childish stubbornness. First Corinthians 14:20 warns, &#8220;Do not be children in your thinking,&#8221; while <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a> cautions against being &#8220;tossed by the waves and carried about by every wind of teaching&#8221;.<p>&#8226; By choosing the marketplace&#8212;where transactions occur&#8212;Jesus shows that spiritual opportunity was right in front of them, yet they ignored it (cf. <a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and calling out to one another</b><p>&#8226; The children are vocal; they want participation from their peers. Likewise, the crowds heard repeated calls from both John the Baptist and Jesus.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a> pictures wisdom &#8220;crying aloud in the street,&#8221; paralleling the public invitation God extends.<p>&#8226; Their mutual chatter replaces listening to God&#8217;s messengers, echoing <a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3</a>, where people &#8220;gather around them teachers to suit their own desires&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We played the flute for you, and you did not dance</b><p>&#8226; A flute tune signals celebration. Jesus&#8217; ministry brought good news, healing, and freedom (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>). Yet the religious leaders and many common people refused to rejoice.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/matthew/11-18.htm">Matthew 11:18-19</a> (parallel passage), critics dismissed Jesus as &#8220;a friend of tax collectors and sinners.&#8221; Their refusal to &#8220;dance&#8221; exposes hardened hearts, not a lack of evidence.<p>&#8226; Compare the elder brother in the parable of the prodigal son, who &#8220;heard music and dancing&#8221; yet would not join the feast (<a href="/luke/15-25.htm">Luke 15:25-28</a>). Joy was offered; acceptance was withheld.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we sang a dirge, and you did not weep</b><p>&#8226; A dirge calls for mourning. John the Baptist came in austere clothing, preaching repentance and judgment (<a href="/luke/3-7.htm">Luke 3:7-9</a>). The same audience remained unmoved.<p>&#8226; <a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a> commands, &#8220;Return to Me with all your heart&#8230; with weeping and mourning&#8221;. John&#8217;s message matched that call, but people treated it as optional.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8-9</a> echoes the need for sorrow over sin: &#8220;Be miserable, mourn, and weep.&#8221; The generation Jesus addresses would do none of it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>John and Jesus offered contrasting yet complementary ministries&#8212;mourning over sin and celebrating salvation. Like spoiled children, the generation refused both the dirge and the dance, revealing hearts resistant to any divine overture. Christ&#8217;s comparison urges every listener to abandon childish indifference, heed God&#8217;s calls&#8212;whether to repent or to rejoice&#8212;and respond in humble, obedient faith.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/7-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They are</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eisin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
