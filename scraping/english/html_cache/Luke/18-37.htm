Nazareth was often looked down upon (<a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>), yet it fulfills the prophecy that the Messiah would be called a Nazarene (<a href="/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>). The use of "Jesus of Nazareth" highlights His humble origins and humanity, contrasting with His divine mission.<p><b>is passing by</b><br>The phrase indicates the immediacy and urgency of the moment. Jesus was on His way to Jerusalem, where He would fulfill His mission through His death and resurrection (<a href="/luke/18-31.htm">Luke 18:31-33</a>). This moment signifies a divine appointment, as Jesus often passed through towns and villages, performing miracles and teaching. The transient nature of His passing underscores the need for immediate faith and action, as seen in the blind man's response in the following verses.<p><b>they told him</b><br>The crowd informs the blind man, showing the communal aspect of Jesus' ministry. The people around Jesus often played a role in bringing others to Him, whether through direct interaction or by spreading news of His presence. This reflects the broader theme of witness and testimony found throughout the Gospels, where individuals and groups are called to share the message of Christ with others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_of_nazareth.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, recognized as the Messiah and Son of God.

Earlier in the chapter Jesus welcomed children and promised sight to faith-filled hearts (vv. 15&#8211;17, 42). The beggar is about to experience that promise firsthand.<p>&#8226; Everywhere Jesus goes, lives change&#8212;&#8220;The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me&#8230; to proclaim recovery of sight to the blind&#8221; (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>). The mention of His name signals that the moment for such a miracle has arrived.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of Nazareth</b><p>&#8226; Identifying Jesus &#8220;of Nazareth&#8221; anchors Him in real time and space. He grew up in a humble Galilean village (<a href="/luke/2-39.htm">Luke 2:39-40</a>), sharing our humanity while remaining fully God (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; This title fulfilled prophecy that Messiah would be despised for His origins&#8212;&#8220;Can anything good come out of Nazareth?&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>). Yet God delighted to reveal His power through what the world considered insignificant (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also recalls anointed ministry&#8212;&#8220;Jesus of Nazareth was a man attested to you by God with miracles, wonders, and signs&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>) and &#8220;God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and He went around doing good and healing all&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>). The crowd&#8217;s words set the stage for another act of &#8220;doing good.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is passing by,</b><p>&#8226; The present-tense action underscores urgency. Opportunity is at the doorstep&#8212;&#8220;Now is the time of God&#8217;s favor; now is the day of salvation&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a>).<p>&#8226; For the blind man this is a once-in-a-lifetime window. Jesus is approachable, moving within earshot, reachable by faith. That echoes the promise, &#8220;Draw near to God and He will draw near to you&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; When Jesus &#8220;passes by,&#8221; He brings compassion and power. In <a href="/john/9-1.htm">John 9:1</a> He &#8220;passed by&#8221; and saw another blind man, granting him sight. Luke wants us to sense the same expectancy here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they told him.</b><p>&#8226; The crowd becomes a chain in the gospel&#8217;s advance. Someone notices the beggar&#8217;s curiosity and answers, &#8220;Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Their brief witness mirrors <a href="/romans/10-14.htm">Romans 10:14</a>&#8212;&#8220;How can they believe in the One of whom they have not heard?&#8221; Faith often begins when a neighbor speaks up.<p>&#8226; Examples abound: the shepherds &#8220;spread the word concerning what had been told them about this Child&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-17.htm">Luke 2:17</a>); Andrew hurried to tell Peter, &#8220;We have found the Messiah&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-41.htm">John 1:41</a>). Ordinary voices point searching hearts to Christ.<p>&#8226; The blind man responds immediately, crying out, &#8220;Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!&#8221; (v. 38). A single sentence of testimony sparks saving faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/18-37.htm">Luke 18:37</a> captures a life-changing moment in four short phrases. It announces the Savior&#8217;s name, reminds us of His humble yet prophetic hometown, highlights the fleeting opportunity of His nearness, and showcases the vital role of everyday witnesses. Taken literally and at face value, the verse invites every reader to recognize when Jesus is &#8220;passing by,&#8221; to seize the moment with trusting cries for mercy, and to open our mouths so others can do the same.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.</span> The Lord's name was by this time a household word in Palestine, and among the sick and afflicted a most precious and welcome sound. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/18-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
