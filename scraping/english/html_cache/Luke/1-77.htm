"His people" refers to the Israelites, God's chosen people, who were awaiting the Messiah. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, as seen throughout the Old Testament, where God repeatedly promises to send a deliverer to His people (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40:1-5</a>).<p><b>the knowledge of salvation</b><br>The term "knowledge" implies an understanding or awareness that goes beyond mere intellectual assent. In the biblical context, salvation is often associated with deliverance from sin and its consequences. This knowledge is not just theoretical but experiential, involving a personal relationship with God. The concept of salvation is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, where it often refers to deliverance from physical enemies, but in the New Testament, it takes on a more spiritual dimension (e.g., <a href="/psalms/98-2.htm">Psalm 98:2-3</a>, <a href="/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a>).<p><b>through the forgiveness of their sins</b><br>Forgiveness is central to the message of the Gospel and is the means by which salvation is realized. In the Jewish context, forgiveness was sought through the sacrificial system established in the Law of Moses. However, the New Testament reveals that true forgiveness comes through Jesus Christ, the ultimate sacrifice (e.g., <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22, 1</a> <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>). This phrase highlights the transition from the old covenant to the new, where forgiveness is no longer achieved through repeated sacrifices but through the once-for-all sacrifice of Christ. The connection between forgiveness and salvation is a recurring theme in the New Testament, emphasizing that reconciliation with God is made possible through the remission of sins (e.g., <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>, <a href="/colossians/1-14.htm">Colossians 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>The father of John the Baptist, who prophesied these words after regaining his speech.

Men had lost sight of the true nature of salvation. They were wrapt in dreams of deliverance from outward enemies, and needed to be taught that it consisted in forgiveness for the sins of the past, and power to overcome sins in the future.<p><span class= "bld">The remission of their sins.</span>--Historically, this was the first utterance of the words in the Gospel records, and we may well think of it as having helped to determine the form which the work of the Baptist eventually took. It is interesting to compare it with our Lord's words at the Last Supper (<a href="/matthew/26-28.htm" title="For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.">Matthew 26:28</a>), and so to think of it as being the key-note of the whole work from the beginning to the end. Different in outward form as were the ministries of the Baptist and our Lord, they agreed in this.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 77.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins.</span> Zacharias goes on to celebrate the splendid part his son was to play in the great Messianic drama, he was to be Messiah's pioneer in order to give men the true information respecting the Deliverer's work. Israel was mistaken altogether in its conception of the salvation which they really-needed. Godet puts it with great force. "Why," he asks, "was the ministry of the Messiah preceded by that of another Divine messenger? Because the very notion of salvation was falsified in Israel, and had to be corrected before salvation could be realized. A carnal and malignant patriotism had taken possession of the people and their rulers, and the idea of a political deliverance had been substituted for that of a moral salvation. There was need, then, of another person, divinely authorized, to remind the people that perdition consisted not in subjection to the Romans, but in Divine condemnation; and that salvation, therefore, was not temporal emancipation, but forgiveness of sins." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/1-77.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">to give</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(dounai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Infinitive Active<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1325.htm">Strong's 1325: </a> </span><span class="str2">To offer, give; I put, place.
