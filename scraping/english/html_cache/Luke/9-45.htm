This reflects the spiritual blindness that can affect even those closest to Jesus. In the context of <a href="/luke/9.htm">Luke 9</a>, Jesus had just foretold His suffering, death, and resurrection, a concept that was difficult for the disciples to accept due to their expectations of a triumphant Messiah. This misunderstanding is echoed in other passages, such as <a href="/mark/9-32.htm">Mark 9:32</a> and <a href="/matthew/16-22.htm">Matthew 16:22</a>, where Peter rebukes Jesus for speaking of His death.<p><b>It was veiled from them so that they could not comprehend it,</b><br>The phrase "veiled from them" suggests a divine purpose in their lack of understanding. This veiling can be seen as part of God's sovereign plan, where certain truths are revealed progressively. The disciples' inability to comprehend may also be linked to their preconceived notions of the Messiah as a political liberator rather than a suffering servant. This concept of veiling is reminiscent of <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where the prophet speaks of people who hear but do not understand, a theme Jesus Himself references in His parables (<a href="/matthew/13-13.htm">Matthew 13:13-15</a>).<p><b>and they were afraid to ask Him about it.</b><br>The disciples' fear to question Jesus further indicates their reverence for Him, but also their confusion and apprehension about the implications of His words. This fear may stem from previous rebukes, such as Peter's earlier confrontation with Jesus (<a href="/mark/8-33.htm">Mark 8:33</a>), or from a general sense of awe and uncertainty about the unfolding events. Their reluctance to seek clarification contrasts with the encouragement found in <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>, which invites believers to ask God for wisdom. This fear also underscores the human tendency to avoid confronting difficult truths, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples about His impending suffering and death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are struggling to understand His message about His future suffering.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_veiling_of_understanding.htm">The Veiling of Understanding</a></b><br>A divine act where the disciples' understanding is intentionally limited, highlighting their spiritual immaturity at this point.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_asking.htm">Fear of Asking</a></b><br>The disciples' fear to seek clarification from Jesus, indicating their lack of comprehension and possible intimidation by the gravity of His message.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_spiritual_truths.htm">Understanding Spiritual Truths</a></b><br>Spiritual truths are often veiled to those not ready to receive them.

Their expectations overruled what they heard, just as in <a href="/mark/9-32.htm">Mark 9:32</a> and <a href="/luke/18-34.htm">Luke 18:34</a>.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/12-16.htm">John 12:16</a> shows they would remember and understand only after Jesus was glorified. Until then, their limited perspective kept them from connecting prophecy (<a href="/bsb/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>) with the Messiah they followed.<p>&#8226; The scene reminds us that sincere followers can miss God&#8217;s meaning when preconceived ideas filter His word (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It was veiled from them so that they could not comprehend it</b><p>&#8220;It was veiled from them so that they could not comprehend it.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The disciples&#8217; blindness was not merely intellectual; God allowed a spiritual veil to remain until the right moment (<a href="/luke/24-45.htm">Luke 24:45</a>). Similar language appears in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-3.htm">2 Corinthians 4:3-4</a>, where the &#8220;god of this age&#8221; blinds unbelievers, and in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-4.htm">Deuteronomy 29:4</a>, where the Lord had not yet given &#8220;eyes to see.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By withholding full understanding, God safeguarded the redemptive plan. If the disciples had grasped everything, they might have resisted the cross even more forcefully than Peter already had (<a href="/matthew/16-22.htm">Matthew 16:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; The veil would lift with the Spirit&#8217;s arrival (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>; <a href="/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32-33</a>), proving that revelation is ultimately a gift, not just a product of study (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They were afraid to ask Him about it</b><p>&#8220;and they were afraid to ask Him about it.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Fear followed confusion. Earlier, their questions had drawn gentle correction (<a href="/luke/8-25.htm">Luke 8:25</a>) and even sharp rebuke (<a href="/mark/8-33.htm">Mark 8:33</a>), so they hesitated.<p>&#8226; <a href="/mark/9-32.htm">Mark 9:32</a> notes the same reticence. Instead of pressing in, they let anxiety silence them, missing a chance for clarity (cf. <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a> invites believers to &#8220;approach the throne of grace with confidence.&#8221; The disciples&#8217; fear contrasts with that privilege, underscoring how Christ&#8217;s completed work would later banish such dread (<a href="/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/9-45.htm">Luke 9:45</a> reveals three intertwined realities: the disciples&#8217; limited understanding, God&#8217;s sovereign timing in revelation, and human fear that keeps us from seeking clarity. Though present followers of Jesus have the full story&#8212;cross, resurrection, and Spirit&#8212;we can still let assumptions and anxieties cloud the plain words of Scripture. The verse calls us to trust God&#8217;s timing, rely on His Spirit for insight, and approach our Lord freely with every question, assured that nothing in His plan is veiled from those who earnestly seek Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they feared to ask him of that saying</span>.

It is possible that they thought this betrayal and death simply veiled for them some bit of teaching to be explained hereafter; it is possible they at once dismissed it from their minds, as men often do painful and mournful forebodings.
