This reflects the role of a disciple as a learner and follower, emphasizing the importance of seeking wisdom and understanding. In the cultural context of first-century Judaism, discipleship involved close association with a teacher, learning not just through instruction but through observation and imitation. This inquiry shows their commitment to grasping the spiritual truths Jesus conveyed.<p><b>what this parable meant.</b><br>Parables were a common teaching method used by Jesus, employing everyday situations to convey deeper spiritual truths. The use of parables fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a>, which speaks of teaching in parables to reveal hidden things. The disciples' question indicates that the meaning of parables was not always immediately clear, even to those closest to Jesus. This particular inquiry follows the Parable of the Sower, which is foundational for understanding the nature of the Kingdom of God and the varied responses to the Gospel message. The disciples' need for explanation highlights the mystery of the Kingdom and the necessity of divine revelation for true comprehension, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, where spiritual truths are discerned through the Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Luke, Jesus is teaching His disciples through parables, which are accounts with spiritual meanings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are eager to understand His teachings.

St. Matthew - who gives the additional detail that on account of the pressure of the crowd on the lake-shore it was spoken from a boat moored close to the bank - relates seven parables here in sequence. It is probable that the Master spoke some of these at least on this occasion, but St. Luke, possibly on account of its extreme solemnity, possibly because he wished to mark <span class="accented">this</span> parable as the first of this new kind of teaching, relates it and its interpretation only, saying nothing further respecting that day's parable-teaching. It is most probable that all these reported discourses, parables, expositions, or sermons, are simply a <span class="accented">resume</span> of the original words. The disciples evidently by their question - which St. Mark tells us was put to Jesus when they were alone with him - were surprised and puzzled, first at the strange change which that eventful day inaugurated in the method of their Master's teaching, and secondly, at the peculiar character of this his first great parable-lesson. It was, indeed, a sombre and depressing announcement whatever way it was looked at - sombre as a picture of the results of his own past ministry, depressing if regarded as a prophecy of their future success as teachers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">His</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
