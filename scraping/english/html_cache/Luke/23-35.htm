The people included various groups: followers of Jesus, curious onlookers, and those who had called for His crucifixion. This moment fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/22-17.htm">Psalm 22:17</a>, "I can count all my bones; they stare and gloat over me." The public nature of crucifixion was intended to serve as a deterrent, and the crowd's presence underscores the humiliation Jesus endured.<p><b>and the rulers sneered at Him</b><br>The rulers mentioned here are likely the Jewish religious leaders, such as the chief priests, scribes, and elders. Their sneering reflects their rejection of Jesus as the Messiah and their belief that His crucifixion validated their judgment against Him. This act of mockery fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a>, "All who see me mock me; they make mouths at me; they wag their heads." Their disdain highlights the spiritual blindness and hardness of heart that Jesus often confronted in His ministry.<p><b>saying, &#8220;He saved others; let Him save Himself</b><br>This taunt refers to Jesus' well-known acts of healing and miracles, which were widely recognized even by His opponents. The rulers' challenge for Jesus to save Himself is ironic, as His mission was to save humanity through His sacrifice. This statement also echoes the temptation of Satan in the wilderness, where Jesus was challenged to prove His divinity (<a href="/luke/4-9.htm">Luke 4:9-12</a>). The rulers' words reveal their misunderstanding of Jesus' mission and the nature of His kingdom.<p><b>if He is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.&#8221;</b><br>The title "Christ" means "Anointed One" and is synonymous with "Messiah." The rulers' use of this title is sarcastic, questioning Jesus' claim to be the Messiah. "The Chosen One" is a messianic title that emphasizes divine selection and approval, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>, "Behold my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights." This phrase underscores the tension between human expectations of the Messiah as a political liberator and the reality of Jesus' mission as a suffering servant. The rulers' mockery unwittingly affirms Jesus' identity and mission, as He fulfills the role of the suffering Messiah prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The general crowd present at the crucifixion, observing the events unfold.

By demanding self-deliverance as the mark of Messiah, they inverted God&#8217;s plan; the true Chosen One would prove His identity by staying on the cross, not coming down from it.

A hush seems to have fallen over the scene. The crowd of by-standers were awed as they at first silently gazed on the dying form of the great Teacher. What memories must have surged up in the hearts of many of the gazers - memories of his parables, his mighty miracles, his words of love; memories of the raising of Lazarus, and of the day of palms! Such a silent awe-struck contemplation was dangerous, the rulers felt, so they hastened to commence their mockery - "to clear," as Stier remarks, "the stifling air, and deafen the voice which was stirring even in themselves." "Look now," they would cry, "at the end of the Man who said he could do, and pretended to do, such strange, unheard-of things!" They seem soon to have induced many to join in their mocking cries and gestures, and so to break the awful silence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/23-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
