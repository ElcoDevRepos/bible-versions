In Jewish thought, it is similar to Sheol, a place of the departed spirits. The New Testament uses "Hades" to describe a place of torment for the unrighteous, distinct from "Gehenna," which refers to the final place of punishment. This setting underscores the reality of an afterlife and the consequences of one's earthly life.<p><b>where he was in torment</b><br>The rich man experiences conscious suffering, indicating that Hades is not merely a state of non-existence or sleep. This torment reflects the justice of God, as the rich man had lived a life of luxury without regard for others, particularly Lazarus. The concept of torment here aligns with other biblical teachings on divine retribution and the moral order established by God.<p><b>he looked up and saw Abraham from afar</b><br>Abraham is a central figure in Jewish history, representing the covenant and promises of God. Seeing Abraham from afar suggests a separation between the righteous and the unrighteous in the afterlife. This imagery reinforces the idea of a great chasm fixed between those who are saved and those who are not, as further explained in the passage.<p><b>with Lazarus by his side</b><br>Lazarus, once a poor and suffering beggar, is now comforted in the presence of Abraham. This reversal of fortunes highlights the theme of divine justice and the hope of redemption for the oppressed. Lazarus's presence with Abraham signifies his inclusion in the covenantal promises, despite his earthly poverty, reflecting the biblical principle that God exalts the humble and brings down the proud.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rich_man.htm">The Rich Man</a></b><br>A central figure in Jesus' parable, representing those who live in luxury without regard for the needs of others.

Today&#8217;s choices echo into eternity, making faith in Christ our single essential preparation for what lies beyond the grave.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">And in hell.</span>--The Greek word is Hades, not Gehenna; the unseen world of the dead, not the final prison of the souls of the lost. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/5-22.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.">Matthew 5:22</a>.) It lies almost on the surface of the parable that it describes an earlier stage of the life after death than that in <a href="/context/matthew/25-31.htm" title="When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:">Matthew 25:31-46</a>. There is no mention here of the Advent of the Judge. As far as the parable itself is concerned, there is nothing to exclude the thought that the torments might have in part the character of a discipline as well as of retribution.<p><span class= "bld">In torments.</span>--The Greek word was applied originally to the test or touchstone of metals, then to the torture to which men had recourse as the one sure test of the veracity of witnesses, than to torments generally. The nature of the "torments" here is suggested by the "flame" of the next verse, but that word has to be taken with all its symbolic associations, and does not necessarily imply the material element of fire. (See Notes on <a href="/context/mark/9-43.htm" title="And if your hand offend you, cut it off: it is better for you to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:">Mark 9:43-49</a>.) What is meant is that there shall be for the soul of the evil-doer, when brought face to face with that holiness of God which is as a consuming fire (<a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm" title="For our God is a consuming fire.">Hebrews 12:29</a>), an anguish as intolerable as the touch of earthly flame is to the nerves of the mortal body. The thought is expressed with great beauty in Dr. Newman's <span class= "ital">Dream of Gerontius</span>:--<p>"And these two pains, so counter and so keen,--<p>The longing for Him, when thou seest Him not; . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments</span>; more accurately, <span class="accented">in Hades</span> (the unseen world of the dead) he <span class="accented">lift up his eyes.</span> The idea of <span class="accented">suffering</span> does not lie in these first words, but in the participle "being in torments," which immediately follows. It is noticeable that, in this Divine picture of unhappy life in the other world there is no coarse, vulgar word-painting such as we meet with so often in mediaeval human works. The very fact of the man's being <span class="accented">unhappy</span> is gently represented. The graver aspect of the torments we learn from the hapless one's own words. Still, it is all very awful, though the facts are so gently told us. "Being in torments:" How could it be otherwise for such a one as Dives? The home of the loving, where Abraham was, would be no home for that selfish man who had never really loved or cared for any one save himself. What were the torments? men with hushed voices ask. A little further on the doomed one speaks of a flame and of his tongue apparently burning, owing to the scorching heat; but it would be a mistake to think of a material flame being intended here. There is nothing in the description of the situation to suggest this; it is rather the burning never to be satisfied, longing for something utterly beyond his reach, that the unhappy man describes as an inextinguishable flame. Were it desirable to dwell on these torments, we should remind men how lustful desires change rapidly into torture for the soul when the means for gratifying them exist not. In the case of Dives, his delight on earth seems to have been society, pleasant jovial company, the being surrounded by a crowd of admiring friends, the daily banquet, the gorgeous apparel, the stately house, - these details more than hint at the pleasure he found in the society of courtier-friends; but in the other world he seems to have been quite alone. Whereas among the blessed there appears to be a sweet companionship. Lazarus is in the company of Abraham, who, of course, only represents a great and goodly gathering. "Abraham's bosom" is simply the well-known expression for that feast or banquet of the happy souls judged worthy of an entrance into Paradise. But in that place where the rich man lifted up his eyes there seems a strange and awful solitariness. A total absence of everything, even of <span class="accented">external</span> causes of trouble, is very noticeable. He was <span class="accented">alone</span>; alone with his thoughts. <span class="cmt_word">And seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/16-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
