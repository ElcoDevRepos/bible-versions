This age was significant in Jewish culture, marking a transition from childhood to adulthood in religious responsibilities. This period in Jesus' life is the only glimpse into His childhood provided in the Gospels, highlighting the importance of His early understanding and engagement with His faith.<p><b>they went up</b><br>The phrase "went up" refers to the journey to Jerusalem, which was geographically higher in elevation than many surrounding areas, including Nazareth where Jesus lived. This ascent was not only physical but also spiritual, as going to Jerusalem for the feasts was a pilgrimage that held deep religious significance. The journey itself was a communal and familial event, often undertaken with relatives and neighbors, reflecting the strong community bonds and shared faith practices of the time.<p><b>according to the custom of the Feast</b><br>The Feast mentioned here is the Passover, one of the three major Jewish pilgrimage festivals, along with Pentecost and Tabernacles, where Jewish males were expected to present themselves at the Temple in Jerusalem. Passover commemorated the Israelites' deliverance from Egyptian bondage, as described in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>. This annual observance was a time of remembrance and celebration of God's salvation and faithfulness. Jesus' participation in this feast underscores His family's adherence to Jewish law and tradition, and it foreshadows His own role as the ultimate Passover Lamb, as referenced in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>At twelve years old, Jesus is on the cusp of Jewish adulthood, a significant age in Jewish tradition, marking a time of increased responsibility and religious duty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary_and_joseph.htm">Mary and Joseph</a></b><br>Jesus' earthly parents, who are devout Jews, faithfully observing the customs and laws of their faith by attending the Feast in Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The spiritual and cultural center of Jewish life, where the annual Feast of Passover is celebrated, drawing Jews from all over to worship and remember God's deliverance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_feast_of_passover.htm">The Feast of Passover</a></b><br>A pivotal Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, symbolizing deliverance and God's faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_custom_of_the_feast.htm">The Custom of the Feast</a></b><br>Refers to the Jewish tradition of pilgrimage to Jerusalem for Passover, a practice rooted in the Law of Moses.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_observance.htm">Faithful Observance</a></b><br>The importance of faithfully observing religious practices and traditions as a means of honoring God and remembering His works.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_growth_and_maturity.htm">Spiritual Growth and Maturity</a></b><br>Jesus' age signifies a time of growth and transition, reminding us of the importance of nurturing spiritual maturity in ourselves and others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/family_and_community_worship.htm">Family and Community Worship</a></b><br>The role of family and community in spiritual development, as seen in Mary and Joseph's commitment to raising Jesus in the faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_identity_in_christ.htm">Understanding Our Identity in Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' awareness of His identity and mission even at a young age challenges us to seek and understand our identity and purpose in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_pilgrimage.htm">The Significance of Pilgrimage</a></b><br>The journey to Jerusalem symbolizes our spiritual journey towards God, encouraging us to pursue Him with intentionality and devotion.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_2_42_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 2:42?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_2_42_Jesus_Jewish_commitment.htm">How does Luke 2:42 illustrate Jesus' commitment to Jewish customs and traditions?

The verse invites believers to nurture children in worship, practice regular obedience, and see every biblical feast as a signpost to the saving work of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(42)<span class= "bld">When he was twelve years old.</span>--The stages of Jewish childhood were marked as follows:--At three the boy was weaned, and wore for the first time the fringed or tasselled garment prescribed by <a href="/context/numbers/15-38.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the fringe of the borders a ribbon of blue:">Numbers 15:38-41</a>, and <a href="/deuteronomy/22-12.htm" title="You shall make you fringes on the four quarters of your clothing, with which you cover yourself.">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>. His education began, at first under the mother's care. At five he was to learn the Law, at first by extracts written on scrolls of the more important passages, the Shemk or Creed of <a href="/deuteronomy/2-4.htm" title="And command you the people, saying, You are to pass through the coast of your brothers the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take you good heed to yourselves therefore:">Deuteronomy 2:4</a>, the Hallel or Festival Psalms (Psalms 114-118, 136), and by catechetical teaching in school. At twelve he became more directly responsible for his obedience to the Law, and on the day when he attained the age of thirteen, put on for the first time the phylacteries which were worn at the recital of his daily prayer. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/23-5.htm" title="But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,">Matthew 23:5</a>.) It was accordingly an epoch of transition analogous to that which obtains among us at Confirmation. It was, therefore in strict accordance with usage, with perhaps a slight anticipation of the actual day, that the "child Jesus" should, at the age of twelve, have gone up with His parents to Jerusalem. If the conjecture suggested in the Notes on <a href="/luke/2-8.htm" title="And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.">Luke 2:8</a>, that the birth of our Lord coincided with the Paschal Season, be accepted, He may actually have completed His thirteenth year during the Feast; and so have become, in the fullest sense, one of the "children of the Law," bound to study it and know its meaning. This at least fits in with, and in fact explains, the narrative that follows. In the later Maxims of the Fathers (<span class= "ital">Pirke Aboth</span>) two other stages of education were marked out. At ten, a boy was to enter on the study of the <span class= "ital">Mischna </span>(= "comments"), or body of traditional interpretations of the Law; at eighteen, on that of the <span class= "ital">Gemara </span>(= "completeness"), or wider collection of sayings or legends, which, with the <span class= "ital">Mischna, </span>made up what is known as the <span class= "ital">Talmud </span>(= "learning," or "doctrine").<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast</span>. When a Jewish boy was three years old he was given the tasselled garment directed by the Law (<a href="/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38-41</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>). At five he usually began to learn portions of the Law, under his mother's direction; these were passages written on scrolls, such as the shema or creed of <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, the Hallel Psalms (<a href="/psalms/114.htm">Psalm 114, 118, 136</a>). When the boy was thirteen years old he wore, for the first time, the phylacteries, which the Jew always put on at the recital of the daily prayer. In the well-known and most ancient 'Maxims of the Fathers' ('Pirke Avoth'), we read that, at the age of ten, a boy was to commence the study of the Mishna (the Mishna was a compilation of traditional interpretations of the Law); at eighteen he was to be instructed in the Gemara (the Gemara was a vast collection of interpretations of the Mishna. The Mishua and Gemara together make up the Talmud. The Mishna may roughly be termed the text, the Gemara the commentary, of the Talmud). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/2-42.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">when</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(hote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3753.htm">Strong's 3753: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, at which time.
