The term "woe" is a strong expression of judgment and lamentation, often used by prophets in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8-23</a>). The "experts in the law" were responsible for teaching and guiding the people in spiritual matters, yet they were failing in their duties. This echoes the prophetic tradition of condemning leaders who mislead the people (<a href="/jeremiah/23.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-2</a>).<p><b>For you have taken away the key to knowledge.</b><br>The "key to knowledge" symbolizes the understanding and insight necessary to comprehend God's will and the Scriptures. By their traditions and interpretations, the religious leaders obscured the true meaning of the Law, making it inaccessible to the common people. This is reminiscent of <a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>, where God laments that His people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. The leaders' actions are contrasted with Jesus, who is the true revelation of God (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>You yourselves have not entered,</b><br>The religious leaders are accused of not entering into the true understanding and relationship with God that the Law was meant to facilitate. This reflects their spiritual blindness and hypocrisy, as they were more concerned with outward appearances and legalistic practices than with genuine faith and obedience (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>). Their failure to enter signifies their rejection of Jesus as the Messiah, who is the fulfillment of the Law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>and you have hindered those who were entering.&#8221;</b><br>Not only did the leaders fail to enter themselves, but they also actively prevented others from doing so. Their teachings and practices placed burdens on the people, making it difficult for them to find the true path to God (<a href="/matthew/23-4.htm">Matthew 23:4</a>). This hindrance is a grave offense, as it obstructs the salvation and spiritual growth of others. Jesus' ministry, in contrast, was about opening the way to God for all who would believe (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, addressing the experts in the law with a strong rebuke.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/experts_in_the_law.htm">Experts in the Law (Scribes)</a></b><br>Religious leaders and scholars responsible for interpreting the Jewish law, criticized by Jesus for their role in obstructing true understanding.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_key_of_knowledge.htm">The Key of Knowledge</a></b><br>A metaphorical concept representing the understanding and insight necessary to enter into a true relationship with God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_audience.htm">The Audience</a></b><br>Primarily the Jewish people who were being misled by the religious leaders of the time.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_setting.htm">The Setting</a></b><br>This event takes place during Jesus' ministry, as He addresses the religious leaders and the people around Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_responsibility_of_leaders.htm">The Responsibility of Leaders</a></b><br>Religious leaders have a duty to guide people towards truth, not away from it.

The verse calls every follower of Jesus to handle God&#8217;s Word plainly and faithfully, to enter the kingdom by obedient faith, and to clear paths&#8212;never block them&#8212;for others who long to know the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(52) <span class= "bld">Woe unto you, lawyers!</span>--The "woe" in this case is uttered against those who were, by their very calling, the professed interpreters of the Law. Its form rests on the fact that each scribe or "doctor of the law," in the full sense of the term, was symbolically admitted to his office by the delivery of a key. His work was to enter with that key into the treasure-chambers of the house of the interpreter, and to bring forth thence "things new and old" (<a href="/matthew/13-52.htm" title="Then said he to them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed to the kingdom of heaven is like to a man that is an householder, which brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.">Matthew 13:52</a>). The sin of the "lawyers" of that time, the "divines" as we should call them, was that they claimed a monopoly of the power to interpret, and yet did not exercise the power. Wearisome minuteness, a dishonest and demoralising casuistry, fantastic legends, these took the place of a free and reverential study of the meaning of the sacred Books. Those who "were entering in," answer to the souls not far from the kingdom of God, waiting for the consolation of Israel, pressing as with eagerness to the spiritual meaning of Law and Prophet. Such, at one stage of his life, must have been the Evangelist himself. This, it will be noted, is the third occurrence of the word in St. Luke's Gospel. (See Notes on <a href="/luke/8-16.htm" title="No man, when he has lighted a candle, covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed; but sets it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.">Luke 8:16</a>; <a href="/luke/11-33.htm" title="No man, when he has lighted a candle, puts it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.">Luke 11:33</a>.) It is obvious that the passage, as a whole, throws light on the promise of the "keys" of the kingdom made to Peter. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/16-19.htm" title="And I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.">Matthew 16:19</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 52.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.</span> The Talmud gives us the clue to the Master's words of bitter reproach here. There were very many, in that restless age of inquiry, waiting for the consolation of Israel, who longed to enter into the real meaning of psalm and prophecy; but the scribe, the lawyer, and the doctor, with their strange and unreal interpretations, their wild and fantastic legends, their own often meaningless additions, effectually hindered all real study of the Divine oracles. The Talmud - in the form we now possess it - well represents the teaching of these schools so bitterly censured by the Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/11-52.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Woe</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#8016;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Ouai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3759.htm">Strong's 3759: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woe!, alas!, uttered in grief or denunciation.
