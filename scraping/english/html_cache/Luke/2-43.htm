If we deal with the history on its human side, the probable course of things was this:--The Passover Feast lasted seven days; on each of those days, after the first, we may well believe the <span class= "ital">"</span>child Jesus" was seeking wisdom to do His Father's work at the hands of the appointed teachers who "sat in Moses' chair." This had become habitual. He went, as usual, when the Feast was over; but Joseph and Mary, instead of seeking Him there, took for granted that He had started with the other boys of the same age who had come from Nazareth. He was therefore left in the strange city by Himself, finding shelter for the night, probably, in the house where Joseph and Mary had lodged during the feast, and spending the day, as before, in drinking in the wondrous things of God's Law, and asking questions which showed that He demanded more than traditional or conventional explanations. His question, "Wist ye not . . .?" implies that they ought to have known where He would be.<p><span class= "bld">Joseph and his mother knew not of it.</span>--The better MSS. read, <span class= "ital">his parents, </span>the alteration having probably been made in the received text on the same ground as that in <a href="/luke/2-33.htm" title="And Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of him.">Luke 2:33</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the Child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem</span>. The feast lasted seven days. Now, a boy in the East, twelve years old, is usually far more advanced than is ever the case in our Northern nations, where development is much slower. We may well suppose that the Boy was left much to himself during these days of the feast. It requires no stress of imagination to picture him absorbed in the temple and all that was to be seen and learned there. It was, doubtless, his first visit since infancy to the glorious house. Slowly, surely, had he been growing up into the consciousness of what he was and whence he came: may we not in all reverence assume that his self-recognition first really burst forth from the depths of his childhood's unconsciousness in that solemn week spent in the storied temple courts? When Joseph and Mary and their friends, as was usual after the seven days, commenced their return journey, the Boy, instead of joining this homeward-bound company of pilgrims, went as usual to the temple and the great teachers there, wholly absorbed in the new light which was breaking in upon him. There they found him. Strange that they should have for so long searched in other places. Had they only called to mind the sacred secret of the Child, surely they would have gone at once to the temple; was it not, after all, his earthly home, that holy house of his Father in Jerusalem? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/2-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">those</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8048;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
