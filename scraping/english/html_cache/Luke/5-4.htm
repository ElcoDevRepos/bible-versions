In the context of <a href="/luke/5.htm">Luke 5</a>, Jesus was teaching a crowd from Simon Peter's boat. This setting highlights Jesus' use of natural surroundings to amplify His voice and reach more people. The act of teaching from a boat also symbolizes the spreading of the Gospel to the nations, as the sea often represents the Gentile world in biblical symbolism.<p><b>He said to Simon</b><br>Simon, also known as Peter, is a central figure in the Gospels. His name means "hearing" or "listening," which is significant as he becomes a key disciple who listens to and follows Jesus. This moment marks the beginning of Simon's deeper journey with Christ, transitioning from a fisherman to a "fisher of men" (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>). The personal address to Simon underscores the relational aspect of Jesus' ministry.<p><b>Put out into deep water</b><br>The instruction to move into deeper water is both literal and metaphorical. Geographically, the Sea of Galilee, where this event takes place, is known for its sudden depth changes. Spiritually, the call to "deep water" suggests a move from the safety of the shore into the unknown, requiring faith and trust in Jesus. This can be seen as a metaphor for the Christian life, where believers are called to step out in faith beyond their comfort zones.<p><b>and let down your nets for a catch</b><br>This command challenges Simon's professional expertise as a fisherman, as fishing was typically done at night in shallower waters. The instruction to fish during the day in deep water defies conventional wisdom, highlighting the miraculous nature of what is about to occur. This act prefigures the abundant spiritual harvest that will come through the disciples' ministry. It also connects to the prophecy of <a href="/ezekiel/47-9.htm">Ezekiel 47:9</a>, where living waters bring life and abundance, symbolizing the life-giving power of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching by the Sea of Galilee.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon.htm">Simon (Peter)</a></b><br>A fisherman by trade, who would later become one of Jesus' closest disciples and a foundational leader in the early church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sea_of_galilee.htm">Sea of Galilee</a></b><br>A freshwater lake in Israel where Jesus performed many miracles and taught the crowds.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>People gathered to hear Jesus teach, demonstrating His growing influence and the public's interest in His message.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fishing_event.htm">The Fishing Event</a></b><br>Jesus instructs Simon to cast his nets into deep water, leading to a miraculous catch of fish.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_christ's_command.htm">Obedience to Christ's Command</a></b><br>Simon's willingness to follow Jesus' instruction, despite his own expertise and previous failure, demonstrates the importance of obedience to Christ, even when it defies human logic.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_provision.htm">Faith in God's Provision</a></b><br>The miraculous catch of fish serves as a reminder that God can provide abundantly beyond our expectations when we trust and obey Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_discipleship.htm">The Call to Discipleship</a></b><br>Just as Simon was called to follow Jesus and become a "fisher of men," believers today are called to participate in the mission of spreading the Gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trusting_in_god's_timing.htm">Trusting in God's Timing</a></b><br>Simon's experience teaches us to trust in God's timing and direction, even when our own efforts seem fruitless.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_jesus'_word.htm">The Power of Jesus' Word</a></b><br>The event underscores the authority and power of Jesus' word, which can bring about miraculous results in our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_5_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 5:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_deepen_our_spiritual_lives_today.htm">How can we "put out into deep water" in our spiritual lives today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Luke_5_4_Obedience_to_Jesus_commands.htm">What does Luke 5:4 teach about obedience to Jesus' commands?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Luke_5_4_Prov_3_5-6_on_trust.htm">How does Luke 5:4 connect with Proverbs 3:5-6 on trusting God?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_Jesus_teachings_at_work.htm">In what ways can we apply Jesus' directive to our daily work?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_this_verse_inspire_trust_in_God_23.htm">How does this verse encourage reliance on God's timing and provision?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_5_4_Jesus_control_over_nature.htm">What does Luke 5:4 reveal about Jesus' authority over nature?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Luke_5_4_s_impact_on_faith_obedience.htm">How does Luke 5:4 challenge our understanding of faith and obedience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_Peter_s_response_in_Luke_5_4.htm">Why is Peter's response to Jesus' command in Luke 5:4 significant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what's_the_sea_of_galilee_story's_meaning.htm">What is the significance of the Sea of Galilee story?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/evidence_for_jesus'_coin-in-fish_claim.htm">In Matthew 17:24&#8211;27, Jesus tells Peter to find a coin in a fish&#8217;s mouth to pay the temple tax.

The same authority now moves from shore to boat.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He said to Simon</b><p>The Lord addresses Simon personally, even though others are present. Obedience to Christ is never anonymous.<p>&#8226; Simon has already witnessed Jesus heal his mother-in-law (<a href="/luke/4-38.htm">Luke 4:38-39</a>). Past experience lays groundwork for deeper trust.<p>&#8226; Jesus often singles out individuals&#8212;think of Zacchaeus (&#8220;Zacchaeus, hurry down&#8221; <a href="/luke/19-5.htm">Luke 19:5</a>) or Saul on the road (&#8220;Saul, Saul&#8221; <a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a>)&#8212;showing that discipleship is relational, not merely theoretical.<p>&#8226; Simon represents all believers who hear the Lord&#8217;s specific call amid ordinary routines (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Put out into deep water</b><p>Literal movement into deeper water pictures the spiritual move from shallow familiarity to profound dependence.<p>&#8226; Deep places are where human skill feels small; &#8220;Deep calls to deep in the roar of Your waterfalls&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/42-7.htm">Psalm 42:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus later invites Peter to step onto deep water again&#8212;not in a boat but on foot (<a href="/matthew/14-28.htm">Matthew 14:28-29</a>). Both moments require daring faith.<p>&#8226; God repeatedly leads servants beyond comfort: Abram leaves Ur (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>); Israel steps into the Jordan at flood stage (<a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a>). The pattern is consistent&#8212;depth precedes discovery.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and let down your nets for a catch.</b><p>The command contains a promise; obedience will not be pointless.<p>&#8226; Simon voices his misgivings yet obeys: &#8220;Master, we have toiled all night&#8230;and yet at Your word I will let down the nets&#8221; (<a href="/luke/5-5.htm">Luke 5:5</a>). Faith acts on Christ&#8217;s word, not on circumstances.<p>&#8226; A similar post-resurrection scene confirms Jesus&#8217; lordship over results: &#8220;Cast the net on the right side of the boat&#8230; So they cast it, and they were unable to haul it in for the great quantity of fish&#8221; (<a href="/john/21-6.htm">John 21:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord alone controls fruitfulness: &#8220;Apart from Me you can do nothing&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>). Our part is to let down the nets; His part is the catch.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/5-4.htm">Luke 5:4</a> portrays Jesus moving from proclamation to personal command, drawing Simon from shallow certainty into deep-water trust. The verse teaches that Christ&#8217;s authoritative word demands individual obedience, often leading us where self-reliance fails, so that divine power can be clearly displayed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Let down your nets.</span>--It is, perhaps, a slight indication that the narrative of St. Luke does not give the same event as the other Gospels, that they use a different word for "net," and one that has, technically, quite a distinct meaning. St. Luke's word, however, is generic, and may therefore include the other; and the other two use it when they speak of the disciples leaving their "nets."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And let down your nets for a draught</span>. Not necessarily a miraculous draught; it was probably a supernatural knowledge which the Lord had of a shoal of fish to be found in the spot indicated by him to the fishermen. Tristram (' Natural History of the Bible ') says, "The thickness of the shoals of fish is almost incredible to any one who has not witnessed them. They often cover an area of more than an acre, and when the fish move slowly forward in a mass, and are rising out of the water, they are packed so close together that it appears as if a heavy rain was beating down on the surface of the water." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/5-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8041;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(H&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5613.htm">Strong's 5613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably adverb of comparative from hos; which how, i.e. In that manner.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] had finished</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#945;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(epausato)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3973.htm">Strong's 3973: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary verb; to stop, i.e. Restrain, quit, desist, come to an end.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">speaking,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#945;&#955;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(lal&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2980.htm">Strong's 2980: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of an otherwise obsolete verb; to talk, i.e. Utter words.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
