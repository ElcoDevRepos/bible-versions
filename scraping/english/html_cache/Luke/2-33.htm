Joseph, though not the biological father, played a crucial role in Jesus' upbringing, fulfilling the legal and social role of a father in Jewish culture. Mary, chosen by God, was a young woman of faith and obedience. Their presence at the temple signifies their adherence to Jewish law and customs, as they were there for the purification rites and to present Jesus to the Lord, as described earlier in <a href="/luke/2.htm">Luke 2</a>.<p><b>were amazed</b><br>The amazement of Joseph and Mary reflects their ongoing realization of the divine nature and mission of Jesus. Despite angelic announcements and miraculous events surrounding Jesus' birth, the words spoken by Simeon in the temple further revealed the profound destiny of their child. This amazement is a recurring theme in the Gospels, as Jesus' life and mission continually surpassed human understanding and expectations.<p><b>at what was spoken about Him</b><br>Simeon's prophecy, which precedes this verse, spoke of Jesus as a light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of Israel. This was a radical message, indicating that Jesus' mission extended beyond the Jewish people to include all nations. This aligns with Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>, which foretold the Messiah as a light to the Gentiles.
