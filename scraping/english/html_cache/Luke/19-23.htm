In the cultural context of the first century, banking systems were rudimentary, but the concept of earning interest was understood. The master in the parable represents God, who entrusts His servants with resources and expects them to be used wisely. This echoes the biblical principle of stewardship found in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, where humanity is given dominion over the earth. The failure to deposit the money signifies a lack of initiative and faithfulness, paralleling the warning in <a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a> about knowing the good one ought to do and failing to do it.<p><b>and upon my return</b><br>This phrase alludes to the eschatological theme of Christ's second coming. The return of the master symbolizes Jesus' return to judge the living and the dead, as described in <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>. The expectation of accountability upon His return is a recurring theme in the New Testament, urging believers to live in readiness and faithfulness. The anticipation of the master's return also reflects the Jewish understanding of the Day of the Lord, a time of divine intervention and judgment.<p><b>I could have collected it with interest?</b><br>The concept of collecting interest underscores the idea of growth and productivity in the spiritual life. In the parable, interest represents the fruits of faithful service and the expansion of God's kingdom. This aligns with the teaching in <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>, where Jesus speaks of bearing much fruit as evidence of being His disciples. The expectation of interest also highlights the principle of reaping what one sows, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-9</a>. Theologically, it emphasizes the importance of using one's gifts and opportunities for the glory of God and the advancement of His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>In the parable, the master represents God or Jesus, who entrusts His servants with resources and expects them to be productive.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servants.htm">The Servants</a></b><br>These are the individuals entrusted with the master's money, symbolizing believers who are given gifts and responsibilities by God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_money.htm">The Money (Mina)</a></b><br>This represents the resources, talents, or opportunities God gives to His people to use for His kingdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bankers.htm">The Bankers</a></b><br>In the parable, the bankers symbolize a means of gaining interest or profit, representing the idea of using resources wisely to yield spiritual growth.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_reckoning.htm">The Event of Reckoning</a></b><br>This is the moment when the master returns and holds the servants accountable for their stewardship, symbolizing the final judgment or Christ's return.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_and_responsibility.htm">Stewardship and Responsibility</a></b><br>God entrusts each believer with resources, talents, and opportunities.
