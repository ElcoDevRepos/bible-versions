The tenants symbolize the religious leaders of Israel who were entrusted with the care of God's people. The act of seeing the son indicates recognition and awareness of his identity and authority. This mirrors the religious leaders' awareness of Jesus' claims and his messianic role, yet they chose to reject him. The vineyard, a common biblical metaphor for Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>), sets the stage for this confrontation.<p><b>they discussed it among themselves</b><br>This phrase highlights the premeditated nature of the tenants' actions. It reflects the deliberation and conspiracy among the religious leaders to eliminate Jesus, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/11-47.htm">John 11:47-53</a>, where the chief priests and Pharisees plot to kill Jesus. This internal discussion signifies a conscious decision to oppose God's plan, showcasing the hardness of their hearts.<p><b>and said, &#8216;This is the heir.</b><br>Acknowledging the son as the heir underscores the tenants' understanding of his rightful claim to the vineyard. In a broader theological context, Jesus is the heir of all things (<a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>), and his coming signifies the fulfillment of God's promises. The recognition of Jesus as the heir by the religious leaders parallels their understanding of his messianic identity, yet they reject him out of envy and fear of losing their own power and influence.<p><b>Let us kill him,</b><br>This phrase foreshadows the crucifixion of Jesus, where the religious leaders conspired to have him executed (<a href="/matthew/26-3.htm">Matthew 26:3-4</a>). It reflects the ultimate rejection of God's Son and the culmination of Israel's history of rejecting the prophets sent to them. The decision to kill the son is a direct challenge to God's authority and plan, illustrating the depth of human sinfulness and rebellion.<p><b>and the inheritance will be ours.&#8217;</b><br>The tenants' desire to seize the inheritance reveals their greed and misunderstanding of God's kingdom. They believed that by eliminating the heir, they could claim ownership of the vineyard. This reflects the religious leaders' desire to maintain control over the people and the religious system, rejecting the true King. Theologically, it underscores the futility of human attempts to thwart God's sovereign will, as God's purposes will ultimately prevail despite human opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tenants.htm">Tenants</a></b><br>These are the individuals who were entrusted with the care of the vineyard.

Now they recognize someone different coming down the road&#8212;&#8220;the son.&#8221; In the story, the landowner represents God the Father and the son clearly points to Jesus, &#8220;the radiance of God&#8217;s glory and the exact representation of His nature&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>). The religious leaders hearing this knew the vineyard was a common Old Testament image for Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>). In real time they were &#8220;seeing&#8221; the Son walk among them, fulfilling <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>: &#8220;He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they discussed it among themselves</b><p>Instead of welcoming the rightful heir, the tenants huddle up and plot.

The kings of the earth take their stand&#8230;against the LORD and against His Anointed.&#8221; The chief priests and Pharisees did exactly this, convening councils to decide &#8220;what we are to do, for this Man performs many signs&#8221; (<a href="/john/11-47.htm">John 11:47-53</a>). Rejection of Christ is never merely passive; it involves deliberate reasoning that shuts out God&#8217;s claim.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said, &#8220;This is the heir.&#8221;</b><p>Astonishingly, the tenants recognize the son&#8217;s identity. They know whose authority he carries, yet they reject him. The same contradiction surfaces when the crowd shouts, &#8220;Hosanna to the Son of David!&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>) and days later cries, &#8220;Crucify Him!&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/27-22.htm">Matthew 27:22-23</a>). <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a> affirms Jesus as the appointed &#8220;heir of all things,&#8221; and <a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a> promises that believers become &#8220;co-heirs with Christ.&#8221; To reject the heir is to forfeit any share in the inheritance God offers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let us kill him</b><p>The parable&#8217;s climax predicts the cross. Luke will soon record the leaders&#8217; demand: &#8220;Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!&#8221; (<a href="/luke/23-18.htm">Luke 23:18</a>). Peter later declares, &#8220;This Man was handed over to you by God&#8217;s deliberate plan&#8230; and you, with the help of wicked men, put Him to death&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>). Even murderous intent becomes part of God&#8217;s redemptive purpose; yet the responsibility for the choice remains squarely on the tenants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the inheritance will be ours.</b><p>The tenants believe that eliminating the son secures the vineyard for themselves. Likewise the Sanhedrin feared losing &#8220;both our place and our nation&#8221; (<a href="/john/11-48.htm">John 11:48</a>). Clinging to position, they missed the very kingdom they desired. Jesus warns elsewhere, &#8220;For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul?&#8221; (<a href="/mark/8-36.htm">Mark 8:36</a>).
