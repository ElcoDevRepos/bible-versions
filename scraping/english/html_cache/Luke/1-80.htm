His growth is both physical and spiritual, indicating a normal human development. This growth is reminiscent of other biblical figures such as Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/2-26.htm">1 Samuel 2:26</a>) and Jesus (<a href="/luke/2-40.htm">Luke 2:40</a>), who also grew in wisdom and stature. The emphasis on growth highlights the preparation for his future ministry.<p><b>and became strong in spirit;</b><br>John's spiritual strength is a key aspect of his character, preparing him for his prophetic role. This strength in spirit is a divine empowerment, similar to the empowerment seen in Old Testament prophets like Elijah. It signifies a deep connection with God and readiness to fulfill his mission. The Holy Spirit's role in John's life is evident from his conception (<a href="/luke/1-15.htm">Luke 1:15</a>), indicating a life set apart for God's purposes.<p><b>and he lived in the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness is a significant location in biblical narratives, often associated with testing, preparation, and divine encounters. For John, the wilderness represents a place of solitude and spiritual formation, away from societal distractions. It is also symbolic of Israel's history, recalling the Exodus and the Israelites' journey through the desert. This setting prepares John for his role as a forerunner to Christ, calling people to repentance and renewal.<p><b>until the time of his public appearance to Israel.</b><br>John's public appearance marks the beginning of his ministry, where he calls Israel to repentance and baptizes them in the Jordan River. This timing is divinely orchestrated, aligning with the fulfillment of prophecy (<a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>) and the coming of the Messiah. John's role as a herald is crucial in preparing the way for Jesus, fulfilling the angel Gabriel's prophecy to Zechariah (<a href="/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>). His ministry sets the stage for the new covenant and the revelation of Jesus as the Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_child.htm">The Child</a></b><br>Refers to John the Baptist, the son of Zechariah and Elizabeth, who was set apart for a special mission to prepare the way for the Lord.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>A place of solitude and preparation, often associated with spiritual growth and testing in the Bible.

The usual Jewish education, the observance of the Nazarite vow, the death of his parents while he was comparatively young, an early retirement from the world to the deserts that surrounded the western shores of the Dead Sea, study and meditation given to the Law and the Prophets, the steadfast waiting for the consolation of Israel, possible intercourse with the Essenes who lived in that region, or with hermit-teachers, like Banus, the master of Josephus (<span class= "ital">Life, c.</span> 1), whose form of life was after the same fashion as his own: this we may surmise as probable, but we cannot say more. Whatever may have been the surroundings of his life, he entered upon his work in a spirit which was intensely personal and original.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 80.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the child grew, and waxed</span> <span class="cmt_word">strong in spirit</span>. We have here another of St. Luke's solemn pauses in his narrative - one of those little passages in which, in a few words, he sets before us a picture clear and vivid of the events of long years. "The description," writes Dr. Farrar, "resembles that of the childhood of Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/2-26.htm">1 Samuel 2:26</a>) and of our Lord (<a href="/luke/2-40.htm">Luke 2:40-52</a>). Nothing, however, is said of 'favor with men.' In the case of the Baptist, as of others, 'the boy was father to the man;' and he probably showed from the first that rugged sternness which is wholly unlike the winning grace of the child Christ. 'The Baptist was no lamb of God. He was a wrestler with life, one to whom peace does not come easily, but only after a long struggle. His restlessness had driven him into the desert, where he had contended for years with thoughts he could not master, and from whence he uttered his startling alarms to the nation. He was among the dogs rather than among the lambs of the Shepherd' ('Ecce Homo')." And was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel. "The deserts" here alluded to were that desolate waste country south of Jericho and along the shores of the Dead Sea. We know nothing of the details of the life of the boy, the wonderful circumstances of whose birth are related so circumstantially in this opening chapter of St. Luke's Gospel. Mary, whose "memories," we believe, are recounted almost in her own words, was herself a witness of some of the circumstances narrated; from her friend and cousin Elisabeth she doubtless received the true history of the rest. But Zacharias and Elisabeth, we know, were aged persons when John was born. They probably lived only a short time after his birth. Hence his solitary desert life. Of it we know nothing. In those wild regions at that time dwelt many grave ascetics and hermit teachers, like the Pharisee Banus, the matter of Josephus. From some of these the orphan boy probably received his training. It is clear, from such passages as <a href="/john/1-31.htm">John 1:31-33</a> and chapter John 3:2, that some direct communication from the Highest put an end to the ascetic desert life and study. Some theophany, perhaps, like the appearance of the burning bush which called Moses to his great post, summoned the pioneer of Christ to his dangerous and difficult work. But we possess no account of what took place on this occasion when God spoke to his servant John, the evangelist simply recording the fact, "The word of God came unto the son of Zacharias in the wilderness" (chapter 3:2). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/1-80.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(To)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
