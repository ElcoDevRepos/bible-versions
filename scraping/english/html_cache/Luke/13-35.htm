The "house" symbolizes both the temple and the nation of Israel. Historically, this prophecy was fulfilled in AD 70 when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and the temple. The term "desolate" indicates a state of emptiness and ruin, reflecting God's judgment due to Israel's rejection of Jesus as the Messiah. This echoes the warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah and Isaiah about the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>And I tell you that you will not see Me again</b><br>Jesus is addressing the people of Jerusalem, indicating a period of separation between Himself and the nation. This separation is both physical and spiritual, as Jesus would soon be crucified, resurrected, and ascend to heaven. The phrase suggests a future time when the people will recognize Him, pointing to the Second Coming. It also implies a period of spiritual blindness for Israel until they acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah.<p><b>until you say, &#8216;Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This part of the verse is a reference to <a href="/psalms/118-26.htm">Psalm 118:26</a>, a messianic psalm that was traditionally sung during the Passover. It signifies a future recognition and acceptance of Jesus as the Messiah by the Jewish people. The phrase was also shouted by the crowds during Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem (<a href="/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>), but here it points to a future fulfillment when Israel will welcome Jesus at His return. This acknowledgment is essential for the restoration and redemption of Israel, aligning with prophecies in <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a> and <a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26-27</a>, which speak of a future national repentance and salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing the people of Jerusalem, lamenting their rejection of Him as the Messiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city symbolizing the heart of Jewish religious life, which Jesus predicts will be left desolate due to its rejection of Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house.htm">The House</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, representing the spiritual state of the nation of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' lament, representing those who have not recognized Him as the Messiah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_coming_of_the_lord.htm">The Coming of the Lord</a></b><br>A future event when Jesus will be recognized as the Messiah, fulfilling the prophecy of His return.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_rejection.htm">The Consequences of Rejection</a></b><br>The desolation of Jerusalem serves as a warning of the spiritual consequences of rejecting Christ.

Van Oosterzee comments here: "Their senses are still blinded. The veil of the Talmud that hangs over their eyes is twice as heavy as the veil of Moses." The promise which concludes this saying of the Master can only refer to the far future, to the day of the penitence of Israel. It harmonizes with the voice of the older prophets, and tells us that the day will surely come when the people shall look on him whom they pierced, and shall mourn. But <span class="accented">that</span> mourning will be turned speedily into joy. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/13-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Look,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#8058;</span> <span class="translit">(idou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2400.htm">Strong's 2400: </a> </span><span class="str2">See!
