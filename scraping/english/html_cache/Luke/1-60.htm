However, Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist, takes an assertive role here, which is significant given the patriarchal society. Her response indicates her obedience to the divine message received by her husband, Zechariah, as seen earlier in <a href="/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13</a>, where the angel Gabriel instructs that the child should be named John.<p><b>&#8220;No!</b><br>Elizabeth's emphatic "No!" underscores her determination and faithfulness to God's command. This strong negation highlights her rejection of societal norms and expectations, as the relatives and neighbors expected the child to be named after his father, Zechariah. Her response reflects a deep conviction and trust in the divine revelation given to her family.<p><b>He shall be called John.&#8221;</b><br>The name "John" means "Yahweh is gracious" or "God is gracious," which is fitting given the miraculous nature of his birth to elderly parents and his role in preparing the way for Jesus Christ. This name was divinely appointed, as mentioned in <a href="/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13</a>, and signifies the grace of God in the unfolding plan of salvation. John's life and ministry would indeed herald the coming of Jesus, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, which speaks of a voice calling in the wilderness to prepare the way for the Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elizabeth.htm">Elizabeth</a></b><br>The mother of John the Baptist, a righteous woman from the priestly line of Aaron.

It is clear (from verse 62) that the old priest was afflicted with deafness as well as with dumbness. At the naming ceremony, the stricken Zacharias, who was patiently awaiting the hour when his God should restore to him his lost powers, made no effort to express his will. He had already in the past months, no doubt, written down for Elisabeth the name of the boy that was to be born. She interrupts the ceremony with her wishes. The guests are surprised, and make signs to the father. He at once writes on his tablets, "His name is John." The name had been already given.
