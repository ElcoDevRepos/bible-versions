Herod the Great ruled Judea from 37 to 4 BC. Known for his extensive building projects, including the expansion of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, Herod was also infamous for his tyrannical rule and paranoia, which led to the execution of several family members. This period was marked by political tension and Roman influence over Judea, setting the stage for the coming of the Messiah as prophesied in the Old Testament.<p><b>there was a priest named Zechariah</b><br>Zechariah was a common name in Jewish history, meaning "Yahweh remembers." As a priest, Zechariah served in the Temple, performing sacred duties and rituals. The priesthood was a respected position, and priests were seen as mediators between God and the people. Zechariah's role highlights the continuity of God's covenant with Israel and the importance of the Temple in Jewish worship.<p><b>who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah</b><br>The division of Abijah was one of the 24 priestly divisions established by King David (<a href="/1_chronicles/24-10.htm">1 Chronicles 24:10</a>). Each division served in the Temple for one week, twice a year. This system ensured that the duties of the Temple were shared among the descendants of Aaron. The mention of Abijah connects Zechariah to a long lineage of priests, emphasizing the fulfillment of God's promises through established religious structures.<p><b>and whose wife Elizabeth was a descendant of Aaron</b><br>Elizabeth's lineage as a descendant of Aaron, the brother of Moses and the first high priest, underscores her own priestly heritage. This connection to Aaron highlights the purity and legitimacy of John the Baptist's lineage, as both parents were from priestly lines. Elizabeth's name, meaning "God is my oath," reflects her faithfulness and the divine purpose in her life. The union of Zechariah and Elizabeth symbolizes the merging of priestly lines, setting the stage for the birth of John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_king_of_judea.htm">Herod King of Judea</a></b><br>Herod the Great, a Roman-appointed king known for his extensive building projects and the expansion of the Second Temple in Jerusalem.

That named after Abia, or Abijah, appears in <a href="/1_chronicles/24-10.htm" title="The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,">1Chronicles 24:10</a> as the eighth of the twenty-four courses into which the houses of Eleazar and Ithamar were divided by David. On the first return from the Captivity only four of these courses are mentioned as having come back to Jerusalem (<a href="/context/ezra/2-36.htm" title="The priests: the children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred seventy and three.">Ezra 2:36-39</a>), and the name Abijah is not one of them. It appears, however, in later lists (<a href="/nehemiah/10-7.htm" title="Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,">Nehemiah 10:7</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-4.htm" title="Iddo, Ginnetho, Abijah,">Nehemiah 12:4</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-17.htm" title="Of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai:">Nehemiah 12:17</a>), and the four-and-twenty sets were probably soon re-organised. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5</span> - chapter Luke 2:52. - THE GOSPEL OF THE INFANCY. The critical reader of the Gospel in the original Greek is here startled by the abrupt change in the style of writing. The first four verses, which constitute the introduction, are written in pure classical language; the sentences are balanced, almost with a rhythmical accuracy. They are the words evidently of a highly cultured mind, well versed in Greek thought. But in the fifth verse, where the history of the eventful period really begins, all is changed. The narrative flows on clearly with a certain picturesqueness of imagery; the style is simple, easy, vivid; but at once the reader is sensible that he has passed out of the region of Greek and Western thought. The language is evidently a close translation from some Hebrew original; the imagery is exclusively Jewish, and the thoughts belong to the story of the chosen people. It is clear that this section of St. Luke's writing, which ends, however, with chapter 2, is not derived from apostolic tradition, but is the result of his own investigation into the origin of the faith of Christ, gathered probably from the lips of the virgin mother herself, or from one of the holy women belonging to her kinsfolk who had been with her from the beginning of the wondrous events. St. Luke reproduced, as faithfully as he could in a strange tongue, the revelations - some perhaps written, some no doubt oral, communicated to him, we reverently believe, by the blessed mother of Jesus herself. The story of these two chapters is what St. Luke evidently alludes to when, in his short preface (verse 3), he writes of his "perfect understanding in all things from the very first (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>)." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5-25.</span> - <span class="accented">The vision of Zacharias in the temple</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was in the days of Herod, the King of Judaea</span>. The Herod here alluded to was the one surnamed "the Great." The event here related took place towards the end of his reign. His dominions, besides Judaea, included Samaria, Galilee, and a large district of Peraea. This prince played a conspicuous part in the politics of his day. He was no Hebrew by birth, but an Idumaean, and he owed his position entirely to the favor of Rome, whose vassal he really was during his whole reign. The Roman senate had, on the recommendation of Antony and Octavius, granted to this prince the title of "King of Judaea." It was a strange, sad state of things. The land of promise was ruled over by an Idumaean adventurer, a creature of the great Italian Republic; the holy and beautiful house on Mount Zion was in the custody of an Edomite usurper; the high priest of the Mighty One of Jacob was raised up or deposed as the officials of Rome thought good. Truly the scepter had departed from Judah<span class="cmt_word">. A certain priest named Zacharias</span>; usually spelt among the Hebrews, Zechariah; it means "Remembered of Jehovah," and was a favorite name among the chosen people. <span class="cmt_word">Of the course of Abia</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (course) signified originally "a daily service." It was subsequently used for a group of priests who exercised their priestly functions in the temple for a week, and then gave place to another group. From Eleazar and Ithamar, the two surviving sons of the first high priest Aaron, had descended twenty-four families. Among these King David distributed by lot the various tabernacle (subsequently temple) services, each family group, or course, officiating for eight days - from sabbath to sabbath. From the Babylonish exile, of these twenty-four families only four returned. With the idea of reproducing as nearly as possible the old state of things, these four were subdivided into twenty-four, the twenty-four bearing the original family names, and this succession of courses continued in force until the fall of Jerusalem and the burning of the temple, A.D. 70. According to Josephus, Zacharias was especially distinguished by belonging to the first of the twenty-four courses, or families. Of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth; identical with Elisheba, "One whose oath is to God." Both the husband and wife traced their lineage back to the first high priest - a coveted distinction in Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/1-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
