The act of testing Jesus reflects a recurring theme in the Gospels where religious leaders and others challenge His authority and divinity. This testing echoes the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>), where Satan also sought to test Him. The Greek word used here for "tested" can imply a malicious intent, suggesting skepticism and unbelief. This behavior is reminiscent of the Israelites in the wilderness who tested God despite witnessing His miracles (<a href="/exodus/17-2.htm">Exodus 17:2</a>).<p><b>by demanding a sign from heaven.</b><br>The demand for a sign from heaven suggests a desire for a miraculous event that would unmistakably prove Jesus' divine authority. In Jewish tradition, signs from heaven were often seen as more authoritative than earthly miracles, possibly because they were associated with divine intervention, as seen in the stories of Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>) and the manna from heaven (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>). This request reflects a misunderstanding of Jesus' mission, as He often rebuked the desire for signs as a lack of faith (<a href="/matthew/12-39.htm">Matthew 12:39</a>). The demand for a heavenly sign contrasts with the faith of those who believed in Jesus based on His teachings and earthly miracles. This request also foreshadows the ultimate sign of Jesus' resurrection, which would be the definitive proof of His divine nature and mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is being tested by those around Him.

As in the case of Manoah or Elijah. Some such sign as the pillar of fire these cavilling Jews probably referred to. No doubt, in the course of the public teaching, in the presence of his mighty acts, Jesus was asked for such a sign on several occasions.
