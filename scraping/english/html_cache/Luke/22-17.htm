This is significant as it symbolizes the redemption of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, and here, it foreshadows the redemption through Christ's sacrifice. The act of taking the cup is a deliberate action by Jesus, indicating His willingness to fulfill His mission. This moment is a precursor to the institution of the Lord's Supper, which becomes a central sacrament in Christian worship.<p><b>He gave thanks</b><br>The act of giving thanks, or "eucharisteo" in Greek, is where the term "Eucharist" originates. This thanksgiving is not merely a ritual but a profound expression of gratitude to God, acknowledging His provision and the unfolding of His redemptive plan. It reflects the Jewish tradition of blessing God before partaking in a meal, emphasizing the importance of gratitude in worship and daily life. This moment also highlights Jesus' role as the mediator between God and humanity.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Take this and divide it among yourselves.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus instructs His disciples to share the cup, symbolizing the communal aspect of the new covenant. This act of dividing the cup among themselves signifies the unity and fellowship that believers are to have in Christ. It also points to the shared participation in the benefits of His sacrifice. The communal sharing of the cup is a powerful image of the body of Christ, the Church, being one in Him. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of covenant community, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16-17</a>, where Paul speaks of the cup of blessing as a participation in the blood of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is preparing to share the Last Supper with His disciples.

<a href="/mark/14-23.htm">Mark 14:23</a>).<p>- This action follows the customary first cup of the Passover meal, but Luke uniquely records two separate cups (<a href="/luke/22-17.htm">Luke 22:17, 20</a>), underscoring the unfolding revelation rather than presenting a contradiction.<p>- Holding the cup, the Lord gathers the disciples&#8217; attention, just as He had gathered Israel&#8217;s focus around the Passover lamb of <a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3-7</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He gave thanks</b><p>- The gratitude Jesus expresses is genuine, directed to the Father, modeling for believers that thanksgiving precedes any act of worship (<a href="/john/11-41.htm">John 11:41</a>;

these words therefore establish a lasting ordinance for His followers (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-23.htm">1 Corinthians 11:23-25</a>).<p>- By instructing verbally, He ensures the meaning is clear and not left to speculation, safeguarding the disciples&#8212;and us&#8212;from self-styled interpretations (<a href="/2_peter/1-20.htm">2 Peter 1:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Take this and divide it among yourselves</b><p>- &#8220;Take&#8221;

signals that no one is excluded who comes in faith; salvation and communion are communal realities, not private privileges (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>).<p>- This first cup, shared before the bread is broken (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19</a>), prepares hearts for the deeper symbolism of the second cup, &#8220;the new covenant in My blood&#8221;
