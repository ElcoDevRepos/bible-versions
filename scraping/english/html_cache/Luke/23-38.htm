This was intended to serve as a public deterrent. The fact that it was placed above Jesus signifies the Roman authority's role in His crucifixion, highlighting the political tension between Roman rule and Jewish leadership. The inscription was written in three languages: Hebrew, Latin, and Greek (<a href="/john/19-20.htm">John 19:20</a>), ensuring that it was understood by all who passed by, reflecting the diverse population of Jerusalem at the time.<p><b>THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS:</b><br>This title, meant to mock Jesus, ironically affirms His true identity as the Messiah, the promised King from the line of David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). The Jewish leaders rejected this claim, seeing it as blasphemy, while Pilate used it to provoke them (<a href="/john/19-21.htm">John 19:21-22</a>). The title fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah's kingship (<a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>) and highlights the misunderstanding of Jesus' mission, which was not to establish an earthly kingdom but a spiritual one (<a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>).

Such multilingual inscriptions were common in the great provincial cities of the empire, where so many nationalities were wont to congregate.

Pilate probably (see note on ver. 33, on effect of accurate rendering of <a href="/john/19-19.htm">John 19:19</a>, "and Pilate wrote a title also") wrote a rough draft with his own hand, "Rex Ju-daeorum hic est."
