Jesus' response is personal and discerning, addressing the heart of the man's spiritual condition. It reflects Jesus' ability to perceive the true needs and intentions of individuals, as seen in other encounters such as with the Samaritan woman (<a href="/john/4-7.htm">John 4:7-26</a>).<p><b>&#8220;You still lack one thing:</b><br>Despite the young man's outward obedience, Jesus identifies a deficiency in his spiritual life. This highlights the biblical principle that salvation is not achieved through works alone but requires a heart fully surrendered to God. It echoes the teaching in <a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a> that failing in one point of the law makes one guilty of all.<p><b>Sell everything you own and give to the poor,</b><br>Jesus challenges the man to relinquish his material wealth, which had become an idol in his life. This command underscores the biblical theme of detachment from earthly possessions, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where believers are instructed to store up treasures in heaven. The call to give to the poor aligns with the Old Testament emphasis on justice and care for the needy (<a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>).<p><b>and you will have treasure in heaven.</b><br>This promise of heavenly treasure contrasts with earthly wealth, emphasizing the eternal value of spiritual riches. It reflects the kingdom principle that true wealth is found in a relationship with God and in living according to His will. This is consistent with Jesus' teachings in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7).<p><b>Then come, follow Me.&#8221;</b><br>The invitation to follow Jesus is central to discipleship, requiring a complete commitment to His lordship. This call to follow is a recurring theme in the Gospels, as seen in Jesus' invitation to His first disciples (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>). It signifies a life of obedience, sacrifice, and transformation, aligning with the call to take up one's cross (<a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one giving the command.

Eternal rewards should take precedence over temporary, earthly gains.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_for_the_poor.htm">Compassion for the Poor</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes the importance of caring for the poor, which is a tangible expression of faith and love. This aligns with the broader biblical mandate to support those in need.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/following_jesus.htm">Following Jesus</a></b><br>The ultimate goal is to follow Jesus wholeheartedly.

Jesus&#8217; immediate response shows that He fully heard and understood the man&#8217;s heart&#8212;just as &#8220;The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their cry&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>).<p>&#8226; By noting Jesus&#8217; attentive hearing, we see His relational approach: He is no distant judge but an engaged Savior (<a href="/mark/10-21.htm">Mark 10:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus told him</b><p>&#8226; Jesus speaks with divine authority.

"Jesus beholding him [looking earnestly at him] loved him." There was something noble and true in that life, struggling in the imperfect light of the rabbinic teaching after eternity and heaven, and feeling that in all its struggles some element was surely wanting; and Jesus, as he gazed on the young earnest face, loved him, and proceeded to show him how far removed his life was as yet from the perfect life he dreamed of attaining to. He would show him in a moment how selfish, how earthly, were his thoughts and aims; how firmly chained to earth that heart of his, which he thought only longed for heaven. <span class="cmt_word">Sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in</span> <span class="cmt_word">heaven: and come, follow me;</span> "Well," the Master said, "I will test you. You say you have from your child-days kept your whole duty to your neighbour; you say that you hunger after the higher righteousness. Do you really? Will you indeed be perfect (<a href="/matthew/19-21.htm">Matthew 19:21</a>)? Then I will tell you what you lack. Go, sell those great possessions which I know you love so dearly, and give all to the poor, and come, take up the cross (<a href="/mark/10-21.htm">Mark 10:21</a>), and follow me, the homeless, landless Teacher whom you call by the Divine title 'good.'" The "cross" of St. Mark only Jesus understood then in all its dread significance. It was coming then very near; and the great Teacher saw that his true servants, if they would indeed follow him, must follow him along that lonely road of suffering he was then treading. "Via crucis, via lucis." The young ruler, with his great wealth, thought he had from his youth done his whole duty to his neighbour. The Galilaean Master, whom he so reverenced and admired, reminded him that out of those wide domains, those stored-up riches, out of the mammon of unrighteousness, he had forgotten to make to himself friends who, when he died, should receive him into the eternal tents of heaven. This is what he lacked, lie had probably heard the Lord's teaching in the parables of the unjust steward and of Lazarus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/18-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">On</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">hearing this,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Akousas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
