In biblical teaching, Jesus often uses such phrases to highlight a critical lesson or truth. It is a directive to the listener to grasp the significance of the forthcoming analogy.<p><b>If the homeowner had known at what hour the thief was coming,</b><br>The imagery of a homeowner and a thief is a common metaphor in Scripture, used to illustrate the unexpected nature of certain events, particularly the return of Christ. This metaphor is also found in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/3-3.htm">Revelation 3:3</a>, where the coming of the Lord is likened to a thief in the night. The cultural context of the time would have made this analogy particularly poignant, as homes were often vulnerable to theft, and vigilance was necessary to protect one's property.<p><b>he would not have let his house be broken into.</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the importance of vigilance and preparedness. In the historical context, homes were typically constructed with materials that could be easily breached, such as mud bricks or wood, making them susceptible to break-ins. The lesson here is about spiritual readiness and the need to be constantly prepared for the return of Christ, as emphasized in <a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42-44</a>.

The Lord wants alert followers who value His words as life-or-death information.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If the homeowner had known</b><p>The picture is simple: a responsible owner would make preparations if he knew the exact threat. It assumes basic stewardship&#8212;caring for what God has entrusted. <a href="/proverbs/27-12.htm">Proverbs 27:12</a> reminds us that &#8220;the prudent see danger and take refuge,&#8221; while <a href="/ezekiel/33-6.htm">Ezekiel 33:6</a> warns a watchman who fails to sound the alarm. Jesus affirms that wise believers anticipate danger and prepare rather than drift into neglect.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>At what hour the thief was coming</b><p>The unknown hour is the crux. A thief operates by surprise; so will the return of Christ (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-15.htm">Revelation 16:15</a>). Jesus is not likening Himself to a criminal in motive, but in suddenness. His coming will disrupt complacency, exposing whether hearts were truly awake (<a href="/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35-38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He would not have let his house be broken into</b><p>Vigilance is effective. If we watch, spiritual loss is preventable. <a href="/revelation/3-3.htm">Revelation 3:3</a> urges believers in Sardis to &#8220;wake up&#8230;for if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief.&#8221; Those who guard their &#8220;house&#8221; (faith, family, ministry) ward off the enemy&#8217;s intrusion (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>). Practical applications include:<p>&#8226; Daily repentance and obedience keep doors locked.<p>&#8226; Regular Scripture intake and prayer maintain bright lights inside.<p>&#8226; Fellowship and accountability function like alarm systems (<a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/12-39.htm">Luke 12:39</a> teaches that Christ&#8217;s return will be sudden, and only watchful, prepared believers will avoid tragic loss.

Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not</span>. The Lord abruptly changes the scene of his parable imagery, and with another striking and vivid example enforces his teaching on the subject of the urgent necessity of his servants keeping a sleepless and diligent watch and ward against his coming again in judgment. Very deeply must this image of the Lord's sudden return, as a thief breaks into the house in the still hours of the night, have impressed itself on the hearts of the awe-struck, listening disciples, for we find in the case of SS. Paul and Peter the very words and imagery, and in the case of St. John the imagery again made use of (see <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:1, 2</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-10.htm">1 Peter 3:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-3.htm">Revelation 3:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-15.htm">Revelation 16:15</a>). The meaning of the simile is obvious. The disciples and all followers of Jesus would do well to remain always on the watch for the second advent of the Lord. The time of that awful return was unknown, never could be known; men, however, must not be deceived by the long tarrying; the clay of the Lord would surely come on the world as a thief in the night. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/12-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">understand</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#953;&#957;&#974;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(gin&#333;skete)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1097.htm">Strong's 1097: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary verb; to 'know' in a great variety of applications and with many implications.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this:</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(Touto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
