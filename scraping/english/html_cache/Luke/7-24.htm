John the Baptist, who was imprisoned, sent messengers to Jesus to inquire if He was the expected Messiah. The departure of these messengers marks a shift in focus from John's inquiry to Jesus' teaching about John. This moment underscores the importance of John's role and the validation of his ministry by Jesus.<p><b>Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John</b><br>Jesus takes this opportunity to address the crowd, emphasizing John's significance. This public affirmation of John highlights his prophetic role and prepares the audience to understand the fulfillment of prophecy. It also serves to clarify any misconceptions about John's mission and character.<p><b>What did you go out into the wilderness to see?</b><br>The wilderness is significant as it was the location of John's ministry, symbolizing a place of spiritual renewal and encounter with God. This rhetorical question challenges the crowd to reflect on their motivations and expectations when they sought out John. It implies that John's ministry was not ordinary but divinely appointed.<p><b>A reed swaying in the wind?</b><br>This metaphor suggests instability and lack of conviction, characteristics not associated with John. In the cultural context, reeds were common along the Jordan River, and their swaying was a familiar sight. By contrasting John with a reed, Jesus emphasizes John's steadfastness and unwavering commitment to his prophetic mission. This imagery also serves to distinguish John from the political and religious leaders of the time, who were often swayed by public opinion and pressure.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching the crowds about John the Baptist.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A prophet who prepared the way for Jesus, known for his ascetic lifestyle and powerful preaching of repentance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowds.htm">The Crowds</a></b><br>The people who followed Jesus and were eager to hear His teachings, including His perspective on John the Baptist.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The place where John the Baptist conducted his ministry, symbolizing a place of spiritual preparation and encounter with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/john's_messengers.htm">John&#8217;s Messengers</a></b><br>Disciples of John the Baptist who were sent to Jesus to inquire if He was the expected Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_true_strength.htm">Understanding True Strength</a></b><br>Jesus challenges the crowd to consider what true strength and conviction look like.

When the messengers of John were departed, the Lord, fearful lest the people who had been standing by and listening to the question which the Baptist had put, and his answer, should entertain any disparaging thought of a great and sorely tried saint of God, spoke the following noble testimony concerning that true, faithful witness.
