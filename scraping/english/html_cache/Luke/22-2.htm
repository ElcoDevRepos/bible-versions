The chief priests included the high priest and those who had previously held the position, while the scribes were experts in the Law of Moses. These groups were part of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council. Their involvement in seeking Jesus' death highlights the religious establishment's opposition to Him, as they saw Him as a threat to their authority and traditions. This opposition is consistent with earlier confrontations, such as in <a href="/luke/20-19.htm">Luke 20:19</a>, where they sought to arrest Him.<p><b>were looking for a way to put Jesus to death</b><br>Their intent to kill Jesus was not a sudden decision but a culmination of growing hostility. This reflects the fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being despised and rejected. The religious leaders' desire to kill Jesus was driven by their perception of Him as a blasphemer and a disruptor of their power. This phrase also foreshadows the eventual crucifixion, a central event in Christian theology, where Jesus' death is seen as the atoning sacrifice for sin.<p><b>for they feared the people</b><br>The leaders' fear of the people indicates Jesus' popularity among the masses. Many saw Him as a prophet and were drawn to His teachings and miracles. This fear is a recurring theme, as seen in <a href="/luke/20-6.htm">Luke 20:6</a>, where the leaders are cautious in their actions due to the people's support for Jesus. Their fear underscores the tension between maintaining their authority and the risk of public unrest. This dynamic is crucial in understanding the political and social pressures that influenced the events leading to Jesus' crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests.htm">Chief Priests</a></b><br>These were the leading priests in the Jewish religious hierarchy, responsible for temple rituals and maintaining religious order.

They had determined to put the dangerous public Teacher to death. The bitter hatred on the part of the Jewish rulers had been gradually growing in intensity during the two years and a half of the public ministry of Jesus of Nazareth. The raising of Lazarus seems to have finally decided the governing body with as little delay as possible to compass the Reformer's death. The temporary withdrawal of the Lord after the great miracle deferred their purpose for a season; after, however, a retirement for a few weeks, Jesus appeared again, shortly before the Passover, and taught publicly in the temple, at a season when Jerusalem was crowded with pilgrims arriving for the great feast. Never had his teaching excited such interest, never had it stirred up such burning opposition as at this juncture. This decided the Jewish rulers to carry out their design on the life of the Galilaean Teacher with as little delay as possible. The only thing that perplexed them was <span class="accented">how</span> this could safely be accomplished, owing to the favor in which he was held by the people, especially by the crowds of pilgrims from the provinces then in Jerusalem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/22-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
