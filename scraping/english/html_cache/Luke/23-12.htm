It highlights the significant events that unfolded, leading to a change in the relationship between Herod and Pilate. The day is pivotal in the Passion narrative, marking the culmination of Jesus' earthly ministry and the fulfillment of His mission.<p><b>Herod and Pilate became friends</b><br>Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee, and Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea, were both key political figures in the region. Their newfound friendship is significant because it underscores the political maneuvering and alliances that often occurred in the Roman Empire. This alliance was likely formed out of mutual interest in maintaining order and control over the volatile region of Judea. The friendship also highlights the irony of Jesus' trial, where political leaders who were previously at odds found common ground in their dealings with Jesus. This moment can be seen as a fulfillment of <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, where rulers unite against the Lord's Anointed.<p><b>before this time they had been enemies</b><br>The enmity between Herod and Pilate likely stemmed from their overlapping jurisdictions and differing political agendas. Historical sources suggest that Pilate's governance was marked by tension with local leaders, including Herod. The fact that they became friends over the trial of Jesus illustrates the unifying power of opposition to Christ, a theme seen throughout the Gospels. This enmity turned friendship serves as a backdrop to the greater narrative of Jesus' trial, where earthly powers conspired against Him, yet ultimately fulfilled God's sovereign plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_antipas.htm">Herod Antipas</a></b><br>The tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, Herod was a ruler under Roman authority.

Scripture underscores how swiftly alliances can form when hearts are set against God&#8217;s Messiah (<a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>; <a href="/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Herod and Pilate</b><p>- Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea (<a href="/luke/3-1.htm">Luke 3:1</a>), represented imperial power and judicial authority (<a href="/john/19-10.htm">John 19:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>- Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee and Perea (<a href="/luke/3-1.htm">Luke 3:1</a>;
