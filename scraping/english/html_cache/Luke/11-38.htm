Their surprise indicates a strong expectation for ritual purity, which was a significant aspect of their religious practice. This reaction highlights the tension between Jesus and the Pharisees, as Jesus often challenged their interpretations and applications of the law. The Pharisees' surprise also underscores their focus on external rituals rather than the heart's condition, a theme Jesus frequently addressed.<p><b>to see that Jesus did not first wash</b><br>The washing referred to here is not about hygiene but a ceremonial washing, a tradition that Pharisees and many Jews practiced to maintain ritual purity. This practice was not explicitly commanded in the Mosaic Law but had become a customary expectation. Jesus' choice not to participate in this ritual washing serves as a critique of the Pharisees' emphasis on human traditions over divine commandments. It also foreshadows His teaching that true purity comes from within, not from external observances.<p><b>before the meal</b><br>Meals in Jewish culture were significant social and religious events, often involving blessings and rituals. The setting of a meal provides a backdrop for Jesus to teach about inner purity and the kingdom of God. This context is important because it shows Jesus' willingness to engage with those who opposed Him, using everyday situations to reveal deeper spiritual truths. The meal setting also connects to other instances in the Gospels where Jesus uses meals to teach, such as the Last Supper, highlighting the importance of fellowship and communion in His ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who often challenged the religious norms of His time.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pharisee.htm">The Pharisee</a></b><br>A member of a Jewish sect known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

The Pharisee&#8217;s shock spotlights a legalistic mindset that equates godliness with ritual compliance. Jesus, secure in His sinlessness, bypasses the ceremonial washing to expose the emptiness of tradition when divorced from inner purity. The verse challenges us to value sincere obedience to God over external show, reminding us that only Christ can provide the cleansing we truly need.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">He marvelled that he had not first washed.</span>--See Notes on <a href="/matthew/15-2.htm" title="Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.">Matthew 15:2</a>; <a href="/mark/7-3.htm" title="For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.">Mark 7:3</a>.

An elaborate system of utter meaningless ablutions, each carried out with particular gestures, had been instituted by the rabbinical schools. All these senseless forms and ceremonies had been developed out of the original simple directions to secure cleanliness in the Levitical Law. It is probable that our Lord, intending to bring about this discussion. pointedly abstained from even the ordinary ablution on this occasion. The language of ver. 37 seems to point to his entering the house and at once sitting down at the table. The Talmud has many references to these practices. R. Akhibha, it proudly relates, died of thirst rather than pass over these preliminary washings. In the same compilation we read that it was currently supposed that a demon sat on hands unwashed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/11-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
