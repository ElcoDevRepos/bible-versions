This site is located outside the city walls of Jerusalem, as was customary for executions, to avoid defiling the city. The name "The Skull" may refer to the shape of the hill or a place associated with death. This location fulfills the typology of Jesus as the sin offering, which was to be taken outside the camp (<a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11-13</a>).<p><b>they crucified Him there</b><br>Crucifixion was a Roman method of execution reserved for the most serious offenders, particularly slaves and insurrectionists. It was a brutal and public form of punishment designed to deter others.

This detail emphasizes Jesus' identification with sinners, taking upon Himself the sins of humanity.<p><b>one on His right and the other on His left</b><br>The positioning of the criminals, one on each side of Jesus, underscores the theme of judgment and salvation. It reflects the division of humanity in response to Christ&#8212;those who accept Him and those who reject Him. This scene is further elaborated in the subsequent verses, where one criminal mocks Jesus while the other seeks His mercy, illustrating the choice each person must make regarding Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_skull.htm">The Skull (Golgotha/Calvary)</a></b><br>This is the place where Jesus was crucified.

As a matter of translation, it would clearly have been better either to give the Greek form (<span class= "ital">Cranion</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> or its meaning (= "skull") in English. The Vulgate, however, had given <span class= "ital">Calvarium,</span> and that word had taken so strong a hold on men's minds, that it was apparently thought better, as in all the English versions, to retain it here. It is not without interest to note that the name which more than any other is associated with Protestant hymns and meditations on the atonement, should come to us from the Vulgate of the Latin Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33-49.</span> - <span class="accented">The Crucifixion.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary;</span> literally, <span class="accented">unto the place which is called the skull.</span> The familiar name "Calvary" has its origin in the Vulgate translation, <span class="accented">Calvarium</span>, a skull. The name "Place of a skull," <span class="accented">Golgotha</span> (properly <span class="accented">Gulgoltha, an</span> Aramaic word <span class="aramaic">&#x5e0;&#x5dc;&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;</span>, corresponding to the Hebrew <span class="accented">Gulgoleth</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5ea;</span>, which in <a href="/judges/9-53.htm">Judges 9:53</a> and <a href="/2_kings/9-35.htm">2 Kings 9:35</a> is translated "skull"), does not come from the fact that the skulls of condemned persons remained lying there, but it is so called from being a bare rounded mound like a skull in form. Dean Plumptre suggests that the spot in question was chosen by the Jewish rulers as a deliberate insult to one of their own order, Joseph of Arima-thaea, whose garden, with its rock-sepulchre, lay hard by. A later legend derives the name from its being the burying-place of Adam, and that as the blood flowed from the sacred wounds on his skull, his soul was translated to Paradise. A tradition traceable to the fourth century has identified this spot with the building known as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. St. Cyril of Jerusalem alludes to the spot repeatedly. In the time of Eusebius there was no doubt as to the site. The Bordeaux Pilgrim (A.D. 333) writes thus: "On the left side (of the original Church of the Holy Sepulchre) is the hillock (<span class="accented">monticulus</span>) Golgotha, where the Lord was crucified. Thence about a stone-throw distance is the crypt where his body was deposited." Recent research confirms this very ancient tradition, and scholars are generally now agreeing that the evidence in support of the <span class="accented">traditional site</span> is strong and seemingly conclusive<span class="cmt_word">. And the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left</span>. St. John adds, "and Jesus in the midst," as holding the position of preeminence in that scene of uttermost shame. Even in suffering Christ appears as a King. Westcott thus comments on the next detail recorded by St. John (<a href="/john/19-19.htm">John 19:19</a>), where the accurate rendering is, "And Pilate wrote a title <span class="accented">also."</span> This title (see further, ver. 38) was drawn up by Pilate, who caused it to be placed on the cross. The words, "wrote a title also," perhaps imply that the placing of the Lord in the midst was done by Pilate's direction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/23-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(hote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3753.htm">Strong's 3753: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, at which time.
