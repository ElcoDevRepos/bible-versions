St. Luke here notices an alteration in the Master's way of life.

From this time there was also a distinct change in the tone of his teaching.

The public work of Jesus may be well arranged under three heads: his work as <span class="accented">Master</span>, as <span class="accented">Evangelist</span>, and as <span class="accented">Prophet.</span> The first had especial relation to his own immediate followers, women as well as men. In the second, as the Preacher of the grace, mercy, and the love of God, he peculiarly addressed himself to the general population; - this was the special side of the Lord's work which St. Luke loved to dwell on; this is what he alludes to here. In the third, as Prophet, the Master spoke generally to an evil generation, and especially to the political and religious leaders of the Jewish society of his day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Soon</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#958;&#8134;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(kathex&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2517.htm">Strong's 2517: </a> </span><span class="str2">From kata and hexes; thereafter, i.e. Consecutively; as a noun a subsequent person or time.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">afterward,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
