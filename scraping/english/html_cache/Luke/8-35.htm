The context is the healing of the demon-possessed man in the region of the Gerasenes. The people&#8217;s curiosity and concern reflect a common human response to extraordinary events. In biblical times, news of miraculous occurrences would spread quickly, prompting people to investigate. This mirrors other instances in the Gospels where crowds gather to witness Jesus' works, such as in <a href="/john/6-2.htm">John 6:2</a>, where a large crowd followed Him because they saw the signs He performed on the sick.<p><b>They came to Jesus and found the man whom the demons had left,</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the transformation of the demon-possessed man. Previously, he was uncontrollable and lived among the tombs, as described earlier in <a href="/luke/8-27.htm">Luke 8:27</a>. The phrase "whom the demons had left" signifies the complete deliverance and authority of Jesus over demonic forces. This is consistent with other Gospel accounts, such as <a href="/mark/1-34.htm">Mark 1:34</a>, where Jesus casts out many demons, demonstrating His power over the spiritual realm.<p><b>sitting at Jesus&#8217; feet,</b><br>The posture of sitting at Jesus' feet is significant. It indicates a position of learning and discipleship, as seen in <a href="/luke/10-39.htm">Luke 10:39</a>, where Mary sits at Jesus' feet to listen to His teaching. This transformation from a state of chaos to one of peace and learning underscores the restorative power of Jesus. It also reflects a cultural practice where disciples would sit at the feet of their rabbi to receive instruction.<p><b>clothed and in his right mind;</b><br>The description of the man as "clothed and in his right mind" contrasts sharply with his previous state of nakedness and madness (<a href="/luke/8-27.htm">Luke 8:27</a>). Clothing in the Bible often symbolizes dignity and restoration, as seen in the parable of the prodigal son (<a href="/luke/15-22.htm">Luke 15:22</a>). The phrase "in his right mind" indicates a return to mental and spiritual wholeness, a testament to the comprehensive nature of Jesus' healing.<p><b>and they were afraid.</b><br>The reaction of fear from the people can be understood in several ways. It may reflect awe and reverence for the power of Jesus, similar to the disciples' fear after Jesus calms the storm in <a href="/mark/4-41.htm">Mark 4:41</a>. It could also indicate a fear of the unknown or a disruption of the status quo, as the presence of divine power often challenges human understanding and control. This fear is a common response to the divine encounters throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18-19</a>, where the Israelites fear the presence of God on Mount Sinai.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the account, the one who performed the miracle of casting out demons.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_demon-possessed_man.htm">The Demon-Possessed Man</a></b><br>Previously tormented by demons, now healed and transformed by Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The local inhabitants who witnessed the aftermath of the miracle and reacted with fear.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_region_of_the_gerasenes.htm">The Region of the Gerasenes</a></b><br>The geographical setting where the event took place, a Gentile region across the Sea of Galilee.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_demons.htm">The Demons</a></b><br>Spiritual entities that had possessed the man, now expelled by Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_through_christ.htm">Transformation through Christ</a></b><br>The man&#8217;s transformation from a state of torment to peace illustrates the power of Jesus to change lives completely.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_jesus.htm">Authority of Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus&#8217;

(<a href="/luke/8-35.htm">Luke 8:35</a>)<p>&#8226; News of Jesus&#8217; miraculous deliverance of the demoniac spread quickly, stirring curiosity and drawing a crowd, much like in <a href="/john/6-2.htm">John 6:2</a> where multitudes followed Christ because they &#8220;saw the signs He was performing.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Their going out underscores that Christ&#8217;s works are never done in a corner (<a href="/acts/26-26.htm">Acts 26:26</a>); His power invites public witness and inspection.<p>&#8226; The phrase also reminds us of <a href="/psalms/66-5.htm">Psalm 66:5</a>&#8212;&#8220;Come and see what God has done,&#8221;

Every genuine encounter with the supernatural must be measured by its relation to Christ (<a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; By approaching Jesus, the townspeople fulfill the pattern seen in <a href="/luke/15-1.htm">Luke 15:1</a> where &#8220;all the tax collectors and sinners were gathering around to listen to Him,&#8221;

to hear His word (<a href="/luke/10-39.htm">Luke 10:39</a>).<p>&#8226; Sitting signifies discipleship and peace (<a href="/isaiah/32-17.htm">Isaiah 32:17</a>&#8212;&#8220;The work of righteousness will be peace&#8221;).<p>&#8226;

(<a href="/luke/8-35.htm">Luke 8:35</a>)<p>&#8226; Confronted with Christ&#8217;s majestic authority, the crowd feels a reverent fear, similar to <a href="/luke/5-8.htm">Luke 5:8-10</a> where Peter, awed by a miraculous catch, trembles before Jesus.<p>&#8226; Fear here is not merely terror but an acute awareness of divine power, echoing <a href="/exodus/20-20.htm">Exodus 20:20</a>&#8212;&#8220;God has come to test you, so that the fear of Him may be before you to keep you from sinning.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Tragically, verses 37-39 show some let fear drive them to ask Jesus to leave, reminding us that encounters with grace demand a response&#8212;either worship or rejection (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/8-35.htm">Luke 8:35</a> paints a vivid portrait of complete deliverance. The once-tormented man is now calm, clothed, and sitting in submissive fellowship with Jesus, proving the Lord&#8217;s total victory over demonic power. The watching crowd, confronted with undeniable transformation, experiences holy fear. The passage calls every reader to behold Christ&#8217;s authority, recognize His power to save, and respond with faith rather than retreat.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">Sitting at the feet of Jesus.</span>--This feature is peculiar to St. Luke's narrative. The demoniac was now in the same attitude of rapt attention as that in which we find afterwards Mary the sister of Lazarus (<a href="/luke/10-39.htm" title="And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.">Luke 10:39</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 35, 36.</span> - Then <span class="cmt_word">they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and. found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind:</span> <span class="cmt_word">and they were afraid.

It was quiet then; the waters of the lake had closed over the tormented creatures, The demoniac, so long the terror of the neighbourhood, now sane, clothed, too, like one of them, was sitting peacefully full of deep, aweful gratitude at the Master's feet; the disciples were standing round; Jesus was no doubt teaching them the deep im - port of the scene they had lately witnessed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[So]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the people] went out</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#958;&#8134;&#955;&#952;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ex&#275;lthon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1831.htm">Strong's 1831: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go out, come out.
