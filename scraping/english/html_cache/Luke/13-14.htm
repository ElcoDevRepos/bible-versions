The Sabbath, a day of rest instituted by God in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>), was central to Jewish identity and religious practice. The Pharisees and other leaders had developed extensive regulations to ensure its observance, often focusing on prohibiting work. Jesus' healing on the Sabbath challenged these interpretations, emphasizing the spirit of the law over the letter. This incident highlights the tension between Jesus and the religious authorities, who often prioritized ritual over compassion.<p><b>&#8220;There are six days for work,&#8221; he told the crowd.</b><br>The leader's statement underscores the traditional Jewish understanding of the workweek, based on the creation narrative in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh. This perspective was deeply ingrained in Jewish culture, with the six days designated for labor and the seventh for rest and worship. The leader's emphasis on these six days reflects a rigid adherence to the law, which Jesus frequently challenged by prioritizing human need and mercy over strict legalism (see <a href="/matthew/12.htm">Matthew 12:1-14</a>).<p><b>&#8220;So come and be healed on those days and not on the Sabbath.&#8221;</b><br>This directive reveals the leader's misunderstanding of the purpose of the Sabbath. While he viewed it as a day to avoid any form of work, Jesus taught that the Sabbath was made for man's benefit (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27</a>). The leader's insistence on healing only on other days shows a lack of compassion and an inability to recognize the Sabbath as a time for restoration and blessing. Jesus' actions and teachings often highlighted the importance of mercy and love over rigid adherence to rules, as seen in His healing of the man with a withered hand on another Sabbath (<a href="/luke/6-6.htm">Luke 6:6-11</a>). This phrase also reflects the broader conflict between Jesus' ministry and the established religious order, which often resisted His message of grace and transformation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/synagogue_leader.htm">Synagogue Leader</a></b><br>A religious authority figure responsible for maintaining order and adherence to Jewish law within the synagogue.

The people, as usual, were stirred to enthusiasm by this glorious act of power and mercy. Afraid, before the congregation of the synagogue, to attack the Master personally, the "ruler," no doubt influenced by members of the Pharisee party who were present, at. tempted to represent the great Physician as a deliberate scorner of the sacred Law. The sabbath regulations at this time were excessively burdensome and childishly rigorous. The Law, as expounded in the schools of the rabbis, allowed physicians to act in cases of emergency, but not in chronic diseases such as this. How deep an interest must such a memory of the Master's as this sabbath day's healing have had for that beloved physician who has given his name to these memoirs we call the Third Gospel! Often in later years, in Syrian Antioch, in the great cities of Italy and Greece, would he, as he plied his blessed craft among the sick on the sabbath day, be attacked by rigid Jews as one who profaned the day. To such would he relate this incident, and draw <span class="accented">his</span> lessons of mercy and of love. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/13-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
