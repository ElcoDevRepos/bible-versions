The act of crucifixion was a Roman method of execution reserved for the most serious offenders, indicating the severity of the crimes committed by these individuals. The criminal's act of heaping abuse on Jesus highlights the fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being mocked. This moment also reflects the broader rejection of Jesus by many during His earthly ministry, as seen in <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>, where it states that He came to His own, but His own did not receive Him. The criminal's behavior contrasts with the other criminal's later repentance, illustrating the varied human responses to Jesus' identity and mission.<p><b>&#8220;Are You not the Christ?&#8221; he said.</b><br>The question posed by the criminal is both mocking and revealing. It reflects a common misunderstanding of the Messiah's role, as many Jews of the time expected a political liberator rather than a suffering servant. The term "Christ" is the Greek equivalent of "Messiah," meaning "Anointed One." This question echoes the taunts Jesus faced from religious leaders and soldiers, as seen in <a href="/luke/23-35.htm">Luke 23:35-37</a>, where they challenge Him to save Himself if He is truly the chosen one. The criminal's question underscores the irony of the situation: Jesus is indeed the Christ, but His mission involves suffering and sacrifice, not immediate earthly deliverance.<p><b>&#8220;Save Yourself and us!&#8221;</b><br>This demand reflects a misunderstanding of Jesus' mission and the nature of salvation. The criminal's plea for physical deliverance mirrors the expectations of many who desired a Messiah who would overthrow Roman rule and restore Israel's independence. However, Jesus' mission was to provide spiritual salvation through His sacrificial death, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who is pierced for our transgressions. The request to "save Yourself and us" also highlights the human tendency to seek immediate relief from suffering without understanding the deeper purpose behind it. This moment foreshadows the ultimate salvation Jesus offers through His resurrection, as later affirmed in <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>, where God's love is demonstrated through Christ's death for sinners.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_criminals.htm">The Criminals</a></b><br>Two criminals were crucified alongside Jesus.

His sneer questions Christ&#8217;s identity and demands a self-serving miracle. Unbelief sees the cross as weakness, not salvation.

The verse warns against hardened hearts and points to the true path of salvation: humble faith, not sarcastic demands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(39) <span class= "bld">And one of the malefactors.</span>--The incident that follows is singularly characteristic of St. Luke. If we ask how he came to know what the other Gospels pass over, we may, I think, find his probable informants once more in the devout women who followed Jesus to the place of Crucifixion, and who stood near enough to the cross to hear what was then spoken. The word for "hanged" is used by St. Luke (<a href="/acts/5-30.htm" title="The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew and hanged on a tree.">Acts 5:30</a>; <a href="/acts/10-39.htm" title="And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:">Acts 10:39</a>) and St. Paul (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>) as applied to crucifixion.<p><span class= "bld">Railed on him.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">was blaspheming,</span> but in the sense in which that word signifies the "reviling" of which man, and not God, may be the object.

The Greek word, however, used by SS. Matthew and Mark is <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (reproached).

Farrar suggests that at first, during the early hours of the Crucifixion, in the madness of anguish and despair, they both probably joined in the reproaches levelled by all classes alike at One who might seem to them to have thrown away a great opportunity. They, no doubt, knew something, possibly much, of Jesus' career, and how he had deliberately prevented more than once the multitude from proclaiming him King. Watching him as he hung bravely patient on his cross, only breaking the dread silence with a low-muttered prayer for his murderers to his Father, one of these misguided men changed his opinion of his fellow-Sufferer, changed his opinion, too, of his own past career. There, dying with a prayer for others on his lips, was the Example of true heroism, of real patriotism. <span class="accented">If thou be Christ.</span> The more ancient authorities read, <span class="accented">Art thou not the Christ</span>? <span class="accented">But the other.</span> In the Apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus the names of the two are given as Dysmas and Gysmas, and these names appear still in Calvaries and stations in Roman Catholic lands.
