Jesus and His disciples were often on the move, spreading the message of the Kingdom of God. This journeying reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah bringing light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>). It also highlights the urgency and dedication of Jesus' mission.<p><b>Jesus entered a village</b><br>The village is identified in other Gospel accounts as Bethany, located near Jerusalem. Bethany was a small village on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives. This location is significant as it was a place Jesus frequently visited, especially during the final week of His life. The village setting emphasizes the humble and accessible nature of Jesus' ministry, reaching out to ordinary people in their everyday environments.<p><b>where a woman named Martha</b><br>Martha is introduced here as a key figure in this narrative. She is the sister of Mary and Lazarus, who are also significant figures in the Gospels. Martha's role in this story highlights the active participation of women in Jesus' ministry, which was counter-cultural in a time when women were often marginalized. Her name, meaning "lady" or "mistress," suggests her role as the head of the household.<p><b>welcomed Him into her home</b><br>Martha's act of welcoming Jesus into her home is an expression of hospitality, a highly valued virtue in Jewish culture. Hospitality was not only a social expectation but also a religious duty, as seen in the stories of Abraham (Genesis 18) and Lot (Genesis 19). This act of welcoming Jesus signifies acceptance and recognition of His authority and message. It also sets the stage for the subsequent interaction between Jesus, Martha, and Mary, highlighting themes of service, devotion, and the prioritization of spiritual over worldly concerns.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is traveling and teaching.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/martha.htm">Martha</a></b><br>A woman who lives in the village and welcomes Jesus into her home.

Jesus arrives on His intentional journey; a specific village and a named woman matter to Him; and an open home becomes holy ground. The verse invites believers to keep traveling with Him, to let Him enter every daily setting, to bring our individual identities before Him, and to welcome Him without reservation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">He entered into a certain village.</span>--The identity of the two names that follow, and, we may add, of the characters connected with the names, leaves hardly room for doubt that the village thus spoken of was Bethany. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/21-1.htm" title="And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, to the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,">Matthew 21:1</a>.) St. Luke's reason for not giving the name is probably connected with the singular reticence of the first three Gospels as to the family of Lazarus. St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/26-7.htm" title="There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.">Matthew 26:7</a>) and St. Mark (<a href="/mark/14-3.htm" title="And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she broke the box, and poured it on his head.">Mark 14:3</a>) narrate the anointing, which we learn from <a href="/john/12-3.htm" title="Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.">John 12:3</a> to have been the act of Mary, but suppress her name. St. Luke gives, in this section, a characteristic anecdote of the two sisters, but suppresses the name of the village in which they lived. None of the first three Gospels name Lazarus, though there seems some reason to believe that the first two narrate a fact in which he took a prominent part (see Note on <a href="/matthew/19-16.htm" title="And, behold, one came and said to him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?">Matthew 19:16</a>), and that the third gives the name with a special reference to him. (See Note on <a href="/luke/16-20.htm" title="And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,">Luke 16:20</a>.) A probable explanation is that, both on spiritual and perhaps social grounds, reticence as to the family of Bethany was, for a time, generally maintained among the disciples of Jerusalem, and that St. Luke, coming at a later period, and finding his way, as a physician, into the company of devout women, named one fact that seemed of special interest. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction,</span> and Note on chap <a href="/luke/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,">Luke 8:1</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38-42.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">sisters of Bethany.</span> The following points are noticeable. A close intimacy evidently existed between the brother and his two sisters and Jesus. They evidently were prominent friends of the Master, and during the years of the public ministry were on many occasions associated with Jesus of Nazareth, and yet a singular reticence evidently existed on the part of the writers of the first three Gospels in respect of the brother and sisters. His name is never mentioned by them. Here, for instance, Bethany is simply alluded to as "a certain village." There was some reason, no doubt, why the three synoptical evangelists exercised this reticence. We have before explained that these Gospels more or less represent the "texts," so to speak, upon which the first preachers of the religion of Jesus based their sermons and instructions. The long recital of <a href="/john/11.htm">John 11</a>. gives us the clue. For the disciples of Jesus publicly to call attention in their sermons and addresses to <span class="accented">Lazarus</span>, on whom the Master's greatest miracle had been worked, would have no doubt called down a ceaseless, restless hostility on the Bethany household; for it must be remembered that for years after the Resurrection the deadly enemies of Jesus and his followers were supreme in Jerusalem and the neighbourhood. There were reasons, no doubt, now unknown to us, which rendered it important to the welfare of the early Church that the Bethany family should remain undisturbed and in comparative privacy. The peculiar and unique position of Lazarus. <span class="accented">During those four days what had he seen and heard</span>? Much curiosity, no doubt, existed to question the risen one:what fierce hostility, what morbid useless speculation, might not have been easily aroused? St. John's Gospel was not written for long years after the event. It probably represents no public preaching, rather a private and esoteric teaching. The home of St. John, too, for years prior to putting forth his Gospel, was far distant from Jerusalem. Probably Jerusalem had ceased to exist as a city and the Jews as a nation well-nigh a quarter of a century before St. John's writing was given to the Church. There were no reasons <span class="accented">then</span> for any silence. Jerusalem and Bethany were a heap of ruins. Lazarus and his sisters and well-nigh all their friends had probably then been long in the presence of the loved or hated Master. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village.</span> The scene here related took place, no doubt, at Bethany, and, most probably, during that short visit to Jerusalem, at the Feast of Dedication, in the month of that December which preceded the Passover "of the Crucifixion." This visit to Jerusalem, as has been suggested above, was made in the course of that solemn progress the account of which fills up the long section of St. Luke's Gospel, beginning at <a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>. The characters of the sisters here mentioned exactly correspond, as do their names, with the well-known Bethany family of that Lazarus for whom the great miracle, related at length by St. John, was worked. There are several mentions of this family in the synoptical Gospels, besides the long and important notice in St. John. <span class="cmt_word">A certain woman named Martha</span>. The name is rather Aramaic than pure Hebrew. It is equivalent to the Greek <span class="accented">Kyria</span>, and signifies "lady." It has been suggested that the Second Epistle of St. John was addressed to this Martha. It was written, we know, to the elect <span class="accented">kyria</span>, or "lady" (<a href="/2_john/1.htm">2 John 1</a>). Various identifications, more or less probable, have been attempted in the persons of the Bethany family. Martha has been supposed to be identical with the wife of Simon the leper (<a href="/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6</a>; <a href="/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a>). One hypothesis identifies Lazarus with the "young ruler" whom Jesus loved (see Dean Plumptre, in Bishop Ellicott's Commentary); another, with the saintly Rabbi Eliezer (or Lazarus) of the Talmud.
