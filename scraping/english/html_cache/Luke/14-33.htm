In <a href="/luke/14.htm">Luke 14</a>, Jesus uses parables to illustrate the cost of discipleship, such as the parable of the tower builder and the king going to war. The phrase "in the same way" indicates that just as these examples require careful consideration and commitment, so does following Christ.<p><b>any one of you</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the personal nature of the call to discipleship. It is an invitation extended to every individual, not limited by social status, ethnicity, or background. The universality of this call reflects the inclusive nature of the Gospel, as seen in passages like <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where Paul states that in Christ, there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free.<p><b>who does not give up everything he has</b><br>This phrase highlights the radical nature of discipleship. The call to "give up everything" is a call to prioritize Jesus above all material possessions and personal ambitions. This echoes the teaching of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where He instructs His followers to store up treasures in heaven rather than on earth. Historically, this would have been a challenging command in a culture where wealth and possessions were often seen as signs of God's favor.<p><b>cannot be My disciple</b><br>This phrase sets a clear condition for true discipleship. It underscores the idea that following Jesus requires total commitment and surrender. The term "disciple" implies a learner or follower who adheres to the teachings and lifestyle of the teacher. In the context of first-century Judaism, discipleship involved a close, personal relationship with the rabbi, often requiring significant personal sacrifice. This mirrors the call of Jesus to His first disciples, such as Peter and Andrew, who left their nets to follow Him (<a href="/matthew/4-18.htm">Matthew 4:18-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching about the cost of discipleship.

Just as a builder counts the cost and a king assesses his army, so must followers calculate what loyalty to Christ truly demands (cf. <a href="/matthew/13-44.htm">Matthew 13:44-46</a>).<p>&#8226; This bridge phrase shows that the principle is not optional or symbolic; it applies exactly &#8220;in the same way&#8221; for every believer (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>any one of you</b><p>&#8226; The call is universal&#8212;no special class is exempt.

Fishing-nets and hired servants, or great possessions, or ease and safety, or besetting sins, or fancied righteousness--all had to be renounced. The word for "forsake" is that which was afterwards used in the baptismal formula, "I <span class= "ital">renounce</span> the devil and all his works," and the same as that which is translated "bidding farewell" in <a href="/luke/9-61.htm" title="And another also said, Lord, I will follow you; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.">Luke 9:61</a>, <a href="/acts/18-18.htm" title="And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.">Acts 18:18</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple</span>. "We must live in this world as though the soul was already in heaven and the body mouldering in the grave" (St. Francis de Sales). There was much unreasoning, possibly not a little sentimental enthusiasm, among the people who crowded round Jesus in these last months of his work. The stern, uncompromising picture of what ought to be the life of his real followers was painted especially with a view of getting rid of these useless, purposeless enthusiasts. The way of the cross, which he was about to tread, was no pathway for such light-hearted triflers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/14-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In the same way,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#8021;&#964;&#969;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Hout&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3779.htm">Strong's 3779: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thus, so, in this manner.
