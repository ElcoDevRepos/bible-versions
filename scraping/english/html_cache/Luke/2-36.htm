This highlights the presence and importance of women in spiritual roles within the early Jewish and Christian communities. Her prophetic role connects her to other biblical prophetesses like Miriam, Deborah, and Huldah, emphasizing that God speaks through both men and women.<p><b>the daughter of Phanuel</b><br>The mention of Anna's father, Phanuel, is significant as it provides a historical and familial context, grounding her identity within a specific lineage. The name Phanuel means "face of God," which may symbolize the divine favor or presence associated with Anna's family. This detail underscores the importance of family heritage in Jewish culture and the transmission of faith and spiritual gifts through generations.<p><b>of the tribe of Asher</b><br>Asher was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, traditionally associated with prosperity and blessing. The tribe's territory was located in the northern part of Israel, known for its fertile land. Anna's tribal affiliation with Asher connects her to the broader narrative of Israel's history and God's promises to His people. It also fulfills the prophecy of the gathering of all tribes in the Messianic age, as seen in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/37-19.htm">Ezekiel 37:19</a>.<p><b>who was well along in years</b><br>Anna's advanced age signifies wisdom and experience, qualities highly respected in Jewish culture. Her long life allowed her to witness the fulfillment of God's promises through the birth of Jesus. Her age also emphasizes her dedication and perseverance in faith, as she spent many years in the temple, devoted to prayer and fasting, awaiting the Messiah.<p><b>She had been married for seven years</b><br>The mention of Anna's marriage duration highlights the brevity of her married life, followed by a long period of widowhood. In biblical numerology, the number seven often represents completeness or perfection, suggesting that her marriage, though short, was significant and complete in its purpose. Her widowhood and subsequent devotion to God reflect a life of faithfulness and service, paralleling the church's call to spiritual devotion and waiting for Christ's return.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/anna.htm">Anna</a></b><br>A prophetess mentioned in the Gospel of Luke.

We find a woman recognised as a prophetess at a time when no man is recognised as a prophet. She bears the name of the mother of the founder of the School of the Prophets, identical with that which the legends of Apocryphal Gospels assign to the mother of the Virgin. She is named, as if it were a well-known fact, as having been the wife of Phanuel, and she is not of the tribe of Judah, but of Aser. That tribe, then, though belonging to the Ten that had been carried into exile by Shalmaneser (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm" title="In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.">2Kings 17:6</a>), had not been altogether lost. Some, at least, of its members survived and cherished the genealogies of their descent, as one family of the neighbouring tribe of Naphthali are said to have done at Nineveh (<a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/1-2.htm" title="Who in the time of Enemessar king of the Assyrians was led captive out of Thisbe, which is at the right hand of that city, which is called properly Nephthali in Galilee above Aser.">Tobit 1:2</a>). In that family also we find the name of Anna (<a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/1-9.htm" title="Furthermore, when I was come to the age of a man, I married Anna of mine own kindred, and of her I begat Tobias.">Tobit 1:9</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Seven years from her virginity.</span>--The words are emphasised (1) as expressing chastity prior to marriage, and (2) as excluding the thought of a second marriage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 36-38.</span> - <span class="accented">Greeting of Anna the prophetess</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was one Anna, a prophetess</span>. The name of this holy woman is the same as that of the mother of Samuel. It is not necessary to assume that this Anna had the gift of foretelling future events. She was, at all events, a preacher. These saintly, gifted women, though never numerous, were not unknown in the story of the chosen people. We read of the doings - in some cases the very words are preserved - of Miriam, Hannah, Deborah, Huldah, and others. <span class="cmt_word">Of the tribe of Aser</span>. It is true that at this period the ten tribes had been long lost, the "Jews" being made up of the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin; but yet certain families preserved their genealogies, tracing their descent to one or other of the lost divisions of the people.
