Flogging, or scourging, was a brutal Roman punishment often preceding crucifixion, highlighting the severity of Jesus' suffering. This act fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being "wounded for our transgressions." The mention of "they" indicates the involvement of both Jewish leaders and Roman authorities, as seen in the trials before the Sanhedrin and Pontius Pilate (<a href="/matthew/27.htm">Matthew 27:1-2</a>, <a href="/john/19.htm">John 19:1</a>). The crucifixion itself is a fulfillment of <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, which describes the suffering of the righteous one. Historically, crucifixion was a common Roman execution method for criminals, emphasizing the humiliation and rejection Jesus faced.<p><b>and on the third day He will rise again.</b><br>This phrase proclaims the resurrection of Jesus, a cornerstone of Christian belief. The "third day" is significant, as it aligns with Jewish understanding of time and prophecy, such as Jonah's three days in the belly of the fish (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>), which Jesus Himself references as a sign (<a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>). The resurrection is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, including <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, which speaks of God not allowing His Holy One to see decay. The resurrection is also a type of new creation, paralleling the creation narrative where God completed His work and rested on the seventh day, with Jesus rising to inaugurate a new covenant. This event is pivotal, as it confirms Jesus' divinity, His victory over sin and death, and the promise of eternal life for believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is foretelling His own suffering, death, and resurrection.

What Isaiah saw in prophecy, Jesus now places on the disciples&#8217; calendar.<p>&#8226; The flogging is more than cruelty; it is part of the atoning work. Peter later writes, &#8220;By His stripes you are healed&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>), tying the lashes to our redemption.<p>&#8226; Notice Christ&#8217;s resolve.

Jesus Himself says, &#8220;I lay down My life&#8230; No one takes it from Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul rejoices in this purposeful sacrifice: &#8220;God proves His love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us&#8221; (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, the death of Christ is the hinge of history&#8212;the moment justice and mercy meet.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and on the third day</b><p>&#8226; Timing matters. &#8220;On the third day&#8221; echoes <a href="/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a>: &#8220;After two days He will revive us; on the third day He will raise us up&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Jesus ties His resurrection to the sign of Jonah (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>), anchoring the promise in Scripture and prophetic pattern.<p>&#8226; The third day also underlines completion.
