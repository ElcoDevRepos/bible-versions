This body consisted of chief priests, elders, and scribes, totaling 71 members. Their unanimous decision to rise indicates a formal and collective action, emphasizing the gravity of the situation. This moment follows a night of trials where Jesus was accused of blasphemy, a charge punishable by death under Jewish law. However, the Sanhedrin lacked the authority to execute capital punishment under Roman rule, necessitating their next action.<p><b>and led Jesus away</b><br>The act of leading Jesus away signifies the transition from a religious trial to a civil one. The Sanhedrin's decision to bring Jesus to the Roman authorities highlights their intent to secure a death sentence, as only the Roman governor could authorize such a penalty. This movement from Jewish to Roman jurisdiction underscores the political and religious tensions of the time. It also fulfills Jesus' own predictions about His suffering and death at the hands of both Jewish and Gentile authorities (<a href="/mark/10-33.htm">Mark 10:33-34</a>).<p><b>to Pilate</b><br>Pontius Pilate was the Roman governor of Judea from AD 26 to 36. His role was to maintain order and enforce Roman law. Pilate's involvement is crucial, as it fulfills the prophecy of Jesus being "lifted up" (<a href="/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a>), indicating crucifixion, a Roman method of execution. Pilate's historical reputation is one of a pragmatic and sometimes ruthless ruler, as evidenced by extra-biblical sources like Philo and Josephus. His interactions with Jesus are marked by political maneuvering, as he navigates the demands of the Jewish leaders and the potential unrest among the populace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_whole_council.htm">The Whole Council (Sanhedrin)</a></b><br>This refers to the Jewish ruling council, composed of chief priests, scribes, and elders.

The Sanhedrin had now formally condemned Jesus to death. They were, however, precluded by the Roman regulations then in force from carrying out their judgment. A capital sentence in Judaea could only be inflicted as the result of a decision by the Roman court. The Sanhedrin supposed, and as we shall see rightly, that the judgment they had pronounced would speedily be confirmed by the Roman judge. The Sanhedrin condemnation to death was, however, from the Jewish standpoint, illegal. In capital cases judgment could not be legally pronounced on the day of trial. But in the case of Jesus, the Accused was condemned without the legal interval which should have been left between the trial and the sentence. The Prisoner was then at once hurried before the Roman tribunal, in order that the Jewish sentence might be confirmed and carried out with all the additional horrors which accompanied Gentile public executions in such cases of treason. Derenbourg ('Histoire de la Palestine,' p. 201) attributes the undue illegal precipitancy of the whole proceeding to the overwhelming influence exercised in the supreme council by Annas and Caiaphas with their friends who were Sadducees, a party notorious for their cruelty as well as for their unbelief. Had the Pharisees borne sway in the Sanhedrin at that juncture, such an illegality could never have taken place. This apology possesses certain weight, as it is based upon known historical facts; yet when the general bearing of the Pharisee party towards our Lord during the greater part of his public ministry is remembered, it can scarcely be supposed that the action of the Sadducee majority in the Sanhedrin was repugnant to, or even opposed by, the Pharisee element in the great assembly. Pilate, Pontius Pilate, a Roman knight, owed his high position as Procurator of Judea to his friendship with Sejanus, the powerful minister of the Emperor Tiberius, He probably belonged by birth or adoption to the gens of the Pontii. When Judaea became formally subject to the empire on the deposition of Archelaus, Pontius Pilate, of whose previous career nothing is known, through the interest of Sejanus, was appointed to govern it, with the title of procurator, or collector of the revenue, invested with judicial power. This was in A.D. , and he held the post for ten years, when he was deposed from his office in disgrace. His government of Judaea seems to have been singularly unhappy. His great patron Sejanus hated the Jews, and Pilate seems faithfully to have imitated his powerful friend. Constantly the Roman governor appears to have wounded the susceptibilities of the strange, unhappy people he was placed over. Fierce disputes, mutual insults arising out of apparently purposeless acts of arbitrary power on his side, characterized the period of his rule. His behaviour in the one great event of his life, when Jesus was brought before his tribunal, will illustrate his character. He was superstitious and yet cruel; afraid of the people he affected to despise; faithless to the spirit of the authority with which he was lawfully invested. In the great crisis of his history, flora the miserably selfish motive of securing his own petty interests, we watch him deliberately giving up a Man, whom he knew to be innocent, and felt to be noble and pure, to torture, shame, and death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/23-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
