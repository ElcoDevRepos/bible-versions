The annual pilgrimage to Jerusalem for the Passover was a significant religious duty for devout Jews, as prescribed in the Torah (<a href="/exodus/23-14.htm">Exodus 23:14-17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>). This regularity underscores the piety and dedication of Jesus' earthly parents, Joseph and Mary, to their faith.<p><b>His parents</b><br>Joseph and Mary are referred to as Jesus' parents, highlighting their role in His upbringing and adherence to Jewish customs. This also emphasizes the humanity of Jesus, who was raised in a typical Jewish family setting, fulfilling the prophecy of the Messiah coming from the line of David (<a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>).<p><b>went to Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem was the spiritual and cultural center of Jewish life, home to the Temple, where sacrifices and major religious festivals were held. The city's significance is rooted in its history as the site of King David's capital and Solomon's Temple.

The Passover lamb is a type of Christ, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).

What looks like an ordinary line in a narrative is actually a window into covenant loyalty and a signpost pointing straight to the Lamb who will one day lay down His life at another Passover in the very same city.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">His parents went to</span> <span class= "bld">Jerusalem.</span>--The law of Moses required the attendance of all males at the three feasts of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles (<a href="/exodus/23-17.htm" title="Three items in the year all your males shall appear before the LORD God.">Exodus 23:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm" title="Three times in a year shall all your males appear before the LORD your God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty:">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>). The dispersion of the Jews had, of course, relaxed the obligation for those who lived at a distance; but it was still more or less generally recognised by those who dwelt in Palestine, and the school of Hillel held the Passover to be binding upon women as well as men. The yearly journey to Jerusalem may therefore be taken as an indication of devout obedience, not without its bearing on the thoughts of the child who, during those visits, remained behind in the home at Nazareth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 41-52.</span> - <span class="accented">The Child Jesus at Jerusalem</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover</span>. The Law required the attendance of all men at the three great Feasts of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>). The dispersion and subsequent residence of so many Jews in distant lands had much broken up the regular observance of these directions. Still, many devout Jews were constantly present at these feasts. This Mosaic ordinance was only binding upon men, but R. Hillel recommended women always to be present at the Passover. The constant yearly presence of Joseph the carpenter and Mary at this feast is another indication of the rigid obedience of the holy family of Nazareth to the ritual of the Law of Moses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/2-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Every</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(kat&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2596.htm">Strong's 2596: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; down, in varied relations (genitive, dative or accusative) with which it is joined).</span><br /><br /><span class="word">year</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(etos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2094.htm">Strong's 2094: </a> </span><span class="str2">A year.
