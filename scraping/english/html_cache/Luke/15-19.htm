In the cultural context of the time, a son who squandered his inheritance would bring shame upon his family, and the prodigal son recognizes this. The concept of worthiness is significant in biblical teachings, as it often relates to one's standing before God. This mirrors the human condition of sin and the need for repentance, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>, which states that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. The prodigal son's admission is a step towards reconciliation, echoing the biblical theme of repentance leading to restoration.<p><b>Make me like one of your hired servants.&#8221;</b><br>In this request, the son expresses a desire to return to his father not as a son, but as a servant. This reflects a complete surrender and a willingness to accept a lower status, which is significant in the cultural context where family honor and status were paramount. The hired servant in ancient times was often a day laborer, without the security or privileges of a household servant. This request highlights the son's understanding of his lost status and his hope for mercy. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ's teaching on humility and servanthood, as Jesus Himself came to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). The son's plea also foreshadows the grace and forgiveness that the father will extend, illustrating the boundless mercy of God towards repentant sinners, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which emphasize salvation by grace through faith, not by works.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prodigal_son.htm">The Prodigal Son</a></b><br>A young man who squanders his inheritance in reckless living and finds himself in dire need, leading to his return to his father in repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Represents God, who is loving, forgiving, and eager to restore the repentant sinner to a place of honor and relationship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hired_servants.htm">The Hired Servants</a></b><br>Symbolize those who work for the father, representing a lower status than a son, yet still under the father's care.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_far_country.htm">The Far Country</a></b><br>Represents a place of sin and separation from the father, where the prodigal son wastes his inheritance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_return.htm">The Return</a></b><br>The pivotal event where the prodigal son decides to return to his father, acknowledging his unworthiness and seeking mercy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_humility.htm">Repentance and Humility</a></b><br>The prodigal son's statement, "I am no longer worthy," reflects true repentance and humility.

After squandering his inheritance (<a href="/luke/15-13.htm">Luke 15:13</a>), he realizes the gravity of his rebellion and confesses, &#8220;Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you&#8221; (<a href="/luke/15-18.htm">Luke 15:18</a>).<p>&#8226; He does not shrug off his failure or blame anyone else. Instead, like David who cried, &#8220;Against You, You only, have I sinned&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>), he owns his guilt.<p>&#8226; His sense of unworthiness echoes the tax collector who prayed, &#8220;God, be merciful to me, a sinner&#8221; (<a href="/luke/18-13.htm">Luke 18:13</a>). Both acknowledge that sin separates us from a holy God (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Recognizing he has forfeited every privilege, the son stops demanding rights. His attitude mirrors Paul&#8217;s confession: &#8220;Christ Jesus came to save sinners&#8212;of whom I am the worst&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment of humility is the doorway to grace. &#8220;God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Make me like one of your hired servants.</b><p>&#8226; The son&#8217;s plan is simple: if he cannot be a son, maybe he can be a day laborer. Hired servants in that culture worked for wages and lived outside the estate&#8212;far below family status.<p>&#8226; He is willing to exchange sonship for servanthood, convinced that even the lowest place in his father&#8217;s house is better than the far country&#8217;s pigpen (<a href="/luke/15-16.htm">Luke 15:16&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; He does not negotiate terms; he submits, much like the centurion who said, &#8220;I am not worthy for You to come under my roof&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/8-8.htm">Matthew 8:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet this request sets the stage for the father&#8217;s lavish grace. The father will restore him fully&#8212;robe, ring, sandals, and feast (<a href="/luke/15-22.htm">Luke 15:22&#8211;24</a>)&#8212;illustrating the truth that &#8220;you are no longer a slave, but a son&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/4-7.htm">Galatians 4:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast between what the son expects and what the father grants underscores salvation by grace, not by works (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The prodigal&#8217;s two-part confession shows genuine repentance: he admits his sin and abandons all claims to privilege.
