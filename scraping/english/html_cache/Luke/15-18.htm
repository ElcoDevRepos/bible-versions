The prodigal son, having squandered his inheritance, recognizes his dire situation and resolves to return to his father. This reflects the biblical theme of repentance, a turning away from sin and a return to God. The act of "getting up" signifies a change in both physical and spiritual posture, moving from a state of despair to one of hope. The father in this parable represents God, who is always ready to receive those who return to Him. This mirrors the call to repentance found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/55-7.htm">Isaiah 55:7</a>, where the wicked are urged to forsake their ways and return to the Lord.<p><b>and say to him, &#8220;Father, I have sinned</b><br>The acknowledgment of sin is crucial in the process of repentance. By addressing his father directly, the son admits his wrongdoing, which is a necessary step in seeking forgiveness. This confession is reminiscent of King David's admission of sin in <a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>, where he acknowledges his transgressions before God. The use of "Father" highlights the personal relationship that has been damaged by sin, emphasizing the need for reconciliation. In the cultural context of the time, such a confession would have been humbling, as honor and shame were significant societal values.<p><b>against heaven and against you.</b><br>The phrase "against heaven" indicates that the son's sin is not only against his earthly father but also against God. This dual acknowledgment underscores the biblical understanding that sin has both vertical (against God) and horizontal (against others) dimensions. The order of the confession, placing "heaven" first, aligns with the Jewish understanding of God as the ultimate authority. This reflects the teaching of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-39</a>, where love for God and love for neighbor are interconnected. The cultural context of the time would have recognized the gravity of sinning against one's family, as family honor was paramount. The son's recognition of his sin against both divine and human relationships is a model for true repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prodigal_son.htm">The Prodigal Son</a></b><br>A young man who demands his inheritance early, squanders it in reckless living, and eventually decides to return to his father in repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Represents God in the parable, showing unconditional love and forgiveness towards his repentant son.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_far_country.htm">The Far Country</a></b><br>Symbolizes a life of sin and separation from God, where the prodigal son wastes his inheritance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_return.htm">The Return</a></b><br>The pivotal moment of repentance and decision to return to the father, symbolizing a sinner's return to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>Represents the divine authority and moral order against which the son acknowledges his sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_is_a_decision.htm">Repentance is a Decision</a></b><br>The prodigal son's decision to return to his father illustrates that repentance begins with a conscious choice to turn away from sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledgment_of_sin.htm">Acknowledgment of Sin</a></b><br>True repentance involves recognizing our sins against God and others, as the son acknowledges his sin against heaven and his father.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_readiness_to_forgive.htm">God's Readiness to Forgive</a></b><br>The father's willingness to forgive and restore his son demonstrates God's grace and readiness to forgive those who repent.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_journey_back.htm">The Journey Back</a></b><br>Returning to God may require humility and courage, as seen in the son's willingness to face his father after his failures.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_reconciliation.htm">Restoration and Reconciliation</a></b><br>The parable shows that repentance leads to restoration and reconciliation with God, offering hope for a renewed relationship.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_15_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 15:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_15_18_Repentance_s_role_in_Christianity.htm">How does Luke 15:18 demonstrate the importance of repentance in Christian life?

He remembers that he has a father, and trusts in that father's love; but he dares not claim the old position which he had so recklessly cast away. He is content to be as one of the "hired servants."

It was no mere sentimental regret, no momentary flash of sorrow for a bad past. There was before him a long and weary journey to be undertaken, and he - brought up in luxury - had to face it without means. There was the shame of confession before dependents and relatives and friends, and, as the crown of all, there was the position of a servant to be filled in the home where once he had been a son, for that was all he hoped to gain even from his father's pitying love. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/15-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I will get up</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8048;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(anastas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_450.htm">Strong's 450: </a> </span><span class="str2">To raise up, set up; I rise from among (the) dead; I arise, appear.
