In the context of first-century Judea, rulers were often part of the local aristocracy or held positions of authority within the synagogue. This encounter follows Jesus' teaching on entering the Kingdom of God, emphasizing the challenge of wealth in spiritual commitment. The ruler's response is pivotal, as it reflects the tension between earthly possessions and spiritual devotion.<p><b>he became very sad</b><br>The ruler's sadness indicates a deep internal conflict. His reaction is not just disappointment but a profound sorrow, suggesting that he understood the gravity of Jesus' challenge. This emotional response highlights the ruler's attachment to his wealth and the difficulty of prioritizing spiritual over material wealth. The sadness also underscores the personal cost of discipleship, a recurring theme in Jesus' teachings.<p><b>because he was extremely wealthy</b><br>Wealth in the ancient world was often seen as a sign of God's favor, yet Jesus challenges this notion by suggesting that wealth can be a hindrance to spiritual growth. The ruler's extreme wealth implies not just financial resources but also the social and cultural power that comes with it. This wealth creates a barrier to fully following Jesus, as it requires a radical reorientation of values. The difficulty of the wealthy entering the Kingdom of God is further illustrated in the subsequent verses, where Jesus uses the metaphor of a camel passing through the eye of a needle. This phrase also connects to other scriptural teachings on the dangers of wealth, such as in <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, which warns that the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rich_ruler.htm">The Rich Ruler</a></b><br>A man of significant wealth and social standing who approaches Jesus with a question about eternal life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel, who provides teachings and guidance on spiritual matters.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event.htm">The Event</a></b><br>This interaction occurs as part of a larger account where Jesus is teaching about the Kingdom of God and the challenges of wealth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_challenge_of_wealth.htm">The Challenge of Wealth</a></b><br>Wealth can be a significant barrier to spiritual growth and commitment to God.

Obedience, not mere interest, marks a faithful response to Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">He was very sorrowful.</span>--St. Luke's word stands half-way between St. Matthew's "sorrowing" and St. Mark's vivid "lowering" or "frowning." (See Note on <a href="/mark/10-22.htm" title="And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.">Mark 10:22</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">He was very rich.</span>--St. Luke's equivalent for <span class= "ital">he had great possessions.</span> There is, perhaps, something suggestive, especially on the view which has been taken as to the identity of the young ruler, and the purport of the parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus, in the use of the very same adjective as had been employed in that parable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he heard this, he was</span> <span class="cmt_word">very sorrowful: for he was very rich.</span> St. Mark adds (a memory of Peter's) that when he heard this the ruler went away frowning, with a lowering look. <span class="accented">This</span> was too much. He could not, even at the bidding of that loved Teacher, give up the pleasant life he loved so well, the things he prized so highly; so silently and sadly he turned away. The 'Gospel of the Hebrews,' a very ancient document, dating from the first days of the faith, a few fragments only of which have come down to us in quotations in the Fathers, thus describes the scene: "Then the rich man began to scratch his head, for that was not to his mind. And the Lord said to him, How then canst thou say, I have kept the Law; for it is written in the Law, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; and, lo! many of thy brethren, children of Abraham, live in the gutter, and die of hunger, while thy table is loaded with good things, and nothing is sent out to them?" (quoted by Origen, in <a href="/matthew/19.htm">Matthew 19</a>.). Dante calls this "The Great Refusal," and represents the shade of the young ruler among the throng of the useless, of those who faced both ways (' Inferno,' 10:27). It is worthy of notice that there was no angry retort from the wealthy ruler, no scornful, cynical smile of derision, as we read of among the covetous, wealthy Pharisees (<a href="/luke/16-14.htm">Luke 16:14</a>). Still, in the heart of this seeker after the true wisdom there was a sore conflict. Grieving, sorrow-stricken, with gloomy looks, he turned away in silence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/18-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when [the ruler] heard</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(akousas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
