Healing the sick was a sign of the in-breaking of God's kingdom, demonstrating God's power and mercy. In the cultural context of the time, illness was often seen as a result of sin or spiritual oppression, so healing was not only physical but also spiritual restoration. This command reflects Jesus' own ministry, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>, where He healed every disease and sickness among the people. The act of healing served as a tangible demonstration of God's love and a foretaste of the complete restoration promised in the kingdom of God.<p><b>and tell them,</b><br>The directive to "tell them" underscores the importance of proclamation in the mission of Jesus' followers. It was not enough to perform acts of mercy; the message of the kingdom needed to be communicated clearly. This aligns with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus instructs His disciples to make disciples of all nations, teaching them to obey everything He has commanded. The spoken word was crucial in a predominantly oral culture, where stories and teachings were passed down verbally.<p><b>&#8216;The kingdom of God is near you.&#8217;</b><br>This proclamation is central to Jesus' message throughout the Gospels. The kingdom of God refers to God's sovereign rule and reign, which was inaugurated through Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. The phrase "is near you" indicates both a present reality and a future hope. It suggests that through Jesus, God's kingdom has broken into human history, offering salvation and transformation. This echoes the message of John the Baptist in <a href="/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a> and Jesus' own preaching in <a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>. The nearness of the kingdom calls for a response of repentance and faith, as individuals are invited to enter into a new relationship with God through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, who sends out the seventy-two disciples to preach and heal.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seventy-two_disciples.htm">The Seventy-Two Disciples</a></b><br>A group of Jesus' followers sent out in pairs to towns and places He was about to visit, tasked with healing and proclaiming the kingdom of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_towns_and_places.htm">The Towns and Places</a></b><br>Various locations in Judea and Galilee where the disciples were sent to prepare the way for Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sick.htm">The Sick</a></b><br>Individuals in these towns who were suffering from various ailments and were to be healed by the disciples.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_god.htm">The Kingdom of God</a></b><br>A central theme in Jesus' teaching, representing God's reign and rule, both present and future.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_authority_of_believers.htm">The Authority of Believers</a></b><br>Jesus grants His followers authority to heal and proclaim the kingdom, emphasizing the power and responsibility given to believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_the_kingdom.htm">The Urgency of the Kingdom</a></b><br>The message that "the kingdom of God is near" underscores the urgency and immediacy of the gospel message.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_in_action.htm">Compassion in Action</a></b><br>Healing the sick is an act of compassion and a demonstration of God's love and power, which should be reflected in our own lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_christ's_coming.htm">Preparation for Christ's Coming</a></b><br>Just as the disciples prepared the way for Jesus, we are called to prepare others for His return by sharing the gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_obedience.htm">Faith and Obedience</a></b><br>The disciples' mission required faith and obedience, serving as a model for our own walk with Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_10_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 10:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_heal_the_sick_today_per_Luke_10_9.htm">How can we "heal the sick" in our communities today, as instructed in Luke 10:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_kingdom_near_for_daily_life.htm">What does "the kingdom of God is near" mean for believers' daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Luke_10_9_to_Matthew_28_19-20.htm">How does Luke 10:9 connect with Jesus' Great Commission in Matthew 28:19-20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_show_God_s_kingdom_via_service.htm">In what ways can we demonstrate God's kingdom through acts of service and love?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Luke_10_9_inspire_evangelism.htm">How can understanding Luke 10:9 deepen our commitment to evangelism and discipleship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_10_9_s_link_to_modern_divine_healing.htm">How does Luke 10:9 relate to the concept of divine healing today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_healing_in_Luke_10_9.htm">What historical evidence supports the healing practices mentioned in Luke 10:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_kingdom_of_God_is_near.htm">How should Christians interpret "the kingdom of God has come near" in Luke 10:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_10.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/evidence_of_luke_10_9_healings_outside_bible.htm">Luke 10:9 &#8211; Where is the evidence, outside of scripture, that these reported healings truly occurred as described?

</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Luke 10:9 Mean</div><b>Heal the sick</b><p>- Jesus commands the seventy-two to minister in the most tangible way possible: restore broken bodies. This is not figurative; it is real, observable healing accomplished by God&#8217;s power working through obedient servants (<a href="/matthew/10-1.htm">Matthew 10:1</a>; <a href="/mark/16-17.htm">Mark 16:17-18</a>).<p>- Physical healing validates the message that follows. When people witness unmistakable acts of mercy, they glimpse God&#8217;s heart and His authority (<a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6-8</a>).<p>- The instruction still speaks to believers today&#8212;pray with faith, anoint with oil, lay on hands, and expect God to act according to His sovereign will (<a href="/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who are there</b><p>- The focus is immediate and local: &#8220;there,&#8221; wherever the disciples find themselves. Ministry begins with the people right in front of us&#8212;neighbors, coworkers, family (<a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>).<p>- Jesus removes any excuse for delay or discrimination; whoever crosses your path is your mission field, reflecting the Good Samaritan principle just a few verses later (<a href="/luke/10-33.htm">Luke 10:33-37</a>).<p>- &#8220;There&#8221; can be a village, a workplace, a hospital room, or a living room. God orchestrates encounters so that His servants meet real needs in real time (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and tell them</b><p>- Deeds alone are not enough; the gospel must be spoken. Faith comes by hearing the word about Christ (<a href="/romans/10-14.htm">Romans 10:14-17</a>).<p>- Healing creates an open door, but the disciple must step through it with clear words. Silence after a miracle would leave people guessing; God wants them certain about who acted and why (<a href="/acts/14-8.htm">Acts 14:8-18</a>).<p>- A balanced ministry combines compassion and proclamation, mirroring Jesus&#8217; own pattern (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-21</a>; 8:1).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The kingdom of God is near you</b><p>- This announcement reveals the purpose behind the miracle: God&#8217;s royal reign has arrived in the person of His Son. The King is on the move, reversing the curse (<a href="/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>).<p>- &#8220;Near&#8221; means imminence and accessibility. Listeners can enter the kingdom now through repentance and faith (<a href="/matthew/12-28.htm">Matthew 12:28</a>; <a href="/luke/17-21.htm">Luke 17:21</a>).<p>- The statement is both comfort and warning. Accept the King and enjoy His blessings, or reject Him and face judgment (<a href="/luke/10-10.htm">Luke 10:10-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/10-9.htm">Luke 10:9</a> shows Jesus pairing compassionate action with clear proclamation. His followers literally heal hurting bodies, right where they find them, then plainly explain that such power proves the nearness of God&#8217;s kingdom.

But this prodigality of miraculous energy was needful then.
