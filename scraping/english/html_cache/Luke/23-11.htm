Known for his role in the execution of John the Baptist, Herod was a ruler who sought to maintain his power by appeasing both Roman authorities and Jewish leaders. The act of ridicule and mockery by Herod and his soldiers reflects the fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being despised and rejected. This mockery also highlights the cultural practice of Roman and local authorities to humiliate those they considered powerless or a threat. The soldiers' actions were not just personal disdain but a representation of the world's rejection of Jesus' kingship.<p><b>Dressing Him in a fine robe,</b><br>The fine robe, likely a luxurious garment, was used to mock Jesus' claim to kingship. This act of dressing Him in such attire was a form of sarcastic homage, intended to belittle His claim to be the King of the Jews. The robe symbolizes the false honor given by the world, contrasting with the true honor and glory that belong to Christ. This event parallels the mockery Jesus faced from the Roman soldiers, who placed a crown of thorns on His head and hailed Him as "King of the Jews" (<a href="/matthew/27-29.htm">Matthew 27:29</a>). The robe can also be seen as a type of the royal garments that Christ will wear in His second coming, as described in <a href="/revelation/19-13.htm">Revelation 19:13-16</a>.<p><b>they sent Him back to Pilate.</b><br>Herod's decision to send Jesus back to Pilate indicates his reluctance to pass judgment on Jesus, possibly due to political caution or a lack of evidence. This act underscores the political dynamics between Herod and Pilate, who were both under Roman authority but had distinct jurisdictions. The return to Pilate fulfills the prophecy of Jesus being handed over to the Gentiles (<a href="/luke/18-32.htm">Luke 18:32</a>). It also highlights the fulfillment of God's sovereign plan, as Jesus' trial and crucifixion were necessary for the redemption of humanity. The collaboration between Herod and Pilate, who were previously at odds, illustrates how Jesus' presence and mission brought together unlikely alliances, even among those who opposed Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_antipas.htm">Herod Antipas</a></b><br>The tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, Herod was a ruler under Roman authority.

He treated him, not as a criminal, but as a mischievous religious Enthusiast, worthy only of contempt and scorn. The "gorgeous robe," more accurately, "bright raiment," was a white festal mantle such as Jewish kings and Roman nobles wore on great occasions. It was probably an old robe of white tissue of some kind, embroidered with silver. Dean Plumptre suggests that we might venture to trace in this outrage a vindictive retaliation for the words which the Teacher had once spoken - with evident allusion to Herod's court - of those who were gorgeously apparelled (<a href="/luke/7-25.htm">Luke 7:25</a>).
