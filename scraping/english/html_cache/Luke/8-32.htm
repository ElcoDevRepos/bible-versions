The choice of pigs, unclean animals, aligns with the demons' nature and the cultural context of the region.<p><b>and He gave them permission.</b><br>Jesus' granting of permission underscores His sovereign authority over all creation, including the spiritual realm. This act demonstrates His control and the fulfillment of His mission to destroy the works of the devil (1 <a href="/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>).

And he suffered them.</span> For what end was this request? Was it simply the way they chose to enter the abyss by? We know that the lives of the creatures, after the permission was given, lasted but a few minutes at most. Was it a desire to do more mischief during their brief sojourn on earth? Theophylact (eighth century) suggests that the purpose of the evil spirits, in their request, was to injure Jesus in that part of the country by arousing fears among the covetous inhabitants lest they too might lose, in a similar way, their herds. But to the writer of this note it seems best to confess that no satisfactory answer can ever be given here. We know so little of these dread spirits of evil. The reason of the Lord's permission is more obvious. Some such visible proof as the sight of the evil and unclean forces that had mastered him so long, transferred to the bodies of other creatures and working their wild will upon them, was probably a necessary element in his perfect cure. It is likely also that Jesus wished to show his indignation at the flagrant disregard of the Mosaic Law, at the open disobedience to the Divine injunctions respecting swine, which was shown by the presence of so vast a herd of these animals pronounced unclean by the Mosaic Law under which these people were professedly living (St. Mark gives the number as two thousand). In this district the large majority of the inhabitants were Jews. The keeping or the rearing of swine was strictly forbidden by the Jewish canon law. Other Oriental peoples also held these animals as unclean. Herodotus (it. 47) tells us that in Egypt there was a special class of swineherds, who alone among the inhabitants of the country were forbidden to enter a temple. This degraded caste were only allowed to marry among themselves. The eating of swine's flesh is referred to by Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3, 4</a>)as among the acts of the people which continually provoked the Lord to anger. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">There</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150;</span> <span class="translit">(ekei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1563.htm">Strong's 1563: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) there, yonder, in that place, (b) thither, there.
