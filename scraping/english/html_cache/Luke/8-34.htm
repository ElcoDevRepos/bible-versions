The presence of pigs indicates a Gentile region, as pigs were considered unclean in Jewish law (<a href="/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7</a>). The herdsmen witnessing this event underscores the miraculous nature of Jesus' power over evil spirits. This act demonstrates Jesus' authority over the spiritual realm, fulfilling prophecies of the Messiah's power to liberate those oppressed by demons (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>).<p><b>they ran off and reported this</b><br>The herdsmen's reaction to run and report the incident highlights the extraordinary nature of the event. In a cultural context where news was spread by word of mouth, their urgency suggests the impact of witnessing such a miracle.
