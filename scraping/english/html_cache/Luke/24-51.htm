In the Jewish tradition, blessings were significant and often given by a father to his children or a priest to the people. Jesus, as the High Priest, imparts His blessing, signifying His ongoing care and authority. This act fulfills the priestly role outlined in <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>, where the priests were instructed to bless the Israelites. The blessing also signifies the transition from Jesus' earthly ministry to His heavenly intercession.<p><b>He left them</b><br>This indicates the physical departure of Jesus from His disciples. It marks the end of His post-resurrection appearances, which had served to confirm His resurrection and prepare the disciples for their mission. The departure is not a sign of abandonment but a necessary step for the coming of the Holy Spirit, as promised in <a href="/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>. This moment is pivotal in salvation history, as it transitions the disciples from reliance on Jesus' physical presence to the empowerment of the Holy Spirit.<p><b>and was carried up into heaven</b><br>The ascension of Jesus is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and a demonstration of His divine nature. <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a> and <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a> speak of the Messiah's exaltation and authority. The ascension signifies Jesus' enthronement at the right hand of God, a position of power and intercession. It also prefigures the believer's future hope of being with Christ in glory. The ascension took place near Bethany on the Mount of Olives, a location with significant biblical history, including being the place where Jesus often taught and prayed.

This is no ceremonial gesture; it is the living Lord continuing the shepherd-heart He displayed in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>. In <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a> God gave a priestly formula of blessing; here the true High Priest applies it personally (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). The timing is crucial: the blessing is still flowing at the very moment of departure, assuring the disciples&#8212;and us&#8212;that His goodness is uninterrupted. Compare <a href="/luke/24-50.htm">Luke 24:50</a> for the setting on the Mount of Olives and <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a> where Jesus promises, &#8220;I am with you always.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He left them</b><p>&#8220;He left them&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-51.htm">Luke 24:51</a>) describes a literal, bodily departure, not a vision or symbol.

His leaving is purposeful, not abandonment (<a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>). <a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9</a> retells the moment: &#8220;He was taken up before their very eyes,&#8221; underscoring eyewitness credibility. The disciples&#8217; response&#8212;worship and great joy (<a href="/luke/24-52.htm">Luke 24:52</a>)&#8212;confirms they understood His departure as victory, not loss.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and was carried up into heaven</b><p>&#8220;and was carried up into heaven&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-51.htm">Luke 24:51</a>) affirms His ascension to the Father&#8217;s right hand, an event also recorded in <a href="/mark/16-19.htm">Mark 16:19</a> and foreshadowed in <a href="/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>.

The Acts (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9</a>) describe the act of ascension thus: "As they were looking, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight." The eleven and those chosen to witness the last earthly scene of the Lord's ministry came together, in obedience probably to some command of their Master, to some meeting-place in Jerusalem, possibly the well-known upper room. Thence he led them forth from the sacred city, past the scene of the agony and the scene of the weeping, on to some quiet spot hard by loved Bethany, talking to them as they went; and as he spoke, suddenly he lifted up his pierced hands and blessed them; and in the very act of performing this deed of love, he rose, they still gazing on him - rose, as it appears, by the exercise of his own will into the air, and, while they still gazed, a cloud came and veiled him from their sight. <span class="accented">He was parted from them</span>, <span class="accented">and carried up into heaven.</span> Among the appearances of the Risen to his followers during the forty days (ten of these distinct appearances are related in the Gospels and Epistles), this last notably differs from all that preceded it. As at other times when he showed himself to his friends during these forty days, so on the "Ascension" day Jesus apparently came forth suddenly from the invisible world; but not, as on former occasions, did he suddenly vanish from sight, as if he might shortly return as he had done before. But on this fortieth day he withdrew in a different way; as they gazed he rose up into the air, and so he parted from them, thus solemnly suggesting to them that not only was he "no more with them" (ver. 44), but that even those occasional and supernatural appearances vouchsafed to them since the Resurrection were now at an end. Nor were they grieved at this final parting; for we read - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-51.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">While</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(auton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
