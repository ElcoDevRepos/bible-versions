Prior to this, Jesus had been across the Sea of Galilee, where He performed the miracle of casting out demons from a man in the region of the Gerasenes. His return signifies His movement back to Jewish territory, likely Capernaum, which served as a central hub for His Galilean ministry. This return is significant as it shows Jesus' intentionality in His ministry, moving between Gentile and Jewish regions, fulfilling His mission to reach all people.<p><b>the crowd welcomed Him</b><br>The crowd's welcoming of Jesus reflects His growing popularity and the anticipation of His teachings and miracles. This reception contrasts with the rejection He faced in the Gerasenes, where the people asked Him to leave after the miracle. The crowd's enthusiasm can be seen as a fulfillment of the messianic expectations prevalent among the Jewish people, who were looking for a deliverer. This welcoming also sets the stage for the subsequent miracles, including the healing of Jairus' daughter and the woman with the issue of blood, demonstrating the people's faith and desperation for divine intervention.<p><b>for they had all been waiting for Him</b><br>This phrase highlights the anticipation and hope that Jesus inspired among the people. The waiting crowd suggests a sense of expectation and urgency, possibly due to the reports of His miraculous works and authoritative teaching. This anticipation can be linked to the prophecies of the Old Testament, where the coming of the Messiah was eagerly awaited. The people's waiting also underscores the spiritual hunger and need for salvation, healing, and truth, which Jesus came to fulfill. This moment foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of messianic prophecy through Jesus' death and resurrection, offering salvation to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, returning to a place where people eagerly awaited Him.

Mark records the same moment: &#8220;When Jesus had again crossed by boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around Him&#8221; (<a href="/mark/5-21.htm">Mark 5:21</a>).<p>- His return is purposeful. Each movement in the Gospels is directed by the Father&#8217;s timing (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>) and reveals the Lord&#8217;s readiness to meet needs on both sides of the lake.<p>- The contrast is striking: the Gerasenes asked Him to leave (<a href="/luke/8-37.htm">Luke 8:37</a>), yet the Galilean shore greets Him with open arms, underscoring how different hearts respond to the same Savior.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The crowd welcomed Him</b><p>- &#8220;Welcome&#8221; signals more than polite greeting; it carries warmth, eagerness, and an openness to His authority. Similar enthusiasm surfaced earlier when Galileans &#8220;welcomed Him, having seen all the things He had done in Jerusalem&#8221; (<a href="/john/4-45.htm">John 4:45</a>).<p>- Their welcome reflects:<p>&#8226; Recognition of His power&#8212;He had healed the centurion&#8217;s servant (<a href="/luke/7-1.htm">Luke 7:1-10</a>) and raised the widow&#8217;s son (<a href="/luke/7-11.htm">Luke 7:11-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Desire for His teaching&#8212;He spoke &#8220;with authority&#8221; (<a href="/luke/4-32.htm">Luke 4:32</a>), offering truth that cut through empty tradition.<p>&#8226; Hope for personal deliverance&#8212;many were sick or oppressed (<a href="/luke/6-17.htm">Luke 6:17-19</a>).<p>- The scene anticipates the hospitality later shown at the triumphal entry (<a href="/luke/19-37.htm">Luke 19:37-38</a>), revealing that crowds can be genuinely receptive even if their understanding is still growing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For they had all been waiting for Him</b><p>- Waiting implies expectancy. Like Simeon who &#8220;was waiting for the consolation of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25</a>), this crowd leaned forward in faith.<p>- Their anticipation was fueled by firsthand reports of miracles (<a href="/luke/7-22.htm">Luke 7:22</a>) and the promise that &#8220;everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved&#8221; (<a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>; <a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>).<p>- Waiting is active, not passive:<p>&#8226; They gathered where His boat would land (parallel in <a href="/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1</a>).<p>&#8226; They positioned family and friends for healing (<a href="/luke/5-18.htm">Luke 5:18-20</a>).<p>&#8226; They listened, ready to obey (<a href="/luke/8-15.htm">Luke 8:15</a>, the &#8220;good soil&#8221;).<p>- Scripture often links waiting with blessing: &#8220;Those who wait upon the LORD will renew their strength&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>). The crowd&#8217;s expectation becomes a doorway for the next miracles&#8212;Jairus&#8217;s daughter and the woman healed from bleeding (<a href="/luke/8-41.htm">Luke 8:41-56</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/8-40.htm">Luke 8:40</a> captures a moment of eager faith: Jesus returns by divine appointment, and a crowd&#8212;hungry for His words and works&#8212;welcomes Him because they have been actively, expectantly waiting. The verse teaches that hearts prepared by anticipation and openness become fertile ground for the Lord&#8217;s power to be displayed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(40) <span class= "bld">When Jesus was returned.</span>--The narrative implies that our Lord and His disciples re-crossed the lake from the eastern to the western shore, and that the crowd that waited belonged to Capernaum and the neighbouring towns.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 40-56.</span> - The <span class="accented">healing of the woman with the issue of blood</span>, <span class="accented">and the raising of the daughter of Jairus.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were</span> all waiting for him. Allusion has already been made, in the notes which preceded the parable of the sower, to the enthusiasm for Jesus in the Galilee lake-cities and their neighbourhood. This, as the Master well knew, was only a temporary religious revival, but still while it lasted it gathered great crowds in every place where he visited. He had not been long in the Gadarene district, but his return was eagerly looked for in Galilee. This verse describes his reception on his return by the people, and introduces the recital of two famous miracles which he worked in this period of his ministry after his brief visit to the other shore of the lake. St. Matthew, before speaking of the request of Jairus that the Master would visit his dying child, relates the healing of the paralytic at Capernaum, and the calling of Matthew the apostle. It is scarcely possible now to arrange the events related, in their proper chronological order. The Gospel histories pretty faithfully represent the teaching of the first days, in which it was evidently the practice of apostles and apostolic men to group their accounts of particular incidents in the Lord's life with a view to teaching certain lessons connected with doctrine or with daily living, often disregarding the order in which these incidents really happened. Hence so many of the differences in detail in our Gospels. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(En)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
