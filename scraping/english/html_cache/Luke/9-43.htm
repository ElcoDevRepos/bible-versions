The term "astonished" indicates a profound sense of wonder and awe, which is a common response to divine intervention throughout the Bible (e.g., <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>, <a href="/psalms/86-10.htm">Psalm 86:10</a>). The "greatness of God" reflects His omnipotence and sovereignty, themes prevalent in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>) and demonstrated through Jesus' ministry. This moment underscores the divine authority of Jesus, affirming His identity as the Son of God and fulfilling prophecies about the Messiah's power (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>).<p><b>While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus was doing,</b><br>The crowd's marveling highlights the public nature of Jesus' miracles and teachings, which were often performed in the presence of many witnesses (e.g., feeding the 5,000 in <a href="/luke/9-10.htm">Luke 9:10-17</a>). This public ministry served to authenticate His message and mission, drawing parallels to the works of prophets like Elijah and Elisha, who also performed miracles to demonstrate God's power (<a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36-39</a>, <a href="/2_kings/4-32.htm">2 Kings 4:32-37</a>). The continuous amazement of the people points to the unprecedented nature of Jesus' works, which were unlike anything seen before, fulfilling the expectations of a coming prophet greater than Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>).<p><b>He said to His disciples,</b><br>This transition marks a shift from public demonstration to private instruction, a common pattern in Jesus' ministry where He would explain deeper truths to His disciples away from the crowds (<a href="/mark/4-34.htm">Mark 4:34</a>). The disciples, as Jesus' closest followers, were being prepared for their future roles as leaders of the early Church. This moment of teaching often involved revealing the mysteries of the Kingdom of God (<a href="/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>) and preparing them for the challenges ahead, including His impending death and resurrection, which He had begun to foretell (<a href="/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>). This private instruction underscores the importance of discipleship and the transmission of Jesus' teachings to future generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, performing miracles and teaching His disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are being taught and prepared for future ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The people who witness Jesus' miracles and are astonished by His works.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_greatness_of_god.htm">The Greatness of God</a></b><br>The divine power and majesty displayed through Jesus' miracles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_setting.htm">The Setting</a></b><br>This event takes place during Jesus' ministry in Galilee, where He performs miracles and teaches.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_god's_greatness.htm">Recognizing God's Greatness</a></b><br>The crowd's astonishment at Jesus' miracles should remind us to recognize and revere the greatness of God in our own lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_faith.htm">The Role of Faith</a></b><br>Witnessing God's power requires faith.

The crowd could only conclude that God Himself was present and active (<a href="/psalms/118-23.htm">Psalm 118:23</a>; <a href="/acts/4-30.htm">Acts 4:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Marveling at all Jesus was doing</b><p>- Luke adds, &#8220;While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus was doing.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;All&#8221; reminds us that this miracle joined a growing list&#8212;stilling storms, feeding multitudes, healing the incurable (<a href="/luke/7-22.htm">Luke 7:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Each deed certified Jesus as the promised Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>; <a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>).<p>- The crowd&#8217;s marvel stops short of saving faith. Amazement is good, but discipleship demands more (<a href="/john/6-26.htm">John 6:26-27</a>). Luke quietly contrasts temporary wonder with the deeper commitment Jesus is about to press upon His own.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus turns to His disciples</b><p>- &#8220;He said to His disciples&#8221; shifts the scene from public spectacle to private instruction.<p>&#8226; Only a verse later He tells them, &#8220;Let these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men&#8221; (<a href="/luke/9-44.htm">Luke 9:44</a>, cf. 9:22).<p>&#8226; While the crowd basks in glory, Jesus fixes His gaze on the cross (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>).<p>- The pattern is consistent: revelation of power is followed by teaching on suffering (<a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16-21</a>; <a href="/mark/9-2.htm">Mark 9:2-9, 30</a>-31).<p>&#8226; The disciples must learn that true greatness involves sacrifice, not applause (<a href="/john/12-23.htm">John 12:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; In addressing them amid the buzz of the crowd, Jesus invites His followers to move from spectators to servants who will share both His mission and His rejection (<a href="/2_timothy/2-11.htm">2 Timothy 2:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/9-43.htm">Luke 9:43</a> captures a glorious moment of public astonishment, yet it serves as a hinge toward deeper revelation. The crowd rightly recognizes God&#8217;s greatness in Jesus&#8217; mighty works, but Jesus immediately directs His disciples beyond wonder to the sobering reality of His coming passion. The verse reminds believers that miracles ignite praise, but true discipleship listens closely to the Savior&#8217;s call to follow Him through both triumph and trial, trusting that the same power that evokes marvel will also sustain obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(43) <span class= "bld">At the mighty power of God.</span>--The word so rendered is a somewhat remarkable one, and, like the <span class= "ital">exodos</span> of <a href="/luke/9-31.htm" title="Who appeared in glory, and spoke of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.">Luke 9:31</a>, appears again in <a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm" title="For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.">2Peter 1:16</a> in close connection with a reference to the history of the Transfiguration.

Once more were kindled the disciples' hopes of an earthly royalty in the Person of that strange Messiah. For was he not Messiah after all, who with a word worked such stupendous works as the miracle they had just witnessed? But Jesus read their thoughts, and again tells them (in ver. 44) of the terrible doom which awaited him. They must remember there was no earthly crown or human sovereignty for him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they were all astonished</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#958;&#949;&#960;&#955;&#942;&#963;&#963;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(Exepl&#275;ssonto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1605.htm">Strong's 1605: </a> </span><span class="str2">To strike with panic or shock; I amaze, astonish.
