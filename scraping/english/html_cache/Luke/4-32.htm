In the context of first-century Judaism, teaching was often based on the traditions of the elders and the interpretations of the scribes and Pharisees. Jesus, however, taught with a directness and clarity that was both new and compelling. This astonishment is echoed in other parts of the Gospels, such as <a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28-29</a>, where the crowds are amazed because He taught as one having authority, not as their teachers of the law. The Greek word for "astonished" suggests a deep, overwhelming amazement, indicating that His teaching had a profound impact on His listeners.<p><b>because His message had authority</b><br>The authority of Jesus' message is a central theme in the Gospels. Unlike the scribes, who relied on quoting other authorities, Jesus spoke with inherent authority. This authority is rooted in His identity as the Son of God, fulfilling the prophecies of the Old Testament. In <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>, the Messiah is described as being anointed to preach good news, which Jesus explicitly claims in <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-21</a>. His authority is also demonstrated through His command over unclean spirits and His ability to perform miracles, as seen in the surrounding passages of <a href="/luke/4.htm">Luke 4</a>. This authority is not just in His words but in His actions, confirming His divine nature and mission. The authority of Jesus is a type of the ultimate authority He will exercise in His second coming, as prophesied in <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching in the synagogue.

We have here again a picture which gives a general summary of Jesus' life extending over a considerable period. This is the fifth of these pictures of St. Luke. It represents the Master dwelling quietly at Capernaum, in the midst of his disciples, teaching and preaching; on the sabbath days gathering a considerable concourse drawn from the people at large, and generally surprising the listeners with his earnestness, freshness, and ability, which carried conviction into many a heart, Gentile as well as Jew. Although this period of the life of Jesus was signalized by many miracles, it does not seem that his <span class="accented">ordinary</span> preaching and teaching needed any such supernatural testimony to enable it to win its way. St. Luke especially tells us it was with power, and that the crowds heard it amazed and astonished. St. Matthew gives us (<a href="/matthew/7-29.htm">Matthew 7:29</a>) one reason, which helps us to understand something of this success which attended his teaching. It was "not as the scribes." In the Talmud we have many a fair specimen of the sacred instruction of the "schools" in the time of our Lord. Frivolous minutiae, hair-splitting of texts, weary repetition of the sayings of the men of old, questions connected with the exact keeping of the sabbath, with the tithing of mint, anise, and cummin, a singular lack of all dealing with the weightier matters of the Law - justice, judgment, truth - were among the characteristics of the scribes' popular instruction. The practical heart-searching words of Jesus were in strong contrast with the curious but useless themes dwelt on by the official teachers of the day. It was with the thirty-first verse of this chapter that the great Gnostic heretic, Marcion (second century) began his Gospel, which, in the early days of Christianity, had a vast circulation. Marcion, while preferring St. Luke's Gospel, as emanating from St. Paul, before putting it out as the authoritative history to be used by his numerous followers, cut out the earlier chapters of our Gospel, which bore on the birth and infancy of the Lord, commencing here - prefixing, however, a note of time, thus: "In the fifteenth year of the government of Tiberius, Jesus went down" (Marcioh probably intended it to be understood <span class="accented">from heaven</span>) "into the town of Galilee named Capernaum." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/4-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They were astonished</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#958;&#949;&#960;&#955;&#942;&#963;&#963;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(exepl&#275;ssonto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1605.htm">Strong's 1605: </a> </span><span class="str2">To strike with panic or shock; I amaze, astonish.
