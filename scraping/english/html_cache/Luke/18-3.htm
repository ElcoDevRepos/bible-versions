Without a husband to provide for them, they frequently faced economic hardship and social marginalization. The Old Testament law provided specific protections for widows (<a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22-24</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>), emphasizing God's concern for their welfare. The mention of a widow in this parable highlights her vulnerability and the expectation that justice should be extended to her. The setting of "that town" suggests a local context, possibly a small community where everyone knew each other, which would make her plight more visible yet still unresolved.<p><b>who kept appealing to him</b><br>The persistence of the widow is a central theme in this parable. Her continual appeals indicate her desperation and determination. In the cultural context, a woman repeatedly approaching a judge would have been seen as bold, as women typically had limited legal standing. This persistence is a model of faith and perseverance, echoing other biblical teachings on persistent prayer (<a href="/luke/11-5.htm">Luke 11:5-8</a>). Her actions demonstrate a relentless pursuit of justice, which is a key aspect of the parable's message.<p><b>&#8216;Give me justice against my adversary.&#8217;</b><br>The widow's plea for justice underscores the biblical theme of righteousness and justice, which are foundational to God's character (<a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>). Her adversary is not named, which universalizes her plight, making it applicable to any situation where injustice occurs. The demand for justice reflects the biblical call for God's people to seek justice and defend the oppressed (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>). This plea also foreshadows the ultimate justice that will be realized in God's kingdom, where wrongs are righted and the oppressed are vindicated. The widow's cry for justice can be seen as a type of the believer's appeal to God, the righteous judge, for deliverance and vindication.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_widow.htm">The Widow</a></b><br>In <a href="/luke/18-3.htm">Luke 18:3</a>, the widow represents a figure of vulnerability and persistence.

Because God&#8217;s nature is to champion the oppressed, He invites His people to keep coming, confident that He will answer with righteous judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">There was a widow in that city.</span>--The neglect of the cause of the widow had always been noted by Lawgiver and Prophet--and it was one of the notes of a high ethical standard in both--as the extremest form of oppressive tyranny (<a href="/exodus/22-22.htm" title="You shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.">Exodus 22:22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm" title="He does execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loves the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-19.htm" title="Cursed be he that perverts the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow.

Comp. also the speech of the widow of Tekoah (<a href="/2_samuel/14-2.htm" title="And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched there a wise woman, and said to her, I pray you, feign yourself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not yourself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:">2Samuel 14:2</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/14-5.htm" title="And the king said to her, What ails you? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and my husband is dead.">2Samuel 14:5</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary</span>. The petitioner was a woman and a widow, the latter being in the East a synonym for helplessness. With no one to defend her or plead her cause, this widow was ever a prey to the covetous. Not once nor twice in the noble generous words of the chivalrous Hebrew prophets we find this readiness on the part of those in power to neglect, if not to oppress these helpless widow-women, sternly commented upon. So in Isaiah we read (<a href="/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>), "They judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them." While Jesus (<a href="/matthew/23-14.htm">Matthew 23:14</a>) includes this cowardly sin among the evil deeds of the rulers of the Israel of his day: "Ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer." A more desperate situation, as regards any hope of obtaining the object of her earnest prayer, could not well be pictured - a careless, corrupt judge of the lawless Herod period for the tribunal in Israel, and a poor helpless widow for the suppliant. The forlorn woman of the parable represents the Church or people of God in dire straits, overborne by an unbelieving world and seemingly forgotten even of their God. The story is a reminder that there is hope even in that extreme situation sketched in the parable, if the petitioner only continues persistent in her prayer. The argument which lies on the surface of the parable, teaching is obvious: if such a judge will in the end listen to the prayer of a suppliant for whom he cares nothing, will not God surely listen to the repeated prayer of a suppliant whom he loves with a deep, enduring love? Such is the argument of the story. Importunity, it seems to say, must inevitably triumph. But underlying this there is much deep teaching, of which, perhaps, the most important item is that it insists upon the urgent necessity for us all to continue in prayer, never fainting in this exercise though no answer seems to come. "The whole limb of the faithful," as Origen once grandly said, "should be one great connected prayer." That is the real moral of the story; but there are a number of minor bits of Divine teaching contained in this curious parable setting, as we shall see. <span class="accented">Avenge me of mine adversary.</span> We must not suppose that mere vengeance in the vulgar sense is what the widow prayed for; <span class="accented">that</span> would be of no use to her; all she wanted was that the judge should deliver her from the oppression which her adversary exercised over her, no doubt in keeping from her the heritage to which she was lawfully entitled. Of course, the granting her prayer would revolve loss and possibly punishment to her fraudulent oppressor. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/18-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">there was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7974;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
