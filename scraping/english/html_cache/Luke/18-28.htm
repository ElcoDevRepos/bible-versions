His use of "Look" indicates a desire for Jesus to pay attention to what he is about to say, suggesting the importance of his statement. This reflects Peter's bold and impulsive nature, seen throughout the Gospels, such as when he walks on water (<a href="/matthew/14-28.htm">Matthew 14:28-29</a>) or declares Jesus as the Messiah (<a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>).<p><b>"we have left all we had"</b><br>Peter refers to the significant sacrifices made by the disciples to follow Jesus. This includes leaving their livelihoods, such as fishing (<a href="/matthew/4-18.htm">Matthew 4:18-22</a>), and their families, which was a radical commitment in a culture that valued family ties and economic stability. This echoes the call of discipleship, where Jesus asks for total commitment (<a href="/luke/14-33.htm">Luke 14:33</a>).<p><b>"to follow You."</b><br>Following Jesus implies a life of discipleship, characterized by learning from Him and emulating His life and teachings. This phrase highlights the personal relationship between Jesus and His disciples, emphasizing trust and obedience. It also connects to the broader theme of discipleship in the Gospels, where following Jesus often means taking up one's cross and prioritizing the Kingdom of God over worldly concerns (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24-25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, known for his impulsive nature and deep devotion to Christ.

Again the question of Peter, evidently acting as spokesman of the twelve, is repeated by the first three evangelists. Strangely faithful in their accounts of their own dealings with their adored Master, they never veil or hide any human weakness or error of their own which led to an important bit of teaching from their Lord. Now, in this place, they, in the person of Peter, gave utterance to a very worldly, but a very natural, thought.
