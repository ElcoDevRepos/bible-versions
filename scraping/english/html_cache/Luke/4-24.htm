In the context of <a href="/luke/4.htm">Luke 4</a>, Jesus is speaking in the synagogue in Nazareth, His hometown, after reading from the scroll of Isaiah. This setting is significant as it marks the beginning of His public ministry. The addition of this statement serves to emphasize the point He is making about the reception of prophets.<p><b>Truly I tell you</b><br>This phrase is a solemn declaration, often used by Jesus to introduce a statement of great importance and truth. It underscores the authority with which Jesus speaks, akin to the Old Testament prophets who would declare, "Thus says the Lord." It is a call for the listeners to pay close attention to the truth being revealed.<p><b>no prophet is accepted</b><br>The rejection of prophets is a recurring theme in the Bible. Prophets like Jeremiah and Elijah faced significant opposition and were often not accepted by their own people. This statement highlights the pattern of resistance to God's messengers throughout Israel's history. It also foreshadows the rejection Jesus Himself will face, culminating in His crucifixion.<p><b>in his hometown</b><br>Nazareth, where Jesus grew up, is the specific hometown referenced here. The cultural context of the time placed great emphasis on familial and community ties, yet familiarity often bred contempt. This reflects a broader human tendency to undervalue what is familiar. The rejection in Nazareth is symbolic of the broader rejection Jesus would face from the Jewish people, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being despised and rejected.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to the people in the synagogue in Nazareth, His hometown.

The cross, for example, emerged from humanity&#8217;s refusal yet became God&#8217;s means of salvation (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In his hometown</b><p>&#8226; Nazareth&#8217;s familiarity bred contempt: &#8220;Isn&#8217;t this Joseph&#8217;s son?&#8221; (<a href="/luke/4-22.htm">Luke 4:22</a>), echoing, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t this the carpenter?&#8221; (<a href="/mark/6-3.htm">Mark 6:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Those who watched Him grow could not see beyond the ordinary to recognize the extraordinary.<p>&#8226; Their unbelief limited what He would do there: &#8220;He did not do many miracles because of their unbelief&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/13-58.htm">Matthew 13:58</a>).<p>&#8226; The principle applies broadly: when hearts cling to preconceptions, they miss God&#8217;s fresh work (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jesus&#8217; words expose a timeless pattern: God&#8217;s messengers meet their sharpest resistance where they should expect their warmest welcome. By citing this proverb, He explains Nazareth&#8217;s unbelief, aligns Himself with the persecuted prophets, and prepares the reader for the wider rejection that will lead to the cross. Yet the rejection itself fulfills Scripture and advances God&#8217;s redemptive plan, assuring us that fidelity to God&#8217;s truth matters more than human applause.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">No prophet is accepted.</span>--The proverb is remarkable as having been quoted by our Lord certainly twice, possibly oftener: (1) on this His first visit after His baptism to Nazareth; (2) on His second visit (<a href="/matthew/13-57.htm" title="And they were offended in him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house.">Matthew 13:57</a>; <a href="/mark/6-4.htm" title="But Jesus, said to them, A prophet is not without honor, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.">Mark 6:4</a>). St. John's reference to it (<a href="/john/4-44.htm" title="For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own country.">John 4:44</a>) may have risen out of one or other of these two occasions, but it rather conveys the impression of the saying having been often on the lips of Jesus.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country</span>. But instead of gratifying their curiosity and supplying them with some more empty arguments why they should not listen to his words, the Lord quietly quotes a proverb well known to all people - Farrar calls it a curious psychological fact - the quoting prefaced by the solemn "verily." The Master was evidently looking far beyond the little prejudices of Nazareth. "His own country" meant far more than the narrow circuit bounded by the Nazareth hills. The Speaker was thinking of all the chosen people - of the Jews, who as a nation he knew too well would not accept him. But if Israel would have none of him, he would reign in the hearts of that unnumbered multitude who peopled the isles of the Gentiles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/4-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He added,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
