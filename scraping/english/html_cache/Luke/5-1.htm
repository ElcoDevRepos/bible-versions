It emphasizes the historical nature of the Gospel accounts, which are rooted in real time and space. The Gospels often highlight particular moments to convey theological truths and the unfolding of Jesus' ministry.<p><b>while Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret</b><br>The Lake of Gennesaret is another name for the Sea of Galilee, a freshwater lake in northern Israel. This area was central to Jesus' ministry, as many of His teachings and miracles occurred here. The lake is surrounded by fertile land, supporting a thriving fishing industry, which is significant for the calling of the first disciples. The geographical setting underscores the accessibility of Jesus' message to ordinary people in their everyday environments.<p><b>with the crowd pressing in on Him</b><br>The crowd's eagerness to be near Jesus reflects His growing popularity and the compelling nature of His teachings. This scene illustrates the intense interest and need among the people for spiritual truth and healing. It also foreshadows the challenges Jesus would face due to His increasing fame, including managing large crowds and addressing diverse expectations.<p><b>to hear the word of God</b><br>This phrase highlights the primary reason for the crowd's gathering: to listen to Jesus' teaching, which is identified as the "word of God." This underscores Jesus' role as a divine teacher and prophet, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies about the coming of a new covenant and the proclamation of God's kingdom. It also connects to passages like <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>, where Jesus is described as the Word, emphasizing His divine authority and the transformative power of His message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, teaching the word of God.

The verse invites us to bring our everyday lives, press close to Christ, and listen intently, confident that His authoritative word still meets every longing heart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">V.</span><p>(1-11) <span class= "bld">And it came to pass . . .</span>--See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/4-18.htm" title="And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.">Matthew 4:18-22</a>. The narrative here has so many points in common with that in St. Matthew and St. Mark (<a href="/context/mark/1-16.htm" title="Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.">Mark 1:16-20</a>) that it has been supposed by most commentators to be a different report of the same facts. It is supposed to be all but incredible that the call to the four disciples, the promise that they should be "fishers of men," their leaving all and following their Master, could have been repeated after comparatively so short an interval. On the other hand, St. Luke places it after the healing of Simon's wife's mother; St. Mark and St. Matthew place what they relate before, and the miraculous draught of fishes and Peter's confession are singularly distinctive features. Their narrative, again, is unconnected with our Lord's preaching to the people, with which this opens. On the whole we cannot go farther than saying that there is a slight presumption against the hypothesis of identity. On the assumption of difference we may infer that while our Lord went by Himself to preach the gospel of the kingdom to "the other cities," the disciples returned, as they did after the Resurrection, to their old manner of life, and were now called again to their higher work.<p><span class= "bld">The lake of Gennesaret.</span>--St. Luke is the only Evangelist who thus describes the Sea of Galilee. On the land of Gennesaret, see Note on <a href="/matthew/14-34.htm" title="And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.">Matthew 14:34</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the</span> <span class="cmt_word">word of God.</span> His fame as a great Teacher was evidently now firmly established. If it were known that he intended speaking in public, a crowd of listeners would gather quickly round him, whether in the synagogues, or by the lake-shore, or in the market-place. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">stood by the Lake of Gennesaret</span>. On this occasion, as he taught by the quiet lake waters, the throng was so great that he borrowed the fishing-boat of one of his friends, and, just pushing out from the shore, spoke to the multitude from the little craft as it rocked on the wavelets of the lake. Dean Stanley calls it "the most sacred sheet of water which the earth contains." The rabbinical derivation is interesting: "<span class="accented">Gannesarim</span>, garden of princes;" but it is more probable that <span class="accented">Gennesaret</span> is but a reproduction of the old Hebrew name <span class="accented">Chinneroth</span> (<a href="/joshua/12-3.htm">Joshua 12:3</a>), so called from its harplike shape. It is a beautiful sheet of water, twelve or thirteen miles long and nearly seven broad at one portion of the lake. The Jordan flows through it. In our Lord's time it was surrounded by the richest and most populous district of the Holy Land; large and flourishing towns were built along its shores. Capernaum, as has been said, was the junction of the great roads leading from Syria and the far East to the Mediterranean on the west, and Jerusalem and Egypt on the south. The lake was famous for its fish, and was crowded with all descriptions of craft. The whole scene is now changed. Scarcely a rude boat is ever seen on the blue silent waters. Desolate ruins fringe the deserted shores, with here and there a crumbling mud village, inhabited by the poorest and least enterprising of peasants, so sadly changed is this beautiful and wealthy district, which the rabbis used to love to speak of as the one among the seven seas of Canaan which God had reserved for himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/5-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">On one occasion,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">while</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
