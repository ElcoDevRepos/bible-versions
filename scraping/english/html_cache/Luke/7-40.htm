This demonstrates Jesus' omniscience, as He perceives Simon's thoughts without them being spoken. This ability to know the hearts and minds of individuals is a divine attribute, aligning with passages such as <a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>, where it is noted that Jesus knew what was in man.<p><b>&#8220;Simon, I have something to tell you.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus addresses Simon directly, indicating a personal and intentional engagement. The use of Simon's name suggests a personal relationship and a call to attention. This approach is reminiscent of how God often calls individuals by name in Scripture, such as Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>, indicating the importance of the message to follow. Jesus' method of teaching through parables and direct conversation is a hallmark of His ministry, as seen throughout the Gospels.<p><b>&#8220;Tell me, Teacher,&#8221; he said.</b><br>Simon&#8217;s response acknowledges Jesus as a "Teacher," a term of respect that recognizes Jesus' authority and wisdom. However, it also reflects a limited understanding of Jesus' true identity as the Messiah. The title "Teacher" is frequently used in the Gospels, often by those who recognize Jesus' authority in teaching but do not fully grasp His divine nature. This interaction sets the stage for the parable of the two debtors, which follows, illustrating themes of forgiveness and grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching and revealing truths about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_the_pharisee.htm">Simon the Pharisee</a></b><br>A Pharisee who invited Jesus to his house.

Christ steps in to correct Simon&#8217;s inward attitude, emphasizing that our unspoken reasoning is fully exposed to Him (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; By initiating the conversation, Jesus models proactive grace&#8212;He does not wait for Simon to seek clarity; He seeks Simon for correction and redemption (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Simon</b><p>&#8226; Jesus addresses the Pharisee by name, making the encounter personal. Scripture often records God calling people by name to draw them into relationship (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>; <a href="/john/20-16.htm">John 20:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Naming him highlights accountability. Simon cannot hide behind his religious status; he must face the truth person-to-person (<a href="/romans/2-1.htm">Romans 2:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The personal call underscores that faith is never generic; it is specific and individual (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have something to tell you</b><p>&#8226; Christ&#8217;s statement signals a purposeful teaching moment. Whenever Jesus says He has &#8220;something&#8221; to convey, it carries eternal weight (<a href="/john/16-12.htm">John 16:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; This approach invites listening rather than condemning. Jesus offers revelation before rebuke, mirroring <a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>&#8217;s call to be &#8220;quick to listen.&#8221;<p>&#8226; We learn that Jesus desires dialogue that penetrates the heart, not mere external conformity (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Tell me, Teacher</b><p>&#8226; Simon&#8217;s reply sounds respectful&#8212;he calls Jesus &#8220;Teacher&#8221;&#8212;yet the narrative soon exposes his limited understanding. Respectful titles without surrendered hearts fall short (<a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Still, Simon&#8217;s openness to hear gives Jesus room to speak a parable of the two debtors (<a href="/luke/7-41.htm">Luke 7:41-43</a>), illustrating grace. Even tentative willingness can become a gateway for truth (<a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The exchange reminds believers to invite Christ&#8217;s correction regularly. When we say, &#8220;Tell me, Teacher,&#8221; we position ourselves for growth (<a href="/psalms/139-23.htm">Psalm 139:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/7-40.htm">Luke 7:40</a> shows Jesus lovingly confronting hidden judgment.
