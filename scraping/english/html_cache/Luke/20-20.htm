This surveillance was not merely casual observation but a deliberate attempt to find fault. The Greek term used implies a careful and malicious watching, akin to a predator stalking its prey. This behavior is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/37-32.htm">Psalm 37:32</a>, where the wicked lie in wait for the righteous.<p><b>and sent spies who pretended to be sincere.</b><br>The leaders employed deceit by sending spies, indicating their desperation and cunning. These spies were to feign righteousness, a tactic that echoes the serpent's deception in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. The use of pretense highlights the moral corruption of the leaders, contrasting with Jesus' call for genuine righteousness in <a href="/matthew/5-20.htm">Matthew 5:20</a>. This act of hypocrisy fulfills Isaiah's prophecy about people honoring God with their lips while their hearts are far from Him (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>).<p><b>They were hoping to catch Him in His words</b><br>Their goal was to trap Jesus in His speech, a common tactic used by adversaries throughout His ministry (see <a href="/matthew/22-15.htm">Matthew 22:15</a>). This reflects the wisdom literature's warnings about the power of words (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>) and the snares of the wicked (<a href="/proverbs/12-13.htm">Proverbs 12:13</a>). The leaders' intent was to manipulate Jesus' words to accuse Him, similar to how Daniel's enemies sought to find fault with him (<a href="/daniel/6-4.htm">Daniel 6:4-5</a>).<p><b>in order to hand Him over to the rule and authority of the governor.</b><br>The ultimate aim was to deliver Jesus to the Roman authorities, as the Jewish leaders lacked the power to execute capital punishment (<a href="/john/18-31.htm">John 18:31</a>). This reflects the political tension of the time, where Roman rule was resented yet necessary for maintaining order. The mention of the governor foreshadows Jesus' trial before Pontius Pilate, fulfilling the prophecy of the suffering servant who would be "numbered with the transgressors" (<a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>). This phrase also underscores the leaders' rejection of Jesus as the Messiah, choosing instead to align with secular power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is being closely watched by those who seek to trap Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/spies.htm">Spies</a></b><br>Individuals sent by the religious leaders to feign sincerity and trap Jesus with His own words.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/religious_leaders.htm">Religious Leaders</a></b><br>The chief priests and scribes who are plotting against Jesus, seeking to undermine His authority.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/governor.htm">Governor</a></b><br>The Roman authority to whom the religious leaders hope to deliver Jesus, aiming to have Him punished under Roman law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events are taking place, a significant location for Jesus' ministry and eventual crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_deception.htm">Discernment in Deception</a></b><br>Jesus demonstrates discernment in recognizing the deceitful intentions of the spies.

By sending others in their place, the leaders hoped to stay behind the scenes while still controlling the outcome.<p>&#8226; This tactic mirrors the serpent&#8217;s subtlety in <a href="/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a> and the enemies of Nehemiah who hired false prophets (<a href="/nehemiah/6-12.htm">Nehemiah 6:12-13</a>). Deception is a hallmark of those resisting God&#8217;s purposes.<p>&#8226; Their use of &#8220;spies&#8221; shows how far religious leaders were willing to go&#8212;using political intrigue rather than honest engagement with Jesus&#8217; teaching.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who pretended to be sincere</b><p>&#8226; Appearance without integrity recalls <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>&#8212;&#8220;This people draws near with their mouths&#8230; yet their hearts are far from Me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Pretended sincerity is especially dangerous because it mimics genuine faith, making it harder to discern.

In the very next verses (<a href="/luke/20-21.htm">Luke 20:21-26</a>), Jesus&#8217; reply about paying taxes to Caesar stuns them into silence, fulfilling <a href="/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a>&#8212;&#8220;Whoever digs a pit will fall into it.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in order to hand Him over to the rule and authority of the governor</b><p>&#8226; The leaders&#8217; ultimate goal was political execution.

They surveil Him, deploy covert agents, feign devotion, distort His words, and seek governmental power to eliminate Him. Each step exposes the contrast between deceitful human schemes and the flawless integrity of Christ. While His enemies maneuver in darkness, Jesus continues to shine as the embodiment of truth, turning their traps into opportunities to reveal His wisdom and ultimately fulfilling God&#8217;s redemptive plan on the cross.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20-26) <span class= "bld">And they watched him.</span>--See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/22-15.htm" title="Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.">Matthew 22:15-22</a> and <a href="/context/mark/12-13.htm" title="And they send to him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.">Mark 12:13-17</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And sent forth spies.</span>--The noun is, again, one of St. Luke's characteristic words not used by any other New Testament writer. It expresses rather the act of those who lie in ambush, than that of "spies" in the strict sense of the words. St. Luke is, on the one hand, less definite as to the parties to the conspiracy than the other Gospels, and on the other hand more explicit as to its aim. They wanted materials for an accusation before Pilate, as well as for one before the Sanhedrin. On the omission of the name of the Herodians, see Note on <a href="/luke/6-11.htm" title="And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.">Luke 6:11</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Power and authority.</span>--We have again the characteristic combination of the two substantives.

Their hope henceforward is to substantiate a charge of treason against him. This was, in those troublous times, when insurrection against the detested Gentile rule was ever being plotted, a comparatively easy matter. The incident of the tribute money, which immediately follows, was part of this new departure in the Sanhedrin policy respecting the murder they so longed to see carried out. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/20-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they watched [Him] closely</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#961;&#942;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(parat&#275;r&#275;santes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3906.htm">Strong's 3906: </a> </span><span class="str2">To watch, observe scrupulously.
