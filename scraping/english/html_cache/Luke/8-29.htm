The man's condition underscores the need for divine intervention, which only Jesus can provide.<p><b>and though he was bound with chains and shackles,</b><br>The use of physical restraints suggests attempts by others to control the man's violent behavior, common in ancient practices for dealing with the mentally ill or possessed.
