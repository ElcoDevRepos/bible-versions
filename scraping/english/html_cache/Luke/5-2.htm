This body of water is significant in Jesus' ministry, as many of His teachings and miracles occur here. The presence of two boats suggests a small fishing operation, typical of the time. Boats were essential for fishing, a primary occupation in Galilee, providing sustenance and economic stability. The number two may symbolize witness or testimony, as seen in other scriptural contexts (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).<p><b>The fishermen had left them</b><br>The fishermen leaving their boats indicates a pause in their work, possibly due to the time of day or the completion of a fishing session. This act of leaving their boats can symbolize a readiness to receive something new, a theme that resonates with the call to discipleship. In the broader biblical narrative, leaving one's occupation or possessions often precedes a significant encounter with God (e.g., Elisha in <a href="/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19-21</a>).<p><b>and were washing their nets.</b><br>Washing nets was a routine task for fishermen, necessary to maintain the equipment and prepare for the next fishing expedition. This detail highlights the diligence and care required in their trade. Spiritually, washing can symbolize purification and preparation, echoing themes of repentance and readiness for God's work. The act of washing nets may also foreshadow the cleansing and renewal that Jesus brings, as seen in His later teachings and miracles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Luke, who is about to call His first disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/fishermen.htm">Fishermen</a></b><br>These are the individuals who were working by the lake, specifically Simon Peter, James, and John, who would soon become Jesus' disciples.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/boats.htm">Boats</a></b><br>Two boats are mentioned, which belong to the fishermen.
