The term "fools" in biblical context often refers to those who are spiritually blind or lack understanding of God's ways. This echoes the wisdom literature, such as Proverbs, where a fool is someone who rejects wisdom and instruction. Jesus is highlighting the Pharisees' focus on external rituals and appearances while neglecting the inner spiritual realities. This rebuke is consistent with His other teachings where He emphasizes the importance of the heart over mere outward compliance (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>).<p><b>Did not the One who made the outside</b><br>Here, Jesus refers to God as the Creator of all things, both visible and invisible. This statement underscores the belief in God's sovereignty and His role as the Creator of the universe. The Pharisees were meticulous about ceremonial cleanliness, focusing on the external aspects of the law. Jesus reminds them that God, who created the physical body, is also concerned with the spiritual state of a person. This aligns with <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>, where God is described as the Creator of mankind, emphasizing His authority over both the physical and spiritual realms.<p><b>make the inside as well?</b><br>This phrase points to the holistic nature of God's creation. Jesus is emphasizing that God is equally concerned with the inner life of a person&#8212;their thoughts, intentions, and spiritual condition. The Pharisees' neglect of the inner life is a central issue here. This teaching is consistent with the biblical theme that God desires truth in the inward being (<a href="/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>) and that true worship is a matter of the heart (<a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23-24</a>).

By calling them &#8220;fools,&#8221; He exposes the emptiness of a religion that prizes appearances over genuine devotion.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently links &#8220;foolishness&#8221; with a refusal to heed God&#8217;s truth. <a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a> says, &#8220;The fool says in his heart, &#8216;There is no God.&#8217;&#8221; The Pharisees&#8217; behavior denied God&#8217;s character even while their lips professed reverence.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/matthew/23-17.htm">Matthew 23:17</a> Jesus likewise says, &#8220;You blind fools!&#8221; showing that outward religiosity can actually blind a person to spiritual reality. <a href="/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a> echoes this when Paul asks, &#8220;Who has bewitched you?&#8221;<p>&#8226; Calling them fools is not mere name-calling; it is a loving but firm wake-up call meant to jolt hardened hearts toward repentance (<a href="/proverbs/27-5.htm">Proverbs 27:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Did not the One who made the outside</b><p>&#8226; Jesus reminds His listeners that God is the Creator of the physical body. <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a> declares, &#8220;So God created man in His own image.&#8221; Since He fashioned the exterior, He knows every detail of our actions and rituals.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-14</a> praises God for knitting us together in the womb&#8212;our organs, skin, features, and all. By referencing the &#8220;outside,&#8221; Jesus affirms the goodness of the body; He is not condemning physical cleanliness, only the hypocrisy that elevates it over heart purity.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a> notes, &#8220;Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.&#8221; The One who &#8220;made the outside&#8221; does not stop His evaluation at the surface.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a> warns of people who draw near with their lips while their hearts are far away&#8212;underscoring that God cares for what is beneath the surface behaviors.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>make the inside as well?</b><p>&#8226; If God created the external, He equally fashioned the internal&#8212;our minds, motives, and affections. <a href="/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a> states, &#8220;Surely You desire truth in the inmost being,&#8221; and verse 10 pleads, &#8220;Create in me a clean heart, O God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus calls for congruence between inner life and outward practice. In <a href="/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a> He says, &#8220;You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence&#8230; First clean the inside&#8230; so that the outside may also become clean.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a> promises, &#8220;I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you.&#8221; That transforming work targets the inside first, then radiates outward.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12-13</a> reminds us that no thought or attitude is hidden from His sight. The Creator searches the heart, weighs motives, and delights in integrity (<a href="/proverbs/21-2.htm">Proverbs 21:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Therefore, true obedience flows from an inside made new by God&#8217;s grace, producing visible fruit such as mercy, justice, and love (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/11-40.htm">Luke 11:40</a> confronts any tendency to polish appearances while neglecting the heart.
