The resurrection is a central tenet of Christian eschatology, affirming life after death and the eventual restoration of all things. This belief is rooted in Old Testament scriptures such as <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a> and is further developed in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>.<p><b>whose wife will she be?</b><br>The question posed by the Sadducees is intended to challenge the concept of resurrection by presenting a hypothetical scenario based on the Levirate marriage law found in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-6</a>. This law required a man to marry his deceased brother's widow to produce offspring in the brother's name. The Sadducees use this to create a dilemma, questioning the logistics of marital relationships in the afterlife, which they do not believe in.<p><b>For all seven were married to her.&#8221;</b><br>This refers to the seven brothers who, according to the hypothetical scenario, each married the same woman in succession after each brother died. The Sadducees' question is designed to ridicule the idea of resurrection by suggesting an absurd situation. However, Jesus' response, which follows this verse, emphasizes that earthly institutions like marriage do not apply in the same way in the resurrection, pointing to a transformed existence beyond human understanding. This highlights the difference between temporal earthly life and eternal life, as also seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/22-30.htm">Matthew 22:30</a> and <a href="/mark/12-25.htm">Mark 12:25</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, responding to a question posed by the Sadducees.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sadducees.htm">Sadducees</a></b><br>- A Jewish sect known for their denial of the resurrection, who challenge Jesus with a hypothetical scenario.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>- A hypothetical figure in the Sadducees' question, who was married to seven brothers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seven_brothers.htm">The Seven Brothers</a></b><br>- Part of the Sadducees' scenario, each married to the woman in succession after the previous brother's death.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resurrection.htm">The Resurrection</a></b><br>- The event in question, which the Sadducees are skeptical about and use to challenge Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_resurrection.htm">Understanding the Resurrection</a></b><br>Jesus' response to the Sadducees emphasizes the reality and nature of the resurrection, which is different from earthly life.

They do not believe in the resurrection (<a href="/acts/23-8.htm">Acts 23:8</a>), so their opening words &#8220;So then&#8221; are meant to corner Him.<p>&#8226; Their logic mimics <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5&#8211;6</a> on levirate marriage, implying that Scripture itself disproves bodily resurrection&#8212;an attempt to pit Moses against future hope.<p>&#8226; By beginning with &#8220;So then,&#8221; they treat the topic as settled. Jesus will show that their premise is flawed, much like He does with other challengers in <a href="/luke/20-20.htm">Luke 20:20&#8211;26</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the resurrection</b><p>&#8226; The phrase points to a literal, future event when the dead are raised, affirmed by Jesus in <a href="/john/5-28.htm">John 5:28&#8211;29</a> and by Paul in <a href="/acts/24-15.htm">Acts 24:15</a>.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently presents resurrection as physical and transformative (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-42.htm">1 Corinthians 15:42&#8211;44</a>), not a mere continuation of earthly existence.<p>&#8226; Jesus clarifies in the next verses that those who &#8220;are considered worthy to attain to that age&#8221; neither marry nor are given in marriage (<a href="/luke/20-35.htm">Luke 20:35</a>), highlighting that resurrection life is different in kind, not just degree.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whose wife will she be?</b><p>&#8226; The Sadducees assume that earthly social structures must persist unchanged. Yet <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a> reminds us all things were created through and for Christ; He has authority to define resurrected life.<p>&#8226; Their question exposes a misunderstanding of both Scripture and divine power, as Jesus states in the parallel account: &#8220;You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/22-29.htm">Matthew 22:29</a>).<p>&#8226; By focusing on legal technicalities, they miss the relational reality that God is &#8220;not the God of the dead, but of the living&#8221; (<a href="/luke/20-38.htm">Luke 20:38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for all seven were married to her.</b><p>&#8226; The piling up of seven husbands is designed to make resurrection sound absurd, yet it unintentionally underscores the temporary nature of earthly institutions compared with eternal life (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-18.htm">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>).<p>&#8226; In Scripture, the number seven often conveys completeness (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2&#8211;3</a>). Even a &#8220;complete&#8221; earthly scenario cannot override God&#8217;s promises of life after death (<a href="/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25&#8211;27</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; forthcoming answer shifts attention from human dilemmas to God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness, echoing <a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>, where the Lord identifies Himself with the patriarchs who are alive to Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/20-33.htm">Luke 20:33</a> records a calculated question meant to discredit belief in bodily resurrection. By challenging Jesus with an extreme version of levirate marriage, the Sadducees reveal their limited view of both Scripture and God&#8217;s power. Jesus responds by affirming that resurrection life transcends current marital structures, demonstrating that God&#8217;s promises outlast earthly arrangements. The verse thus highlights the certainty of resurrection and the transformation awaiting those who belong to the living God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/20-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So then,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
