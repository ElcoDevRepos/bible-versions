It acknowledges the sovereignty and faithfulness of God, who is the covenant God of Israel. The title "God of Israel" emphasizes the special relationship between God and the nation of Israel, as seen throughout the Old Testament. This phrase connects to the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>) and the Davidic covenant (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>), highlighting God's ongoing commitment to His people.<p><b>because He has visited</b><br>The term "visited" in this context refers to God's intervention in human history. It implies a divine action where God comes to aid or deliver His people. This visitation is reminiscent of God's deliverance of Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a>) and His promise to visit His people in times of need. In the New Testament, this visitation is ultimately fulfilled in the incarnation of Jesus Christ, who is God in the flesh coming to dwell among humanity (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>and redeemed His people</b><br>Redemption in biblical terms involves deliverance from bondage or slavery, often through the payment of a price. In the Old Testament, God redeemed Israel from slavery in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). In the New Testament, this redemption is understood as deliverance from sin and death through the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>). The concept of redemption is central to the Christian faith, as it signifies the restoration of the relationship between God and humanity. This phrase also connects to the prophetic hope of a Messiah who would redeem Israel, as foretold in passages like <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>The father of John the Baptist, a priest who prophesied these words after regaining his speech.

Its occurrence here is noticeable as showing how large an element the thought of deliverance through a ransom was in all the Messianic expectations of the time. (Comp. <a href="/luke/2-38.htm" title="And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise to the Lord, and spoke of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.">Luke 2:38</a>.) The past tense (in the Greek the aorist) is used by Zacharias as, in the joy of prophetic foresight, seeing the end of what had been begun. The next verse shows that he looked for this redemption as coming not through the child that had been born to him, but through the Son, as yet unborn, of Mary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 68, 69.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath visited and redeemed,... and hath raised up.</span> The tenses of the verbs used in these expressions show that in Zacharias's mind, when he uttered the words of his hymn, the Incarnation, and the glorious deliverance commenced in that stupendous act of mercy, belonged to the past. He hath visited; that is, after some four hundred years of silence and absence, the Holy One of Israel had again come to his people. About four centuries had passed since the voice of Malachi, the last of the prophets, had been heard. <span class="cmt_word">An horn of salvation</span>. A metaphor not unknown in classical writings (see Ovid, 'Art. Am.,' 1:239; Her., 'Od.,' 3. 21. 18), and a much-used figure in Hebrew literature (see, among other passages, <a href="/ezekiel/29-2.htm">Ezekiel 29:2</a>l; <a href="/lamentations/2-3.htm">Lamentations 2:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-17.htm">Psalm 132:17</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a>). The reference is not to the horns of the altar, on which criminals seeking sanctuary used to lay hold; nor to the horns with which warriors used to adorn their helmets; but to the horns of a bull - in which the chief power of this animal resides. This was a figure especially familiar among an agricultural folk like the Israelites. "A rabbinic writer says that there are ten horns - those of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, the horn of the Law, of the priesthood, of the temple, and of Israel, and some add of the Messiah. They were all placed on the heads of the Israelites till they sinned, and then they were cut off' and given to the Gentiles" (Schottgen, 'Hor. Hebr.,' quoted by Dr. Farrar). <span class="cmt_word">In the house of his servant David</span>.
