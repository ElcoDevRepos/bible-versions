The concept of mercy is central to the biblical narrative, emphasizing God's willingness to forgive and bless His people despite their shortcomings. This mercy is a fulfillment of promises made to the forefathers, reflecting God's unchanging nature. In the broader biblical context, mercy is a key attribute of God, as seen in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, where God describes Himself as "merciful and gracious." The mercy shown to the fathers is also a precursor to the ultimate act of mercy through Jesus Christ, who embodies God's grace and forgiveness.<p><b>and to remember His holy covenant</b><br>The covenant referred to here is likely the Abrahamic Covenant, which is foundational to the relationship between God and Israel. This covenant, found in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a> and reiterated in <a href="/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15 and 17</a>, includes promises of land, descendants, and blessing. The term "holy" underscores the sacred and unbreakable nature of this agreement, set apart by God Himself. Remembering the covenant implies God's active engagement in fulfilling His promises, despite the passage of time. This remembrance is not merely a mental recall but an active commitment to bring about what was promised. The fulfillment of this covenant is seen in the coming of Jesus, who is the ultimate blessing to all nations, as foretold in <a href="/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>. The New Testament further connects this covenant to the new covenant in Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>, where Jesus is the mediator of a better covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>The father of John the Baptist, who prophesies this verse.

Just as <a href="/psalms/103-17.htm">Psalm 103:17</a> declares, &#8220;the loving devotion of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting,&#8221; that same steadfast love is now breaking into history with the arrival of the Messiah.<p>&#8226; Mercy here is not abstract sentiment; it is God&#8217;s active, covenant-keeping compassion. Consider how <a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a> says, &#8220;God heard their groaning, and He remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&#8221; Luke connects that same merciful action to the coming of Christ.<p>&#8226; By speaking of &#8220;our fathers,&#8221; Zechariah reminds every Israelite&#8212;and every believer today&#8212;that God never loses track of His promises. <a href="/micah/7-20.htm">Micah 7:20</a> echoes, &#8220;You will show faithfulness to Jacob and loving devotion to Abraham, as You swore to our fathers in days long ago.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The birth of Jesus is therefore presented as living proof that God&#8217;s mercy is more than a warm feeling; it is history-shaping faithfulness toward people who often faltered but were loved nonetheless.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and to remember His holy covenant</b><p>&#8220;and to remember His holy covenant&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-72.htm">Luke 1:72</a>b)<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s &#8220;remembering&#8221; is not recalling something forgotten; it is moving to fulfill what He swore. <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a> records the core of that covenant: &#8220;I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you&#8230; to be your God.&#8221; Luke shows that God is now acting decisively on that pledge.<p>&#8226; The covenant is called &#8220;holy&#8221; because it flows from God&#8217;s own holy character&#8212;utterly reliable, set apart from human fickleness. <a href="/psalms/111-5.htm">Psalm 111:5</a> says, &#8220;He remembers His covenant forever,&#8221; underscoring that His promises are unbreakable.<p>&#8226; The coming of Christ fulfills the layers of the covenant:<p>&#8211; Land and nation promises realized in Israel&#8217;s history (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>).<p>&#8211; Kingship promises pointing to the eternal throne of David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>; <a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<p>&#8211; Universal blessing promised through Abraham&#8217;s seed (<a href="/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<p>All converge in Jesus, who embodies the covenant&#8217;s goal: bringing people into right relationship with God.<p>&#8226; By calling attention to God&#8217;s covenant memory, Zechariah reassures the faithful that every divine promise&#8212;past, present, future&#8212;stands firm. <a href="/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17-18</a> celebrates this same certainty: &#8220;God wanted to make the unchanging nature of His purpose very clear&#8230; so that by two unchangeable things&#8230; we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/1-72.htm">Luke 1:72</a> celebrates God&#8217;s unwavering faithfulness.

In "performing mercy," we find an allusion to John or Jochanan (= "The Lord be merciful"); in "remembering His holy covenant," to the name Zacharias (= "Whom Jehovah remembers"); in the "oath" of <a href="/luke/1-73.htm" title="The oath which he swore to our father Abraham,">Luke 1:73</a>, to that of Elizabeth or Elisheba (= "The oath of my God").
