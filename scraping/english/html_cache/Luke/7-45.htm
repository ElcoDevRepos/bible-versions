It was a sign of respect and hospitality. The absence of this gesture from Simon the Pharisee, who was hosting Jesus, indicates a lack of honor and recognition of Jesus' status. This omission contrasts with the woman's actions, highlighting her deep reverence and love for Jesus. The greeting kiss is also seen in other biblical passages, such as when Judas betrays Jesus with a kiss (<a href="/matthew/26-49.htm">Matthew 26:49</a>), underscoring the significance of this gesture in relationships and social interactions.<p><b>but she has not stopped kissing My feet since I arrived</b><br>The woman's continuous kissing of Jesus' feet is an extraordinary act of humility and devotion. In biblical times, feet were considered the dirtiest part of the body due to the dusty roads and open sandals. Her actions demonstrate a profound acknowledgment of Jesus' authority and her own repentance and gratitude. This act of worship parallels other instances in the Gospels where individuals show deep reverence for Jesus, such as Mary of Bethany anointing Jesus' feet with perfume (<a href="/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a>). The woman's actions fulfill the prophetic imagery of <a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>, which speaks of the beauty of feet that bring good news, symbolizing her recognition of Jesus as the bearer of salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is at a Pharisee's house for a meal.

Honor owed to the Messiah was withheld, revealing unbelief.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but she has not stopped kissing My feet</b><p>&#8226; The woman, widely known as a sinner, does what Simon refused to do, but with far greater intensity. Her kisses land not on Jesus&#8217; cheek but on His feet, the place of deepest humility (echoed later in <a href="/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a> when Mary wipes His feet with her hair).<p>&#8226; Her continual action (&#8220;has not stopped&#8221;) shows an overflowing, grateful love springing from forgiven sin (<a href="/luke/7-47.htm">Luke 7:47</a>).<p>&#8226; This contrast teaches that true repentance produces visible fruit; love for Christ cannot stay hidden (see <a href="/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; While Simon debates worthiness, the woman demonstrates it: honoring the Lord with affection, submission, and persistence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>since I arrived</b><p>&#8226; From the moment Jesus crossed Simon&#8217;s threshold, two responses formed side by side: cold formality versus warm devotion.<p>&#8226; The timing underscores how quickly genuine faith acts. The woman seized the opportunity without delay&#8212;much like the healed leper who &#8220;returned, glorifying God with a loud voice&#8221; (<a href="/luke/17-15.htm">Luke 17:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus notices every neglected courtesy and every offered act of worship. Nothing escapes His gaze (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also hints at the coming judgment: there is a window to honor Christ, and it closes when He moves on.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/7-45.htm">Luke 7:45</a> contrasts the icy indifference of a self-righteous host with the fervent affection of a forgiven sinner. The withheld kiss unmasks a heart untouched by grace; the unceasing kisses reveal a soul set free. Scripture invites us to stand with the woman&#8212;lavishing honor on Jesus now, without hesitation, because those who are forgiven much love much, and their love is never unnoticed by the Savior.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(45) <span class= "bld">Thou gavest me no kiss.</span>--This also, as we see in the case of Judas (see Note on <a href="/matthew/26-49.htm" title="And immediately he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.">Matthew 26:49</a>), was a customary mark of respect to one who claimed the character of a Rabbi.
