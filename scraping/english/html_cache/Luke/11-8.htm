In the Gospels, Jesus often uses "I tell you" to emphasize the importance and truth of His teachings. It reflects His role as a teacher and prophet, similar to the Old Testament prophets who spoke with divine authority.<p><b>even though he will not get up to provide for him because of his friendship</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the cultural context of hospitality in the ancient Near East, where providing for a guest was a significant social obligation. The reluctance of the friend to get up despite their relationship underscores the human tendency to prioritize personal comfort over social duties. It also sets the stage for the lesson on persistence in prayer.<p><b>yet because of the man&#8217;s persistence</b><br>Persistence is a key theme in this passage, illustrating the importance of perseverance in prayer. The Greek word used here can also be translated as "shamelessness" or "boldness," suggesting a tenacity that refuses to give up. This reflects the biblical principle found in other scriptures, such as the parable of the persistent widow in <a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18:1-8</a>, where persistence in seeking justice is rewarded.<p><b>he will get up and give him as much as he needs</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the eventual response to persistence. It suggests that God, unlike the reluctant friend, is willing to provide for His children. The provision of "as much as he needs" aligns with the biblical promise that God will supply all our needs according to His riches in glory (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>). It also reflects the abundant nature of God's grace and provision, as seen in the feeding of the 5,000 (<a href="/john/6.htm">John 6:1-14</a>), where Jesus provides more than enough for the crowd.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples about prayer and persistence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/friend.htm">Friend</a></b><br>In the parable, the friend represents someone who is approached for help at an inconvenient time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbor.htm">Neighbor</a></b><br>The neighbor is the one who is being asked for bread, symbolizing God in the context of prayer.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/house.htm">House</a></b><br>The setting of the parable, representing a place of rest and security.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/midnight.htm">Midnight</a></b><br>The time of the request, indicating an unexpected and inconvenient moment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_persistence.htm">The Power of Persistence</a></b><br>Persistence in prayer is crucial. Just as the friend in the parable continues to knock, we must continue to bring our requests to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_readiness_to_respond.htm">God's Readiness to Respond</a></b><br>The parable illustrates that God is more willing to respond to our needs than the neighbor in the account. Our persistence is not about changing God's mind but aligning our hearts with His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/boldness_in_prayer.htm">Boldness in Prayer</a></b><br>The Greek word for "persistence" (anaideia) can also mean "shamelessness" or "boldness." We are encouraged to approach God with confidence and boldness in our requests.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>The timing of the request (midnight) teaches us that God's timing may not align with ours, but His response is always timely and perfect.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_support.htm">Community and Support</a></b><br>The parable underscores the importance of community and supporting one another, as the friend seeks help for another.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_11_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 11:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_11_8_Why_persist_in_prayer.htm">How does Luke 11:8 illustrate the importance of persistence in prayer?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_persistence_affect_God_s_response.htm">What does "because of his persistence" teach about God's response to our prayers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Luke_11_8_to_daily_prayer.htm">How can we apply the lesson of Luke 11:8 in daily prayer life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Luke_11_8_to_James_1_12_on_faith.htm">Connect Luke 11:8 with another Bible verse emphasizing perseverance in faith.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_this_verse_inspire_bold_faith.htm">How does this verse encourage us to approach God with boldness and confidence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Lesson_of_persistence_in_Luke_11_8.htm">What does Luke 11:8 teach about persistence in prayer?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Luke_11_8_God_s_responsiveness.htm">How does Luke 11:8 challenge our understanding of God's responsiveness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_emphasize_persistence_in_Luke_11_8.htm">Why is persistence emphasized in Luke 11:8 over immediate answers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_11.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'importunity'_mean_biblically.htm">What does "importunity" mean in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_bible's_view_on_tribalism.htm">What does 'importunity' mean in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_doesn't_god_answer_my_prayers.htm">Why doesn't God answer my prayers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_paul's_and_jesus'_views.htm">How do we reconcile Paul's instructions in 1 Corinthians 5:9-11 about disassociating with sinners with Jesus' example of befriending them?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Luke 11:8 Mean</div><b>I tell you</b><p>&#8226; Jesus speaks with divine authority, underscoring that what follows is absolutely reliable (cf. <a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>; <a href="/john/3-11.htm">John 3:11</a>).<p>&#8226; His words never fail, so the principle He is about to state is anchored in the unchanging character of God (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>even though he will not get up to provide for him because of his friendship</b><p>&#8226; The friend inside is reluctant, revealing normal human limits: fatigue, inconvenience, and self-interest (<a href="/proverbs/24-10.htm">Proverbs 24:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Friendship alone does not always overcome those limits; this highlights the contrast with God, who neither slumbers nor grows weary (<a href="/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3-4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>).<p>&#8226; The line reminds readers that human relationships, however sincere, still fall short of God&#8217;s perfect faithfulness (<a href="/psalms/118-8.htm">Psalm 118:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>yet because of the man&#8217;s persistence</b><p>&#8226; Persistence (&#8220;shameless boldness,&#8221; v. 8) is the turning point.
