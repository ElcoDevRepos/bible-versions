In the context of <a href="/luke/19.htm">Luke 19</a>, Jesus is entering Jerusalem, an event known as the Triumphal Entry. His words are directed towards the city, reflecting His deep emotional connection and sorrow for its future.<p><b>&#8220;If only you had known on this day</b><br>The phrase "on this day" emphasizes the specific moment in time, which is significant in biblical prophecy. This day refers to Jesus' entry into Jerusalem, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a> about the coming of the King. The people of Jerusalem were expected to recognize the significance of this event, as it was foretold in their Scriptures.<p><b>what would bring you peace!</b><br>Peace here refers to more than just the absence of conflict; it signifies spiritual peace and reconciliation with God. Jesus is the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), and His coming was meant to bring salvation and peace to Israel. However, the people were looking for a political savior rather than a spiritual one, missing the true peace Jesus offered.<p><b>But now it is hidden from your eyes.</b><br>This phrase indicates a judicial hardening, where the truth is obscured due to the people's unbelief and rejection of Jesus. It echoes themes found in <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where the people's inability to perceive God's message leads to judgment. The hidden nature of this peace signifies the consequences of rejecting Jesus as the Messiah, leading to the eventual destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is lamenting over Jerusalem.
