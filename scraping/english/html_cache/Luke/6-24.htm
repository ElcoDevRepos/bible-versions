In the context of Jesus' teachings, it serves as a warning to those who place their trust in material wealth rather than in God. The rich, in this context, are those who prioritize earthly possessions over spiritual riches. This echoes the teachings found in the parable of the rich fool (<a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>) and the story of the rich young ruler (<a href="/luke/18-18.htm">Luke 18:18-23</a>), where wealth becomes a barrier to entering the kingdom of God. The cultural context of the time saw wealth as a sign of God's favor, but Jesus challenges this notion by highlighting the spiritual dangers of riches.<p><b>for you have already received your comfort</b><br>This phrase suggests that the rich have found their consolation in their wealth, leaving no room for the deeper, eternal comfort that comes from God. The use of "already" implies a temporal satisfaction that is fleeting compared to the eternal rewards promised to those who seek God's kingdom first. This idea is reinforced in the parable of Lazarus and the rich man (<a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19-31</a>), where the rich man experiences comfort in life but faces torment after death, while Lazarus, who suffered in life, is comforted in Abraham's bosom. The historical context of first-century Palestine was marked by significant economic disparity, and Jesus' message would have resonated with those who were oppressed by the wealthy elite. This teaching aligns with the broader biblical theme that true comfort and security are found in God alone, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where believers are encouraged to store up treasures in heaven.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering a sermon often referred to as the "Sermon on the Plain," which parallels the "Sermon on the Mount" found in Matthew.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rich.htm">The Rich</a></b><br>The audience being addressed in this specific verse, representing those who have wealth and material comfort in this life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples_and_the_multitude.htm">The Disciples and the Multitude</a></b><br>The broader audience of Jesus' teachings, including His disciples and a large crowd gathered to hear Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_temporary_nature_of_earthly_wealth.htm">The Temporary Nature of Earthly Wealth</a></b><br>Earthly riches are fleeting and can lead to a false sense of security.

(Comp. <a href="/matthew/23-13.htm" title="But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for you neither go in yourselves, neither suffer you them that are entering to go in.">Matthew 23:13</a>; <a href="/mark/13-17.htm" title="But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!">Mark 13:17</a>; <a href="/luke/21-23.htm" title="But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath on this people.">Luke 21:23</a>.) We enter here on what is a distinct feature of the Sermon on the Plain--the woes that, as it were, balance the beatitudes. It obviously lay in St. Luke's purpose, as a physician of the soul, to treasure up and record all our Lord's warnings against the perilous temptations that wealth brings with it. The truth thus stated in its naked awfulness is reproduced afterwards in the parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus (<a href="/luke/16-19.htm" title="There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:">Luke 16:19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Ye have received your consolation.</span>--Better, simply, <span class= "ital">ye have your consolation</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> all that you understand or care for, all, therefore, that you can have. The thought appears again in the words of Abraham, "Thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things" (<a href="/luke/16-25.htm" title="But Abraham said, Son, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and you are tormented.">Luke 16:25</a>). The verb is the same as in "they have their reward," in <a href="/matthew/6-2.htm" title="Therefore when you do your alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-5.htm" title="And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:5</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.</span> These "rich" referred to here signify men of good social position. These, as a class, opposed Jesus with a bitter and unreasoning opposition. Again the same warning cry to the so-called fortunate ones of this world is re-echoed with greater force in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus. "Thou in thy lifetime," said Abraham, speaking from Paradise to the poor lost Dives, "receivedst thy good things;" and yet the very characters represented in that most awful of the parable-stories of the pitiful Lord correct any false notion which, from words like these, men may entertain respecting the condemnation of the rich and great because they are rich and great. Abraham, who speaks the grave stern words, was himself a sheik of great power and consideration, and at the same time very rich. Prophets and apostles, as well as the Son of God, never ceased to warn men of the danger of misusing wealth and power; but at the same time they always represented these dangerous gifts as gifts from God, capable of a noble use, and, if nobly used, these teachers sent by God pointed out, these gifts would bring to the men who so used them a proportional reward. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/6-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#955;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Pl&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4133.htm">Strong's 4133: </a> </span><span class="str2">However, nevertheless, but, except that, yet.
