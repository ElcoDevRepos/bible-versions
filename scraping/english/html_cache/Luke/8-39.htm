In biblical times, family and community were central to identity and social structure. The man is instructed to go back to his own people, highlighting the significance of sharing one's faith journey with those who know you best. This mirrors the call for believers to be witnesses in their immediate surroundings, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>.<p><b>and describe how much God has done for you.</b><br>The instruction to "describe" suggests a detailed recounting of personal experience. This aligns with the biblical principle of testimony, where personal stories of God's intervention serve as powerful tools for evangelism. The phrase underscores the transformative power of God's work in an individual's life, encouraging believers to share their experiences as a testament to God's grace and power. This is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/66-16.htm">Psalm 66:16</a>, where the psalmist invites others to hear what God has done for his soul.<p><b>So the man went away</b><br>The man's obedience to Jesus' command is immediate, reflecting a common theme in the Gospels where those healed or touched by Jesus respond with action. This obedience is a model for believers, demonstrating the importance of acting on Jesus' instructions without delay. The man's departure signifies a new mission and purpose, aligning with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>.<p><b>and proclaimed all over the town</b><br>The act of proclaiming "all over the town" indicates a widespread dissemination of his testimony. This suggests a boldness and eagerness to share the good news, which is a hallmark of early Christian witness. The town, likely in the region of the Decapolis, was a Gentile area, highlighting the inclusive nature of Jesus' ministry and the spread of the Gospel beyond Jewish boundaries. This foreshadows the mission to the Gentiles seen in Acts.<p><b>how much Jesus had done for him.</b><br>The shift from "God" to "Jesus" in the man's testimony underscores the recognition of Jesus' divine authority and power. This reflects the early Christian understanding of Jesus as the embodiment of God's work on earth. The man's testimony serves as a Christological statement, affirming Jesus' role in God's redemptive plan. This connection between Jesus and God is a central theme in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>, where Jesus declares, "I and the Father are one."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Luke, Jesus is the one who performs the miracle of healing the demon-possessed man and instructs him to share his testimony.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_demon-possessed_man.htm">The Demon-Possessed Man</a></b><br>Previously tormented by demons, this man is healed by Jesus.

That command underlines two truths:<p>&#8226; Transformation shows most clearly where our brokenness was once on full display (<a href="/mark/5-19.htm">Mark 5:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Home is a God-given mission field&#8212;family, friends, neighbors who need living proof that &#8220;if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<p>&#8226; God often starts evangelism with households (<a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31</a>) and circles of influence we already have.<p>By obeying, the man acknowledges Christ&#8217;s authority and trusts that God can use even yesterday&#8217;s shame as today&#8217;s platform for grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and describe</b><p>Jesus does not ask for a polished sermon, just an honest account. Testimony is storytelling, not theologizing. Scripture keeps inviting us to speak up:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Come and listen&#8230; I will declare what He has done for me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/66-16.htm">Psalm 66:16</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;We cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Always be prepared to give a defense&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>).<p>Practical pointers:<p>&#8211; Keep it personal: what Christ did in you.<p>&#8211; Keep it clear: before / how / after.<p>&#8211; Keep it Christ-centered: He, not you, is the hero.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>how much God has done for you</b><p>The spotlight is on God&#8217;s greatness, not the former demoniac&#8217;s misery. Scripture reminds us never to forget His works (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-2.htm">Psalm 103:2</a>). Notice the breadth of &#8220;how much&#8221;:<p>&#8226; Mercy that rescued (<a href="/luke/1-49.htm">Luke 1:49</a>).<p>&#8226; Power that restored (<a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Purpose that re-commissioned (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p>Rehearsing God&#8217;s deeds fuels gratitude and keeps fresh the wonder of salvation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the man went away</b><p>Instant obedience marks genuine faith.

Obedience is the hinge between command and impact.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and proclaimed all over the town</b><p>What began in one heart spreads through an entire region. Personal rescue becomes public proclamation:<p>&#8226; Jesus said His followers would be &#8220;My witnesses&#8230; to the ends of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Even when Jesus asked the cleansed leper to keep quiet, &#8220;he went out and openly proclaimed&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-45.htm">Mark 1:45</a>); the urge to share good news is irrepressible.<p>&#8226; Healthy proclamation is both verbal and visible&#8212;word and changed life testify together (<a href="/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>how much Jesus had done for him</b><p>Luke purposefully shifts from &#8220;God&#8221; in the command to &#8220;Jesus&#8221; in the obedience, affirming the deity of Christ. What God did, Jesus did&#8212;because Jesus is God (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>; <a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>).
