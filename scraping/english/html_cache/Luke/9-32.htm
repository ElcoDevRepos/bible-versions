The setting is the Mount of Transfiguration, a significant event in the New Testament. The disciples' sleepiness can be seen as a parallel to their later inability to stay awake in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-40.htm">Matthew 26:40-43</a>). This moment underscores the theme of spiritual unpreparedness and the need for vigilance in prayer and spiritual matters. The physical exhaustion of the disciples may also reflect the intensity of their ministry activities with Jesus.<p><b>but when they awoke</b><br>The awakening of the disciples signifies a transition from a state of unawareness to one of revelation and understanding. This moment can be seen as symbolic of spiritual awakening, where believers move from spiritual slumber to enlightenment. The disciples' awakening allows them to witness a profound moment of divine glory, emphasizing the importance of being spiritually alert to perceive God's work.<p><b>they saw Jesus&#8217; glory</b><br>The glory of Jesus here refers to His divine nature and majesty, which is momentarily revealed to the disciples. This event is a foretaste of the eschatological glory that will be fully revealed at the Second Coming of Christ. The transfiguration serves as a confirmation of Jesus' identity as the Son of God, echoing the declaration at His baptism (<a href="/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>). The glory seen by the disciples is reminiscent of the Shekinah glory of God that filled the tabernacle and temple in the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>).<p><b>and the two men standing with Him</b><br>The two men are identified as Moses and Elijah, representing the Law and the Prophets, respectively. Their presence signifies the fulfillment of the Old Testament in Jesus Christ. Moses and Elijah's appearance with Jesus underscores His role as the culmination of God's redemptive plan. This moment also connects to the prophecy in <a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5-6</a>, which speaks of Elijah's return before the "great and dreadful day of the LORD." The presence of these figures affirms Jesus' mission and authority, bridging the Old and New Covenants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, often seen as a leader among the Twelve.
