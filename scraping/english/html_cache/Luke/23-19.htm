His imprisonment highlights the Roman practice of detaining those who threatened public order. The name "Barabbas" means "son of the father," which is ironic given the choice between him and Jesus, the true Son of the Father. This moment underscores the injustice of the situation, as an innocent man, Jesus, is condemned while a guilty man is set free.<p><b>for an insurrection in the city</b><br>The insurrection refers to a rebellion against Roman authority, a common occurrence in Judea due to the oppressive Roman rule. This context is crucial as it shows the political tension of the time. The city mentioned is likely Jerusalem, the center of Jewish religious life and a hotbed for political unrest. Barabbas's involvement in such an insurrection would have made him a significant threat to Roman peace, yet the crowd chooses him over Jesus, who preached peace and love.<p><b>and for murder</b><br>Barabbas's crime of murder further emphasizes the gravity of his offenses. Murder, according to Jewish law, is a capital crime, deserving of death. This detail highlights the stark contrast between Barabbas and Jesus, who gave life and healed others. The choice to release Barabbas instead of Jesus illustrates the moral blindness and corruption of the leaders and the crowd, fulfilling the prophecy of the suffering servant who would be rejected by His own people (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<p><b>(Barabbas had been imprisoned for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.)</b><br>This entire verse serves as a powerful illustration of substitutionary atonement, a key theological concept where Jesus takes the place of sinners. Barabbas's release symbolizes humanity's release from the bondage of sin through Christ's sacrifice. The choice of Barabbas over Jesus also reflects the broader rejection of Jesus by the world, as foretold in <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>, where He came to His own, but His own did not receive Him. This moment is a pivotal point in the Passion narrative, setting the stage for the crucifixion and the ultimate demonstration of God's love and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/barabbas.htm">Barabbas</a></b><br>A prisoner who was involved in an insurrection and committed murder.
