In biblical terms, the "spirit" often refers to the life force or breath given by God (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>). The return of the spirit signifies divine intervention, affirming Jesus' authority over life and death. This miracle is a testament to Jesus' power, similar to the raising of Lazarus (<a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43-44</a>) and the widow's son at Nain (<a href="/luke/7-14.htm">Luke 7:14-15</a>). It fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah bringing life (<a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>).<p><b>and at once she got up</b><br>The immediacy of her action underscores the completeness of the miracle. There is no period of recovery or weakness, which highlights the totality of Jesus' healing power. This immediate response is consistent with other miracles performed by Jesus, where healing is instantaneous (<a href="/mark/5-29.htm">Mark 5:29</a>, <a href="/john/5-9.htm">John 5:9</a>). It also reflects the cultural understanding of resurrection, where the restored individual is fully functional, as seen in Elijah and Elisha's miracles (<a href="/1_kings/17-22.htm">1 Kings 17:22</a>, <a href="/2_kings/4-35.htm">2 Kings 4:35</a>).<p><b>And He directed that she be given something to eat</b><br>This instruction serves multiple purposes. Practically, it demonstrates Jesus' care for the girl's physical needs, ensuring her well-being. Culturally, eating is a sign of life and normalcy, confirming the reality of her resurrection. It also serves as a proof to the witnesses that she is truly alive and not a ghost, as spirits do not eat (<a href="/luke/24-41.htm">Luke 24:41-43</a>). This act parallels Jesus' post-resurrection appearances, where He eats with His disciples to prove His physical resurrection (<a href="/luke/24-42.htm">Luke 24:42-43</a>, <a href="/john/21-12.htm">John 21:12-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is performing a miracle by raising a young girl from the dead.

Resurrection power is not theoretical; it produces visible change.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And He directed that she be given something to eat</b><p>- A practical instruction proves the reality of the miracle. Ghosts don&#8217;t eat (<a href="/luke/24-41.htm">Luke 24:41-43</a>). Jesus offers an ordinary action to validate an extraordinary event.<p>- The tenderness of Christ shines: He cares not only about triumphant moments but about a hungry twelve-year-old&#8217;s next meal (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13-14</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p>- Providing food also engages the parents, inviting them to act in faith and resume normal family life&#8212;similar to Jesus involving servants at Cana (<a href="/john/2-7.htm">John 2:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/8-55.htm">Luke 8:55</a> shows Jesus literally restoring life, instantly reviving the girl, and thoughtfully attending to her needs.
