The Sanhedrin was composed of chief priests, scribes, and elders, who were responsible for religious and legal matters. This rhetorical question indicates their belief that they have sufficient evidence to convict Jesus. The context is the trial where Jesus is accused of blasphemy, a serious charge under Jewish law, which could warrant the death penalty. The question reflects their determination to find Jesus guilty, regardless of the fairness of the trial. This moment fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, where the Messiah is described as being oppressed and afflicted, yet not opening His mouth in defense.<p><b>&#8220;they declared.&#8221;</b><br>The use of "they declared" shows a collective decision by the Sanhedrin, emphasizing their unity in the decision to condemn Jesus. This reflects the cultural and religious authority they held over the Jewish people. The Sanhedrin's declaration is significant because it marks the transition from a religious trial to a political one, as they would soon bring Jesus before Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, to seek a death sentence. This collective declaration also highlights the fulfillment of <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, where the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and His Anointed.<p><b>&#8220;We have heard it for ourselves&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the directness of the evidence they believe they have obtained. In Jewish law, the testimony of two or three witnesses was required to establish a matter (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). Here, the Sanhedrin claims to have heard Jesus' supposed blasphemy directly, thus considering their requirement for witnesses fulfilled. This reflects the cultural and legal practices of the time, where oral testimony was crucial in legal proceedings. The phrase also highlights the irony of their spiritual blindness, as they fail to recognize Jesus as the Messiah despite hearing His words.<p><b>&#8220;from His own lips.&#8221;</b><br>The emphasis on hearing from Jesus' own lips points to the gravity of His confession in their eyes. Jesus had affirmed His identity as the Son of God, which they interpreted as blasphemy. This moment is pivotal in the Passion narrative, as it directly leads to His crucifixion. Theologically, this phrase underscores the fulfillment of Jesus' mission, as He willingly affirms His identity, knowing it would lead to His death. It also connects to <a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>, where Jesus states, "I and the Father are one," further affirming His divine nature. This declaration from Jesus' own lips is a testament to His role as the sacrificial Lamb, fulfilling the typology of the Passover lamb in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is being interrogated by the religious leaders.

In that moment they believe their case is closed.<p>&#8226; By their own law, multiple witnesses were normally required (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>), yet they brush that aside because Christ&#8217;s words&#8212;spoken in their hearing&#8212;seem to give them all the evidence they want.<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/26-65.htm">Matthew 26:65</a> and <a href="/mark/14-63.htm">Mark 14:63</a> record the high priest tearing his robes and asking the same rhetorical question, exposing their eagerness to condemn rather than investigate.<p>&#8226; They had earlier sought false testimony (<a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59</a>), so when Jesus openly affirms His identity, their feigned concern for due process evaporates.<p>&#8226; Ironically, the One who is &#8220;the Way and the Truth&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>) is condemned on the basis of His own truthful confession.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they declared</b><p>Luke stresses that this is a united verdict. The Sanhedrin speaks as one body; no dissenting voice is recorded.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a> foretold that &#8220;the kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the LORD and against His Anointed.&#8221; Here that prophecy materializes as the council collectively pronounces guilt.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27</a> later confirms the joint responsibility of &#8220;Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel,&#8221; underscoring a shared rejection of Christ.<p>&#8226; Their declaration highlights the contrast between human judgment and God&#8217;s verdict. While they believe they are preserving orthodoxy, <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a> shows they are actually fulfilling the role of those who despise and reject the Servant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We have heard it for ourselves from His own lips</b><p>The council emphasizes first-hand hearing&#8212;no rumor, no second-hand report.<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; clear self-identification echoes earlier statements such as <a href="/john/10-33.htm">John 10:33</a>, where He is accused of making Himself equal with God.<p>&#8226; The leaders interpret His claim as blasphemy (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>), yet in reality they are hearing the very truth that could save them (<a href="/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58&#8211;59</a>).<p>&#8226; Their insistence that they &#8220;have heard&#8221; removes any excuse; the light was shining in front of them, and they knowingly chose darkness (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, the phrase reminds us that Scripture gives us direct, reliable testimony of who Jesus is&#8212;no additional evidence is needed to trust Him (<a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/22-71.htm">Luke 22:71</a> captures the moment the Sanhedrin believes it has clinched its case against Jesus. Convinced that His own words are sufficient for a verdict of blasphemy, they unanimously declare no further testimony necessary. Yet the very confession they condemn is the truth that secures our salvation. The verse exposes the blindness of human judgment, contrasts it with the reliability of Christ&#8217;s self-revelation, and sets the stage for the cross where God&#8217;s true verdict&#8212;our redemption through His Son&#8212;will be publicly displayed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/22-71.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Why</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Ti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
