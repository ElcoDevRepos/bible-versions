In the context of <a href="/luke/11.htm">Luke 11</a>, Jesus is addressing the Pharisees and experts in the law, condemning their hypocrisy and the burdens they place on others. The "result" refers to the judgment that will come upon them due to their rejection of God's messengers and their failure to recognize Jesus as the Messiah.<p><b>this generation</b><br>"Generation" here refers to the people living at the time of Jesus, particularly the religious leaders who opposed Him. In biblical terms, a generation can also imply a group characterized by certain behaviors or attitudes. This generation is marked by unbelief and resistance to God's revelation through Jesus Christ.<p><b>will be charged with the blood of all the prophets</b><br>The phrase "charged with the blood" suggests accountability and judgment. The prophets were God's messengers, often persecuted and killed for delivering His messages. Jesus is highlighting the continuity of rejection and violence against God's prophets, culminating in the rejection of Jesus Himself, the ultimate Prophet. This echoes the Old Testament theme of Israel's history of persecuting prophets, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a>.<p><b>that has been shed since the foundation of the world,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the long history of violence against God's messengers, dating back to the earliest times. "Since the foundation of the world" suggests a comprehensive indictment, from Abel, the first martyr (<a href="/genesis/4-8.htm">Genesis 4:8</a>), to the prophets of the Old Testament. It underscores the persistent rebellion against God's will throughout human history.
