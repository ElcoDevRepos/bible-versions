In the preceding verses, Jesus reads from the scroll of Isaiah and declares that the prophecy is fulfilled in their hearing. This bold claim, asserting His messianic identity, challenges the expectations of His audience. The synagogue was a central place for teaching and community gatherings, making Jesus' declaration particularly impactful.<p><b>all the people in the synagogue</b><br>The synagogue in Nazareth was likely a modest structure, typical of first-century Jewish places of worship. The audience would have been familiar with Jesus, as Nazareth was His hometown. This familiarity may have contributed to their skepticism and eventual anger, as they struggled to reconcile the Jesus they knew with the claims He made.<p><b>were enraged</b><br>The anger of the people can be understood in the context of Jewish expectations of the Messiah. Many anticipated a political liberator who would free them from Roman oppression. Jesus' message, emphasizing spiritual liberation and inclusion of Gentiles, was radical and offensive to their nationalistic hopes. This reaction also foreshadows the broader rejection Jesus would face, culminating in His crucifixion. The response of the synagogue attendees is reminiscent of the rejection faced by prophets in the Old Testament, highlighting a recurring theme of resistance to God's messengers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is in the synagogue in Nazareth, His hometown, delivering a message that challenges the expectations of His audience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_in_the_synagogue.htm">The People in the Synagogue</a></b><br>These are the Jewish attendees of the synagogue in Nazareth who become enraged at Jesus' words.
