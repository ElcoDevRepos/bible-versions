As far as we know, his comment upon the widow's alms was his last word of public teaching. On their way home, while crossing the Mount of Olives, they apparently halted for a brief rest. It was then that some of his friends called attention to the glorious prospect of the temple, then lit up by the setting sun. It was, no doubt, then in all its perfect beauty, a vast glittering mass of white marble, touched here and there with gold and color. Whosoever had not gazed on it, said the old rabbis, had not seen the perfection of beauty. It is possible that the bystander's remark was suggested by the memory of the last bit of Divine teaching they had listened to. "Lord, is not the house on Zion lovely? But if only such gifts as those you have just praised with such unstinting praise had been made, never had that glorious pile been raised in honor of the Eternal King." More probable, however, the sight of the great temple, then bathed in the golden glory of the fast-setting sun, recalled some of the Master's sayings of that eventful day, notably such as, "Your house is left unto you desolate," which occurred in the famous twice-spoken apostrophe, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets!" (<a href="/matthew/23-38.htm">Matthew 23:38</a>; <a href="/luke/13-35.htm">Luke 13:35</a>). "What, Lord I will <span class="accented">that</span> house, so great, so perfect in its beauty, so loved, the joy of the whole earth, - will <span class="accented">that house</span> be left desolate and in shapeless ruins?" <span class="cmt_word">With goodly stones</span>. The enormous size of the stones and blocks of marble with which the temple of Jerusalem was built excited the surprise of Titus when the city fell. Josephus mentions ('Bell. Jud.,' v. 5) that some of the levelled blocks of marble or stone were forty cubits long and ten high. And gifts; better rendered, <span class="accented">sacred offerings</span>, such as the "golden vine," with its vast clusters, the gift of Herod - which probably suggested the discourse, "I am the true Vine" (reported in <a href="/john/15.htm">John 15</a>.) - such as crowns, shields, vessels of gold and silver, presented by princes and others who visited the holy house on Zion. The temple was rich in these votive offerings. The historian Tacitus, for instance, calls it "a temple of vast wealth" ('Hist.,' 5. 8). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/21-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">some [of the disciples]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(tin&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Genitive Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
