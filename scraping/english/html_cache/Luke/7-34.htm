Jesus, referred to as the "Son of Man," a title emphasizing His humanity and messianic role, engaged in social settings, sharing meals, which was a significant cultural practice for building relationships. This approach fulfilled prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>, where the Messiah is depicted as one who brings good news and liberation, often through personal interaction and fellowship.<p><b>and you say,</b><br>This indicates the response of the religious leaders and some in the crowd. Their reaction is one of criticism and misunderstanding, reflecting a common theme in the Gospels where Jesus' actions are often misinterpreted by those who hold rigid expectations of religious conduct. This phrase sets the stage for the accusations that follow, showing the tension between Jesus' ministry and the established religious norms.<p><b>&#8216;Look at this glutton and drunkard,</b><br>The accusation of being a "glutton and drunkard" is a distortion of Jesus' behavior. It echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/21-20.htm">Deuteronomy 21:20</a>, where a rebellious son is described similarly, suggesting that Jesus was being labeled as rebellious against traditional religious values. This reflects the cultural and religious expectations of the time, where excessive eating and drinking were frowned upon, especially for a religious teacher. The criticism is ironic, as Jesus' actions were meant to demonstrate the inclusivity and grace of God's kingdom.<p><b>a friend of tax collectors and sinners!&#8217;</b><br>This phrase underscores Jesus' mission to reach the marginalized and despised in society. Tax collectors were often viewed as traitors and sinners due to their association with the Roman occupiers and their reputation for corruption. By befriending them, Jesus demonstrated the radical nature of His message of grace and redemption. This association fulfills the prophetic vision of the Messiah as one who seeks and saves the lost, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/34-16.htm">Ezekiel 34:16</a>. It also prefigures the Great Commission, where the Gospel is to be shared with all, regardless of social status or past sins.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus (The Son of Man)</a></b><br>Central figure in this passage, referred to as "The Son of Man," a title emphasizing His humanity and messianic role.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees_and_teachers_of_the_law.htm">Pharisees and Teachers of the Law</a></b><br>Religious leaders who criticized Jesus for His associations and lifestyle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tax_collectors_and_sinners.htm">Tax Collectors and Sinners</a></b><br>Individuals marginalized by society and often despised by the religious elite, yet whom Jesus befriended.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_public.htm">The Public</a></b><br>The general populace who witnessed Jesus' actions and the criticisms against Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/galilee.htm">Galilee</a></b><br>The region where much of Jesus' ministry took place, including His interactions with diverse groups of people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_jesus'_mission.htm">Understanding Jesus' Mission</a></b><br>Jesus' association with sinners highlights His mission to seek and save the lost.
