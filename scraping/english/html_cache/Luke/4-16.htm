It was here that Jesus spent His formative years, growing up in a typical Jewish family. This phrase emphasizes Jesus' humanity and His connection to a specific community. The mention of Nazareth fulfills the prophecy that the Messiah would be called a Nazarene (<a href="/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>). The town's reputation is highlighted in <a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>, where Nathanael questions, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" This skepticism underscores the unexpected nature of Jesus' messianic role.<p><b>As was His custom, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath.</b><br>This phrase indicates Jesus' adherence to Jewish customs and laws, demonstrating His respect for the traditions and practices of His people. The synagogue was a central place for teaching, worship, and community gatherings. Jesus' regular attendance at the synagogue shows His commitment to communal worship and the study of Scripture. The Sabbath, a day of rest and worship, was instituted in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>) and was a vital aspect of Jewish life. Jesus' participation in synagogue services highlights His role as a teacher and His authority in interpreting the Scriptures.<p><b>And when He stood up to read,</b><br>In the synagogue, it was customary for a man to stand while reading from the Scriptures, signifying respect and reverence for God's Word. Jesus' action of standing to read indicates His active role in the service and His authority as a teacher. The reading of Scripture was a central part of synagogue worship, often followed by teaching or exposition. This moment foreshadows Jesus' public ministry, where He would frequently teach and interpret the Scriptures, revealing His identity and mission. The act of reading from the Scriptures also connects to the prophetic role of the Messiah, who would proclaim God's truth to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is beginning His public ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazareth.htm">Nazareth</a></b><br>A small town in Galilee where Jesus was raised.

For believers, it calls us to the same rootedness: live the faith where we are known, gather faithfully with the body, honor Scripture, and be ready to serve when God opens the scroll to us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">And he came to Nazareth.</span>--The narrative that follows, signally interesting in itself, has also the special interest of being peculiar to St. Luke. We may naturally think of it as having come to him from the same group of informants as those from whom he derived his narrative of the Infancy. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>) He may have journeyed from Caearea to Nazareth during St. Paul's imprisonment in the former city, and obtained his information on the spot. It is clear that our Lord did not begin His ministry at Nazareth. He came there when His fame was, in some measure, at least, already established.<p><span class= "bld">As his custom was.</span>--This, then, had been His wont before He entered on His work. Children were admitted to the synagogue at the age of five. At thirteen attendance was obligatory. It was open to any man of reputed knowledge and piety, with the sanction of the ruler of the synagogue, to read the lessons (one from the Law and one from the Prophets), and our Lord's previous life had doubtless gained the respect of that officer. Up to this time, it would seem, He had confined Himself to reading. Now He came to preach, after an absence possibly of some months, with the new power that had already made Him famous. The work of preaching also was open to any person of adequate culture, who had a "word of exhortation" to address to the worshippers. (Comp. <a href="/acts/13-15.htm" title="And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, You men and brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.">Acts 13:15</a>.) The constitution of the synagogue in thus admitting the teaching functions of qualified laymen, was distinctly opposed to the root-idea of sacerdotalism.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day</span>. This had been for years his practice in the little synagogue of the village where was his carpenter's shop. Children at the age of five years were admitted into the synagogue, and at thirteen attendance there was part of the legal life of the Jew. These synagogues were the regular places for religious gatherings every sabbath day, and also usually on Mondays and Tuesdays, besides on other special occasions. We hear of them after the return from the Captivity, and probably they existed long before. Some think that in <a href="/psalms/74-8.htm">Psalm 74:8</a> there is a reference to them<span class="cmt_word">. And stood up for to read</span>. The holy books were always read standing. The ruler or elder presided over and directed the synagogue service. The priest and Levite had no recognized position in the synagogue. Their functions were confined to the temple and to the duties prescribed in the Law. It was not unusual for the synagogue officials, if any stranger was present who was known to be competent, to ask him to read and to expound a passage in the Law or Prophets. Our Lord was well known in Nazareth, and of late had evidently gained a great reputation as a preacher. It was, therefore, most natural that he should be asked to take a prominent part in the sabbath services. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/4-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] came</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7974;&#955;&#952;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;lthen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2064.htm">Strong's 2064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, go. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1519.htm">Strong's 1519: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition; to or into, of place, time, or purpose; also in adverbial phrases.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Nazareth,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#925;&#945;&#950;&#945;&#961;&#940;</span> <span class="translit">(Nazara)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Or Nazaret nad-zar-et'; of uncertain derivation; Nazareth or Nazaret, a place in Palestine.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">where</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;</span> <span class="translit">(hou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3757.htm">Strong's 3757: </a> </span><span class="str2">Where, whither, when, in what place.
