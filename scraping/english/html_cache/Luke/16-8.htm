The commendation of the dishonest manager is unexpected, as it highlights the manager's shrewdness rather than his dishonesty. This reflects a cultural understanding of shrewdness as a valuable trait in ancient Near Eastern societies, where resourcefulness and cleverness were often necessary for survival. The parable challenges the listener to consider the importance of wisdom and prudence in managing resources, even when the methods are not entirely ethical.<p><b>because he had acted shrewdly.</b><br>The term "shrewdly" here implies a level of wisdom and foresight. In biblical context, shrewdness is often associated with practical wisdom, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/1-4.htm">Proverbs 1:4</a>, which speaks of giving prudence to the simple. The manager's actions, though dishonest, demonstrate an ability to navigate difficult situations effectively. This phrase encourages believers to be wise and discerning in their dealings, using their resources to secure a future, much like the manager secured his. It also serves as a reminder of the need for spiritual discernment, as seen in <a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>, where Jesus advises His disciples to be "shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves."<p><b>For the sons of this age are more shrewd</b><br>"Sons of this age" refers to those who belong to the present world system, often characterized by a focus on material wealth and temporal concerns. This phrase contrasts with the "sons of light," who are associated with spiritual insight and eternal values. The observation that the sons of this age are more shrewd suggests that worldly people often exhibit greater practical wisdom in their affairs than believers do in spiritual matters. This serves as a call for Christians to be equally diligent and wise in their spiritual pursuits.<p><b>in dealing with their own kind</b><br>This phrase highlights the idea that people of the world are adept at navigating their own systems and relationships to achieve their goals. It underscores the importance of understanding and engaging effectively with the world while maintaining one's spiritual integrity. The cultural context of the time valued community and relationships, and this insight into human behavior remains relevant for believers today, urging them to be wise in their interactions with both believers and non-believers.<p><b>than are the sons of light.</b><br>"Sons of light" is a term used to describe those who follow Christ and live according to His teachings, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8</a>, which calls believers to "walk as children of light." This phrase serves as a critique of believers who may lack the same level of shrewdness in spiritual matters as worldly people do in secular affairs. It challenges Christians to be proactive and wise in their spiritual lives, using their resources and opportunities to further God's kingdom. The contrast between the two groups emphasizes the need for believers to be as committed and strategic in their spiritual endeavors as the world is in its pursuits.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>Represents God or a figure of authority who recognizes the shrewdness of the manager.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dishonest_manager.htm">The Dishonest Manager</a></b><br>A steward who, upon facing dismissal, acts cleverly to secure his future by reducing the debts of his master's debtors.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_this_age.htm">The Sons of This Age</a></b><br>Refers to people who live according to worldly wisdom and values.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_light.htm">The Sons of Light</a></b><br>Represents believers who are expected to live according to God's wisdom and values.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_parable_setting.htm">The Parable Setting</a></b><br>Jesus uses this parable to teach His disciples about the use of worldly resources for eternal purposes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_shrewdness.htm">Understanding Shrewdness</a></b><br>The parable highlights the importance of being wise and strategic in our dealings, not for selfish gain, but for the Kingdom of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/worldly_vs._godly_wisdom.htm">Worldly vs. Godly Wisdom</a></b><br>Believers are called to discern the difference between worldly shrewdness and godly wisdom, using the latter to advance God's purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_of_resources.htm">Stewardship of Resources</a></b><br>We are stewards of the resources God has given us, and we should use them to build relationships and invest in eternal treasures.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_as_children_of_light.htm">Living as Children of Light</a></b><br>Our actions should reflect our identity as children of light, using wisdom to navigate a world that often values cunning over integrity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>The parable encourages us to focus on eternal outcomes rather than temporary gains, aligning our actions with God's eternal purposes.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_16_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 16:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_wisely_advance_God_s_kingdom.htm">How can we be "shrewd" in advancing God's kingdom, as in Luke 16:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_sons_of_this_age_in_Luke_16_8.htm">What does "sons of this age" mean in Luke 16:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_do_Luke_16_8_and_Matt_10_16_connect.htm">How does Luke 16:8 relate to Matthew 10:16 about being "shrewd"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_Luke_16_8_s_wisdom_today.htm">In what ways can we apply the wisdom of Luke 16:8 today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Balance_shrewdness_integrity_in_Luke_16_8.htm">How can we balance shrewdness with integrity, according to Luke 16:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_16_8_worldly_vs_spiritual_wisdom.htm">What does Luke 16:8 reveal about the nature of worldly wisdom versus spiritual wisdom?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Luke_16_8_Dishonest_manager_s_praise.htm">How does the commendation of the dishonest manager in Luke 16:8 challenge traditional moral values?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_use_dishonesty_in_Luke_16_8_parable.htm">Why does Jesus use a parable involving dishonesty in Luke 16:8 to convey a spiritual lesson?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_16.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_the_efca.htm">What defines the Evangelical Free Church of America?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_the_steward_secure_his_future.htm">How does the unjust steward secure his future?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_does_luke_16_1-8_praise_the_steward.htm">Why does Luke 16:1&#8211;8 seem to commend the unjust steward&#8217;s dishonest tactics, potentially endorsing unethical behavior?

He too, in the outer framework of the story, is one of the children of this world, and he admires the sharpness and quickness of the steward's action. In the interpretation of the story, we trace once more the grave, half-veiled indignation, more keenly incisive than if the veil had been withdrawn, which so often appears in this phase of our Lord's teaching. If this world were all, there would be a wisdom worthy of praise when a Church or its teachers adapted themselves to men's passions or interests at the expense of Truth.

We may note the recurrence of the phrase (with the variation of the Greek word for "children" instead of "sons") in <a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm" title="For you were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord: walk as children of light:">Ephesians 5:8</a> as another instance of the way in which the phraseology of St. Paul was influenced by that of the words of the Lord Jesus collected by his fellow-labourer. "Children of light" are those in whom light is the prevailing element of their life, and they are necessarily also children of God; for "God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all" (<a href="/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.">1John 1:5</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely.</span> This, again, is a detail which has little bearing on the main teaching. It is a graphic and sarcastic eulogy which a good-humoured man of the world would pronounce upon a brilliant and skilful, although unprincipled, action, and it completes the story as a story. It seems evident that the intentions of the steward in regard to the debtors were carried out, and that they were really indebted to him for the release of a part of their indebtedness, and that the owner of the property did not dispute the arrangement entered into by his steward when in office<span class="cmt_word">. For the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light</span>. This was a melancholy and sorrowful reflection. It seems to say, "I have been painting, indeed, from the life. See, the children of this world, men and women whose ends and aims are bounded by the horizon of this world, who only live for this life, how much more painstaking and skilful are <span class="accented">they</span> in their working for the perishable things of this world than are the children of light in their noble toiling after the things of the life to come. The former appear even more in earnest in their search after what they desire than do the latter. There is underlying the Lord's deep and sorrowful reflection here, a mournful regret over one feature that is, alas! characteristic of well-nigh all religious life - the unkindness which religious professors so often show to one another. One great division of Christianity despises, almost hates, the other; sect detests sect; a very slight difference in religious opinion bars the way to all friendship, often to even kindly feeling. With truth Godet remarks here "that the <span class="accented">children of this world</span> use every means for their own interest to strengthen the bonds which unite them to their contemporaries of the same stamp, but, on the other hand, the <span class="accented">children of light</span> neglect this natural measure of prudence; they forget to use God's goods to form bonds of love to the contemporaries who <span class="accented">might</span> one day give them a full recompense, when they themselves shall want everything, and these shall have abundance." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/16-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
