Jesus' reply shifts the focus from physical lineage and earthly relationships to spiritual obedience. This reflects a common theme in Jesus' teachings, where He often redirects attention from the temporal to the eternal (see <a href="/matthew/12-46.htm">Matthew 12:46-50</a>).<p><b>Blessed rather</b><br>The use of "blessed" here echoes the Beatitudes (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-12</a>), where Jesus describes the characteristics of those who are truly blessed in the kingdom of God. The term "blessed" implies a state of spiritual well-being and divine favor, which is not necessarily linked to earthly circumstances.<p><b>are those who hear the word of God</b><br>Hearing the word of God is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing the importance of being receptive to God's message. In the Jewish tradition, hearing is closely linked to obedience, as seen in the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>), which calls Israel to hear and obey. Jesus often used parables to illustrate the importance of truly hearing and understanding God's word (see <a href="/matthew/13-9.htm">Matthew 13:9-16</a>).<p><b>and obey it</b><br>Obedience to God's word is a central tenet of the faith, underscoring the idea that true discipleship involves action, not just passive listening. <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a> reinforces this by urging believers to be doers of the word, not merely hearers. This obedience is not about legalistic adherence to rules but a heartfelt response to God's love and grace, as seen in the life and teachings of Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to a woman in the crowd who has just praised His mother, Mary.
