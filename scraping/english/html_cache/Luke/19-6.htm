Tax collectors were often despised by their fellow Jews for collaborating with the Roman authorities and for their reputation of extortion. Zacchaeus's haste in coming down from the sycamore tree reflects his readiness to change and his recognition of Jesus' authority. This moment signifies a turning point, as Zacchaeus moves from curiosity to action, paralleling the call to immediate obedience seen in other biblical figures, such as the disciples who left their nets to follow Jesus (<a href="/matthew/4-20.htm">Matthew 4:20</a>).<p><b>and welcomed Him joyfully.</b><br>The act of welcoming Jesus joyfully highlights Zacchaeus's acceptance and faith. In the cultural context, hospitality was a significant aspect of Jewish life, and welcoming someone into one's home was a sign of respect and honor. Zacchaeus's joy contrasts with the grumbling of the crowd, who saw him as a sinner. This joy is indicative of the transformative power of Jesus' presence, as seen in other instances where individuals encounter Christ and experience profound change, such as the Samaritan woman at the well (<a href="/john/4-39.htm">John 4:39-42</a>). Zacchaeus's response also fulfills the prophetic theme of joy in salvation, as foretold in <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>, where the redeemed express joy in the Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zacchaeus.htm">Zacchaeus</a></b><br>A chief tax collector in Jericho, known for his wealth and social status.

Just as Abram &#8220;went as the Lord had told him,&#8221; Zacchaeus acts because Jesus has spoken. Faith that trusts the Lord&#8217;s word always moves from hearing to doing (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Zacchaeus</b><p>The man&#8217;s name reappears to highlight that this is an individual, not a crowd statistic.<p>&#8226; A chief tax collector, despised by society (<a href="/luke/19-2.htm">Luke 19:2</a>), yet personally sought by Christ&#8212;echoing the Lord&#8217;s pattern with Levi (<a href="/luke/5-27.htm">Luke 5:27-32</a>) and the sinful woman (<a href="/luke/7-37.htm">Luke 7:37-50</a>).<p>&#8226; His story fulfills Jesus&#8217; purpose statement: &#8220;the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost&#8221; (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s call is personal: &#8220;He calls his own sheep by name&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>).
