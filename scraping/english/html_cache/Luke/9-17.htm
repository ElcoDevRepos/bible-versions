The feeding of the five thousand is one of the few miracles recorded in all four Gospels, emphasizing its significance. In a cultural context, sharing a meal was a sign of fellowship and community. The satisfaction of the crowd points to Jesus as the Bread of Life, fulfilling spiritual hunger as well as physical needs. This event foreshadows the Last Supper and the Eucharist, where Jesus offers Himself as spiritual sustenance.<p><b>and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls</b><br>The number twelve is significant, symbolizing the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles. This indicates the abundance of God's provision and the completeness of His care for His people. The act of the disciples gathering the leftovers shows their role in Jesus' ministry, serving as stewards of His resources. It also teaches a lesson in stewardship and the importance of not wasting God's blessings.<p><b>of broken pieces that were left over</b><br>The broken pieces signify the abundance of Jesus' provision, exceeding the immediate need. This abundance reflects the overflowing grace and generosity of God. The collection of leftovers can be seen as a metaphor for the gathering of the scattered people of God, bringing them into the fullness of His kingdom. It also connects to the theme of Jesus as the Good Shepherd, who ensures that nothing is lost. This miracle serves as a type of the Messianic banquet, where all will be fed and satisfied in the kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, performing the miracle of feeding the five thousand.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who distributed the food and collected the leftovers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A multitude of people who followed Jesus and were fed by Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethsaida.htm">Bethsaida</a></b><br>The region where this miracle took place, near the Sea of Galilee.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_miracle_of_feeding_the_five_thousand.htm">The Miracle of Feeding the Five Thousand</a></b><br>A significant event demonstrating Jesus' divine provision and compassion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_provision.htm">Divine Provision</a></b><br>Jesus meets both physical and spiritual needs, demonstrating God's care for His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/abundance_in_christ.htm">Abundance in Christ</a></b><br>The twelve baskets of leftovers symbolize the overflowing abundance found in Jesus.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_obedience.htm">Faith and Obedience</a></b><br>The disciples' role in distributing the food shows the importance of participating in God's work through faith and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>Jesus' provision came at the right moment, teaching us to trust in God's perfect timing for our needs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_sharing.htm">Community and Sharing</a></b><br>The miracle encourages believers to share resources and care for one another, reflecting the early church's practices.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_9_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 9:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_9_17_God_s_daily_provision.htm">How does Luke 9:17 demonstrate God's provision in our daily lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_disciples_in_Luke_9_17.htm">What lessons can we learn from the disciples' role in Luke 9:17?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Luke_9_17_to_Exodus_16_4_provision.htm">How does Luke 9:17 connect to God's provision in Exodus 16:4?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Luke_9_17_to_today_s_issues.htm">How can we apply the miracle in Luke 9:17 to modern-day challenges?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_all_ate_show_God_s_sufficiency_2.htm">What does "all ate and were satisfied" teach about God's sufficiency for us?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_9_17_Jesus_divine_power_shown.htm">How does Luke 9:17 demonstrate Jesus' divine power and authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_Luke_9_17_miracle.htm">What is the significance of the miracle in Luke 9:17 for Christian faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Luke_9_17_and_God_s_provision_link.htm">How does Luke 9:17 relate to the theme of God's provision?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_spiritual_darkness.htm">What occurred at the Mount of Transfiguration?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_did_5_loaves,_2_fish_feed_thousands.htm">In Matthew 14:15-21, how can five loaves and two fish realistically feed thousands of people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_there_non-biblical_proof_of_feeding_5,000.htm">In Mark 6:30-44, is there any credible evidence outside the Bible supporting the feeding of 5,000 people with just five loaves and two fish?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_keep_the_vision_secret_until_resurrection.htm">Why did Jesus instruct the disciples to keep the vision secret until after his resurrection if it confirmed his divine identity?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Luke 9:17 Mean</div><b>They all ate</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/9-17.htm">Luke 9:17</a> opens with the simple statement, &#8220;They all ate&#8221;. Every person in the crowd&#8212;five thousand men plus women and children (v. 14)&#8212;received literal food. No one was excluded or overlooked, showing Christ&#8217;s compassion for the whole assembly (cf. <a href="/matthew/14-20.htm">Matthew 14:20</a>; <a href="/mark/6-42.htm">Mark 6:42</a>).<p>&#8226; The miracle echoes God&#8217;s past provision of manna to &#8220;all&#8221; Israel in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>) and foreshadows the future marriage supper of the Lamb when every believer will be welcomed to the table (<a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>).<p>&#8226; By meeting a tangible need, Jesus affirms that the gospel addresses body and soul. Just as He fed Elijah through the ravens (<a href="/1_kings/17-4.htm">1 Kings 17:4&#8211;6</a>) and a widow through a never-empty jar (<a href="/1_kings/17-14.htm">1 Kings 17:14-16</a>), He still provides for His people today (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and were satisfied</b><p>&#8226; The verse continues, &#8220;and were satisfied&#8221;.

Israel often &#8220;ate and were satisfied&#8221; when obedient (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10</a>), and here the same language shows Jesus fulfilling what God alone can do&#8212;completely satisfy His people (<a href="/isaiah/55-2.htm">Isaiah 55:2</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, true contentment is found in Christ&#8217;s sufficiency, not in circumstances (<a href="/1_timothy/6-6.htm">1 Timothy 6:6-8</a>). The miracle calls us to rest in the One who meets every need, earthly and eternal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the disciples picked up</b><p>&#8226; After the meal, &#8220;the disciples picked up&#8221; the leftovers.

None of Israel&#8217;s tribes will be lacking when the Messiah reigns (<a href="/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, the baskets also become a visual reminder to the disciples: what seemed impossible at the start (v. 13) ends with overflow they can hold in their hands (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of broken pieces that were left over</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Broken pieces&#8221; points to bread already distributed and enjoyed&#8212;yet still remaining.

Even what looks insignificant to us is precious to Him (<a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the Lord uses the &#8220;broken&#8221; to demonstrate His power (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>).

St. John expressly tells us that this order to gather up the fragments of their meal emanated from Jesus himself. Carefulness, thrift, and economy in small things as in great, form part of the teaching of the loving Master. From such passages as <a href="/mark/6-37.htm">Mark 6:37</a> and <a href="/john/13-29.htm">John 13:29</a>, it seems probable that the disciples, acting under their Master's direction, were in the habit of distributing, out of their comparative abundance, food to those persons in the villages who were poorer than themselves. It was, no doubt, for some such hallowed object as this that the careful collection of the fragments which filled twelve baskets was made. The "baskets" (<span class="accented">cophinus</span>) were usually carried by travelling Jews to keep their food from contracting Levitical pollution in Gentile places. Juvenal, in a well-known passage ('Sat.,' 3:14), writes of the Jews travelling about Italy with no baggage save a little bundle of hay to serve as a pillow, and this cophinus, or basket, for their food. So abundant had been the provision created by Jesus, that the fragments collected far exceeded the original stock of food which the disciples gave to Jesus to bless, to break, and to distribute among the five thousand and upward who were fed that memorable afternoon. This miracle is the only one in the entire Galilaean ministry which is told by all the four evangelists. It evidently had a very prominent place in the teaching of the first days. Rationalizing interpretation in the case of this miracle is singularly at fault. After eighteen centuries of unremitting hostility to the teaching of Jesus Christ, not even a plausible explanation of this miraculous multiplication of the loaves and fishes has been found by adverse critics. In our own days, Renan, following the ancient interpretation of Paulus, simply suggests that the multitudes were fed by materials provided by themselves. "Every one took his little store of provision from his wallet; they lived on very little" - an explanation, as it has been happily termed, "ludicrously inadequate." After the relation of the great miracle of feeding the five thousand, St. Luke omits in his Gospel a variety of incidents and several discourses told at greater or lesser length by the other evangelists. For instance, the reverential amazement of the people when the nature of the stupendous miracle in connection with the creation of the loaves and fishes flashed upon them, - they wished to recognize him as King Messiah; the walking on the sea; the long and important discourse on the true Bread at Capernaum, the text of which was the late great miracle of the loaves; the journey among the heathen as far as Tyre and Sidon; the meeting with the Syro-phoenician woman; the feeding of the four thousand, etc. These incidents are related in <a href="/matthew/14.htm">Matthew 14-16:12</a>; <a href="/mark/6-45.htm">Mark 6:45</a> - 8:80; <a href="/john/6.htm">John 6</a>. No commentator has satisfactorily explained the reason of this omission of important portions of our Lord's public ministry. The reason for St. Luke's action here probably will never be guessed. We must, however, in all theories which we may form of the composition of these Gospels, never lose sight of this fact, that while SS. Matthew and Peter (Mark) were eyewitnesses of the events of the life, St. Luke, and his master, Paul, simply reproduced what they had heard or read. We may, therefore, suppose that St. Luke exercised larger discretionary powers in dealing with materials derived from others than the other two, who desired, no doubt, to reproduce a fairly general summary of their Divine Master's acts. On such a theory of composition, a gap in the story like the one we are now alluding to, in the more eclectic Gospel of St. Luke, would seem scarcely possible in the first two Gospels. We, of course, make no allusion here to the Fourth Gospel; the whole plan and design of St. John was different to that upon which the first three were modelled. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They all ate</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#966;&#945;&#947;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ephagon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5315.htm">Strong's 5315: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary verb; to eat.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">were satisfied,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#967;&#959;&#961;&#964;&#940;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(echortasth&#275;san)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5526.htm">Strong's 5526: </a> </span><span class="str2">To feed, satisfy, fatten.
