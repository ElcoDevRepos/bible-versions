The setting is the Garden of Gethsemane, a place Jesus often visited for solitude and prayer (<a href="/john/18-2.htm">John 18:2</a>). This moment is significant as it follows His intense prayer where He asked for the cup of suffering to pass from Him, yet submitted to the Father's will (<a href="/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>). This act of rising from prayer signifies His readiness to face the impending crucifixion, demonstrating His obedience and resolve.<p><b>and returned to the disciples,</b><br>Jesus' return to the disciples shows His concern for them even in His own time of need. The disciples were His closest followers, and He had previously instructed them to pray so they would not fall into temptation (<a href="/luke/22-40.htm">Luke 22:40</a>). This return is a reminder of His role as a teacher and shepherd, guiding and caring for His flock. It also reflects the communal aspect of faith, emphasizing the importance of supporting one another in spiritual vigilance.<p><b>He found them asleep,</b><br>The disciples' sleep contrasts sharply with Jesus' vigilance in prayer. This sleep is not merely physical but symbolizes spiritual unpreparedness. Despite Jesus' earlier warnings about the coming trials (<a href="/luke/22-31.htm">Luke 22:31-34</a>), the disciples succumb to their human frailty. This moment foreshadows their later abandonment of Jesus during His arrest and trial, highlighting the weakness of the flesh even when the spirit is willing (<a href="/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>).<p><b>exhausted from sorrow.</b><br>The disciples' exhaustion is attributed to sorrow, indicating the emotional toll of the events unfolding around them. They were likely overwhelmed by Jesus' predictions of His suffering and death (<a href="/luke/22-37.htm">Luke 22:37</a>). This sorrow reflects a deep, human response to impending loss and confusion about the future. It also connects to the broader biblical theme of sorrow preceding joy, as their grief would later turn to joy with the resurrection (<a href="/john/16-20.htm">John 16:20-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is in the Garden of Gethsemane, praying earnestly before His impending arrest and crucifixion.

They are Jesus' closest followers, whom He brought with Him to pray, but they fall asleep due to exhaustion from sorrow.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/garden_of_gethsemane.htm">Garden of Gethsemane</a></b><br>This is the place where Jesus went to pray.

Now He stands, having fully yielded to the Father&#8217;s will.<p>&#8226; The scene follows the anguished petition, &#8220;Father, if You are willing, take this cup from Me; yet not My will, but Yours be done&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>; cf. <a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Rising signals resolve. Jesus moves from pleading to progressing toward the cross, echoing earlier patterns of prayer-fueled action (<a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>; <a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Returned to the disciples</b><p>&#8226; Though eternity&#8217;s redemption is at stake, Jesus&#8217; first act is pastoral: He checks on His closest friends, just as He promised to keep them (<a href="/john/17-12.htm">John 17:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier He had urged them, &#8220;Pray that you will not enter into temptation&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-40.htm">Luke 22:40</a>). His return measures their response and reminds us that obedience is lived in community (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9&#8211;10</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Parallel accounts underline His repeated trips back to them (<a href="/matthew/26-40.htm">Matthew 26:40</a>; <a href="/mark/14-37.htm">Mark 14:37</a>), displaying both patience and sorrow over their struggle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He found them asleep</b><p>&#8226; Physical drowsiness mirrors spiritual dullness.

They are overwhelmed by anticipation of loss, unable to process the impending arrest.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word distinguishes godly sorrow that leads to repentance (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>) from paralyzing despair. Here, sorrow incapacitates instead of invigorates prayer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/22-45.htm">Luke 22:45</a> shows the contrast between Christ&#8217;s steadfast obedience and the disciples&#8217; frailty. Jesus rises from agonizing prayer with firm resolve, returns in shepherd-like concern, discovers His followers physically sleeping and emotionally drained. The verse highlights our inability to remain faithful in our own strength and magnifies the Savior who, fully awake and fully willing, proceeds to secure redemption for sleepy, sorrow-laden hearts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(45) <span class= "bld">He found them sleeping for sorrow.</span>--It is, perhaps, again characteristic of St. Luke, that while the other Gospels state simply the fact that the disciples slept, he assigns it psychologically and physiologically to its cause. Prolonged sorrow has, at last, a numbing and narcotising effect. (See Note on "believing not for joy," <a href="/luke/24-41.htm" title="And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have you here any meat?">Luke 24:41</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 45, 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He found them sleeping for sorrow, and said unto them, Why sleep ye rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation</span>. The events of the past evening; the long excitement stirred up by listening to such words as their Master had been speaking to them during the sad hours of the Last Supper; the sure consciousness of coming sorrow; then the walk through the silent city: - all predisposed them to sleep. Commentators are never weary with pressing these excuses for the slumber of the eleven at that awful moment. But all these things, though they may well have predisposed them to slumber, are not sufficient to account for that strange heavy sleep which seems to have paralyzed the eleven in Gethsemane. In spite of their Master's solemn injunction to watch and pray, he finds them, several times during that dreadful watch of his in the garden, asleep, in spite of his asking them for sympathy and prayer, in spite of his evident longing for their sympathy - each time he cast his eyes on them, he sees them, not watching, but sleeping! Many a time in their work-filled lives those fishermen he loved so well, John and Peter and Andrew, had toiled all night with their nets; but on this night of sorrow, when their pleading voices were listened for, possibly their hand-press waited for, their silent sympathy certainly longed for, they slept, seemingly forgetful of all save their own ease and comfort. Surely on this night of temptation they were influenced by some invisible power, who lulled them to sleep during those precious moments when they should have been agonizing with their Master in prayer, and so arming themselves against the supreme moment of temptation just coming upon them. But swayed by the power of evil of whom the Lord had been warning them, but in vain, they let the moments slip by, and the hour of temptation came on them unawares. We know how grievously they all fell. <p><span class="accented">"'Forsake the Christ thou sawest transfigured! him<br />Who trod the sea and brought the dead to life?<br />What should wring this from thee?' - ye laugh and ask.<br />What wrung it?
