In the cultural context of Jesus' time, Jews and Samaritans had deep-seated animosity towards each other, making the Samaritan's act of mercy even more significant. The Samaritan's actions exemplify the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor, transcending ethnic and religious boundaries. This act of mercy aligns with the teachings found in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, which emphasizes doing justice, loving kindness, and walking humbly with God.<p><b>replied the expert in the law.</b><br>The expert in the law, or lawyer, was a scholar of the Mosaic Law. His initial question to Jesus was about inheriting eternal life, which led to the parable. His response here indicates a reluctant acknowledgment of the Samaritan's righteousness, despite his own cultural prejudices. This interaction highlights the tension between legalistic interpretations of the law and the deeper, heart-centered obedience that Jesus advocated.<p><b>Then Jesus told him,</b><br>Jesus often used parables to teach profound truths in a way that challenged listeners to think deeply. His response here is direct and serves as a command, emphasizing the practical application of the parable's lesson. Jesus' teaching method here is consistent with His approach throughout the Gospels, where He often concludes parables with a call to action or reflection.<p><b>&#8220;Go and do likewise.&#8221;</b><br>This command from Jesus is a call to action, urging the expert in the law&#8212;and by extension, all believers&#8212;to emulate the Samaritan's example of mercy and compassion. It underscores the importance of active love and service to others, as seen in <a href="/james/2-14.htm">James 2:14-17</a>, which speaks about faith being dead without works. This directive also reflects the essence of Jesus' ministry, which was characterized by acts of compassion and service, fulfilling the law through love as stated in <a href="/romans/13-10.htm">Romans 13:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the passage, who is teaching through the parable of the Good Samaritan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/expert_in_the_law.htm">Expert in the Law</a></b><br>A Jewish legal scholar who questions Jesus, seeking to justify himself and understand who his neighbor is.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_good_samaritan.htm">The Good Samaritan</a></b><br>A character in Jesus' parable who shows mercy to a wounded man, illustrating the command to love one's neighbor.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wounded_man.htm">The Wounded Man</a></b><br>A victim of robbery and assault, left for dead, representing those in need of compassion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem_and_jericho.htm">Jerusalem and Jericho</a></b><br>The road between these two places is the setting for the parable, known for being dangerous and treacherous.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_mercy.htm">Understanding Mercy</a></b><br>Mercy is not just a feeling but an action.

By identifying mercy as the defining act of neighbor-love, the law expert unwittingly condemns every form of prejudice. Jesus then turns that confession into a commission: &#8220;Go and do likewise.&#8221; The verse calls believers to embody active, sacrificial compassion, demonstrating God&#8217;s love to any person in need, without boundary or hesitation, until mercy becomes a way of life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">Go, and do thou likewise.</span>--This was the practical, though not the formal, answer to the question of the lawyer. If he acted in the spirit of the Samaritan, he would need no "nicely-calculated less or more" of casuistic distinctions as to who was and who was not his neighbour. Fellowship in the same human nature, and any kind of even passing contact, were enough to constitute a ground for neighbourly kindness. Of such a question it may be said, <span class= "ital">Solvitur amando.</span> We love, and the problem presents no difficulty.<p>Nothing should lead us away from recognising this as the main lesson of the parable. But there is another application of it which, within limits, is legitimate enough as a development of thought, and which has commended itself to so many devout minds, both in ancient and modern times, that it at least deserves a notice. Christ Himself, it is said, is the great pattern of a wide, universal love for man as man, acting out the lesson which the parable teaches in its highest form. May we not think of Him as shadowed forth in the good Samaritan, as accepting, in that sense, the name which had been flung at Him in scorn? Starting from this thought, the circumstances fit in with a strange aptness. The traveller stands as representing mankind at large. The journey is from Jerusalem, the heavenly city, the paradise of man's first estate, to Jericho, the evil and accursed city (<a href="/joshua/6-17.htm" title="And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.">Joshua 6:17</a>), the sin into which man entered by yielding to temptation. The robbers are the powers of evil, who strip him of his robe of innocence and purity, who smite him sore, and leave him, as regards his higher life, half-dead. The priest and the Levite represent the Law in its sacrificial and ceremonial aspects, and they have no power to relieve or rescue. The Christ comes and helps where they have failed. The beast on which He rides is the human nature in which the Word dwelt, and it is upon that humanity of His that He bids us rest for comfort and support. The inn represents the visible Church of Christ, and the host its pastors and teachers; even the two pence, perhaps, the ordinances and means of grace committed to the Church. There is an obvious risk, in all such application, of an element that is fantastic and unreal; but the main line of parallelism seems to commend itself, if not to the reason, at least to the imagination of the devout interpreter.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/10-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;The [one]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
