His use of "Lord" signifies respect and acknowledgment of Jesus' authority. This title reflects Peter's recognition of Jesus' divine role, aligning with the confession he made in <a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."<p><b>&#8220;I am ready to go with You&#8221;</b><br>Peter's declaration of readiness shows his loyalty and commitment to Jesus. This statement is made during the Last Supper, a time of heightened emotion and significance. It reflects Peter's impulsive nature and his genuine desire to support Jesus, though it foreshadows his later denial. This moment is reminiscent of Peter's earlier willingness to step out of the boat and walk on water towards Jesus (<a href="/matthew/14-28.htm">Matthew 14:28-29</a>).<p><b>&#8220;even to prison&#8221;</b><br>The mention of prison indicates Peter's understanding of the potential consequences of following Jesus. In the Roman world, imprisonment was a common fate for those who opposed the authorities or were seen as threats. This reflects the growing tension between Jesus' ministry and the religious and political powers of the time. The early church would later face similar persecutions, as seen in <a href="/acts/12-4.htm">Acts 12:4</a> when Peter himself is imprisoned.<p><b>&#8220;and to death.&#8221;</b><br>Peter's willingness to face death highlights the ultimate sacrifice he is prepared to make for Jesus. This echoes Jesus' earlier teachings on the cost of discipleship, such as in <a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>, where He calls His followers to take up their cross. Peter's statement is prophetic, as he would eventually be martyred for his faith, fulfilling Jesus' prediction in <a href="/john/21-18.htm">John 21:18-19</a> about the manner of his death. This phrase also connects to the theme of martyrdom seen throughout the New Testament, exemplified by Stephen in <a href="/acts/7.htm">Acts 7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his impulsive nature and strong declarations of loyalty.
