The Holy Spirit's guidance is seen in the lives of believers, as in <a href="/acts/8-29.htm">Acts 8:29</a> with Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch. The Spirit's leading is essential for fulfilling God's purposes, as seen in the life of Simeon, who is the subject of this passage. The Spirit's role in the early church underscores the transition from the Old Covenant to the New Covenant, where the Spirit indwells believers.<p><b>he went into the temple courts</b><br>The temple courts refer to the outer areas of the Temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship and sacrifice for the Jewish people. This location is significant as it was the heart of Jewish religious life and the place where God's presence was believed to dwell. The temple was a place of prophecy and fulfillment, as seen in <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, which speaks of the Lord coming to His temple. The courts were accessible to all Jews, making it a fitting place for Simeon to encounter Jesus.<p><b>And when the parents brought in the child Jesus</b><br>Mary and Joseph, as devout Jews, were obedient to the Law, bringing Jesus to the temple for the rites of purification and dedication. This act of bringing Jesus to the temple fulfills the requirements of the Law, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/12-6.htm">Leviticus 12:6-8</a>. The mention of Jesus as a child emphasizes His humanity and the fulfillment of prophecies concerning His birth and early life, such as <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, which speaks of a virgin bearing a son.<p><b>to do for Him what was customary under the Law</b><br>This refers to the Jewish customs and laws concerning purification and dedication of the firstborn, as described in <a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a> and <a href="/leviticus/12.htm">Leviticus 12</a>. The Law required that every firstborn male be consecrated to the Lord, symbolizing God's deliverance of Israel's firstborn during the Exodus. Jesus' presentation at the temple signifies His role as the firstborn of all creation (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>) and foreshadows His ultimate sacrifice for humanity. This act of obedience by His parents sets the stage for Jesus' fulfillment of the Law and the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simeon.htm">Simeon</a></b><br>A devout and righteous man in Jerusalem who was promised by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ.

In common life it is almost obvious that no other phraseology was possible.<p><span class= "bld">To do for him after the custom of the law.</span>--In common practice, the child would have been presented to the priest who offered the two turtle doves on behalf of the parents. In this instance Simeon, though not a priest (there is, at least, nothing but a legend in an Apocryphal Gospel to fix that character on him), takes on himself, standing by the priest, to receive the child as he was presented. This fits in, as far as it goes, with the idea of his having been an Essene, revered as possessing prophetic gifts. (See Notes on <a href="/luke/2-25.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was on him.">Luke 2:25</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus</span>. This was evidently the usual expression which the Nazareth family adopted when they spoke of the Child Jesus (see, again, in Ver. 48 of this chapter; and also in Ver. 33, where the older authorities read" his father" instead of "and Joseph"). The true story, which they both knew so well, was not for the rough Galilaean peasant, still less for the hostile Herodian. The mother knew the truth, Joseph too, and the house of Zacharias the priest, and probably not a few besides among their devout friends and kinsfolk. The Nazareth family, resting quietly in their simple faith, left the rest to God, who, in his own season, would reveal the secret of the nativity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/2-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Led by]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
