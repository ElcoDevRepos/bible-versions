The context is a parable told by Jesus, highlighting themes of stewardship and accountability. The manager, facing dismissal, seeks to secure his future by reducing the debts owed to his master. This reflects the cultural practice of debt management in ancient times, where stewards had significant control over financial transactions. The calling in of debtors suggests a formal process, possibly involving written records, which was common in the economic practices of the time.<p><b>&#8216;How much do you owe my master?&#8217;</b><br>The question posed by the manager is direct and reflects the urgency of his situation. In the historical context, debt was a common part of life, often leading to servitude if not managed properly. The manager's inquiry indicates a personal knowledge of each debtor's account, emphasizing his role and responsibility. This question also sets the stage for the manager's subsequent actions, which are aimed at currying favor with the debtors. Theologically, this can be seen as a reflection on the nature of sin and forgiveness, where the "debt" can symbolize sin, and the reduction of debt can symbolize grace.<p><b>he asked the first.</b><br>The phrase indicates the beginning of a series of interactions, suggesting a methodical approach by the manager. The "first" debtor represents the start of a pattern, highlighting the manager's intent to systematically reduce debts. This action can be seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where each individual is approached personally. Theologically, it underscores the importance of individual accountability and the personal nature of salvation. The manager's actions, though self-serving, inadvertently illustrate the concept of mercy and the transformative power of forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unjust_steward.htm">The Unjust Steward (Manager)</a></b><br>A central figure in the parable, he is responsible for managing his master's resources but is accused of wasting them.

Who, we ask, are the "debtors," in the interpretation of the parable? The Lord's Prayer supplies the answer to that question. The "debtors" are those who have sinned against God, who have left undone the things which they were bound to do, who have made no return for the outward blessings they have received. The unfaithful Church or party tries to secure its position by working on the lower nature of those who have the sense of that burden upon them. It neither gives the sense of peace or pardon, nor asserts the righteous severity of God's commandments. It keeps their consciences uneasy, and traffics in its absolutions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6,</span> and 7 simply paint in the details of the interesting picture of the parable. This singular plan of providing for himself by becoming a benefactor of the debtor, remarks Professor Bruce, was by no means the only possible one under the circumstances; but the Speaker of the parable made his hero make choice of it as the aim of the imaginary narrative was to teach the value of beneficence as a passport into the eternal habitations. Various explanations have been suggested to account for the difference in the gifts to the debtors. It is probable that when our Lord spoke the parable, reasons for these varied gifts were given, such as the circumstances of the debtors. It is scarcely now worth while to frame ingenious guesses respecting the details, which apparently do not affect the grand lessons which the story was intended to teach. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/16-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">he called in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(proskalesamenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4341.htm">Strong's 4341: </a> </span><span class="str2">To call to myself, summon.
