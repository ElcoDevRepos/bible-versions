The concept of being entrusted with "all things" indicates a transfer of authority and responsibility, reflecting the intimate relationship between Jesus and God the Father. This echoes the messianic prophecy in <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7-8</a>, where the Son is given the nations as His inheritance. It also aligns with <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, where Jesus declares that all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Him. The Father-Son relationship is central to understanding the Trinity, where distinct persons share one essence and purpose. This entrustment signifies Jesus' role in the divine plan of salvation and His authority over creation, judgment, and redemption.<p><b>No one knows who the Son is except the Father,</b><br>This phrase highlights the unique and exclusive knowledge between the Father and the Son, underscoring the mystery of the divine nature of Christ. The term "knows" implies an intimate, experiential understanding, not just intellectual awareness. This exclusivity points to the deep, eternal relationship within the Godhead, as seen in <a href="/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>, where the Son, who is in the closest relationship with the Father, has made Him known. It also reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah, who would have a unique relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>. This knowledge is not accessible through human wisdom but is revealed by divine revelation.<p><b>and no one knows who the Father is except the Son</b><br>This statement further emphasizes the reciprocal knowledge between the Father and the Son, indicating that true understanding of God the Father is only possible through the Son. This aligns with <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where Jesus states that no one comes to the Father except through Him. It underscores the role of Jesus as the mediator between God and humanity, fulfilling the role of the ultimate high priest as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>. The Son's unique knowledge of the Father is a testament to His divine nature and mission to reveal God to the world.<p><b>and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase introduces the concept of divine revelation and election, where the knowledge of God is granted by the sovereign choice of the Son. It highlights the grace and initiative of God in making Himself known to humanity. This is consistent with the theme of revelation throughout the New Testament, where understanding and faith are gifts from God, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>. The idea of being chosen by the Son reflects the doctrine of election, where God, in His sovereignty, reveals Himself to those He calls. This revelation is not based on human merit but on God's gracious will, as seen in <a href="/romans/9-15.htm">Romans 9:15-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, who speaks of His unique relationship with the Father and His authority to reveal the Father to others.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The one who has entrusted all things to Jesus, highlighting the divine relationship and authority within the Trinity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are the immediate audience of Jesus' teaching and the ones to whom He reveals the Father.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_trinity.htm">The Trinity</a></b><br>Implicit in the relationship between the Father and the Son, emphasizing the unity and distinct roles within the Godhead.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/revelation.htm">Revelation</a></b><br>The event or process by which Jesus chooses to reveal the Father to others, indicating divine initiative and grace.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_authority_and_trust.htm">Divine Authority and Trust</a></b><br>Jesus has been entrusted with all things by the Father, indicating His supreme authority and trustworthiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/exclusive_knowledge.htm">Exclusive Knowledge</a></b><br>The unique relationship between the Father and the Son is foundational to understanding the nature of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/revelation_as_grace.htm">Revelation as Grace</a></b><br>The ability to know the Father is a gift of grace, dependent on the Son's choice to reveal Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_trinity.htm">The Role of the Trinity</a></b><br>Understanding the distinct roles within the Trinity helps us appreciate the unity and diversity of God's work in the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/pursuing_revelation.htm">Pursuing Revelation</a></b><br>As believers, we should seek to know God more deeply through Jesus, who reveals the Father to us.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_10_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 10:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_10_22_Jesus_bond_with_Father.htm">How does Luke 10:22 emphasize Jesus' unique relationship with the Father?

These words, spoken late in the public ministry, evidently refer to the Almighty power possessed and frequently exercised by the incarnate Son of God. During the days of his humiliation, Jesus Christ exercised the power of Creator, Lord of the elements, Lord of the secrets of health and disease, Lord of life and death. Dean Mansel, comparing this statement, recorded both by SS. Matthew and Luke, with the language of St. John, remarks "that there is no substantial difference between the different evangelists in their views of our Lord's Person and nature, and that the Gospel of St. John, far from being the representative of a later theology, does but more fully expound what is implicitly contained in the earliest of the Gospels." St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>) here gives us that sublime invitation of the Master's to the weary and heavy-laden. In the consciousness of his possession of all power, Jesus, with infinite compassion, offers to the great army of sufferers that rest which he alone can give. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/10-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">All things</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Panta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
