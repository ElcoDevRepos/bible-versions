The Greek word for "distracted" suggests being pulled in different directions, indicating Martha's internal struggle. This scene takes place in Bethany, a village near Jerusalem, which was a common stop for Jesus. The preparations likely involved food and accommodations, reflecting the customs of the time. Martha's focus on service, while commendable, contrasts with the spiritual focus Jesus often emphasized, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>, where seeking God's kingdom is prioritized.<p><b>She came to Jesus and said,</b><br>Martha's approach to Jesus shows her familiarity and comfort with Him, indicating a close relationship. This interaction occurs in a domestic setting, which was a common place for Jesus to teach and interact with His followers. Her directness reflects the openness and honesty encouraged in prayer and communication with God, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>, where believers are invited to approach the throne of grace with confidence.<p><b>&#8220;Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone?</b><br>Martha's question reveals her frustration and sense of injustice, a common human experience. Her use of "Lord" acknowledges Jesus' authority, yet her question implies doubt about His concern for her situation. This reflects a tension between earthly concerns and spiritual priorities, similar to the worries addressed in <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>, where believers are encouraged to present their requests to God with thanksgiving. Martha's focus on her sister Mary highlights the familial dynamics and expectations of shared responsibilities in that culture.<p><b>Tell her to help me!&#8221;</b><br>Martha's request for Jesus to intervene underscores her belief in His authority to resolve disputes. It also reflects a desire for fairness and assistance, common themes in human relationships. This plea can be seen as a type of intercession, where one seeks divine intervention in personal matters, akin to the intercessory role of Christ described in <a href="/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>. Martha's focus on service, while important, is gently corrected by Jesus in the following verses, emphasizing the need to prioritize spiritual nourishment over worldly concerns.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/martha.htm">Martha</a></b><br>A resident of Bethany and sister to Mary and Lazarus.

Jesus invites the weary to approach Him (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>) and urges believers to &#8220;come boldly to the throne of grace&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>). Even imperfect prayers are welcome; the problem is not where she goes but what she says next.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lord, do You not care</b><p>This echo of the disciples&#8217; cry in the storm (<a href="/mark/4-38.htm">Mark 4:38</a>) exposes a common temptation&#8212;doubting God&#8217;s concern when life feels unfair. Scripture affirms the opposite: &#8220;Cast all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>). The question reveals more about Martha&#8217;s heart than about the Lord&#8217;s character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that my sister has left me to serve alone?</b><p>Martha interprets Mary&#8217;s choice to sit at Jesus&#8217; feet (<a href="/luke/10-39.htm">Luke 10:39</a>) as abandonment. Comparison breeds resentment:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Each one should examine his own work&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-4.htm">Galatians 6:4-5</a>) rather than another&#8217;s.<p>&#8226; God assigns differing roles, yet &#8220;the same Lord&#8221; values them all (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-5.htm">1 Corinthians 12:5</a>).<p>Self-pity blinds Martha to Mary&#8217;s act of worship and to her own opportunity for the same.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Tell her to help me!</b><p>Martha moves from questioning Jesus&#8217; care to instructing Him. Instead of &#8220;Your will be done&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>), she presses her agenda. Scripture cautions against prayers aimed at getting God to rubber-stamp our plans (<a href="/james/4-3.htm">James 4:3</a>). The Lord will answer, but His gentle correction (v. 41-42) shows that Martha needs perspective more than assistance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/10-40.htm">Luke 10:40</a> shows a sincere believer pulled off-center by busyness. Service became distraction, questions turned to doubt, and frustration morphed into presumption.

The use of a like word in <a href="/luke/12-42.htm" title="And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?">Luke 12:42</a> suggests that this also may have passed from the abstract to the concrete sense, and have been used for a <span class= "ital">household</span> of many servants as well as for the act of serving.<p><span class= "bld">Came to him.</span>--The Greek word implies something like a hasty movement to interrupt the calm tenor of the Lord's discourse.

Dr. Farrar very happily seizes the tone and temper of Martha. He renders the Greek words here, "but suddenly coming up." We see in this inimitable touch the little petulant outburst of jealousy in the loving, busy matron, as she hurried in with the words, "Why is Mary sitting there doing nothing?" <span class="cmt_word">Bid her therefore that she help me</span>. "We almost seem to hear the undertone of 'It is no use for <span class="accented">me</span> to tell her.'
