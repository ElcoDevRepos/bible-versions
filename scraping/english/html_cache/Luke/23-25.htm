The crowd, influenced by the chief priests and elders, chose Barabbas, a known criminal, over Jesus, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as "despised and rejected by men." This decision highlights the fickle nature of public opinion and the fulfillment of God's sovereign plan through human actions.<p><b>he released the one imprisoned for insurrection and murder</b><br>Barabbas was a notorious prisoner, guilty of rebellion against Roman authority and murder. His release instead of Jesus is symbolic of the substitutionary atonement of Christ, where the innocent suffers in place of the guilty. This act prefigures the core of the Gospel message, where Jesus takes the place of sinners, bearing the punishment they deserve. The choice of Barabbas over Jesus also underscores the political tension in Judea, where insurrectionists were both feared and, at times, admired by the Jewish populace for their resistance against Roman rule.<p><b>and he handed Jesus over to their will</b><br>Pilate's decision to hand Jesus over to the crowd's will demonstrates the political pressure he faced. Despite finding no fault in Jesus, Pilate capitulated to the demands of the people to maintain order and his position. This act of handing Jesus over fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, where the Messiah is described as being led like a lamb to the slaughter. It also reflects the broader theme of Jesus' submission to the Father's will, as seen in His prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>), and highlights the injustice of His trial and crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor who presided over the trial of Jesus.
