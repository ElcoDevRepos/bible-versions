This reflects the widespread interest in his message of repentance and preparation for the coming Messiah. The crowds likely included a diverse group of individuals from various social and economic backgrounds, highlighting the universal appeal and urgency of John's message. In the context of first-century Judea, where Roman occupation and religious expectation were high, the people were eager for guidance and hope.<p><b>&#8220;What then should we do?&#8221;</b><br>This question signifies a genuine desire for practical application of John's teachings. It reflects a common theme in Scripture where individuals seek to align their lives with God's will. The question echoes the response of those convicted by the message of repentance, similar to the inquiry in <a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a>, where the crowd asks Peter, "Brothers, what shall we do?" This demonstrates a recognition of personal responsibility and a willingness to change. The question also underscores the ethical and moral implications of repentance, emphasizing that true repentance involves tangible actions and a transformation of behavior.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A prophet and forerunner of Jesus Christ, known for his call to repentance and baptism for the forgiveness of sins.

They are interesting as showing that the work of the Baptist was not that of a mere preacher of repentance. Confession of sins followed naturally on the part of the penitents; that was followed, as naturally, by guidance for the conscience. St. Luke, as a physician of the soul, may well have delighted to place on record this example of true spiritual therapeutics." The same train of thought is followed out by Godet in his remark on the question contained in this verse: "It is the confessional after preaching." This little section (vers. 10-14), containing an epitome of questions placed before John by different classes of hearers touched by his soul-stirring preaching, is peculiar to our evangelist. It is clear that here, in the story of the ministry of the Baptist, Luke derived his knowledge of the details from an independent authority not used either by Matthew or Mark. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/3-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
