In biblical context, self-reliance often contrasts with reliance on God. <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a> advises trusting in the Lord rather than one's own understanding. The man's internal focus highlights a lack of seeking divine guidance, a theme prevalent in Jesus' teachings.<p><b>&#8216;What shall I do</b><br>The question reveals a sense of urgency and concern about material wealth. In the cultural context of the time, wealth was often seen as a sign of God's blessing, yet Jesus frequently challenged this notion, emphasizing spiritual wealth over material abundance. This question also echoes the rich young ruler's inquiry in <a href="/luke/18-18.htm">Luke 18:18</a>, where the focus is on eternal life rather than earthly possessions.<p><b>since I have nowhere to store my crops?&#8217;</b><br>The abundance of crops signifies prosperity, yet the man's dilemma underscores the transient nature of material wealth. In historical context, agriculture was central to the economy, and storing surplus was a common practice. However, the man's lack of storage reflects a deeper spiritual issue&#8212;his focus on earthly treasures rather than heavenly ones. This connects to Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a> about storing treasures in heaven.

private reasoning, not prayer. <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a> urges, &#8220;Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding,&#8221; yet this man leans entirely on himself.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/10-4.htm">Psalm 10:4</a> describes the godless mindset: &#8220;In his pride the wicked man does not seek Him; in all his thoughts there is no room for God.&#8221; The farmer&#8217;s inner dialogue reflects that same exclusion of the Lord.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13-15</a> warns planners who forget God that life is &#8220;a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.&#8221; The farmer behaves as though he controls tomorrow, revealing a heart anchored in self-sufficiency.<p>&#8226; Jesus later says (<a href="/luke/12-29.htm">Luke 12:29-31</a>), &#8220;Seek His kingdom, and these things will be added unto you.&#8221; The contrast is sharp: kingdom-minded people think vertically; the farmer thinks only inwardly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What shall I do</b><p>&#8226; His question sounds practical, yet it hides a deeper issue: he wants to safeguard surplus rather than seek God&#8217;s purpose for it.<p>&#8226; When crowds asked John the Baptist, &#8220;What then shall we do?&#8221; (<a href="/luke/3-10.htm">Luke 3:10, 14</a>) or when Pentecost listeners cried, &#8220;Brothers, what shall we do?&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a>), the answer pointed to repentance and generosity. This man never considers either.<p>&#8226; Luke&#8217;s Gospel often pairs right questions with surrendered hearts (<a href="/luke/10-37.htm">Luke 10:37</a>, &#8220;Go and do likewise&#8221;). Here, the same words expose a heart ruled by possessions.<p>&#8226; The Lord never condemns planning itself; He condemns planning divorced from stewardship and dependence on Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>since I have nowhere to store my crops?</b><p>&#8226; The heart of the dilemma is abundance, not scarcity. He frets over storage while neighbors may lack daily bread, ignoring <a href="/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>, &#8220;A generous soul will prosper.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a> advises, &#8220;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth.&#8221; The farmer is doing the opposite&#8212;hoarding earthly gain instead of investing in eternal riches.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17-19</a> instructs the wealthy &#8220;to be rich in good deeds... to lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age.&#8221; His barns will not survive eternity, but giving would.<p>&#8226; In verse 20 the Lord calls him &#8220;You fool!&#8221; because that very night his soul is required. The storage problem vanishes, and an eternity problem begins. Earthly security proved an illusion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/12-17.htm">Luke 12:17</a> exposes a self-centered heart that plans without prayer, asks without surrender, and stores without generosity. Scripture consistently commends wise stewardship under God&#8217;s lordship; the farmer models self-trusting greed. The verse invites us to replace inward scheming with God-dependent, kingdom-focused stewardship, remembering that true security is found only in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">And he thought within himself.</span>--The parable, like that of the Good Samaritan, is more than a similitude, and reads like an actual history. There is an almost dramatic vividness in the rich man's soliloquy. It was the very "superfluity" of the man's goods that became a new cause of anxiety. In such a case half was more than the whole. So far as life depended on property, it would have been better had the property been less.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17, 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits? And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater</span>. "No place to bestow my fruits." Well answers St. Ambrose," Thou <span class="accented">hast</span> barns - the bosoms of the needy, the houses of the widows, the mouths of orphans and of infants." Some might argue, from the sequel of the story, that God looks with disfavour on riches as riches. St. Augustine replies to such a mistaken deduction, "God desires not that thou shouldest lose thy riches, but that thou shouldest change their place" ('Serm.,' 36:9). The Greek word rendered "barns" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> - whence our word "apothecary") has a broader signification than merely barns; it signifies store or warehouses of all kinds, thus suggesting that the hero of the story was more than a mere wealthy farmer - he was probably also a trader. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods</span>. As he grew richer, he grew more covetous. Absolutely no care or thought for anything save his loved possessions seems to have crossed the threshold of that poor mistaken heart of his. This strange hunger after riches for riches' sake is, alas! a very usual form of soul-disease. Can it be cured? Alas! it is one of the most hopeless of soul-maladies. This unhappy love in countless cases becomes a passion, and twines itself round the heart, and so destroys all the affections and higher aspirations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/12-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">he thought</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(dielogizeto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1260.htm">Strong's 1260: </a> </span><span class="str2">To reason (with), debate (with), consider.
