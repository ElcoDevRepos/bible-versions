In the biblical context, being "well fed" often symbolizes self-reliance and complacency, neglecting spiritual needs. The warning echoes the Old Testament prophets, such as <a href="/amos/6.htm">Amos 6:1-7</a>, who condemned the wealthy for their indifference to the plight of the poor. Jesus' message here is a call to recognize the temporary nature of earthly comforts and the importance of spiritual hunger and dependence on God.<p><b>for you will hunger.</b><br>This part of the verse serves as a prophetic warning of reversal. It suggests that those who prioritize earthly satisfaction will eventually face spiritual emptiness. This concept is consistent with the biblical theme of divine justice, where the proud and self-sufficient are humbled. The future hunger can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual void that comes from neglecting one's relationship with God, as seen in the parable of the rich fool in <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>.<p><b>Woe to you who laugh now,</b><br>"Laugh" in this context refers to a carefree, self-indulgent lifestyle that ignores the deeper realities of life and the needs of others. In the cultural setting of Jesus' time, laughter was often associated with mockery or scorn, particularly towards those who were suffering or marginalized. This warning is a call to take life seriously, recognizing the brokenness of the world and the need for compassion and empathy.<p><b>for you will mourn and weep.</b><br>This phrase predicts a future of sorrow for those who currently live in self-satisfaction and disregard for others. Mourning and weeping are expressions of deep grief and repentance, often associated with the realization of one's sins and the consequences thereof. This reversal is a common biblical theme, as seen in <a href="/james/4-9.htm">James 4:9-10</a>, where believers are called to turn their laughter into mourning as a sign of humility and repentance before God. The ultimate fulfillment of this warning is seen in the eschatological judgment, where true joy is found in Christ alone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering a sermon often referred to as the "Sermon on the Plain," which parallels the "Sermon on the Mount" in Matthew.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples_and_the_crowd.htm">Disciples and the Crowd</a></b><br>The audience to whom Jesus is speaking, consisting of His disciples and a larger crowd gathered to hear His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_setting.htm">The Setting</a></b><br>This teaching takes place on a level place, possibly in the region of Judea or Galilee, where Jesus often taught the multitudes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_complacency.htm">The Danger of Complacency</a></b><br>Jesus warns against finding comfort in worldly satisfaction.

This saying points to men who used their wealth for self-indulgence, for the mere gratification of the senses. "The fulness," writes Dean Plumptre, "is the satiety of over-indulgence." <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and</span> <span class="cmt_word">weep.</span> These are they who, proudly self-satisfied, dreamed that they needed nothing, neither repentance in themselves nor forgiveness from God - a character too faithfully represented in the self-satisfied, haughty Pharisee of the time of our Lord, a character, alas! not extinct even when the hapless men to whom the Lord specially referred had paid the awful penalty of extinction of name and race, loss of home and wealth. The hunger, the mourning, and the weeping were terribly realized in the case of the men and their proud houses in the national war with Rome which quickly followed the public teaching of Jesus. When the Master spoke the words of this sermon the date was about A.D. -31. In A.D. - that is, within forty years - Jerusalem, its temple, and its beautiful houses, were a mass of shapeless ruins. Its people, rich and poor, were ruined. Its very name, as a city and nation, blotted out. But from parables, and still more from direct words, we gather, too, that the hunger, the mourning, and the weeping point to the cheerless state of things in which those poor souls who have lived alone for this world will find themselves after death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/6-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Woe</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#8016;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Ouai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3759.htm">Strong's 3759: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woe!, alas!, uttered in grief or denunciation.
