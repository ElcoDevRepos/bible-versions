The term "ascension" refers to Jesus' return to heaven, which is detailed in <a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>. This event marks the completion of His earthly mission and the beginning of His heavenly reign. The anticipation of this event underscores the divine plan and purpose that Jesus was fulfilling. The use of "approached" suggests a divine timetable, emphasizing God's sovereignty over the events of Jesus' life. This moment is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, which speaks of the Messiah's exaltation.<p><b>Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem</b><br>The phrase "resolutely set out" highlights Jesus' determination and commitment to His mission. Despite knowing the suffering and crucifixion that awaited Him in Jerusalem, Jesus willingly chose to go. This determination is a testament to His obedience to the Father's will, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>. Jerusalem is significant as the city where many prophets were martyred (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>) and where Jesus would fulfill His role as the sacrificial Lamb (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).

It can here refer to nothing else, and the passage, as occurring in the midst of a narrative, is remarkable. It is as though St. Luke looked on all that follows as seen in the light of the Ascension.

It at once marks off all that now follows as a winding-up of the earthly ministry. The expression, "that he should be received up," is simply the rendering of one Greek word, which signifies "ascension." The Passion, the cross, and the grave are passed over here, and the glorious goal alone is spoken cf. What a lesson of comfort is here suggested! The words in the Greek original, "he steadfastly set his face," are evidently literally translated from a well-known Aramaic (Hebrew) expression. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-51.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
