Leprosy was a highly stigmatized disease, and those afflicted were required to live outside the community, often in isolation. Raising their voices indicates both the physical distance they had to maintain and the desperation of their plea. This act of calling out is reminiscent of other biblical instances where individuals in need cry out to God, such as the blind man in <a href="/luke/18-38.htm">Luke 18:38</a>. It demonstrates faith and recognition of Jesus' authority and ability to heal.<p><b>shouting</b><br>The act of shouting underscores the urgency and intensity of their request. In the cultural context, shouting was a common way to express deep emotion or need, especially when seeking divine intervention. This public display of desperation highlights their belief that Jesus could provide the help they needed. It also reflects the communal nature of their plea, as all ten lepers are united in their cry for help.<p><b>&#8220;Jesus, Master</b><br>By addressing Jesus as "Master," the lepers acknowledge His authority and power. The term "Master" (Greek: epistates) is used in the Gospels to denote someone with authority, often in a teaching or leadership capacity. This title reflects their recognition of Jesus' divine authority, similar to how the disciples addressed Him in <a href="/luke/8-24.htm">Luke 8:24</a>. It indicates a level of respect and faith in His ability to heal and command over illness.<p><b>have mercy on us!&#8221;</b><br>The plea for mercy is a common biblical theme, often associated with requests for healing or forgiveness. Mercy, in this context, implies compassion and relief from suffering. The lepers' request echoes the cries for mercy found throughout the Psalms, such as <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51:1</a>, where David asks for God's mercy. This plea is not just for physical healing but also for restoration to the community and spiritual renewal. It reflects the broader biblical narrative of God's compassion and willingness to restore those who seek Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ten_lepers.htm">The Ten Lepers</a></b><br>A group of men afflicted with leprosy, a severe skin disease that led to social isolation and religious impurity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_border_between_samaria_and_galilee.htm">The Border between Samaria and Galilee</a></b><br>The geographical setting of this event, highlighting the cultural and religious tensions between Jews and Samaritans.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cry_for_mercy.htm">The Cry for Mercy</a></b><br>The lepers' plea to Jesus, acknowledging His authority and their need for healing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognition_of_authority.htm">Recognition of Authority</a></b><br>The lepers address Jesus as "Master," acknowledging His divine authority and power to heal.
