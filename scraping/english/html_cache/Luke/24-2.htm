In Jewish burial customs, a large stone was typically rolled in front of the entrance to a tomb to protect the body from animals and grave robbers. This stone was likely very heavy, requiring several men to move it. The fact that the women found the stone already rolled away suggests divine intervention, as it would have been impossible for them to move it alone. This aligns with the angelic involvement described in other Gospel accounts (<a href="/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2</a>).<p><b>rolled away</b><br>The rolling away of the stone symbolizes the removal of barriers between humanity and God. It signifies the opening of the way to eternal life through Jesus Christ's resurrection. This act fulfills Jesus' prophecy about His resurrection (<a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31</a>) and demonstrates His victory over death. The stone being rolled away is not to let Jesus out, but to let witnesses in, confirming the empty tomb.<p><b>from the tomb,</b><br>The tomb, likely a rock-hewn cave, was a common burial practice for the wealthy in first-century Judea. Joseph of Arimathea, a wealthy man and a member of the Sanhedrin, provided his own new tomb for Jesus' burial (<a href="/matthew/27-57.htm">Matthew 27:57-60</a>). The empty tomb is a central piece of evidence for the resurrection, a cornerstone of Christian faith. The resurrection fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, which speaks of God not allowing His Holy One to see decay. The empty tomb is a testament to the power of God and the truth of Jesus' promise of resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_women.htm">The Women</a></b><br>The women who came to the tomb early in the morning, including Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, as mentioned in the surrounding verses.

It had been recently hewn out of a rock, the low ridge opposite the slight ascent of Calvary. "In front of a tomb belonging to a rich family there was generally a vestibule open to the air, then a low entrance sometimes, as in this case, on the side of a rock, leading into a square chamber of moderate dimensions, on one side of which was a place for the body, either cut some seven feet into the rock, or lengthways, three feet deep, with a low arch over it... The tomb had been lately made, and the door which closed the entrance, the only aperture into the tomb, was a large stone" ('Speaker's Commentary,' on <a href="/matthew/27-60.htm">Matthew 27:60</a>). Recent investigations in Jerusalem serve to confirm the accuracy of the original traditional sites. (comp. Williams, 'Holy City,' 2:240; Professor Willis, 'Treatise on the Holy Sepulchre,' etc.). We find the following passage in the Bordeaux Pilgrim (A.D. 333): "On the left side (of the original Church of the Holy Sepulchre) is the hillock Golgotha, where the Lord was crucified. Thence about a stone-throw distance is the crypt where his body was deposited." St. Cyril of Jerusalem makes several references to the spot. In the days of Eusebius (first half of the fourth century) there was no doubt as to the site. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They found</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8023;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(heuron)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2147.htm">Strong's 2147: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary heuro, which heureo is used for it in all the tenses except the present and imperfect to find.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
