The Greek word for "amazement" here can also be translated as "astonishment" or "ecstasy," indicating a profound emotional response. This reaction is consistent with other instances in the Gospels where Jesus performs miracles, such as in <a href="/mark/1-27.htm">Mark 1:27</a> and <a href="/matthew/9-8.htm">Matthew 9:8</a>, where the crowds are similarly amazed. The amazement reflects the divine authority and power of Jesus, which was unprecedented and challenged the religious norms of the time.<p><b>and glorified God.</b><br>The glorification of God by the crowd highlights the recognition of divine intervention in the miracle. In Jewish culture, giving glory to God was a common response to witnessing His works, as seen in Psalms 86:12 and <a href="/isaiah/25.htm">Isaiah 25:1</a>. This acknowledgment serves as a testament to Jesus' role as the Messiah, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which speak of the coming of one who will perform miraculous healings. The act of glorifying God also underscores the theological theme that Jesus' miracles were not just acts of compassion but signs pointing to His divine nature and mission.<p><b>They were filled with awe</b><br>The awe experienced by the crowd is indicative of a deep reverence and fear, often associated with encountering the divine. This reaction is similar to the fear and wonder seen in other biblical accounts of divine encounters, such as Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>) and the shepherds at the announcement of Jesus' birth (<a href="/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9</a>). The awe signifies a recognition of the holy and the supernatural, reinforcing the idea that Jesus' actions were not merely human but carried divine significance.<p><b>and said, &#8220;We have seen remarkable things today.&#8221;</b><br>The declaration of having seen "remarkable things" emphasizes the extraordinary nature of Jesus' miracle. The term "remarkable" can also be translated as "paradoxical" or "unbelievable," suggesting that what they witnessed defied natural explanation. This statement connects to the broader narrative of Jesus' ministry, where His works consistently reveal the Kingdom of God breaking into the world. It also echoes the prophetic anticipation of the Messiah performing signs and wonders, as foretold in passages like <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>. The crowd's acknowledgment serves as a witness to the authenticity and authority of Jesus' ministry, inviting others to believe in His message and mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /

mat, and go home&#8221; (<a href="/luke/5-24.htm">Luke 5:24</a>), every eye in the packed house watched the man stand, roll up his bed, and walk out.<p>&#8226; Luke often notes how crowds reacted to Jesus&#8217; miracles&#8212;see <a href="/luke/4-36.htm">Luke 4:36 and 7</a>:16.<p>&#8226; Mark&#8217;s parallel account adds, &#8220;they were all amazed and glorified God&#8221; (<a

the newborn Messiah (<a href="/luke/2-20.htm">Luke 2:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The woman bent double for eighteen years &#8220;began glorifying God&#8221; when Jesus straightened her (<a href="/luke/13-13.htm">Luke 13:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Matthew records that when the crowd saw the paralytic walk, &#8220;they were afraid and glorified God, who had given such authority to men&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/9-8.htm">Matthew 9:8</a>).<p>God receives the glory because the miracle unmistakably displays His hand at work through His Son (<a href="/john/11-40.htm">John 11:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They were filled with awe</b><p>This awe is a holy fear&#8212;a recognition that God has invaded ordinary space.<p>&#8226; After Jesus raised the widow&#8217;s son, &#8220;fear swept over all of them&#8221; (<a href="/luke/7-16.htm">Luke 7:16</a>).<p>&#8226; When signs accompanied the early church, &#8220;fear came upon every soul&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-43.htm">Acts

color="#eeeeee"><b>We have seen remarkable things today</b><p>The crowd&#8217;s confession sums up the entire scene: the visible proof of the invisible claim that &#8220;the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins&#8221; (<a href="/luke/5-24.htm">Luke 5:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Nicodemus later echoes this: &#8220;No one could perform the signs You are doing if God were not with him&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The disciples will shout similar praise on Palm Sunday for &#8220;all the miracles they had seen&#8221; (<a href="/luke/19-37.htm">Luke 19:37</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;remarkable things&#8221; points not only to the healing but to the forgiveness granted&#8212;a marvel even greater than restored legs (<a
