In biblical literature, "behold" often signals a significant revelation or divine action. It invites the listener or reader to pay close attention to the message being delivered.<p><b>I am sending the promise of My Father upon you.</b><br>The "promise of My Father" refers to the Holy Spirit, as prophesied in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>) and reiterated by Jesus in His teachings (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17, 26</a>). This promise is a fulfillment of God's covenant to empower His people. The sending of the Holy Spirit marks a new era in salvation history, where believers are equipped for ministry and witness. The phrase underscores the Trinitarian work in salvation, with the Father promising, the Son sending, and the Spirit empowering.<p><b>But remain in the city</b><br>The city referred to is Jerusalem, a central location in Jewish religious life and the site of significant biblical events. Jesus instructs His disciples to stay there, highlighting Jerusalem's role as the starting point for the spread of the Gospel (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). This instruction also aligns with the Jewish festival of Pentecost, which would soon occur, providing a strategic moment for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.<p><b>until you have been clothed with power from on high.&#8221;</b><br>"Clothed with power" is a metaphorical expression indicating being endowed or equipped with divine strength and authority. This power is the Holy Spirit, who enables the disciples to carry out their mission (<a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2:1-4</a>). "From on high" signifies the heavenly origin of this power, emphasizing its divine source. This empowerment fulfills Jesus' promise and prepares the disciples for their role in the early church, as seen in the Acts of the Apostles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples after His resurrection, preparing them for the coming of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' words, they are instructed to wait in Jerusalem for the fulfillment of God's promise.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promise_of_the_father.htm">The Promise of the Father</a></b><br>Refers to the Holy Spirit, whom Jesus promised would come to empower the disciples for their mission.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the disciples are instructed to remain until they receive the Holy Spirit, significant as the starting point of the early church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The "power from on high" that will clothe the disciples, enabling them to carry out their mission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Jesus instructs the disciples to remain in Jerusalem, highlighting the importance of obedience to God's timing and instructions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit is essential for empowering believers to fulfill God's mission.

He wants His followers to stop, look, and take seriously what comes next. Throughout Scripture, such a word signals a pivotal revelation (see <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>).
