Parables are a common teaching method used by Jesus to convey spiritual truths through everyday stories. They often require interpretation and are designed to reveal truths to those who are spiritually receptive while concealing them from those who are not.<p><b>A man of noble birth</b><br>The man of noble birth represents Jesus Himself, who is of divine origin and royal lineage. This phrase emphasizes His authority and rightful claim to kingship. In the cultural context, noble birth would imply a person of significant status and potential inheritance, aligning with Jesus' identity as the Son of God and the promised Messiah.<p><b>Went to a distant country</b><br>This reflects Jesus' ascension to heaven after His resurrection. The "distant country" symbolizes the heavenly realm where Jesus goes to receive His kingdom. It also alludes to the Jewish understanding of the Messiah's departure and return, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the Son of Man approaches the Ancient of Days to receive dominion.<p><b>To lay claim to his kingship</b><br>This phrase indicates the purpose of the nobleman's journey. It parallels Jesus' mission to establish His kingdom, which is both a present spiritual reality and a future physical reign. The concept of kingship is central to biblical prophecy, with Jesus fulfilling the role of the eternal King promised in the Davidic Covenant (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>And then return</b><br>The return signifies the Second Coming of Christ, when He will fully establish His kingdom on earth. This expectation of return is a key element of Christian eschatology, providing hope and motivation for believers to live faithfully. The parable encourages readiness and stewardship in anticipation of the King's return, as seen in other teachings of Jesus, such as the Parable of the Ten Virgins (<a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/a_man_of_noble_birth.htm">A Man of Noble Birth</a></b><br>This figure represents Jesus Christ, who is of divine origin and rightful heir to the kingdom of God.

There are, however, many noticeable differences in detail. At the outset we have the new feature of the nobleman going "into a far country to receive a kingdom." This had an obvious starting-point in the recent history of Judaea. Both the Tetrarch Antipas and Archelaus, on the death of their father, had gone to Rome to submit their claims to the kingdom to the decision of Augustus (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xvii. 9, ?? 3, 4). The Greek for "nobleman" is not the same as in <a href="/john/4-46.htm" title="So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.">John 4:46</a>, where the word means a "king's officer." Here it is simply a "man of noble family." In the interpretation of the parable we may see a prophetic announcement by our Lord of His own departure to the "far country," that lay behind the veil, to receive His Kingdom, and of His subsequent return.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He said therefore, A certain noblemen went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return</span>. There was a singular fitness in the Master's choice of a framework for his parable, which at first sight would seem strange and unreal. Two nobles, Herod and Archelaus, in that age had literally gone from Jericho, where the Speaker of the parable-story then was, to a far country across the sea - to Rome, to receive a kingdom from Caesar (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 14:14; 17:9). And one of these two nobles, Archelaus, had rebuilt the stately royal palace of Jericho, under the very shadow of which the Speaker and the crowds were perhaps standing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/19-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
