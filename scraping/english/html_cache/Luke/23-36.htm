Mockery was a common form of humiliation in Roman crucifixions, intended to degrade the victim. This act fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a>, "All who see me mock me; they hurl insults, shaking their heads." The soldiers' actions reflect the broader rejection of Jesus as the Messiah, as seen throughout the Gospels. Their mockery underscores the spiritual blindness of humanity and the rejection of divine authority, echoing the scorn Jesus faced from religious leaders and the crowd.<p><b>and came up to offer Him sour wine</b><br>Sour wine, or vinegar, was a cheap, common drink for soldiers and the poor, often used to quench thirst. This act fulfills <a href="/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>, "They gave me vinegar for my thirst." The offering of sour wine can be seen as both an act of mockery and a small gesture of mercy, as it was intended to prolong life and suffering. This moment connects to the broader theme of Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and His role as the suffering servant. It also highlights the stark contrast between the soldiers' actions and the spiritual significance of Jesus' sacrifice, as He endures physical and emotional torment for the redemption of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_soldiers.htm">The Soldiers</a></b><br>Roman soldiers who were responsible for carrying out crucifixions.

But still, they knew not what they did, and did but follow, after their nature, in the path in which others led the way. Possibly too, rude as their natures were, there was a touch of rough kindliness mingling in their mockery, as shown in the offer of the vinegar, or sour wine, which they had brought for their own use (see Note on <a href="/matthew/27-48.htm" title="And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.">Matthew 27:48</a>)--unless, indeed, we suppose the refinement of cruelty which held it before the eyes of the Sufferer, but did not, as afterwards, convey it to His lips.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar</span>.

This was evidently a draught prepared with narcotics and stupefying drugs, no doubt by some of those compassionate women addressed by him on his way to the cross as "daughters of Jerusalem," a common work of mercy at that time, and one apparently permitted by the guards. This, St. Matthew tells us, "he tasted of," no doubt in courteous recognition of the kindly purpose of the act, but he refused to do more than taste of it. He would not dull the sense of pain, or cloud the clearness of his communion with his Father in that last awful hour. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The second, mentioned here by St. Luke, seems to imply that the soldiers mocked his agony of thirst - one of the tortures induced by crucifixion - by lifting up to his parched, fevered lips, vessels containing their sour wine, and then snatching them hastily away. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The third (<a href="/john/19-28.htm">John 19:28-30</a>) relates that here the Lord, utterly exhausted, asked for and received this last refreshment, which revived, for a very brief space, his fast failing powers, and gave him strength for his last utterances. The soldiers, perhaps acting under the orders of the compassionate centurion in command, perhaps touched with awe by the brave patience and strange dignity of the dying Lord, did him this last kindly office. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/23-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
