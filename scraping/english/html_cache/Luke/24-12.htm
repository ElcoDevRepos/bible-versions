Peter's action reflects his impulsive and passionate nature, often depicted in the Gospels. The urgency in his response underscores the significance of the resurrection event. The act of running indicates the importance and urgency of verifying the women's testimony. In the cultural context, it was unusual for a man of Peter's age and status to run, suggesting the deep emotional impact of the news. This moment is also a fulfillment of Jesus' earlier prediction that Peter would be a foundational leader in the early church (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>).<p><b>And after bending down and seeing only the linen cloths,</b><br>The act of bending down suggests the low entrance of the tomb, typical of first-century Jewish burial sites. The linen cloths are significant as they indicate that Jesus' body was not stolen; grave robbers would not have left the valuable linen behind. This detail aligns with the account in <a href="/john/20-6.htm">John 20:6-7</a>, where the cloths are described as lying separately, suggesting an orderly departure rather than a hasty removal. The presence of the linen cloths also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, which speaks of the Holy One not seeing decay, implying resurrection rather than corruption.<p><b>he went away,</b><br>Peter's departure from the tomb signifies a moment of contemplation and confusion. Unlike the women who encountered angels, Peter's experience is more subdued, leaving him in a state of wonder. This reflects the initial struggle to comprehend the resurrection, a theme present in all Gospel accounts. Peter's leaving the tomb without immediate understanding highlights the gradual revelation of the resurrection's significance to the disciples.<p><b>wondering to himself what had happened.</b><br>This phrase captures Peter's internal conflict and amazement. The Greek term used for "wondering" implies a deep pondering or marveling, indicating that Peter is processing the implications of the empty tomb. This moment of reflection is crucial as it sets the stage for Peter's later encounters with the risen Christ, which will transform his understanding and faith. The resurrection was a fulfillment of Jesus' predictions (<a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31</a>), yet it was so unprecedented that even those closest to Him struggled to grasp it initially. This internal wonderment is a precursor to the fuller revelation and understanding that will come with the appearances of the risen Jesus and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his impulsive nature and deep devotion.
