In biblical context, it reflects the idea that God's truth and justice will ultimately prevail. This aligns with the teachings found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>, where it is stated that God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing. The phrase also serves as a warning to believers to live transparently and righteously, as all actions and intentions will eventually be revealed.<p><b>and nothing concealed that will not be made known</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the inevitability of divine revelation. It suggests that all secrets, whether good or bad, will be exposed. This is consistent with the theme found in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>, where Paul speaks of the Lord bringing to light what is hidden in darkness and exposing the motives of the heart. Historically, this would have resonated with early Christians who faced persecution and needed reassurance that truth and justice would ultimately triumph.<p><b>and brought to light</b><br>The imagery of light is significant throughout Scripture, often symbolizing truth, purity, and the presence of God. In <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, Jesus refers to Himself as the "light of the world," indicating that He is the source of truth and revelation. This phrase assures believers that God's light will penetrate all darkness, revealing the true nature of all things.

The Master's words surely promise that, as the ages advance, more and ever more light on the subject of God's dealings with men will be vouchsafed to the humble, patient searcher after the Divine wisdom. This apophthegm seems to have been a very favourite one of our Lord; he evidently used it on several occasions (see, for instance, <a href="/matthew/10-26.htm">Matthew 10:26</a>, where the same words are reported to have been spoken in a different connection). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#940;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
