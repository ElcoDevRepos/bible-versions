The tax collector's choice to stand at a distance reflects his awareness of his social and spiritual status, acknowledging his unworthiness to approach God closely. This act of standing apart symbolizes humility and repentance, contrasting with the Pharisee's self-righteousness earlier in the passage.<p><b>unwilling even to lift up his eyes to heaven</b><br>In Jewish culture, lifting one's eyes to heaven was a common posture of prayer, signifying a direct appeal to God. The tax collector's reluctance to do so indicates profound shame and contrition. This posture is reminiscent of other biblical figures who express deep humility and repentance, such as Ezra (<a href="/ezra/9-6.htm">Ezra 9:6</a>) and the psalmist (<a href="/psalms/123.htm">Psalm 123:1-2</a>).<p><b>Instead, he beat his breast</b><br>Beating one's breast was a gesture of extreme sorrow and penitence in ancient Jewish culture. It is a physical manifestation of inner turmoil and regret, often associated with mourning or deep repentance. This action underscores the tax collector's sincere acknowledgment of his sinfulness and his desire for forgiveness.<p><b>and said, &#8216;God, have mercy on me, a sinner!&#8217;</b><br>The plea for mercy is central to the tax collector's prayer, highlighting his recognition of his need for God's grace. The term "mercy" here is linked to the concept of atonement and forgiveness, echoing the sacrificial system of the Old Testament where mercy was sought through offerings. The acknowledgment of being "a sinner" aligns with the biblical understanding that all have sinned (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>) and need redemption. This prayer is a model of genuine repentance and faith, contrasting with the self-justification of the Pharisee.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tax_collector.htm">Tax Collector</a></b><br>A despised figure in Jewish society, often seen as a traitor for working with the Roman authorities and known for extortion.

So might some "forlorn and desperate castaway" crouch, at some solemn service, in the remote corner of the nave of a cathedral. He, too, stood, for that was the received attitude of prayer, and kneeling, at such a time and in that place, would have been ostentatious.<p><span class= "bld">Would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven.</span>--There is a subtle delineation of what one may call the physiognomy of repentance, which should not pass unnoticed.

So men strike their chest, when suffering from cold, to quicken the circulation of the blood. As being spontaneous and involuntary, it attested the reality of the emotion, and contrasted with the calm, fixed attitude of the Pharisee.<p><span class= "bld">God be merciful to me a sinner.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">to me the sinner,</span> as though, like St. Paul, he singled out his own guilt as exceptional, and thought of himself as "the chief of sinners" (<a href="/1_timothy/1-15.htm" title="This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.">1Timothy 1:15</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner!</span> Utterly sad and heart-broken, the publican neither recounts nor thinks of good kind deeds done, or special sins committed; no thoughts came into that poor heart, such as, "I have done some fair deeds; I am not altogether vile and sinful." He felt that with him evil so far overbalanced good that he could make no plea for himself, and yet he, too, longed for salvation, so he threw himself wholly upon God's mercy and love in his sad prayer, "God be merciful to me the sinner!" for so the words should be rendered. Different to the Pharisee, who thought himself better than his neighbours, this man, in his sad humility, evidently thought other men better than himself, but still he so trusted in God that he felt even for him, the sinner, there might be mercy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/18-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
