It highlights the urgency and tension of the moment. Jesus had been preparing His disciples for His impending arrest and crucifixion, emphasizing the fulfillment of prophecy and the necessity of His sacrifice. The timing underscores the divine orchestration of events, as Jesus' words are interrupted by the arrival of those who would arrest Him.<p><b>a crowd arrived</b><br>The crowd likely consisted of Roman soldiers, temple guards, and officials from the chief priests and Pharisees. This diverse group reflects the collaboration between Jewish religious leaders and Roman authorities in the arrest of Jesus. The presence of a crowd also signifies the public nature of Jesus' arrest, setting the stage for the subsequent trials and crucifixion. The crowd's arrival fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-2</a>, where the nations conspire against the Lord and His Anointed.<p><b>led by the man called Judas</b><br>Judas Iscariot, one of Jesus' twelve disciples, is identified as the leader of the group. His role as the betrayer fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, where a close friend turns against the Messiah. Judas' leadership in this moment highlights the gravity of his betrayal, as he guides the authorities to Jesus, whom he had followed and learned from for three years.<p><b>one of the Twelve</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the intimacy of Judas' betrayal. As one of the Twelve, Judas was part of Jesus' inner circle, entrusted with responsibilities and privy to Jesus' teachings and miracles. His betrayal is particularly poignant because it comes from within Jesus' closest group of followers, illustrating the theme of betrayal and the fulfillment of <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a>, which speaks of the thirty pieces of silver and the potter's field.<p><b>He approached Jesus to kiss Him</b><br>The kiss was a customary greeting in Jewish culture, symbolizing respect and affection. Judas' use of a kiss as a signal for Jesus' arrest is a profound act of treachery, turning a gesture of friendship into one of betrayal. This act fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/55-12.htm">Psalm 55:12-14</a>, where betrayal comes from a close companion. The kiss also serves as a type of the false peace offered by the world, contrasting with the true peace that Jesus provides.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is about to be betrayed and arrested.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of the Twelve Apostles, who betrays Jesus with a kiss, fulfilling the prophecy of betrayal.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A group of people, including chief priests, officers of the temple guard, and elders, who come to arrest Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_garden_of_gethsemane.htm">The Garden of Gethsemane</a></b><br>The place where Jesus often went to pray and where this event of betrayal takes place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kiss.htm">The Kiss</a></b><br>A gesture of greeting and respect, used here by Judas as a sign to identify Jesus to the arresting crowd.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_betrayal.htm">The Nature of Betrayal</a></b><br>Betrayal often comes from those closest to us, as seen in Judas's actions.

The general effect on the thoughtful reader is that the Crucifixion and the events leading up to it were very far from being the result of the counsels of the Jewish leaders, the outcome of their relentless enmity. The death and all the attendant circumstances took place in their solemn order, then, when the public teaching of the Redeemer was finished, <span class="accented">because</span> it had been determined by some higher and grander power than was possessed by Jerusalem Sanhedrin or Roman Senate. So St. Matthew, in his account, twice (Matthew 26:54, 56) gives the ground for the arrest, "That the Scriptures might be fulfilled." And the Scriptures were but the echoes of that other and grander power. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And while he yet spake, behold a multitude</span>. Different to his disciples, their Master, who had prayed and received as an answer to his prayer the angel's visit, was now, when the hour of mortal danger struck, in possession of the profoundest calm. No. thing disturbed his serenity any more. With calm majesty he advanced to meet the traitor as he guided his Master's deadly enemies into the garden. From this hour Jesus welcomes the cross, from which for a brief moment he had seemed to shrink. The corn-pony who was thus guided to Gethsemane to effect the arrest in the dead of the night was composed of Roman legionaries detailed for this duty from a cohort on guard in the Antonia Fort by the temple, and of Levitical guards belonging to the temple - an armed force of police, part of the temple watch at the disposal of the priests. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">that was called Judas, one of the twelve.</span> Each of the evangelists mention the presence of the traitor. It was evidently a strange and startling detail for the writers of these memoirs that one of the chosen twelve should have been the betrayer! And drew near unto Jesus to kiss him. This was the sign agreed upon between Judas and his employers. They knew that it would be night, and that Gethsemane was shaded with olives, and that therefore some conspicuous sign would be necessary to indicate to the guards which of the company of twelve was the Master whom they were to seize. But the signal was superfluous, for, as St. John tells us, Jesus of his own accord advanced before the others, telling those who came for him who he was. Because of this kiss the early Christian Church discontinued the customary brotherly kiss on Good Friday. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/22-47.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">While</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7964;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Eti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2089.htm">Strong's 2089: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) of time: still, yet, even now, (b) of degree: even, further, more, in addition.
