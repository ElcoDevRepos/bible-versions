In Jewish tradition, the Messiah was anticipated to establish a reign of peace and prosperity. Jesus, however, addresses a misconception about His mission. The question is rhetorical, prompting listeners to reconsider their understanding of His purpose. This echoes the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, where the Messiah is called the "Prince of Peace," yet here, Jesus clarifies that His immediate mission involves a different kind of impact. The peace He offers is spiritual and internal, not necessarily societal or political.<p><b>No, I tell you, but division.</b><br>Jesus introduces the concept of division as a necessary consequence of His ministry. This division is not a contradiction to His role as the Prince of Peace but highlights the reality of human response to His message. The division arises from differing reactions to the Gospel, as seen in families and communities where some accept and others reject His teachings. This is further illustrated in <a href="/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34-36</a>, where Jesus speaks of setting family members against each other. The division is a result of the truth confronting sin and the world&#8217;s values, leading to a separation between those who follow Christ and those who do not. This division is a fulfillment of prophecy and a type of the refining process that distinguishes true believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing His disciples and followers, challenging their expectations of His mission.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing those who are committed to following Him and learning from His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/earth.htm">Earth</a></b><br>Symbolically represents the world and its systems, which are often in opposition to the Kingdom of God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/division.htm">Division</a></b><br>The result of Jesus' coming, as His message and mission create a clear distinction between those who accept Him and those who reject Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_jesus'_mission.htm">Understanding Jesus' Mission</a></b><br>Jesus' mission was not to bring superficial peace but to challenge the status quo and call people to a decision about Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">The Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>Following Jesus may lead to division, even among close relationships, as His truth demands a response that can separate believers from non-believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_discernment.htm">Spiritual Discernment</a></b><br>Believers are called to discern the truth of Jesus' message and stand firm, even when it leads to conflict or division.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/peace_vs._division.htm">Peace vs. Division</a></b><br>True peace comes from reconciliation with God through Christ, which may initially result in division as people respond differently to the Gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_christ.htm">Commitment to Christ</a></b><br>Believers must prioritize their commitment to Christ above all else, understanding that this may lead to difficult choices and divisions.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_12_51_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 12:51?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_12_51_Rethink_Jesus_mission.htm">How does Luke 12:51 challenge our understanding of Jesus' mission on earth?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_can_Christ_s_teachings_divide.htm">In what ways can division be a result of following Christ's teachings?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Luke_12_51_to_Matt_10_34_s_sword.htm">How does Luke 12:51 relate to Matthew 10:34 about bringing a sword?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Preparing_for_family_faith_divisions.htm">How can believers prepare for divisions within families due to faith in Christ?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prioritize_faith_in_family_conflict.htm">What practical steps can we take to prioritize faith amidst familial conflict?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_12_51_vs_Jesus_peace_message.htm">How does Luke 12:51 align with Jesus' message of peace and love?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_Jesus_mention_division_in_Luke.htm">Why does Jesus say He brings division in Luke 12:51?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_explains_Luke_12_51_s_split.htm">What historical context explains the division mentioned in Luke 12:51?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_12.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'obey_god,_not_men'_mean.htm">What did Jesus mean by bringing a sword, not peace?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_division,_unity.htm">What does the Bible say about division and unity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_did_jesus_mean_by_'bring_a_sword'.htm">What did Jesus mean by bringing a sword, not peace?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_did_jesus_say_he_brings_division.htm">If Jesus is the Prince of Peace, why did He say He came to bring "division" (Luke 12:51-53)?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Luke 12:51 Mean</div><b>Do you think</b><p>Jesus opens with a probing question.

Yet Jesus distinguishes two kinds of peace:<p>&#8226; Peace with God&#8212;secured through His atoning work (<a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Peace in circumstances&#8212;which will not be universal until His second coming (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>).<p>Other passages echo this tension: He offers &#8220;My peace&#8221; to believers (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>), yet warns of tribulation in the world (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>). The immediate mission, therefore, is reconciliation, not social tranquility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>No, I tell you, but division.</b><p>Truth always divides between belief and unbelief. Jesus states it plainly:<p>&#8220;From now on five in one household will be divided, three against two and two against three&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-52.htm">Luke 12:52</a>; cf. <a href="/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34-36</a>).<p>&#8226; Familial division&#8212;parents, children, siblings may part over allegiance to Christ.<p>&#8226; Religious division&#8212;synagogues then, secular culture now, split over the exclusivity of the gospel (<a href="/john/9-16.htm">John 9:16</a>; <a href="/acts/14-4.htm">Acts 14:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Personal division&#8212;within every heart, the word &#8220;cuts&#8221; like a sword, exposing motives (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>).<p>The Lord does not celebrate conflict, yet He refuses to dilute truth to avoid it.

Peace with God is available now through Christ, but unified earthly peace awaits His return. Until then, loyalty to Jesus inevitably creates division between those who submit to His lordship and those who reject it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(51-53) <span class= "bld">Suppose ye that I am come to give peace?</span>--See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/10-34.htm" title="Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.">Matthew 10:34-35</a>.

"I have been dwelling on the troublous times quickly coming on. Do not deceive yourselves, my disciples; the great change about to be inaugurated will only be carried out in war and by divisions in the individual house as in the nation. I bring not peace, but a sword, remember." And then follows a curious picture of a home torn asunder by the conflict of thought which would spring up as the result of the cross and of the preaching of the cross. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/12-51.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Do you think</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Dokeite)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1380.htm">Strong's 1380: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary verb, doko dok'-o of the same meaning; to think; by implication, to seem.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have come</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#951;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(paregenom&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3854.htm">Strong's 3854: </a> </span><span class="str2">From para and ginomai; to become near, i.e. Approach; by implication, to appear publicly.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to bring</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(dounai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Infinitive Active<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1325.htm">Strong's 1325: </a> </span><span class="str2">To offer, give; I put, place.
