The speakers are religious leaders, likely the chief priests, scribes, and elders, who were often in opposition to Jesus. Their approach is confrontational, reflecting the tension between Jesus and the Jewish authorities. This demand for an explanation is a common theme in the Gospels, where Jesus is frequently questioned by those in power.<p><b>&#8220;by what authority are You doing these things,</b><br>The question of authority is central to this passage. In Jewish culture, authority was derived from lineage, education, or appointment by religious leaders. Jesus' actions, such as cleansing the temple and teaching with authority, challenged the established religious order. This question reflects the leaders' concern over Jesus' influence and the threat He posed to their authority. The concept of authority is also significant in the broader biblical narrative, as Jesus' authority is divine, fulfilling prophecies such as those in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>, which speak of a ruler with divine authority.<p><b>and who gave You this authority?&#8221;</b><br>This part of the question seeks to identify the source of Jesus' authority. In Jewish tradition, authority was often passed down through recognized channels, such as rabbinical ordination. The leaders' question implies skepticism about Jesus' legitimacy. However, Jesus' authority comes directly from God, as seen in His baptism (<a href="/luke/3-21.htm">Luke 3:21-22</a>) and transfiguration (<a href="/luke/9-28.htm">Luke 9:28-36</a>), where God's voice affirms Him.
