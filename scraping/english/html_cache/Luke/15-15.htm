In the cultural context of the time, hiring oneself out was often a last resort for those in desperate need. The act of hiring oneself out suggests a loss of status and independence, highlighting the son's fall from wealth to poverty. This mirrors the spiritual journey of those who turn away from God, emphasizing the consequences of sin and the need for repentance.<p><b>to a citizen of that country</b><br>The mention of a "citizen of that country" underscores the son's alienation from his own people and heritage. In Jewish culture, associating with Gentiles was often seen as undesirable, and this detail highlights the depth of the son's estrangement. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of exile and separation from God, as seen in the experiences of Israel in the Old Testament.<p><b>who sent him into his fields</b><br>Being sent into the fields signifies a menial and degrading task, especially for someone of Jewish heritage. Fields were often associated with hard labor and servitude, contrasting sharply with the son's previous life of ease. This imagery is reminiscent of the Israelites' bondage in Egypt, serving as a metaphor for the bondage of sin.<p><b>to feed the pigs</b><br>Feeding pigs would have been particularly abhorrent to a Jewish audience, as pigs were considered unclean animals according to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7</a>). This task symbolizes the depth of the son's degradation and the spiritual impurity he has reached. It serves as a powerful illustration of the consequences of turning away from God and the depths to which sin can lead. The imagery of uncleanness also foreshadows the need for redemption and cleansing, themes central to the message of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prodigal_son.htm">The Prodigal Son</a></b><br>A young man who, after squandering his inheritance, finds himself in dire need and hires himself out to a foreigner.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/citizen_of_that_country.htm">Citizen of that Country</a></b><br>A resident of the foreign land where the prodigal son finds himself.

The son of Abraham had to depend upon the bounty of an alien. In the two lines of interpretation, the "citizen" is one who all along has been of the world, worldly, living for no higher end than gain or pleasure. The prodigal is as one who, called to a higher life, has forfeited its blessedness, and now depends for such joy as he is capable of on those who are more completely identified with evil. It is, perhaps, natural that as we diverge more widely from the primary scope of the parable, its application in detail should become more difficult; and looking at the parable, as giving an outline of the history of the human race, one fails to see who answers to the "citizen." Not the Tempter, the great author of the world's evil, for the citizen is one of many. Nor is it the part of the citizen here to tempt to evil, but rather to be half-unconsciously God's instrument in punishing it--half-unconsciously, again, the means of preserving the evil-doer from perishing, and so of making a subsequent deliverance possible. It is truer to facts, therefore, to see in the "citizen" the representative of the wisdom and knowledge, maxims of worldly prudence or principles of ethics without religion, which for a time sustain the soul, and "still the hungry edge of appetite," and keep it from sinking utterly, while yet they leave it in its wretchedness and do not satisfy its cravings.<p><span class= "bld">To feed swine.</span>--We feel at once the shudder that would pass through the hearers of the parable as they listened to these words. Could there be for an Israelite a greater depth of debasement? In the inner teaching of the parable, this perhaps implies a state in which the man's will and energies have but the one work of ministering to his baser appetites. Such, in the long-run, is the outcome of the wisdom described in the previous note as answering to the "citizen."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country</span>. "That citizen," says St. Bernard, quoted by Archbishop Trench, "I cannot understand as other than one of the malignant spirits, who in that they sin with an irremediable obstinacy, and have passed into a permanent disposition of malice and wickedness, are no longer guests and strangers, but citizens and abiders in the land of sin." This is a true picture of the state of such a lost soul, which in despair has yielded itself up to the evil one and his angels and their awful prompt-tugs and suggestions; but the heathen citizen is well represented by the ordinary sordid man of the world, who engages in any infamous calling, and in the carrying on of which he employs his poor degraded ruined brothers and sisters. To feed swine. What a shudder must have passed through the auditory when the Master reached this climax of the prodigal's degradation I For a young Israelite noble, delicately nurtured and trained in the worship of the chosen people, to be reduced to the position of a herdsman of those unclean creatures for which they entertained such a loathing and abhorrence that they would not even name them, but spoke of a pig as <span class="accented">the other thing</span>! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/15-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[So]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">he went</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#961;&#949;&#965;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(poreutheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4198.htm">Strong's 4198: </a> </span><span class="str2">To travel, journey, go, die. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[and] hired himself out</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#942;&#952;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(ekoll&#275;th&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2853.htm">Strong's 2853: </a> </span><span class="str2">From kolla; to glue, i.e. to stick.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to a</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7953;&#957;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(heni)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1520.htm">Strong's 1520: </a> </span><span class="str2">One.
