Zechariah, having been rendered mute by the angel Gabriel (<a href="/luke/1-20.htm">Luke 1:20</a>), needed a way to convey his message. This act of asking for a tablet demonstrates his determination to fulfill God's command despite his physical limitations. The use of a tablet also highlights the importance of written communication in ancient times, which was often reserved for significant matters.<p><b>and wrote, &#8220;His name is John.&#8221;</b><br>The act of writing the name "John" is significant because it confirms the angel Gabriel's message to Zechariah (<a href="/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13</a>). The name "John" means "Yahweh is gracious," reflecting the grace of God in granting Zechariah and Elizabeth a child in their old age. This moment is a fulfillment of divine prophecy and an act of obedience to God's will. It also signifies a break from tradition, as it was customary to name a child after a relative, yet Zechariah follows God's directive instead.<p><b>And they were all amazed.</b><br>The amazement of the people reflects the cultural and communal nature of Jewish society, where family and community played a central role in personal events. The unexpected choice of the name "John" and the miraculous circumstances surrounding his birth and naming would have been a source of wonder and discussion among those present. This amazement also foreshadows the significant role John the Baptist would play in preparing the way for Jesus Christ, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a> and fulfilled in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>The father of John the Baptist, a priest who was temporarily rendered mute by the angel Gabriel for his disbelief.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elizabeth.htm">Elizabeth</a></b><br>The mother of John the Baptist, who was considered barren but miraculously conceived in her old age.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>The child born to Zechariah and Elizabeth, who would become the forerunner of Jesus Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_gabriel.htm">The Angel Gabriel</a></b><br>The messenger of God who announced the birth of John to Zechariah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gathering.htm">The Gathering</a></b><br>The event where family and neighbors gathered for the circumcision and naming of John, leading to the astonishment at Zechariah's declaration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Zechariah's act of writing "His name is John" demonstrates obedience to God's command, even when it defies cultural expectations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_word.htm">The Power of God's Word</a></b><br>The fulfillment of Gabriel's message shows that God's word is trustworthy and will come to pass.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_restoration.htm">Faith and Restoration</a></b><br>Zechariah's speech is restored after his act of faith, illustrating that obedience can lead to restoration and blessing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_naming.htm">God's Sovereignty in Naming</a></b><br>The name "John" (meaning "God is gracious") was divinely chosen, reflecting God's purpose and grace in John's life and ministry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_witness.htm">Community Witness</a></b><br>The astonishment of the gathered community highlights how acts of faith can serve as a powerful witness to others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_1_63_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 1:63?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_Zechariah_s_obedience.htm">Why is Zechariah's obedience in naming his son significant for us today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Zechariah_s_faith_inspires_our_journey.htm">How does Zechariah's faithfulness in Luke 1:63 inspire our own faith journey?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/OT_prophecies_linked_to_John_s_name.htm">What Old Testament prophecies connect to the naming of John in Luke 1:63?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Zechariah_s_obedience_daily_2.htm">How can we apply Zechariah's example of obedience in our daily decisions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Zechariah_s_trust_in_God_s_plan.htm">What does Zechariah's response in Luke 1:63 teach about trusting God's plan?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_name_his_son_John_in_Luke_1_63.htm">Why did Zechariah insist on naming his son John in Luke 1:63?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Luke_1_63_Obedience_to_God.htm">How does Luke 1:63 demonstrate the importance of obedience to God's instructions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_John_significant_in_Luke_1_63.htm">What is the significance of the name "John" in the context of Luke 1:63?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_1.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_do_luke_16_19-31_and_john_5_28-29_align.htm">How does Luke 16:19-31's portrayal of immediate judgment align with passages like John 5:28-29 that suggest a future resurrection?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_did_women_visit_jesus'_tomb.htm">Why did the women visit the tomb?

Their gestures hint that Zechariah may have also lost his hearing, intensifying his dependence on written words.<p>- Requesting a writing tablet shows practical faith at work. After nine months of silent reflection, Zechariah now moves decisively in obedience. Like Habakkuk, who was told to &#8220;write the vision and make it plain&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2</a>), Zechariah employs writing to proclaim God&#8217;s revealed will.<p>- The tablet becomes more than a communication aid; it becomes a witness to God&#8217;s faithfulness. Just as Moses&#8217; tablets bore God&#8217;s law (<a href="/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a>), Zechariah&#8217;s tablet bears God&#8217;s promise fulfilled.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and wrote, &#8220;His name is John.&#8221;</b><p>- The wording is immediate and emphatic. Zechariah doesn&#8217;t say, &#8220;We will call him John,&#8221; but records the name as an established fact: &#8220;His name IS John,&#8221; exactly matching Gabriel&#8217;s directive (<a href="/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Heaven had already settled the matter; Zechariah simply affirms it.<p>&#8226; The pattern echoes God naming Isaac before his birth (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>) and Jesus before His conception (<a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>).<p>- By aligning with the angel&#8217;s words, Zechariah publicly repents of earlier unbelief. His writing displays submission to God&#8217;s sovereign choice, just as <a href="/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a> declares, &#8220;The counsel of the LORD stands forever.&#8221;<p>- &#8220;John&#8221; (Y&#244;&#7717;anan, &#8220;the LORD is gracious&#8221;) encapsulates the gospel theme: God&#8217;s gracious initiative to prepare people for Christ (<a href="/luke/1-76.htm">Luke 1:76-77</a>). Naming the child rightly honors God&#8217;s character, much like <a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a> underscores God protecting His glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And they were all amazed.</b><p>- The onlookers marveled because they expected the child to carry a family name (<a href="/luke/1-59.htm">Luke 1:59</a>). Breaking tradition signaled divine intervention.<p>- Their amazement blossoms into holy fear: &#8220;All who heard these things laid them up in their hearts, saying, &#8216;What then will this child become?&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-65.htm">Luke 1:65-66</a>).<p>- Throughout Luke, amazement marks encounters with God&#8217;s power (<a href="/luke/5-26.htm">Luke 5:26</a>; 8:56). Here it prepares hearts for the coming ministry of both John and Jesus.<p>- <a href="/acts/3-10.htm">Acts 3:10</a> notes a similar reaction after a miracle, showing that wonder often precedes wider witness. The crowd&#8217;s amazement thus becomes part of God&#8217;s plan to spread news of His work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Zechariah&#8217;s silent obedience, bold inscription, and the crowd&#8217;s astonishment together reveal how faithfully God keeps His word. A once-doubting priest now affirms heaven&#8217;s decree, naming his son exactly as directed. Through a simple tablet, God showcases His grace, sparks communal awe, and sets the stage for the forerunner who will &#8220;prepare the way for the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/luke/3-4.htm">Luke 3:4</a>). When God speaks, wise hearts respond as Zechariah did&#8212;believing, obeying, and watching others stand amazed at His faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(63) <span class= "bld">A writing table.</span>--The tablets in common use at this time throughout the Roman empire were commonly of wood, covered with a thin coat of wax, on which men wrote with the sharp point which has left its traces in our language, in the word "style," in its literal and figurative senses.<p><span class= "bld">His name is John.</span>--There is something emphatic in the use of the present tense.
