Childlessness, therefore, was often viewed as a source of shame and social stigma. This situation would have been particularly difficult for Elizabeth and Zechariah, as they were both from priestly lines, and the expectation to continue their lineage would have been significant. The absence of children in their lives sets the stage for the miraculous birth of John the Baptist, highlighting God's intervention and the fulfillment of His divine plan.<p><b>because Elizabeth was barren</b><br>Barrenness is a recurring theme in the Bible, often preceding a miraculous birth that plays a crucial role in God's redemptive history. Notable examples include Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, and Hannah, all of whom were initially barren but later bore children who were significant in Israel's history. Elizabeth's barrenness emphasizes the miraculous nature of John's birth and aligns with the pattern of God using unexpected means to fulfill His purposes. It also underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and His ability to bring life where there is none.<p><b>and they were both well along in years</b><br>This phrase indicates that Elizabeth and Zechariah were beyond the typical childbearing age, making the prospect of having children naturally improbable. This detail highlights the miraculous nature of John's conception, drawing a parallel to the story of Abraham and Sarah, who also had a child in their old age. The advanced age of Elizabeth and Zechariah serves to magnify God's power and faithfulness, demonstrating that nothing is impossible for Him. It also foreshadows the miraculous birth of Jesus, who would be born to a virgin, further emphasizing the divine nature of these events.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A priest from the division of Abijah, serving in the temple.

When the Lord answers, no one can attribute John&#8217;s conception to coincidence or medicine; it is unmistakably divine.<p>&#8226; Their long season of waiting also refines their faith. Persistent prayer despite decades of disappointment (<a href="/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13</a>) models endurance that trusts God&#8217;s timing rather than surrendering to despair (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/1-7.htm">Luke 1:7</a> emphasizes three realities&#8212;childlessness, barrenness, and old age&#8212;that combine to make parenthood impossible apart from God.
