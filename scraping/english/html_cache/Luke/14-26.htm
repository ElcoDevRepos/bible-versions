In the cultural context of first-century Judea, following a rabbi meant committing to learn and live according to the teacher's ways. Jesus is positioning Himself as a teacher and leader, inviting individuals to a deeper commitment.<p><b>and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters</b><br>The term "hate" here is understood as a hyperbolic expression common in Semitic languages, emphasizing preference rather than literal animosity. In <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>, Jesus clarifies this by stating that anyone who loves family more than Him is not worthy of Him. The cultural context of the time placed strong emphasis on family loyalty, making this statement particularly challenging and highlighting the radical nature of discipleship.<p><b>&#8212;yes, even his own life&#8212;</b><br>This phrase underscores the totality of commitment required to follow Jesus. It echoes the call to self-denial found in <a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>, where Jesus instructs His followers to take up their cross daily. The historical context of Roman crucifixion would have made this imagery stark and sobering, as it was a symbol of ultimate sacrifice and submission.<p><b>he cannot be My disciple.</b><br>This concluding statement sets a clear boundary for discipleship, indicating that following Jesus requires prioritizing Him above all else. The term "disciple" implies a learner or follower who adopts the teachings and lifestyle of the teacher. This call to radical allegiance is consistent with the demands of the Kingdom of God, as seen throughout the Gospels, where Jesus often challenges societal norms and personal priorities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing the cost of discipleship to those who are following Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The audience Jesus is speaking to, which includes both His immediate followers and the larger crowd interested in His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/family_members.htm">Family Members</a></b><br>Mentioned in the verse are father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, representing close familial relationships.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/self.htm">Self</a></b><br>The individual&#8217;s own life is also mentioned, emphasizing the personal cost of following Jesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The larger group of people who were following Jesus at the time, curious about His teachings and miracles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_hate_in_context.htm">Understanding Hate in Context</a></b><br>The Greek word (miseo) used here can mean to love less.

Scripture forbids literal hatred of parents (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-2.htm">Ephesians 6:2</a>). Instead, Jesus insists that loyalty to Him outranks even the most honored human relationships. <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a> states it plainly: &#8220;Anyone who loves his father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and wife and children</b><p>Family unity is precious (<a href="/bsb/psalms/128.htm">Psalm 128</a>), yet discipleship may create tension when loved ones resist Christ&#8217;s call. <a href="/luke/18-29.htm">Luke 18:29&#8211;30</a> shows that forsaking family for the kingdom brings eternal reward, while <a href="/1_corinthians/7-29.htm">1 Corinthians 7:29</a> reminds believers to hold earthly ties loosely in light of eternal realities.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and brothers and sisters</b><p>Even sibling bonds, highlighted positively in passages like <a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>, must yield to the Lord&#8217;s supremacy.

Here they appear in a yet stronger form, "not hating" taking the place of "loving more," and they are spoken, not to the Twelve only, but to the whole multitude of eager would-be followers.
