This divine affirmation echoes the baptism of Jesus (<a href="/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>) and fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah being the Son of God (<a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>). The voice signifies divine approval and authority, emphasizing Jesus' unique relationship with the Father.<p><b>only Jesus was present with them</b><br>Following the divine voice, Moses and Elijah, who appeared with Jesus, disappeared. This highlights Jesus' supremacy over the Law and the Prophets, represented by Moses and Elijah, respectively. It underscores the New Covenant, with Jesus as the central figure, fulfilling the Law and the Prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). The focus on Jesus alone points to His sufficiency and preeminence in salvation and revelation.<p><b>The disciples kept this to themselves</b><br>The disciples' silence can be attributed to Jesus' instruction not to reveal the vision until after His resurrection (<a href="/matthew/17-9.htm">Matthew 17:9</a>). This reflects the theme of the "Messianic Secret" in the Gospels, where Jesus often instructs His followers to keep His identity and works concealed until the appropriate time. It also indicates their lack of full understanding of the event's significance at that moment.<p><b>and in those days they did not tell anyone what they had seen</b><br>This secrecy aligns with the cultural and historical context of the time, where premature revelation of Jesus' divine nature could have led to misunderstanding or political unrest. The disciples' silence also suggests a period of reflection and growth in their understanding of Jesus' mission. The eventual sharing of this event, post-resurrection, would serve as a powerful testimony to Jesus' divine nature and the fulfillment of His mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, the Son of God, who is revealed in His glory during the Transfiguration.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Specifically Peter, James, and John, who were chosen to witness the Transfiguration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_voice.htm">The Voice</a></b><br>The voice of God the Father, affirming Jesus as His chosen Son.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_transfiguration.htm">The Transfiguration</a></b><br>A significant event where Jesus' divine nature is revealed to the disciples.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mountain.htm">The Mountain</a></b><br>The location of the Transfiguration, symbolizing a place of divine revelation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_revelation_of_jesus'_divinity.htm">The Revelation of Jesus' Divinity</a></b><br>The Transfiguration serves as a powerful revelation of Jesus' divine nature, affirming His identity as the Son of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_witness.htm">The Importance of Witness</a></b><br>The disciples' role as witnesses to the Transfiguration underscores the importance of bearing witness to Christ's glory and truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_silence_and_reflection.htm">The Call to Silence and Reflection</a></b><br>The disciples' initial silence about the event invites us to reflect on the mysteries of God and the appropriate timing for sharing spiritual experiences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_voice_of_god.htm">The Voice of God</a></b><br>The voice from heaven emphasizes the authority of Jesus and the necessity of listening to Him, aligning with the call to heed God's Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_through_encounter.htm">Transformation through Encounter</a></b><br>Just as the disciples were transformed by witnessing Jesus' glory, believers are called to be transformed by encounters with Christ through prayer and Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_9_36_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 9:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_9_36_Listen_to_Jesus_daily.htm">How does Luke 9:36 encourage us to listen to Jesus in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_the_cloud_s_voice_mean_in_Luke_9_36.htm">What significance does the voice from the cloud have in Luke 9:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Luke_9_36_silence_guide_us.htm">How can we apply the disciples' silence in Luke 9:36 to our witness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Luke_9_36_to_Matthew_3_17_s_affirmation.htm">How does Luke 9:36 connect to God's affirmation of Jesus in Matthew 3:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Luke_9_36_Divine_revelation_s_role.htm">What does Luke 9:36 teach about the importance of divine revelation and obedience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_were_disciples_silent_on_transfiguration.htm">Why did the disciples remain silent about the transfiguration in Luke 9:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Luke_9_36_Jesus_divinity_proof.htm">How does Luke 9:36 affirm the divinity of Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_the_cloud_s_voice_important.htm">What is the significance of the voice from the cloud in Luke 9:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/did_jesus_allow_disciples_a_staff.htm">Did Jesus allow his disciples to keep a staff on their journey?

The reasons of this silence for the present have been already discussed. The scene, doubtless, had done its work in the education of the three. Without telling their companions what they had seen and heard on the mount, we may assume that the sight of the serene confidence and renewed trust on the part of Peter, James, and John did its effectual work in strengthening their brethren. No doubt directly after the Resurrection, possibly during the days of darkness and gloom which followed the day of the cross, the chosen three related at length their experience of the Transfiguration mystery. The narrative of the Transfiguration and its attendant circumstances, as might have been expected, has been a favourite subject for hostile criticism. It does not, however, lend itself to any probable, or even possible, explanation which refers the story to some exaggerated report of a mistaken natural phenomenon. The whole story, as we have it thrice - with very slight variation in the details - repeated in the synoptical Gospels, must stand as we have it, or else must be wholly rejected as a myth. But, if a myth, whence did it spring? for nothing in the Jewish expectation of Messiah could possibly have suggested the "legend." The strange and even childish interruption of Peter could never have been <span class="accented">invented.</span> No one <span class="accented">friendly</span> to the apostle would have chronicled such a saying had there been any doubt resting on its authenticity; and a writer <span class="accented">hostile</span> to the apostle would scarcely have invented a narrative which treated of the Divine glory of the apostle's adored Master. If it be an invention, whence comes it? in whose interest was it composed? and how did it find its way into the very heart of the three synoptical Gospels? for there we find it woven into that marvellous tapestry of revelation and teaching which has at once charmed and influenced so many millions of men and women now for more than eighteen hundred years. Something of the purpose which the Transfiguration was intended to serve in the education of the twelve has been already discussed in the foregoing notes. Dr. Lange, who has made this difficult passage in the story of Jesus a subject of deep and earnest study, has given us some beautiful thoughts on the real signification of the Lord's transfiguration. This scholar and divine considers that, just at this period of his public ministry, Jesus had reached the zenith of his power. This is indicated by the grandeur of his recent miracles. There was nothing higher and more sublime to be reached by him. From this moment, therefore, earthly existence became too narrow a sphere. There only remained death; but death is, as St. Paul says, <span class="accented">the wages of sin.</span> For the sinless Man the issue of life is not the sombre passage of the tomb, rather is it the. royal road of a glorious transformation. Had the hour of this glorification struck for Jesus? and was the Transfiguration the beginning of the heavenly renewal? Gess, quoted by Godet - from whose <span class="accented">precis</span> of Lange's note these observations are derived - gives expression to Lange's thoughts in these words: "This event (the Transfiguration) indicates the ripe preparation of Jesus for immediate entrance upon eternity." "Had not Jesus himself," goes on Godet to say, thus con-eluding this very beautiful and suggestive, if somewhat fanciful note, "voluntarily suspended this change which was on the point of being wrought in him, this moment, the moment of his glorious transfiguration would have become the moment of his ascension." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
