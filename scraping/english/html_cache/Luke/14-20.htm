The use of "still another" indicates a continuation of a pattern of excuses, highlighting the repeated rejection of the invitation. This reflects the broader theme of the parable, where many are invited to the kingdom of God, but few accept the invitation.<p><b>&#8216;I have married a wife,</b><br>Marriage in Jewish culture was a significant life event, often involving extended celebrations and social obligations. The excuse given here is rooted in <a href="/deuteronomy/24-5.htm">Deuteronomy 24:5</a>, which allowed a newly married man to be exempt from certain duties, such as military service, for a year. This reflects the cultural importance placed on marriage and family life. However, in the context of the parable, this excuse symbolizes prioritizing personal commitments over spiritual ones.<p><b>so I cannot come.&#8217;</b><br>The refusal to attend the banquet due to marriage underscores the theme of misplaced priorities. In the parable, the banquet represents the kingdom of God, and the invitation is a call to salvation. The man's excuse reveals a lack of understanding of the significance of the invitation. This mirrors the broader biblical narrative where earthly concerns often distract from spiritual truths. The inability to "come" suggests a self-imposed barrier, emphasizing the personal responsibility in responding to God's call. This connects to other scriptures, such as <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>, which urges believers to seek first the kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_who_married_a_wife.htm">The Man Who Married a Wife</a></b><br>This individual represents those who prioritize personal relationships or commitments over spiritual invitations.

Yet even God-given blessings must never outrank God Himself (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>; <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The speaker likely alludes to <a href="/deuteronomy/24-5.htm">Deuteronomy 24:5</a>, where a newly married man was excused from war for a year. But attending a joyful banquet demands far less than going to battle; the excuse stretches a legitimate provision into self-serving avoidance.<p>&#8226; Paul later observes that &#8220;the married man is concerned about the affairs of this world, how he can please his wife&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-33.htm">1 Corinthians 7:33</a>). That concern becomes sinful only when it eclipses obedience.<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; earlier words, &#8220;Seek first the kingdom of God&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>), remind us that marriage thrives best when placed under God&#8217;s rule, not above it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so I cannot come</b><p>&#8226; The phrase sounds final&#8212;no negotiation, no inquiry whether his wife might join him. It reveals a settled refusal, not a scheduling conflict.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26-27</a> Jesus warns that family ties, precious as they are, must not hinder discipleship. The cost of following Him may include reordering every relationship (<a href="/luke/9-59.htm">Luke 9:59-62</a>).<p>&#8226; By saying &#8220;I cannot,&#8221; the man confesses self-imposed inability. True incapacity would have sought the master&#8217;s help; this is unwillingness disguised as necessity (<a href="/john/5-40.htm">John 5:40</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>).<p>&#8226; The consequence appears later: those who decline are shut out, while unexpected guests fill the banquet (<a href="/luke/14-24.htm">Luke 14:24</a>; <a href="/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The third excuse in <a href="/luke/14-20.htm">Luke 14:20</a> shows a man placing a good gift&#8212;marriage&#8212;above the Giver. His polite words mask a heart that prefers comfort to communion. Jesus uses the example to warn that even our noblest relationships become idols when they override God&#8217;s invitation. Only by putting the Lord first can spouses, families, and every other blessing take their rightful, fruitful place under His gracious rule.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">I have married a wife.</span>--It may be noted that the Law of Moses allowed men to plead this, and the building of a house, or planting of a vineyard, as a ground for exemption from military service (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/20-5.htm" title="And the officers shall speak to the people, saying, What man is there that has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.">Deuteronomy 20:5-7</a>). The sin of the invited guests was that they treated the invitation to the feast as though it were as burdensome as a military conscription. In the interpretation of the parable, the bearing of this is obvious. Men are invited to the highest spiritual blessings, and they look askance at the invitation, as though it called them to what was simply a weariness to the flesh, and "beg off" under a hundred miserable pretences.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/14-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Still</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">another</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(heteros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2087.htm">Strong's 2087: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) of two: another, a second, (b) other, different, (c) one's neighbor.
