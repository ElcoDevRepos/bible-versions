Parables were a common rabbinic teaching tool in first-century Judaism, designed to provoke thought and self-reflection. Jesus often used parables to reveal the mysteries of the Kingdom of God to those willing to hear and understand (<a href="/matthew/13-10.htm">Matthew 13:10-17</a>).<p><b>&#8220;There was a man who had two sons.</b><br>The man in this parable represents God the Father, and the two sons symbolize different responses to God's love and grace. The number two often signifies contrast or choice in biblical literature, as seen in the stories of Cain and Abel, Jacob and Esau, and others. This sets the stage for exploring themes of repentance, forgiveness, and the nature of God's mercy. The familial setting reflects the importance of family in Jewish culture, where inheritance and lineage were significant. The parable will unfold to reveal the heart of God towards both the wayward and the faithful, illustrating the depth of divine compassion and the call to reconciliation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The speaker of the parable, Jesus uses this account to teach about God's grace and forgiveness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man (Father)</a></b><br>Represents God the Father, characterized by his love, patience, and forgiveness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_two_sons.htm">The Two Sons</a></b><br>Symbolize different responses to God's love and grace.

In that opening, He sets the stage for unveiling the Father&#8217;s loving heart, the estrangement of humanity in both reckless rebellion and cold self-righteousness, and God&#8217;s readiness to receive anyone who will return to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And he said, A certain man had two sons.</span>--We enter here on one of the parables which are not only peculiar to St. Luke's Gospel, but have something of a different character, as giving more than those we find in the other Gospels, the incidents of a story of common daily life. As with the Good Samaritan, it seems open to us to believe that it rested on a substratum of facts that had actually occurred. It is obvious that in the then social state of Palestine, brought into contact as the Jews were with the great cities of the Roman empire, such a history as that here recorded must have been but too painfully familiar.<p>In the immediate application of the parable, the father is the great Father of the souls of men; the elder son represents the respectably religious Pharisees; the younger stands for the class of publicans and sinners. In its subsequent developments it applies to the two types of character which answers to these in any age or country. On a wider scale, but with a less close parallelism, the elder son may stand for Israel according to the flesh; the younger for the whole heathen world. Looking back to the genealogies of <a href="/genesis/5-10.htm" title="And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:">Genesis 5:10</a>; <a href="/genesis/9-18.htm" title="And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.">Genesis 9:18</a>, and even (according to the true construction of the words) <a href="/genesis/10-21.htm" title="To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.">Genesis 10:21</a>, they correspond respectively to the descendants of Shem and those of Japheth. It is obvious from the whole structure of the parable that the elder son cannot represent the unfallen part of God's creation; and, so far as it goes, this tells against that interpretation of the ninety and nine sheep, or the nine pieces of silver.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, A certain man had two sons</span>. It seems probable that this and the two preceding shorter parables were spoken by the Lord on the same occasion, towards the latter part of this slow solemn journeying to the holy city to keep his last Passover. The mention of the publicans and sinners in ver. 1 seems to point to some considerable city, or its immediate vicinity, as the place where these famous parables were spoken. This parable, as it is termed, of the prodigal sou completes the trilogy. Without it the Master's formal <span class="accented">apologia</span> for his life and work would be incomplete, and the rebuke of the Pharisaic selfishness and censoriousness would have been left unfinished. In the <span class="accented">apologia</span> much had still to be said concerning the limitless love and the boundless pity of God. In the <span class="accented">rebuke</span> the two first parables had shown the Pharisee party and the rulers of Israel how they ought to have acted: this third story shows them how they did act. But the Church of Christ - as each successive generation read this exquisite and true story - soon lost sight of all the temporal and national signification at first connected with it. The dweller in the cold and misty North feels that it belongs to him as it does to the Syrian, revelling in his almost perpetual summer, to whom it was first spoken. It is a story of the nineteenth century just as it was a story of the first. We may, with all reverence, think of the Divine Master, as he unfolded each successive scene which portrayed human sin and suffering, and heavenly pity and forgiveness, man's selfish pride and God's all-embracing love, passing into another and broader sphere than that bounded by the Arabian deserts to the south and the Syrian mountains to the north, forgetting for a moment the little Church of the Hebrews, and speaking to the great Church of the future - the Church of the world, to which, without doubt, this Catholic parable of the prodigal, in all its sublime beauty and exquisite pathos, with all its exhaustless wealth of comfort, belongs. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/15-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] said,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
