This reflects the elder brother's anger and sense of injustice. In the cultural context of the time, family honor was paramount, and the younger son's actions would have brought shame. The elder brother's reaction is a common human response to perceived unfairness, echoing the parable's broader theme of grace versus human merit.<p><b>from squandering your wealth</b><br>The term "squandering" indicates reckless and wasteful behavior, which was a serious offense in a society that valued stewardship and responsibility. The younger son's actions symbolize a life lived in sin and separation from God. This mirrors the spiritual state of humanity before repentance and redemption. The wealth squandered can be seen as the blessings and opportunities given by God, which are often misused.<p><b>with prostitutes</b><br>This detail emphasizes the depth of the younger son's moral and spiritual decline. Engaging with prostitutes was considered a grave sin, highlighting the son's complete disregard for the moral and religious laws of the time. This aspect of the story underscores the transformative power of repentance and forgiveness, as even those who have fallen far can be restored.<p><b>you kill the fattened calf for him!</b><br>The fattened calf was reserved for the most special occasions, symbolizing celebration and honor. In the historical context, such a feast would be a rare and significant event, indicating the father's joy at the son's return. This act represents God's abundant grace and the joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, as seen in <a href="/luke/15-7.htm">Luke 15:7</a>. The elder brother's objection highlights the tension between justice and grace, a central theme in the parable.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prodigal_son.htm">The Prodigal Son</a></b><br>A younger son who demands his inheritance early, leaves home, and squanders his wealth in reckless living.
