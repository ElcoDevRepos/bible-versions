In biblical context, servants often symbolize believers who are devoted to serving God. This phrase emphasizes the reward for faithfulness and vigilance in spiritual duties.<p><b>whom the master finds on watch when he returns.</b><br>The "master" represents Jesus Christ, and His return refers to the Second Coming. Being "on watch" implies spiritual alertness and readiness, akin to the parable of the ten virgins in <a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>. This vigilance is a recurring theme in eschatological teachings, urging believers to live in anticipation of Christ's return.<p><b>Truly I tell you,</b><br>This phrase underscores the certainty and importance of the statement that follows. It is a common expression used by Jesus to emphasize truth and authority in His teachings.<p><b>he will dress himself to serve</b><br>This imagery is counter-cultural, as masters typically do not serve their servants. It reflects the humility and servant leadership of Christ, reminiscent of <a href="/john/13.htm">John 13:1-17</a>, where Jesus washes the disciples' feet. It highlights the reversal of roles in the Kingdom of God, where greatness is defined by service.<p><b>and will have them recline at the table,</b><br>Reclining at the table is a posture of rest and fellowship, often associated with banquets and feasts. This imagery is linked to the Messianic Banquet, a symbol of the ultimate fellowship and celebration in God's Kingdom, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6-9</a> and <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>.<p><b>and he himself will come and wait on them.</b><br>This final phrase reiterates the theme of Christ's servanthood. It reflects the fulfillment of His promise to reward those who are faithful. The act of waiting on them signifies honor and intimacy, reinforcing the idea of a personal relationship with Christ in the eternal Kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants.htm">Servants</a></b><br>In this parable, the servants represent believers who are expected to be vigilant and faithful in their duties while awaiting the return of their master.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/master.htm">Master</a></b><br>The master symbolizes Jesus Christ, who will return at an unexpected time.

Their real fulfilment is to be found, it need hardly be said, in the far-off completion of the Kingdom, or in the ever-recurring experiences which are the foretastes of that Kingdom; but the office which He then assumed must have reminded the disciples of the words which are recorded here, and may well have been intended to be at once a symbol and an earnest of what should be hereafter. In the promise of <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm" title="Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.">Revelation 3:20</a> ("I will sup with him and he with Me") we have a recurrence to the same imagery. The passage should be borne in mind as balancing the seeming harshness of the Master in <a href="/luke/17-8.htm" title="And will not rather say to him, Make ready with which I may sup, and gird yourself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward you shall eat and drink?">Luke 17:8</a>.<p><span class= "bld">To sit down.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">to lie down,</span> or <span class= "ital">recline.</span><p><span class= "bld">Will come forth . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and as He passes on will minister unto them.</span> The Greek verb expresses, not the "coming out" as from another chamber, but the passing from one to another, as when He washed the disciples' feet, in <a href="/john/13-5.htm" title="After that he pours water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.">John 13:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them</span>. The title "blessed," when used by our Lord, is ever a very lofty one, and implies some rare and precious virtue in the one to whom this title to honor is given. It seems as though the house-master of the parable scarcely expected such true devotion from his servants; so he hastens to reward a rare virtue with equally rare blessedness and honor. He raises the slaves to a position of equality with their master. These true faithful ones are no longer his servants; they are his friends. He even deigns himself to minister to their wants. A similar lofty promise is made in less homely language. The final glorious gift to the faithful conqueror in the world's hard battle appears in the last of the epistles to the seven Churches: "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with <span class="accented">me</span> in my throne" (<a href="/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/12-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Blessed [are]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#945;&#954;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(makarioi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3107.htm">Strong's 3107: </a> </span><span class="str2">Happy, blessed, to be envied.
