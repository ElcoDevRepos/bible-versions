This phrase indicates that Herod's decision to imprison John the Baptist was another in a series of sinful actions. Herod's life was marked by a series of transgressions, including his unlawful marriage to Herodias, his brother's wife, which John openly condemned (<a href="/mark/6-17.htm">Mark 6:17-18</a>). This act of imprisoning John was a culmination of Herod's disregard for righteousness and truth.<p><b>He locked John up in prison:</b><br>John the Baptist, a pivotal prophetic figure, was imprisoned in the fortress of Machaerus, located east of the Dead Sea. This act of imprisonment was not only a political move but also a fulfillment of the opposition that prophets often faced (<a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-27.htm">1 Kings 22:27</a>). John's imprisonment foreshadows the suffering and rejection that Jesus would later endure. It also highlights the cost of speaking truth to power, as John boldly confronted Herod's sin.

It did not enter into St. Luke's plan to write any detailed account of the circumstances which led to the death of the Baptist. The story (related at length by St. Matthew) was, no doubt, well known in all the Gentile Churches. He simply mentions the act which consigned the dauntless preacher to the dungeons of Herod's palace-fortress, close to the Dead Sea; it was termed Macha, or Machaerus. In closing his little sketch of the work of his Master's great pioneer, St. Luke wishes to show that the fearless Baptist was no respecter of persons. The despised collector of Roman tribute, the rough free lance or mercenary, the nameless legionary of Rome, was attacked for his evil life and his wanton excesses, with no greater hardihood than the prince who sat on the throne of the mighty Herods. True servant of his brave and patient Master, he paid the penalty of his splendid courage and, "like so many of earth's great ones, he passed through pain and agony to his rest." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/3-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Herod] added</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#941;&#952;&#951;&#954;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(proseth&#275;ken)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4369.htm">Strong's 4369: </a> </span><span class="str2">To place (put) to, add; I do again.
