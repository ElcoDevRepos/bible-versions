His anger reflects the self-righteousness and lack of compassion often seen in those who believe they have earned God's favor through their own efforts. This mirrors the attitude of Jonah, who was displeased with God's mercy towards Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/4.htm">Jonah 4:1</a>).<p><b>and refused to go in.</b><br>His refusal to join the celebration signifies a rejection of grace and forgiveness. This act symbolizes the separation between those who rely on their own righteousness and those who accept God's grace. The older son's actions echo the parable of the two sons in <a href="/matthew/21-28.htm">Matthew 21:28-32</a>, where one son initially refuses to obey but later repents, highlighting the importance of a repentant heart.<p><b>So his father came out</b><br>The father's action of coming out to the older son demonstrates God's initiative in reaching out to those who are lost, whether they are openly sinful or self-righteous. This reflects the character of God as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11-16</a>, where God seeks out His lost sheep. The father's willingness to leave the celebration to speak with the older son shows the personal nature of God's love and His desire for reconciliation.<p><b>and pleaded with him.</b><br>The father's pleading illustrates God's patience and desire for all to come to repentance, as expressed in <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>. This act of pleading is reminiscent of God's appeals to Israel through the prophets, urging them to return to Him (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>).

The disapprobation of Jesus for Pharisee opinions was very marked, yet here and elsewhere his treatment of them, with a few exceptional cases, was generally very gentle and loving. There was something in their excessive devotion to the letter of the Divine Law, to the holy temple, to the proud traditions of their race, that was admirable. It was a love to God, but a love all marred and blurred. It was a patriotism, but a patriotism utterly mistaken. The elder brother here was a representative of the great and famous sect, both in its fair and repulsive aspect, in its moral severity and correctness, in its harshness and exclusive pride. The father condescended to entreat this angry elder son; and Jesus longed to win these proud mistaken Pharisees. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/15-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[The older son] became angry</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8040;&#961;&#947;&#943;&#963;&#952;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(&#332;rgisth&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3710.htm">Strong's 3710: </a> </span><span class="str2">To irritate, provoke, be angry.
