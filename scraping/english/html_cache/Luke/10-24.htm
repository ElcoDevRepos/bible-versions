It emphasizes the importance and truth of what He is about to say. In the Gospels, Jesus often uses this phrase to introduce significant teachings or revelations, underscoring His role as a divine teacher and prophet.<p><b>that many prophets and kings</b><br>Prophets and kings in the Old Testament were often seen as the primary recipients of God's revelations and leaders of His people. Prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Daniel received visions and messages about the coming Messiah. Kings, such as David and Solomon, were anointed leaders who longed for the fulfillment of God's promises. This phrase highlights the high status and spiritual insight of these figures, yet even they did not experience what Jesus' disciples were witnessing.<p><b>desired to see what you see</b><br>The prophets and kings had a deep longing to witness the fulfillment of the messianic prophecies. They anticipated the coming of the Messiah, who would bring salvation and establish God's kingdom. This desire reflects the hope and expectation that permeated Jewish thought and scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a> and <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>.<p><b>but did not see it</b><br>Despite their longing and anticipation, these figures did not live to see the arrival of Jesus, the Messiah. This underscores the privilege of the disciples who were witnessing the fulfillment of centuries of prophecy. It also highlights the progressive revelation of God's plan, which unfolds over time and is fully realized in Christ.<p><b>and to hear what you hear</b><br>The teachings and words of Jesus were the culmination of God's revelation to humanity. The disciples were hearing the direct teachings of the Messiah, which included the mysteries of the Kingdom of God and the path to salvation. This hearing is not just physical but spiritual, as Jesus' words carried divine authority and truth.<p><b>but did not hear it.</b><br>The prophets and kings received glimpses and shadows of God's plan, but they did not hear the full revelation that Jesus provided. This emphasizes the unique and unprecedented nature of Jesus' ministry. It also serves as a reminder of the privilege and responsibility of those who hear and understand the Gospel message, as seen in passages like <a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>, which speaks of God speaking through His Son in these last days.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples, emphasizing the privilege they have in witnessing His ministry and teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Refers to the Old Testament prophets who longed for the coming of the Messiah and the fulfillment of God's promises.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings.htm">Kings</a></b><br>Represents the rulers of Israel, such as King David and King Solomon, who desired to see the fulfillment of God's covenant and the coming of the Messiah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' words, who are witnessing the fulfillment of prophecies and the presence of the Messiah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/messianic_fulfillment.htm">Messianic Fulfillment</a></b><br>The event of Jesus' ministry, which is the realization of the prophecies and promises made throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_privilege_of_revelation.htm">The Privilege of Revelation</a></b><br>As believers, we have the privilege of understanding the full revelation of God's plan through Jesus Christ.
