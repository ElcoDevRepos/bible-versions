The act of standing up signifies respect or a formal setting, possibly in a synagogue or public teaching area. Testing Jesus was a common practice among religious leaders to challenge His authority and teachings. This reflects the tension between Jesus and the Jewish authorities, who often sought to discredit Him.<p><b>&#8220;Teacher,&#8221; he asked,</b><br>Addressing Jesus as "Teacher" acknowledges His role as a rabbi or respected instructor. This title, while respectful, may also be used here with a hint of irony or insincerity, given the expert's intent to test Jesus. It highlights the common practice of addressing rabbis with honorific titles, even when questioning them.<p><b>&#8220;what must I do to inherit eternal life?&#8221;</b><br>The question reveals a focus on actions or deeds necessary for salvation, reflecting a common Jewish understanding of the law as a means to righteousness. The concept of "eternal life" is rooted in Jewish eschatology, which anticipates a future resurrection and life in the world to come.

Jesus welcomes the question but will dismantle the assumption that life with God can be earned. The verse reminds us that:<p>&#8226; Ordinary days hold divine appointments.<p>&#8226; Titles and learning cannot replace humility before Christ.<p>&#8226; Eternal life is an inherited gift received by faith that then expresses itself in love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up.</span>--On the word "lawyer" and its difference from the more generic "scribe," see Note on <a href="/matthew/22-35.htm" title="Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,">Matthew 22:35</a>. Here, as there, the "tempting" does not necessarily imply hostile purpose. It was simply a test-question to see if the new Teacher was sound in His view of the ethical obligations of the Law.<p>The question, though the same as that of the young man in <a href="/matthew/19-16.htm" title="And, behold, one came and said to him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?">Matthew 19:16</a>, is not asked in the same tone. There it was asked by one anxiously seeking to inherit eternal life. Here there is a certain tone of self-conscious superiority, which required a different treatment. As the method of Socrates was to make men conscious of their ignorance of the true meaning of words which they repeated glibly, so here our Lord parries the question by another, makes him repeat his own formulated answer--an answer true and divine itself, identical with that which our Lord gave Himself (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm" title="Jesus said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.">Matthew 22:37</a>)--and then teaches him how little he had realised its depth and fulness.

It seems (as has already been noticed) probable that in St. Luke's general account of our Lord's teaching during the six months which immediately preceded the last Passover, certain events which took place at a short visit which Jesus paid to Jerusalem at the Feast of the Dedication are noticed. This question of the lawyer was probably asked on the occasion of this visit, and the little episode connected with the Bethany family of Lazarus took place at the same period. The "lawyer" is sometimes termed "scribe." There is little difference between these appellations. They were professional teachers and expounders of the Mosaic Law and of the vast complement of traditional sayings which had gathered round it. As the whole life of the people at this period was ruled and guided by the Law, written and traditional, this profession of scribe and lawyer was an important and influential one. <span class="cmt_word">Stood up</span>. The Master was evidently teaching in a house or a courtyard of a house. Many were sitting round him. To attract his attention, this lawyer stood up before putting his question to Jesus. This scene, as we have said, took place most likely in or near Jerusalem, not improbably, as the Bethany episode follows, in that suburb of the city, and perhaps in the house of Lazarus. <span class="cmt_word">And tempted him</span>; that is to say, tested him and his skill in answering questions out of that Law which then was the rule and guide of daily life in Israel. It is not unlikely that the lawyer hoped to convict the broad and generous Rabbi of some unorthodox statement which would injure his reputation as a Teacher. It was a hard and comprehensive question, this query how eternal life was to be won, and possibly one carefully prepared by the enemies of Jesus, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/10-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">One day</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">an</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
