Parables were a common teaching tool in Jewish culture, allowing listeners to engage with the story and uncover its meaning. This particular parable is directed at the people, including religious leaders, to illustrate a spiritual lesson about God's kingdom and the responsibilities of those entrusted with it.<p><b>A man planted a vineyard:</b><br>The vineyard is a common biblical metaphor for Israel, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, where God is depicted as the owner of a vineyard representing His people. The act of planting signifies God's establishment of Israel as His chosen nation, intended to bear fruit for His glory. The imagery of a vineyard also suggests care, investment, and expectation of a harvest.<p><b>Rented it out to some tenants:</b><br>The tenants symbolize the religious leaders of Israel, who were entrusted with the spiritual care and leadership of God's people. Renting out the vineyard indicates a delegation of responsibility, where the tenants are expected to manage the vineyard and produce fruit. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where the leaders are accountable for guiding the nation in faithfulness to God.<p><b>And went away for a long time:</b><br>The owner's departure represents God's patience and long-suffering with Israel. The "long time" suggests a period of testing and opportunity for the tenants to prove their faithfulness. It also alludes to the history of Israel, where God sent prophets over many generations to call His people back to righteousness, often met with resistance and rejection. This phrase sets the stage for the unfolding drama of the tenants' response to the owner's expectations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man</a></b><br>Represents God, the owner of the vineyard, who entrusts His creation to humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vineyard.htm">The Vineyard</a></b><br>Symbolizes Israel, God's chosen people, and by extension, the Kingdom of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tenants.htm">The Tenants</a></b><br>Represent the religious leaders of Israel who were entrusted with the care of God's people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_parable.htm">The Parable</a></b><br>A teaching method used by Jesus to convey spiritual truths through everyday accounts.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The audience to whom Jesus was speaking, including His disciples and the religious leaders.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_and_responsibility.htm">Stewardship and Responsibility</a></b><br>God entrusts us with His creation and expects us to be faithful stewards.

Isaiah sang a &#8220;song of the vineyard&#8221; where God lovingly plants Israel as His vineyard (<a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Planting involves deliberate care&#8212;soil prepared, vines selected, boundaries set (<a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-9</a>). God&#8217;s covenant work with Israel was equally intentional.<p>&#8226; This imagery reminds us that creation and covenant history are not random; the Lord of heaven is personally invested in His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>rented it out to some tenants</b><p>&#8226; The tenants symbolize Israel&#8217;s leaders&#8212;priests, scribes, elders&#8212;entrusted to shepherd God&#8217;s vineyard (<a href="/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Leasing the vineyard highlights stewardship: the land belongs to the owner, yet tenants enjoy privilege and responsibility (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Their role was to cultivate fruit for God, not themselves (<a href="/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33</a>).

The presence of this, as well as of the last section, in the first three Gospels, with so little variation, indicates the impression which these facts and teaching made at the time, and probably also that they occupied a prominent place in the early records that served as the basis of our present Gospels.<p><span class= "bld">A certain man planted a vineyard.</span>--The absence of the fuller detail in St. Matthew and St. Mark shows that St. Luke's report was not derived from them, but probably from a version, orally repeated, of that which they reported more fully. On the other hand, the addition of "for a long time" is peculiar to St. Luke, and reminds us of the like phrase in <a href="/matthew/25-19.htm" title="After a long time the lord of those servants comes, and reckons with them.">Matthew 25:19</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-19.</span> - <span class="accented">Parable of the wicked husbandmen in the vineyard, and the simile of the corner-stone.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A certain man</span> <span class="cmt_word">planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen.</span> Under a very thin parabolic veil, Jesus foretells the awful tragedy of the next few days. He adopts a well-known imagery, and seems to say, "Listen to Isaiah's well-known story of the vineyard, the vineyard of the Lord of hosts, which is the house of Israel. I will expand it a little, that I may show you how it stands with you as regards this matter of 'authority,' that we may see whether you have as much respect for the ascertained will of God as ye pretend, so that ye should be sure to submit to me if only ye were satisfied that I was an accredited Messenger of God" (Professor Bruce).
