They were known for collecting more than required, enriching themselves at the expense of others. Sinners, in this context, refers to those who were considered morally or ritually impure according to Jewish law. This group included people who did not adhere strictly to the Pharisaic interpretation of the law. The mention of both tax collectors and sinners highlights the inclusive nature of Jesus' ministry, reaching out to those marginalized by society.<p><b>were gathering around</b><br>The act of gathering around Jesus indicates a strong interest and desire to hear His teachings. This reflects the magnetic nature of Jesus' message and His ability to draw people from all walks of life. The imperfect tense of the verb suggests that this was a repeated or ongoing action, showing that Jesus consistently attracted those who were often shunned by religious leaders.<p><b>to listen to Jesus</b><br>Listening to Jesus implies an openness to His teachings and a willingness to be transformed by His words. In the cultural context, rabbis and teachers would often have disciples or followers who would sit at their feet to learn. This phrase underscores Jesus' role as a teacher and the authority with which He spoke. It also foreshadows the transformative impact of His message, as many who listened would go on to become His followers. This gathering of tax collectors and sinners contrasts with the religious leaders' rejection of Jesus, highlighting the theme of reversal present throughout the Gospel of Luke.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tax_collectors.htm">Tax Collectors</a></b><br>These individuals were often despised by the Jewish people because they collected taxes for the Roman authorities and were known for being corrupt and extorting more money than required.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sinners.htm">Sinners</a></b><br>This term generally referred to those who were considered morally or ritually unclean by the religious leaders, often including those who did not strictly adhere to the Jewish law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, Jesus is the Son of God who came to seek and save the lost.

God&#8217;s word records these moments as factual history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the tax collectors and sinners</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;Tax collectors&#8221; were Jewish men working for Rome; many enriched themselves through over-charging. By Jewish standards they were moral outcasts.<p>&#8211; &#8220;Sinners&#8221; covers everyone whose public life showed open disregard for God&#8217;s law&#8212;prostitutes, thieves, and the irreligious.<p>&#8211; These two groups picture the people society labels unreachable. Yet Jesus&#8217; mission explicitly included them (<a href="/matthew/9-10.htm">Matthew 9:10-13</a>; <a href="/luke/19-2.htm">Luke 19:2-7</a>).<p>&#8211; Contrast with the self-righteous Pharisee in <a href="/luke/18-11.htm">Luke 18:11</a>; the Gospel highlights the difference between those confident in themselves and those aware of their need.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Were gathering around</b><p>&#8211; The verb points to a steady, repeated action. They kept coming and kept coming.<p>&#8211; Wherever Jesus went, marginalised people drew near (<a href="/luke/6-17.htm">Luke 6:17</a>: &#8220;A large crowd of His disciples was there, and a great number of people&#8230;had come to hear Him&#8221;).<p>&#8211; This pattern fulfills Old Testament expectation that Messiah would shepherd lost sheep (<a href="/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11-16</a>).

The great outside- class came in crowds to listen to Jesus. These were men and women who, through home and family associations, through their occupations, which were looked upon with disfavour by the more rigid Jews, often no doubt through their own careless, indifferent character, had little or nothing to do with their religious and orthodox countrymen. Poor wanderers, sinners, thoughtless ones, no one cared for them, their present or their future. Do not these in every age make up the majority? The religious, so often Pharisees in heart, despising them, refusing to make allowances for them, looking on them as hopelessly lost ones. But at no time was this state of things so accentuated as when Jesus lived among men. Now, among such care. less irreligious men and women, are man whose hearts are very tender, very listen if the teacher of religion has Mud, wise words for them. The grave and severe, yet intensely pitiful and loving, doctrines of the Galilaean Master <span class="accented">found</span> such. His words were words of stern rebuke, and yet were full of hope, even for the hopeless. No man had ever spoken to them like this Man. Hence the crowds of publicans and sinners who were now ever pressing round the Master. But the teachers of Israel, the priestly order, the learned and rigid scribes, the honoured doctors Of the holy <span class="accented">Law</span>, - these were indignant, and on first thoughts not without reason, at the apparent preference felt for and special tenderness shown by Jesus to this great outside class of sinners. The three parables of this fifteenth chapter were the <span class="accented">apologia</span> of the Galilaean Master to orthodox Israel, but they appeal to an audience far greater than any enclosed in the coasts of the Holy Land, or living in that restless age, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/15-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pantes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
