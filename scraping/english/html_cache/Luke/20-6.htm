The leaders are caught in a predicament because acknowledging John's authority as merely human would undermine their own credibility. This highlights the tension between divine authority and human authority, a recurring theme in the Gospels. The leaders' fear of the crowd's reaction indicates their awareness of the popular support for John, who was widely regarded as a prophet.<p><b>all the people will stone us,</b><br>Stoning was a common form of capital punishment in ancient Jewish law, typically reserved for serious offenses such as blasphemy or idolatry. The leaders' fear of being stoned by the people underscores the high regard in which John the Baptist was held by the general populace. This fear also illustrates the leaders' lack of genuine spiritual authority and their reliance on public opinion to maintain their power. The potential for stoning reflects the volatile nature of public sentiment and the serious consequences of opposing popular religious figures.<p><b>for they are convinced that John was a prophet.&#8221;</b><br>John the Baptist is recognized as a prophet by the people, which is significant because prophets were seen as messengers of God, often calling for repentance and pointing towards future fulfillment of God's promises. John's role in preparing the way for Jesus is emphasized in the Gospels, and his prophetic ministry is validated by the people's conviction. This acknowledgment of John as a prophet also serves as an implicit endorsement of Jesus, whom John identified as the Messiah. The leaders' inability to deny John's prophetic status without incurring the wrath of the people highlights their spiritual blindness and resistance to God's work through both John and Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Luke, who is teaching in the temple courts and being questioned by the religious leaders.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests_and_scribes.htm">Chief Priests and Scribes</a></b><br>Religious leaders who are questioning Jesus' authority and are concerned about maintaining their own power and influence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A prophet recognized by the people, whose baptism and authority are being referenced in the discussion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The general populace who hold John the Baptist in high regard and are present during this exchange.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The setting of this event, a significant place of worship and teaching in Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_man_vs._fear_of_god.htm">Fear of Man vs. Fear of God</a></b><br>The religious leaders were more concerned about the opinion of the people than the truth of God.

They have already rejected John&#8217;s call to repentance (<a href="/luke/7-30.htm">Luke 7:30</a>), yet they know the crowd honors him.

John heralded the Lamb (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>) and demanded fruit in keeping with repentance (<a href="/luke/3-8.htm">Luke 3:8</a>).
