The use of "Lord" here is significant because it indicates a position of authority and divinity. In Jewish tradition, the Messiah was expected to be a descendant of David, a human king. However, David calling the Messiah "Lord" suggests a higher status than that of a mere descendant. This implies the Messiah's divine nature, which is a cornerstone of Christian belief in Jesus as both fully God and fully man. The term "Lord" (Greek: Kyrios) is often used in the New Testament to denote Jesus' divine authority and is a title that reflects His sovereignty and pre-existence.<p><b>So how can He be David&#8217;s son?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question posed by Jesus challenges the prevailing Jewish understanding of the Messiah as merely a political or earthly figure. By highlighting the paradox of the Messiah being both David's Lord and his son, Jesus points to the mystery of the Incarnation. This question invites the audience to reconsider their expectations of the Messiah and recognize Jesus' unique identity. The genealogies in <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a> and <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a> trace Jesus' lineage back to David, affirming His rightful claim as David's descendant. However, His divine sonship is emphasized in passages like <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-14</a>, where Jesus is described as the Word made flesh. This dual identity fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>, which speak of a child born who will be called "Mighty God" and "Everlasting Father," indicating both human and divine natures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, a man after God's own heart, and the author of many Psalms.
