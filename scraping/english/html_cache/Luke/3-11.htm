His message often called for repentance and ethical living, aligning with the prophetic tradition of calling Israel back to covenant faithfulness.<p><b>Whoever has two tunics</b><br>A tunic was a basic garment in ancient times, often worn as an undergarment. Having two tunics implies having more than one needs, suggesting a level of wealth or surplus. This reflects the biblical principle of stewardship and generosity, emphasizing that material possessions should be used to serve others.<p><b>should share with him who has none</b><br>This directive echoes the Old Testament laws concerning care for the poor and needy, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>.

Sharing with those in need is a tangible expression of love and obedience to God.<p><b>and whoever has food should do the same</b><br>Food, a basic necessity, is used here to illustrate the broader principle of generosity. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who often spoke about feeding the hungry (<a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35</a>). It also reflects the communal nature of the early Christian community, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>, where believers shared their possessions with those in need.<br><br>This passage highlights the ethical demands of repentance, calling for a transformation that affects one's actions and relationships with others.
