In biblical times, standing over someone could signify a position of authority or readiness to act. Jesus' presence is often associated with healing and divine intervention, as seen in other miracles throughout the Gospels. His standing over Peter's mother-in-law signifies His readiness to heal and His authority over sickness.<p><b>and rebuked the fever</b><br>The act of rebuking the fever demonstrates Jesus' authority over illness, similar to how He rebukes demons and the storm in other passages. This reflects His divine power and control over creation, aligning with the belief that all things are subject to Him. The use of "rebuke" suggests that sickness is not part of God's original design and can be confronted with divine authority.<p><b>and it left her</b><br>The immediate departure of the fever highlights the effectiveness and power of Jesus' command. This instantaneous healing is a testament to His divine nature and the fulfillment of messianic prophecies that the Messiah would bring healing and restoration. It also serves as a sign of the in-breaking of God's kingdom, where sickness and suffering are overcome.<p><b>And she got up at once</b><br>Her immediate recovery and ability to rise without delay underscore the completeness of the healing. This contrasts with gradual healing processes and emphasizes the miraculous nature of Jesus' intervention. It also reflects the restoration of her strength and vitality, allowing her to resume her normal activities.<p><b>and began to serve them</b><br>Her response to serve is significant, reflecting gratitude and the restoration of her social role within the household. In the cultural context, hospitality was a valued virtue, and her service indicates a return to normalcy and community life. This act of service also symbolizes the appropriate response to Jesus' work in one's life&#8212;serving others and participating in the community of believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, demonstrating His divine authority and compassion by healing Simon Peter's mother-in-law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon's_mother-in-law.htm">Simon's Mother-in-law</a></b><br>The woman who was suffering from a high fever and was healed by Jesus.
