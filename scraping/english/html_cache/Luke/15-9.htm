In the context of the parable, the lost coin represents a sinner who repents. The act of finding signifies God's relentless pursuit of the lost. This mirrors the shepherd finding the lost sheep earlier in the chapter, emphasizing God's joy in redemption.<p><b>she calls together her friends and neighbors</b><br>The communal aspect of this phrase reflects the cultural importance of community in first-century Jewish society. Celebrations were often shared events, and the woman's joy is so profound that she wants others to partake in it. This reflects the heavenly celebration over one sinner who repents, as seen in <a href="/luke/15-7.htm">Luke 15:7 and 15</a>:10, where there is joy in the presence of the angels of God.<p><b>to say, &#8216;Rejoice with me</b><br>The invitation to rejoice underscores the shared joy in the recovery of the lost. Biblically, rejoicing is a common response to God's acts of salvation and deliverance, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15:1-21</a> and <a href="/psalms/126-3.htm">Psalm 126:3</a>. This communal rejoicing is a foretaste of the heavenly joy described in <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-9</a>.<p><b>for I have found my lost coin.&#8217;</b><br>The lost coin, likely a drachma, was significant in value, possibly representing a day's wage. Its recovery symbolizes the value God places on each individual. The parable illustrates the theme of redemption and restoration, central to the Gospel message. The joy of finding the lost coin parallels the joy of God when a sinner repents, reinforcing the message of <a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>, where Jesus states His mission to seek and save the lost.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>Represents God or Jesus in the parable, illustrating the diligent search for the lost.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/friends_and_neighbors.htm">Friends and Neighbors</a></b><br>Symbolize the community of believers who are called to rejoice in the repentance and return of the lost.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lost_coin.htm">The Lost Coin</a></b><br>Represents a sinner who is lost and then found, emphasizing the value of each individual to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house.htm">The House</a></b><br>The setting of the parable, symbolizing the world or the church where the search takes place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rejoicing.htm">The Rejoicing</a></b><br>The celebration that occurs when the lost is found, reflecting the joy in heaven over one sinner who repents.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_the_individual.htm">The Value of the Individual</a></b><br>Each person is precious to God, and He diligently seeks those who are lost.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_rejoicing.htm">Community Rejoicing</a></b><br>The church should celebrate and support the repentance and restoration of individuals.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_relentless_pursuit.htm">God's Relentless Pursuit</a></b><br>God does not give up on anyone, and His love compels Him to search until the lost are found.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_joy_of_salvation.htm">The Joy of Salvation</a></b><br>Salvation brings immense joy not only to the individual but also to the entire community of believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_participation_in_god's_mission.htm">Active Participation in God's Mission</a></b><br>Believers are called to join in God's mission to seek and save the lost, sharing in the joy of their return.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_15_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 15:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_mirror_joy_from_Luke_15_9.htm">How can we emulate the woman's joy in Luke 15:9 in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Luke_15_9_Repentance_forgiveness_value.htm">What does Luke 15:9 teach about the value of repentance and forgiveness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Luke_15_9_to_lost_sheep_parable.htm">How does Luke 15:9 connect with the parable of the lost sheep?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_celebrate_others_spiritual_wins.htm">In what ways can we "rejoice with" others in their spiritual victories?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Luke_15_9_inspire_outreach.htm">How can Luke 15:9 inspire us to seek the lost in our community?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_15_9_Joy_in_heaven_for_repentance.htm">What does Luke 15:9 reveal about the nature of joy in heaven over repentance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Luke_15_9_show_God_s_view.htm">How does the parable in Luke 15:9 illustrate God's view on lost and found?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_finding_the_lost_coin_important.htm">Why is the act of finding the lost coin significant in Luke 15:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_15.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_do_white_garments_mean_in_revelation.htm">What does prioritizing others' interests entail?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/meaning_of_'jesus,_friend_of_sinners'.htm">What does 'Jesus, Friend of Sinners' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/did_jesus_appear_to_12_or_11_disciples.htm">How many disciples did Jesus appear to after his resurrection: Twelve (1 Cor 15:5) or Eleven (Matt 27:3-5;

Heaven&#8217;s chorus erupts whenever the lost are found, and we are summoned to join the song.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost. Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth</span>. Again, as in the parable of the lost sheep, we find this longing for sympathy; again the finding of this sympathy in heavenly places, among heavenly beings, is especially recorded. There is a slight difference in the language of rejoicing here. In the first parable it was, "Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep <span class="accented">which was</span> lost;" here, "...for I have found the piece <span class="accented">which I had</span> lost." In the first it was the anguish of the sheep which was the central point of the story; in the second it was the distress of the woman who had lost something; hence this difference in the wording. "What grandeur belongs to the picture of this humble rejoicing which this poor woman celebrates with her neighbours, when it becomes the transparency through which we get a glimpse of God himself, rejoicing with his elect and his angels over the salvation of a single sinner!" (Godet). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/15-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">when she finds [it],</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8017;&#961;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(heurousa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2147.htm">Strong's 2147: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary heuro, which heureo is used for it in all the tenses except the present and imperfect to find.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">she calls together</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#8150;</span> <span class="translit">(synkalei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4779.htm">Strong's 4779: </a> </span><span class="str2">To call together.
