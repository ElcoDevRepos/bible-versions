The "high place" is symbolic of a vantage point, possibly a mountain, which in biblical times was often associated with divine encounters or significant events (e.g., Moses on Mount Sinai). This setting underscores the gravity of the temptation and the devil's attempt to assert authority over Jesus. Theologically, it reflects the devil's role as the "prince of this world" (<a href="/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>), temporarily permitted to wield influence.<p><b>and showed Him in an instant</b><br>The phrase "in an instant" suggests a supernatural vision rather than a physical journey. This momentary revelation implies the devil's attempt to overwhelm Jesus with the grandeur and allure of worldly power. The immediacy of the vision contrasts with the eternal nature of God's kingdom, highlighting the fleeting and deceptive nature of earthly power. This aligns with the devil's character as a deceiver, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3:1-5</a>, where he uses half-truths to tempt Eve.<p><b>all the kingdoms of the world</b><br>This phrase encompasses the entirety of human political and cultural power structures. The kingdoms represent not just geographical territories but also the systems and authorities that govern them. Historically, this would include the Roman Empire, which dominated the known world at the time. Theologically, it reflects the devil's claim to authority over earthly realms, a claim that Jesus later refutes through His death and resurrection (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). This temptation echoes the promise of dominion given to Adam, which was marred by sin, and foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's kingdom through Christ (<a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is being tempted by the devil in the wilderness after fasting for forty days and nights.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_devil.htm">The Devil</a></b><br>Also known as Satan, he is the tempter who challenges Jesus, attempting to divert Him from His divine mission.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_place.htm">High Place</a></b><br>The location to which the devil leads Jesus.

Each phrase exposes layers of the enemy&#8217;s strategy&#8212;inviting pride, offering shortcuts, pressing for hurried decisions&#8212;while highlighting Jesus&#8217; steadfast obedience. The verse reminds believers that temptations may be dramatic, sensory, and swift, yet God&#8217;s Word, sovereignty, and eternal plan far outweigh every fleeting offer of the evil one.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">The kingdoms of the world.</span>--St. Luke uses the word (literally, <span class= "ital">the inhabited world</span>) which was commonly used as co-extensive with the Roman empire.

This temptation was something more than "offering to One who had lived as a village carpenter the throne of the world." It appealed to his ambition certainly, but in Jesus' case it was a high, pure, sinless ambition. This much he certainly knew already, that he was destined to rule over men from pole to pole. It was for him a righteous longing, this desire to have the heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth as his possession. No false ambition was this in Jesus, this desire to realize the glorious Messianic hope. Again, how typical a temptation! All ranks and orders are often soon tempted here. A noble end as they think, and in the beauty of the goal they forget that the road leading to it is paved with evil and wrong. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/4-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the devil] led Him up to a high place</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#945;&#947;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(anagag&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_321.htm">Strong's 321: </a> </span><span class="str2">From ana and ago; to lead up; by extension to bring out; specially, to sail away.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[and] showed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#958;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(edeixen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1166.htm">Strong's 1166: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of an obsolete primary of the same meaning; to show.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Him</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
