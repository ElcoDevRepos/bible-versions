Throughout the Gospels, Jesus demonstrates His ability to perceive the thoughts and intentions of others (e.g., <a href="/matthew/9-4.htm">Matthew 9:4</a>, <a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>). This ability underscores His authority and insight, which are consistent with Old Testament depictions of God knowing the hearts of men (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>).<p><b>and said to the man with the withered hand</b><br>The man with the withered hand represents those marginalized and suffering in society. In the cultural context of first-century Judea, physical deformities often led to social and religious exclusion. By addressing this man, Jesus challenges societal norms and demonstrates His compassion and willingness to restore and heal. This act is a fulfillment of messianic prophecies that speak of healing and restoration (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Get up and stand among us.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus' command for the man to stand among them is significant. It is a public act, drawing attention to the miracle He is about to perform. This setting emphasizes the confrontation between Jesus and the Pharisees, who were watching to accuse Him of breaking the Sabbath (<a href="/luke/6-7.htm">Luke 6:7</a>). The act of standing among them symbolizes the man's reintegration into the community and foreshadows the inclusive nature of the Kingdom of God, where the marginalized are brought to the center.<p><b>So he got up and stood there.</b><br>The man's obedience to Jesus' command demonstrates faith and trust in Jesus' authority. His action is a precursor to the healing that follows, illustrating the principle that faith often precedes divine intervention. This moment also serves as a testament to Jesus' power to transform lives, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of redemption and restoration. The man's response can be seen as a type of the believer's response to Christ's call, illustrating the transformative power of faith and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, demonstrating His divine knowledge and authority.

As in <a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>, He &#8220;knew what was in each man,&#8221; and, just as <a href="/luke/11-17.htm">Luke 11:17</a> notes, He &#8220;knew their thoughts.&#8221; This mirrors the truth of <a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a> that God &#8220;perceives&#8221; every word before it is on our tongues. Because He is fully God, nothing in the human heart is hidden from Him (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12-13</a>). For the gathered observers, this moment silently affirmed His authority to judge motives as well as actions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said to the man with the withered hand</b><p>While the religious leaders plotted, Jesus turned His attention to a suffering individual. The Lord consistently singles out people others overlook&#8212;think of Zacchaeus in <a href="/luke/19-5.htm">Luke 19:5</a> or the Samaritan woman in <a href="/john/4-7.htm">John 4:7-10</a>. By addressing the man directly, Jesus offered dignity and hope, foreshadowing how He &#8220;came to seek and to save the lost&#8221; (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>). In the parallel account of <a href="/mark/3-1.htm">Mark 3:1-3</a>, the same deliberate focus highlights both compassion and purpose: Jesus intended to confront legalistic hardness while restoring a life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Get up and stand among us.</b><p>The command required public obedience. Much like Peter&#8217;s words to the lame beggar in <a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6-8</a>, or Jesus&#8217; instruction to the crippled woman in <a href="/luke/13-12.htm">Luke 13:12-13</a>, the call to &#8220;stand&#8221; invited faith before the miracle happened. It also exposed the onlookers&#8217; hearts&#8212;would they rejoice at God&#8217;s mercy or cling to their rigid Sabbath rules? Jesus often intertwined faith and public confession (<a href="/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>), urging people to step forward so that God&#8217;s power &#8220;may rest on&#8221; human weakness (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So he got up and stood there.</b><p>The man&#8217;s immediate response demonstrated trusting obedience. Similar acts of faith preceded other healings: the blind man washing in <a href="/john/9-7.htm">John 9:7</a>, or the ten lepers heading to the priests in <a href="/luke/17-14.htm">Luke 17:14</a>. His simple action illustrated <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17-18</a>&#8212;faith proves itself through works. By standing in full view, he became a living testimony, setting the stage for Jesus to display divine power and silence His critics.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/6-8.htm">Luke 6:8</a> shows Jesus reading hearts, valuing the hurting, calling for public faith, and rewarding obedience. The verse invites us to trust the Savior who knows every thought, speaks personally into our need, asks us to stand for Him openly, and meets that faith with transforming grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Rise up, and stand forth in the midst.</span>--Here again, and throughout what follows, we have another example of a narrative in which St. Mark and St. Luke agree much more closely than either agrees with St. Matthew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst.

The Gospel which Jerome found among the Nazarenes gives at length the prayer of this man with the withered hand. "I was a mason earning my livelihood with my own hands; I pray thee, Jesus, restore me to health, in order that I may not with shame beg my bread." This Nazarene Gospel was only used among a sect of early Jewish Christians, and has not been preserved. It possibly was one of those alluded to by the compiler of the Third Gospel in his preface (<a href="/luke/1-1.htm">Luke 1:1</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/6-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#913;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Autos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
