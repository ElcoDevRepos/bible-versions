In the cultural context of the time, professional mourners were often hired to lament the dead, and their laughter indicates a lack of faith in Jesus' power over death. This reaction is reminiscent of other instances in Scripture where Jesus was mocked or doubted, such as during His crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39-44</a>). The laughter underscores the contrast between human understanding and divine power, as Jesus often performed miracles that defied natural expectations.<p><b>knowing that she was dead</b><br>The certainty of the girl's death is emphasized here, setting the stage for a miraculous demonstration of Jesus' authority over life and death. In Jewish culture, death was a significant and final event, and the mourners' knowledge of her death reflects their experience and certainty. This situation parallels the story of Lazarus in <a href="/john/11.htm">John 11</a>, where Jesus raises someone from the dead, further affirming His identity as the resurrection and the life. The phrase also highlights the theme of faith versus sight, as the mourners rely on their physical perception, while Jesus operates on a higher spiritual plane.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is demonstrating His divine authority and power over life and death.

These were, no doubt, the hired mourners. Familiar as they were with death, they ridiculed the idea of one whom they knew had passed away, awaking again as from a sleep. These public mourners were customary figures in all Jewish homes, even in the poorest where a death had occurred. They are still usual throughout the Levant. The expression, "laughed him to scorn," is found in Shakespeare - <p><span class="accented">"Our castle's strength<br />Will laugh a siege to scorn."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Macbeth,' act 5. sc. 5.</span>) The Aramaic words, <span class="accented">Talitha, kumi</span>!
