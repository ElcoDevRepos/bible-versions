This reflects the importance of inner motives, as God judges the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><b>&#8216;My master will be a long time in coming,&#8217;</b><br>The servant's assumption about the master's delay reflects a common theme in Scripture regarding the unexpected timing of the Lord's return (<a href="/matthew/24-44.htm">Matthew 24:44</a>).

It contrasts with Jesus' teaching on servant leadership (<a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42-45</a>).<p><b>and to eat and drink and get drunk.</b><br>This phrase highlights indulgence and moral decay. Eating and drinking to excess symbolize a life focused on self-gratification rather than service and responsibility. Drunkenness is condemned throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>, <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>) as it leads to a loss of self-control and spiritual vigilance, which are essential for a faithful servant awaiting the master's return.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Represents a person entrusted with responsibilities by their master.

Scripture makes clear that what a person allows to brew in the heart eventually guides outward behavior (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>; <a href="/matthew/15-18.htm">Matthew 15:18-19</a>). The servant&#8217;s silent reasoning shows a subtle but real shift away from trust in his master&#8217;s word. Like the fool who &#8220;says in his heart, &#8216;There is no God&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>), this servant quietly dismisses accountability. The warning is immediate: spiritual decline often starts with private thoughts rather than public actions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;My master will be a long time in coming,&#8217;</b><p>Here the servant convinces himself that the master&#8217;s delay frees him from present responsibility. Jesus uses the delay motif elsewhere&#8212;&#8220;But if that wicked servant says to himself, &#8216;My master is delayed&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/24-48.htm">Matthew 24:48</a>)&#8212;to show how doubting the timing of His return fosters lax living. Peter echoes the theme: &#8220;Where is the promise of His coming?&#8221; scoffers ask (<a href="/2_peter/3-3.htm">2 Peter 3:3-4</a>). The lesson is straightforward: because Christ&#8217;s return seems delayed, some dismiss its certainty. Yet the very delay underscores God&#8217;s patience (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>), not His absence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he begins to beat the menservants and maidservants</b><p>Once accountability is shelved, the servant&#8217;s leadership turns abusive. Instead of stewarding fellow servants with care (<a href="/luke/12-42.htm">Luke 12:42-44</a>), he exploits them. This echoes God&#8217;s indictment of self-serving shepherds in <a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-4</a> and reminds that &#8220;the greatest among you shall be your servant&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/23-11.htm">Matthew 23:11</a>). The passage exposes how disbelief in the master&#8217;s imminent return breeds oppression: if no inspection is expected, power will readily be wielded for personal advantage.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and to eat and drink and get drunk</b><p>The servant&#8217;s corruption blossoms into open indulgence. Neglecting his post, he seeks pleasure and intoxication, ignoring repeated biblical calls to sobriety (<a href="/luke/21-34.htm">Luke 21:34</a>; <a href="/romans/13-13.htm">Romans 13:13</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6-7</a>). The phrase paints a life absorbed in self-gratification rather than faithful service. It stands in sharp contrast to the watchful steward Jesus blesses earlier in the chapter (<a href="/luke/12-37.htm">Luke 12:37</a>). Drunkenness here symbolizes any lifestyle that numbs sensitivity to God&#8217;s voice and the needs of others.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/12-45.htm">Luke 12:45</a> warns that unbelief concerning the Master&#8217;s return begins in the heart, grows through rationalized delay, erupts in mistreatment of others, and culminates in unchecked self-indulgence. The verse calls every disciple to guard inner thoughts, live every day as though Christ could appear at any moment, steward authority for the good of others, and reject the lure of fleshly excess. Christ&#8217;s literal, promised return remains the sure anchor that keeps service faithful and life sober.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(45) <span class= "bld">To beat the menservants.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the boys,</span> but in the sense which the word had acquired, like the French <span class= "ital">garcon,</span> as used generally for servants of any age. Note the more specific terms as compared with the "fellow-servants" of St. Matthew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 45, 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken; the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware</span>. "But," continued the Master, "although certain of my servants have onlooks to higher degrees of glory than the great mass of their fellows, these seemingly favored ones have at the same time more perilous responsibilities; and only if in these graver responsibilities they are faithful to the end, will they receive their high and peculiar reward." If, on the other hand, they fail in their perpetual watch for the coming of their Lord, and instead of the restless toil which the Master has assigned to these stewards, these servants, weighted with higher responsibilities, give themselves up to worldly pleasures and passions, terrible will be their doom. Again the excesses of the table are specially mentioned. If, instead of spending themselves in the cares of their high office, they make a profit out of that office, if they live as oppressors of the flock rather than as shepherds, then to these unfaithful stewards will the Lord suddenly come, as pictured in the parable imagery, a thief in the night. <span class="cmt_word">And will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers</span>. The terrible punishment here specified was not unknown among the ancients (see Herodotus, 7:39; and <a href="/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>). Isaiah was said to have been sawn asunder. <span class="accented">Bengel's</span> comment is curious: "<span class="accented">Qui</span> cor <span class="accented">divisum</span> habet, <span class="accented">dividetur."</span> It has been suggested, to bring the punishment into harmony with the statement immediately following, which speaks of a definite and, perhaps, of an enduring position for the guilty one, a "portion with the unbelievers," to understand the word as an equivalent for scourging; so in the Latin we find <span class="accented">flagellis discindere</span>, to scourge the back with the rod. There is, however, no known instance of the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> being used in this sense. The expression is, however, used as simply implying that a terrible doom is surely reserved in the life to come for those who have so sadly misused their high opportunities and neglected their great responsibilities. "The image of the parable itself is blended with the reality which the parable signifies; this thought of the human master who can punish his slaves with temporal death passes into that of the Divine Judge who can punish with spiritual death" (Dean Mansel). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/12-45.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">suppose</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#8048;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Ean)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1437.htm">Strong's 1437: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
