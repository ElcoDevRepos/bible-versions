This communal act of prayer underscores the unity and collective faith of the Jewish people. It was customary for the people to pray during this time, aligning their prayers with the symbolic act of the incense rising to God. This practice reflects the Jewish understanding of corporate worship and the power of communal prayer (<a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>; <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>).
