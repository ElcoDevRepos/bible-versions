The first day of the week is Sunday, following the Jewish Sabbath, which is Saturday. This marks the beginning of a new week and is significant as it is the day of Jesus' resurrection, symbolizing a new creation and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan. The early church began to gather on this day to commemorate the resurrection, which is why Sunday became the primary day of Christian worship.<p><b>very early in the morning</b><br>The timing here underscores the devotion and urgency of the women. In the Jewish context, the day begins at sunset, so "very early in the morning" would be just after dawn. This detail highlights the women's eagerness to perform their duties despite the potential dangers and uncertainties following Jesus' crucifixion. It also reflects the cultural practice of visiting tombs early in the day to avoid the heat and to ensure the body was properly cared for.<p><b>the women came to the tomb</b><br>The women mentioned here include Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and others, as noted in other Gospel accounts. Their presence is significant as women were the first witnesses to the resurrection, which is notable given the cultural context where women's testimonies were often undervalued. This emphasizes the inclusivity of the Gospel message and the important role women played in Jesus' ministry and the early church.<p><b>bringing the spices they had prepared</b><br>The spices were intended for anointing Jesus' body, a customary practice in Jewish burial traditions to honor the deceased and mitigate the odor of decay. This act of bringing spices shows the women's love and respect for Jesus, as well as their expectation that His body would still be in the tomb. The preparation of spices also indicates their adherence to Jewish customs, as they had to wait until after the Sabbath to perform this act. This detail sets the stage for the discovery of the empty tomb, highlighting the unexpected nature of the resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_women.htm">The Women</a></b><br>These are the faithful followers of Jesus who came to anoint His body.

All the four evangelists give an account of the Resurrection. None of the four, however, attempt to give a <span class="accented">history</span> of it simply from a human point of sight. Each Gospel probably reproduces the special points dwelt on in certain great centres of Christian teaching, in what we should now term different schools of thought. (Attempts have been made by theological scholars to <span class="accented">classify</span> these as Jewish, Gentile, Greek, Roman; but only with indifferent success). The teaching which St. Matthew's Gospel represents, evidently in the Resurrection preaching dwelt with peculiar insistence on the great Galilaean appearance of the Risen. St. Luke confines himself exclusively to the appearance, in Judaea. St. John chooses for his Resurrection instruction scenes which had for their theatre both Galilee and Judaea. St. John, as his central or most detailed piece of teaching, dwells on a fishing scene on Gennesaret, the actors being the well-known inner circle of the apostles. While St. Luke chooses for his detailed Resurrection narrative a high-road in a Jerusalem suburb; and for actors, two devoted, but historically unknown, disciples. Then there is no question of <span class="accented">discrepancies</span> in this portion of the great history. It is not easy to frame a perfectly satisfactory harmony of all the events related by the four, after the Lord had risen; for, in fact, we possess no detailed account or history of what took place in that eventful period in presence of the disciples. We simply have memoranda of eye-witnesses of certain <span class="accented">incidents</span> connected with the Resurrection selected by the great first teachers as specially adapted to their own preaching and instruction. The events of the first Easter Day have Been tabulated by Professor Westcott, in what he terms a provisional arrangement, as follows: - <span class="ref_word">APPROX.
