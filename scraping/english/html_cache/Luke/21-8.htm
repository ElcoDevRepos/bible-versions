This context is crucial as it sets the stage for His teachings on vigilance and discernment. Jesus, as the ultimate teacher and prophet, provides guidance that is both immediate and eschatological.<p><b>See to it that you are not deceived</b><br>Jesus warns His followers to be vigilant against deception. This echoes the biblical theme of spiritual discernment found throughout Scripture, such as in 1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>, which advises believers to test the spirits. The early church faced numerous false teachings, and this warning remains relevant as believers are called to uphold truth in a world filled with falsehoods.<p><b>For many will come in My name</b><br>This phrase indicates that false prophets and messiahs will arise, claiming authority and identity with Christ. Historically, there have been numerous individuals who have claimed to be the Messiah, both in the first century and throughout history. This serves as a reminder of the importance of knowing the true character and teachings of Jesus to avoid being led astray.<p><b>Claiming, &#8216;I am He&#8217;</b><br>The claim "I am He" is a direct assertion of messianic identity. In the cultural and historical context of first-century Judea, messianic expectations were high, and many were looking for a political or military leader. Jesus warns that such claims will be made by impostors, emphasizing the need for spiritual discernment.<p><b>And, &#8216;The time is near&#8217;</b><br>This phrase reflects the eschatological urgency that false teachers might exploit. Throughout history, various groups have predicted the imminent end of the world, often leading to misguided actions and beliefs. Jesus cautions against such predictions, aligning with His teaching in <a href="/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36</a> that no one knows the day or hour of His return.<p><b>Do not follow them</b><br>The command not to follow false messiahs or prophets is a call to steadfastness in faith. It underscores the importance of adhering to the teachings of Christ and the apostles, as seen in passages like <a href="/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8-9</a>, which warns against accepting any gospel contrary to the one preached by the apostles.

Many of these pretenders appeared in the lifetime of the apostles. Josephus mentions several of these impostors ('Ant.,' 20:8 &sect;&sect; 6-10; 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:13. &sect; 5). Theudas, one of these pretenders, is referred to in <a href="/acts/21-38.htm">Acts 21:38</a> (see, too, Josephus, 'Ant.,' 20:05. &sect; 1). Simon Magus announced that he was Messiah. His riyal Dositheus, his disciple Menander, advanced similar pretences. Mr. Greswell (quoted by Dean Manse], 'Speaker's Commentary,' on <a href="/matthew/24-5.htm">Matthew 24:5</a>) has called attention to the remarkable fact that, while many of these false Messiahs appeared in the interval between the Lord's ascension and the Jewish war, there is no evidence that any one arose claiming this title before the beginning of his ministry. It was necessary, he infers, that the true Christ should first appear and be rejected by the great body of the nation, before they were judicially given over to the delusions of the false Christs. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/21-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Jesus] answered,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
