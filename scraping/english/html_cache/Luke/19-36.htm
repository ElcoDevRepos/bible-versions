This event is significant as it marks the beginning of the final week of Jesus' earthly ministry, leading up to His crucifixion. The act of riding, specifically on a colt, fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, which speaks of a king coming to Jerusalem "righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey." This symbolizes Jesus' role as the humble Messiah, contrasting with the expectations of a conquering king.<p><b>the people spread their cloaks on the road</b><br>The spreading of cloaks on the road is a gesture of honor and submission, acknowledging Jesus as a king. This act can be compared to the reception of Jehu in <a href="/2_kings/9-13.htm">2 Kings 9:13</a>, where garments were laid under him as a sign of respect and recognition of his kingship. In the cultural context of the time, laying down cloaks was a way for the people to show reverence and to prepare a path for someone of great importance.
