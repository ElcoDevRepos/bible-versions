The Feast commemorates the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, during which they left in haste and did not have time to let their bread rise. This day marks the preparation for the Passover meal, emphasizing the removal of leaven from homes, symbolizing the removal of sin and corruption. The timing of this event is crucial, as it sets the stage for the Last Supper, which Jesus shares with His disciples.<p><b>on which the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed</b><br>The Passover lamb is central to the Passover celebration, symbolizing God's deliverance of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. Each household was to sacrifice a lamb without blemish, foreshadowing Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The sacrifice of the lamb is a type of Christ's sacrificial death, highlighting themes of redemption and atonement. The historical context of this practice dates back to <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, where the blood of the lamb was used to protect the Israelites from the final plague.
