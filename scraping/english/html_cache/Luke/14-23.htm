The relationship between master and servant reflects the authority and obedience expected in the divine mission. This mirrors the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus instructs His disciples to go and make disciples of all nations.<p><b>Go out to the highways and hedges</b><br>The "highways and hedges" signify areas outside the city, representing the Gentiles and those marginalized by society. This phrase emphasizes the inclusivity of the Gospel message, extending beyond the Jewish people to all nations. It reflects the cultural context of first-century Palestine, where roads and hedges marked boundaries and were often places where the outcasts and travelers could be found.<p><b>and compel them to come in</b><br>The word "compel" suggests urgency and earnest persuasion, not force. It indicates the importance of the invitation to God's kingdom and the necessity of a response. This aligns with <a href="/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>, where believers are described as ambassadors for Christ, imploring others to be reconciled to God. The cultural context of hospitality in the ancient Near East also underscores the importance of accepting such an invitation.<p><b>so that my house will be full</b><br>The "house" symbolizes the kingdom of God, and the desire for it to be "full" reflects God's will for all to be saved, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>. This phrase highlights the abundance and generosity of God's grace, contrasting with the exclusivity often practiced by religious leaders of the time. It also points to the eschatological vision of a great banquet in the kingdom of heaven, as depicted in <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>Represents God, who desires His house (the Kingdom of Heaven) to be filled with people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Symbolizes believers or disciples tasked with spreading the Gospel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/highways_and_hedges.htm">Highways and Hedges</a></b><br>Metaphorically represent places outside the immediate community, indicating the call to reach out to all people, including those on the fringes of society.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house.htm">The House</a></b><br>Represents the Kingdom of God, which is open to all who accept the invitation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_invitation.htm">The Invitation</a></b><br>The call to salvation and participation in God's Kingdom, extended to everyone.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_the_gospel.htm">The Urgency of the Gospel</a></b><br>The command to "compel them to come in" underscores the urgency and importance of sharing the Gospel with all people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/inclusivity_of_god's_kingdom.htm">Inclusivity of God's Kingdom</a></b><br>God's invitation extends beyond traditional boundaries, calling us to reach out to those who might be marginalized or overlooked.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_the_believer.htm">Role of the Believer</a></b><br>As servants of the Master, believers are called to actively participate in God's mission, going out to invite others into His Kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fullness_of_god's_house.htm">The Fullness of God's House</a></b><br>God's desire is for His house to be full, reflecting His heart for all to come to repentance and salvation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compelling_with_love_and_truth.htm">Compelling with Love and Truth</a></b><br>The method of compelling should be rooted in love and truth, not coercion, reflecting the character of Christ in our outreach.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_14_23_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 14:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_14_23_s_role_in_daily_evangelism.htm">How does Luke 14:23 encourage evangelism in our daily lives today?

The verse marries divine initiative, human obedience, and a worldwide invitation into one compelling snapshot of the gospel mission.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">The highways and hedges.</span>--In the frame-work of the parable, this points to a yet lower class of the population of an Eastern country--to the tramps and the squatters who had no home, and who were content to sleep under the shelter of a hedge or fence. For the most part, these were low walls or palisades, rather than hedges in the English sense of the word. In the application of the parable, the men thus brought in can hardly be any other than the wanderers of the outlying Gentile world.<p><span class= "bld">Compel them to come in.</span>--It would have seemed all but incredible, had it not been too painfully and conspicuously true, that men could have seen in these words a sanction to the employment of force and pains and penalties as means of converting men to the faith of Christ. To us it seems almost a truism to say that such means may produce proselytes and hypocrites, but cannot possibly produce converts. There is, of course, something that answers to this "compulsion" in the work of Christian preachers, but the weapons of their warfare are not carnal (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm" title="(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)">2Corinthians 10:4</a>), and the constraint which they bring to bear on men is that of "the love of Christ" (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-14.htm" title="For the love of Christ constrains us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:">2Corinthians 5:14</a>) The only instances of the other kind of compulsion in the Apostolic age are when Saul "compelled" men and women to blaspheme (<a href="/acts/26-11.htm" title="And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even to strange cities.">Acts 26:11</a>), or the Judaisers "compelled" Gentile converts to be circumcised (<a href="/galatians/2-14.htm" title="But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compel you the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?">Galatians 2:14</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-12.htm" title="As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.">Galatians 6:12</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges</span>. Hitherto the parable-story has been dealing with the past and the present of Israel; it now becomes prophetic, and speaks of a state of things to be. The third series of invitations is not addressed to inhabitants of a city. No walls hem in these far-scattered dwellers among the highways and hedges of the world. This time the master of the house asks to his great banquet those who live in the isles of the Gentiles<span class="cmt_word">. And compel them to some in</span>. A greater pressure is put on <span class="accented">this</span> class of outsiders than was tried upon the favoured first invited. The indifferent ones were left to themselves. <span class="accented">They</span> knew, or professed to know and to appreciate, the nature of that feast in heaven, the invitation to which they treated <span class="accented">apparently</span> with so much honour, and <span class="accented">really</span> with such contempt. But these outsiders the Divine Host would treat differently. To them the notion of a pitying, loving God was quite a strange thought; <span class="accented">these</span> must be compelled - must be brought to him with the gentle force which the angels used when they laid hold of the hand of lingering Lot, and brought him out of the doomed city of the plain. Thus faithful men, intensely convinced of the truth of their message, <span class="accented">compel</span> others, by the bright earnestness of their words and life, to join the company of those who are going up to the feast above. Anselm thinks that God may be also said to <span class="accented">compel</span> men to come in when he drives them by calamities to seek and find refuge with him and in his Church. <span class="cmt_word">That my house may be filled</span>. In ver. 22 the servant, who knew well his master's mind and his master's house too, and its capabilities, tells his lord how, after many had accepted the invitation and were gone in to the banquet, "yet there was room." The master of the house, approving his servant's words, confirms them by repeating, "Bring in more andyet more, that my house may be filled." Bengel comments here with his quaint grace in words to which no translation can do justice: "Nee natura nec gratis patitur vacuum." Our God, with his burning love for souls, will never bear to contemplate a half-empty heaven. "Messiah will see of the travail of his soul, and be satisfied." "The love of God," says Godet, "is great; it requires a multitude of guests; it will not have a seat empty. The number of the elect is, as it were, determined beforehand by the riches of the Divine glory, which cannot find complete reflection without a certain number of human beings. The invitation will, therefore, be continued, and consequently the history of our race prolonged, until that number be reached." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/14-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[So]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
