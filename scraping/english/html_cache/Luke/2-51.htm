Nazareth, a small town in Galilee, was Jesus' childhood home. The phrase "went down" reflects the geographical descent from the higher elevation of Jerusalem to the lower region of Nazareth. This journey underscores Jesus' humble submission to His earthly family, despite His divine nature. It also fulfills the prophecy that the Messiah would be called a Nazarene, as mentioned in <a href="/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>.<p><b>and was obedient to them</b><br>Jesus' obedience to His earthly parents highlights His fulfillment of the Law, specifically the commandment to honor one's father and mother (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). This obedience is significant as it demonstrates His sinless nature and His role as the perfect Son. It also serves as a model for Christian behavior, emphasizing the importance of family and respect for parental authority. This obedience is consistent with His later submission to the will of the Father, as seen throughout His ministry.<p><b>But His mother treasured up all these things in her heart</b><br>Mary's reflection on the events surrounding Jesus' life indicates her deep contemplation and understanding of His unique identity and mission. The phrase suggests a meditative and thoughtful response, as she pondered the significance of Jesus' actions and words. This introspection is reminiscent of her earlier response to the angel Gabriel's announcement (<a href="/luke/1-29.htm">Luke 1:29</a>) and the shepherds' visit (<a href="/luke/2-19.htm">Luke 2:19</a>). It highlights Mary's role as a witness to Jesus' life and the unfolding of God's redemptive plan.

The twelve years that had passed had not changed the character of the Virgin Mother. It was still conspicuous, more even than that of Joseph, for the faith which accepted what it could not understand, and waited patiently for the solution of its perplexities.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth</span>. The question of Mary, and the quiet grave answer of the Child Jesus, were all that seems to have taken place. It served, no doubt, to bring back to Mary's mind what had long passed, and the memory of which for her was beginning somewhat to fade. This was, no doubt, one of the uses of the temple scene, but it had other and deeper purposes to serve. It was then, perhaps, as we have already reverently surmised, in the gradual development and growth of the Redeemer, that consciousness who he really was first dawned upon "the <span class="accented">Child</span> Jesus." <span class="cmt_word">And was subject unto them</span>. This recital of the temple scene, the meeting with the great rabbis there, the few words of surprise addressed by the Boy to Mary and Joseph when they sought him "sorrowing" - "as if it were possible," to use Stier's expression, for "him to be in wrong or in danger" - this recital alone breaks the deep silence which shrouds the first thirty years of "the Life." For some eighteen years after that visit to Jerusalem Jesus appears to have lived and toiled as a carpenter at Nazareth, with Joseph and Mary while they both lived, with Mary and his halfsisters and brothers when Joseph was dead. Justin Martyr, living a century and a half later, speaks of the ploughs and yokes the Master's own hands had fashioned during float long quiet pause in his life. Why, it is often asked, were not these years spent in Jerusalem and in the temple neighborhood, in the center of busy life and active Jewish thought? Godet suggests an answer which, if not exhaustive, is at least satisfactory: "If the spiritual atmosphere of Nazareth was heavy, it was at least calm; and the labors of the workshop, in the retirement of this peaceful valley, under the eye of the Father, was a more favorable sphere for the development of Jesus than the ritualism of the temple and the rabbinical discussions of Jerusalem." Joseph is never again mentioned in the gospel story; the probability is that he died some time in that period of eighteen years. <span class="cmt_word">But his mother kept all these sayings in her heart</span>. As twelve years before, Mary - pondering in her heart - had treasured up the rough adoration of the shepherds and their strange story of what the angels said to them about her Child (ver. 19), as doubtless she had done too when the Magi laid their costly gifts before the Babe at Bethlehem, and when Simeon and Anna in the temple spoke their prophetic utterances over the Infant; so now the mother, in quiet humble faith, stored up again her Son's sayings in her heart, waiting with brave and constant patience for the hour when her God should grant her to see face to face the mysterious things she had hitherto seen only "in a glass darkly." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/2-51.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He went down</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#946;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(kateb&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2597.htm">Strong's 2597: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go down, come down, either from the sky or from higher land, descend.
