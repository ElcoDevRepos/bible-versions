This led to the belief that Elijah would return to prepare the way for the Messiah, as prophesied in <a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5-6</a>. The expectation of Elijah's return was prevalent during the time of Jesus, and many Jews were looking for signs of his appearance. This belief is reflected in the New Testament, where John the Baptist is identified with the spirit and power of Elijah (<a href="/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>). The mention of Elijah here indicates the people's anticipation of messianic fulfillment and their attempt to understand Jesus' identity in light of their expectations.<p><b>and still others that a prophet of old had arisen</b><br>The reference to "a prophet of old" suggests the people's recognition of Jesus as a significant prophetic figure, akin to the prophets of the Old Testament. Prophets like Moses, Samuel, and Isaiah were revered for their roles in delivering God's messages and guiding Israel. The idea of a prophet arising from the dead aligns with the Jewish belief in the resurrection and the hope for a new era of divine intervention. This reflects the people's struggle to categorize Jesus within their existing religious framework, acknowledging His miraculous works and authoritative teaching as reminiscent of the great prophets. This perception is also seen in other parts of the Gospels, where Jesus is compared to prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/matthew/16-14.htm">Matthew 16:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament known for his miraculous works and his confrontation with the prophets of Baal.
