This renaming signifies Peter's future role as a foundational leader in the early Church (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>). The act of renaming is significant in biblical tradition, often indicating a change in mission or identity, as seen with Abram to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>) and Jacob to Israel (<a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>). Peter's leadership is evident in the Book of Acts, where he is a central figure in the spread of the Gospel.<p><b>and his brother Andrew</b><br>Andrew, originally a disciple of John the Baptist, was one of the first to follow Jesus (<a href="/john/1-40.htm">John 1:40</a>). He is known for bringing others to Christ, including his brother Peter (<a href="/john/1-41.htm">John 1:41-42</a>). Andrew's role highlights the importance of personal evangelism and the impact of bringing family members to faith. His name, of Greek origin, suggests a Hellenistic influence, reflecting the diverse cultural context of Galilee.<p><b>James and John</b><br>James and John, the sons of Zebedee, were fishermen by trade and were called by Jesus while mending their nets (<a href="/mark/1-19.htm">Mark 1:19-20</a>). Known as the "Sons of Thunder" (<a href="/mark/3-17.htm">Mark 3:17</a>), they were part of Jesus' inner circle, witnessing key events such as the Transfiguration (<a href="/mark/9-2.htm">Mark 9:2-3</a>). Their fiery temperament is seen in their request to call down fire from heaven (<a href="/luke/9-54.htm">Luke 9:54</a>). James would become the first apostolic martyr (<a href="/acts/12-2.htm">Acts 12:2</a>), while John is traditionally credited with writing the Gospel of John, three epistles, and Revelation.<p><b>Philip and Bartholomew</b><br>Philip, from Bethsaida like Peter and Andrew (<a href="/john/1-44.htm">John 1:44</a>), is known for his practical nature, as seen in the feeding of the 5,000 (<a href="/john/6-5.htm">John 6:5-7</a>). He brought Nathanael (Bartholomew) to Jesus, demonstrating the importance of personal testimony (<a href="/john/1-45.htm">John 1:45-46</a>). Bartholomew, often identified with Nathanael, is noted for his initial skepticism about Jesus being from Nazareth, which turns to faith upon meeting Him (<a href="/john/1-47.htm">John 1:47-49</a>). This encounter underscores the theme of recognizing Jesus' divine nature through personal revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_peter.htm">Simon Peter</a></b><br>Originally named Simon, Jesus gave him the name Peter, meaning "rock" in Greek (Petros).

He is sometimes referred to as James the Greater to distinguish him from the other James.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/john.htm">John</a></b><br>Also a son of Zebedee and brother of James, John is known as the "beloved disciple." He authored several New Testament books, including the Gospel of John and Revelation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/philip.htm">Philip</a></b><br>From Bethsaida, the same town as Peter and Andrew, Philip was one of the first disciples called by Jesus. He is known for his evangelistic efforts, as seen in his interaction with the Ethiopian eunuch.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/b/bartholomew.htm">Bartholomew</a></b><br>Often identified with Nathanael, Bartholomew is known for his initial skepticism about Jesus, which turned into faith upon meeting Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_names.htm">The Importance of Names</a></b><br>Jesus renaming Simon as Peter signifies a transformation and a new identity in Christ.

Encouraging family involvement in church activities can strengthen both family bonds and the church community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/immediate_obedience.htm">Immediate Obedience</a></b><br>The disciples' immediate response to Jesus' call is a model for us.

Well-known and honoured names in the records of the first days. Mark adds a vivid detail which throws much light on the character and fortunes of the brothers; he calls them Boanerges, "sons of thunder."
