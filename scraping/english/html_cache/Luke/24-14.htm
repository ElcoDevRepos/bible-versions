The act of discussing events is a common human response to processing significant occurrences. In the context of first-century Jewish culture, oral tradition was a primary means of sharing and preserving information. This conversation reflects the communal nature of Jewish society, where discussing religious and social events was integral to daily life. The disciples' dialogue also highlights the importance of fellowship and community in the early Christian movement, as believers sought to understand and interpret the events surrounding Jesus' death and resurrection.<p><b>about everything that had happened</b><br>The phrase "everything that had happened" refers to the recent events in Jerusalem, including Jesus' crucifixion, burial, and the reports of His resurrection. This period was a time of great turmoil and confusion for Jesus' followers, as they grappled with the apparent defeat of their Messiah. The events fulfilled numerous Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant, and <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, which describes the crucifixion in detail. The disciples' discussion likely included their hopes and expectations for Jesus as the promised Messiah, as well as their disappointment and uncertainty following His death. This conversation underscores the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan through Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples_on_the_road_to_emmaus.htm">The Disciples on the Road to Emmaus</a></b><br>Two followers of Jesus, one named Cleopas, were traveling from Jerusalem to Emmaus, discussing the recent events surrounding Jesus' crucifixion and reported resurrection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Jesus was crucified and resurrected, and from where the disciples were departing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/emmaus.htm">Emmaus</a></b><br>A village approximately seven miles from Jerusalem, serving as the destination for the two disciples.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crucifixion_and_resurrection_of_jesus.htm">The Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus</a></b><br>The central events being discussed by the disciples, which are foundational to Christian faith.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_appearance_of_jesus.htm">The Appearance of Jesus</a></b><br>Although not explicitly mentioned in verse 14, the context of the passage includes Jesus appearing to these disciples later in the account.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_fellowship_and_discussion.htm">The Importance of Fellowship and Discussion</a></b><br>Engaging in conversations about faith and scripture can lead to deeper understanding and revelation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/processing_grief_and_confusion.htm">Processing Grief and Confusion</a></b><br>Like the disciples, believers may experience confusion and grief, but discussing these feelings in community can bring clarity and comfort.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_scripture_in_understanding_jesus.htm">The Role of Scripture in Understanding Jesus</a></b><br>The disciples' discussion eventually leads to Jesus explaining the Scriptures to them, highlighting the importance of biblical literacy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_jesus_in_our_journey.htm">Recognizing Jesus in Our Journey</a></b><br>Just as the disciples eventually recognized Jesus, believers are encouraged to seek His presence in their daily lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_transformative_power_of_encountering_christ.htm">The Transformative Power of Encountering Christ</a></b><br>An encounter with the risen Christ can transform doubt and despair into faith and hope.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_24_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 24:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_24_14_Discuss_Jesus_daily.htm">How does Luke 24:14 encourage discussing Jesus' teachings in daily conversations?

Scripture presents them as historical witnesses, not fictional characters.<p>- Walking together recalls Jesus&#8217; pattern of sending disciples out two by two (<a href="/luke/10-1.htm">Luke 10:1</a>) and the promise that &#8220;where two or three are gathered in My name, there am I among them&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>).<p>- Their companionship highlights the value of shared faith. &#8220;Two are better than one&#8230;for if either falls, his companion can lift him up&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9-10</a>). God often strengthens us through fellow believers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Talking with each other</b><p>- The verse continues: &#8220;They were talking with each other&#8230;.&#8221; Conversation is a God-given tool for processing truth.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a> encourages believers to talk of God&#8217;s works &#8220;when you walk along the road.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a> records those who &#8220;feared the Lord spoke with one another, and the Lord listened.&#8221;<p>- Their discussion shows honest wrestling with recent events&#8212;a reminder that faith invites questions and dialogue rather than silent confusion (<a href="/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11-12</a>).<p>- Christ often meets us in the midst of such conversations; He will shortly join these two travelers (<a href="/luke/24-15.htm">Luke 24:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>About everything</b><p>- &#8220;About everything&#8230;&#8221; indicates a thorough, all-encompassing review.

It helps disciples grasp the bigger picture of God&#8217;s redemptive plan (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That had happened</b><p>- The final phrase grounds their talk in concrete history: &#8220;that had happened.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The empty tomb earlier that morning was fresh in their minds (<a href="/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Women had reported angelic testimony: &#8220;He is not here; He has risen!&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-6.htm">Luke 24:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Eyewitnesses like Peter confirmed the tomb was indeed empty (<a href="/luke/24-12.htm">Luke 24:12</a>).<p>- By anchoring faith in real events, Scripture assures us our hope rests on fact, not myth (<a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>).<p>- The literal death and bodily resurrection of Jesus fulfill prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5-12</a> and <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, underscoring God&#8217;s faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/24-14.htm">Luke 24:14</a> portrays two disciples walking side by side, openly discussing every detail of the recent, world-shaking events surrounding Jesus&#8217; death and resurrection. Their candid conversation within trusted fellowship models how believers today can process God&#8217;s works together. The verse affirms that our faith is rooted in actual historical events, invites honest dialogue, and shows that in shared reflection the risen Christ draws near and deepens understanding.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(autoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
