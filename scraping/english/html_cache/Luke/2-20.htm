This reflects the theme of God revealing Himself to the humble and lowly, as seen throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>). Their return signifies a return to their daily lives, transformed by their encounter with the divine.<p><b>glorifying and praising God</b><br>Their response of glorifying and praising God is a natural reaction to witnessing the fulfillment of God's promises. This mirrors the response of other biblical figures who encountered God's work, such as Mary in the Magnificat (<a href="/luke/1-46.htm">Luke 1:46-55</a>) and Zechariah in his prophecy (<a href="/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68-79</a>). It highlights the importance of worship and gratitude in response to God's revelation.<p><b>for all they had heard and seen</b><br>The shepherds' experience was both auditory and visual, emphasizing the tangible reality of God's intervention in the world. This dual witness of hearing and seeing is significant in biblical narratives, as it confirms the truth of the message (e.g., 1 <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>). It underscores the reliability of their testimony about Jesus' birth.<p><b>which was just as the angel had told them</b><br>The fulfillment of the angel's message to the shepherds confirms the reliability and truth of God's word. This echoes the theme of prophecy fulfillment found throughout the Bible, such as the prophecies concerning the Messiah in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>).
