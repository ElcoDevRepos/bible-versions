Their disbelief is not rooted in skepticism but in the overwhelming joy and astonishment at seeing Jesus alive. This reflects the human tendency to struggle with accepting miraculous events, even when they fulfill divine promises. The disciples' reaction is consistent with human nature, as seen in other biblical accounts where individuals are initially incredulous when confronted with divine intervention (e.g., Sarah's laughter in <a href="/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>). The joy and amazement also highlight the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecies about His resurrection (<a href="/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22, 18</a>:33), underscoring the reality of His victory over death.<p><b>He asked them, &#8220;Do you have anything here to eat?&#8221;</b><br>Jesus' request for food serves multiple purposes. It provides tangible proof of His physical resurrection, countering any notion that He was merely a spirit or apparition. In Jewish culture, eating together was a sign of fellowship and acceptance, reinforcing the restored relationship between Jesus and His disciples. This act also connects to other post-resurrection appearances where Jesus eats with His followers (e.g., <a href="/john/21-9.htm">John 21:9-14</a>), emphasizing His real, bodily resurrection. Additionally, this moment echoes the Last Supper, reminding the disciples of Jesus' teachings and the new covenant established through His sacrifice. The request for food can also be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>, where the suffering servant sees the light of life and is satisfied, symbolizing the completion of His redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The resurrected Lord who appears to His disciples, demonstrating His physical resurrection by asking for food.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are gathered together, experiencing a mix of disbelief, joy, and amazement at His resurrection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events take place, significant as the location of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room.htm">The Upper Room</a></b><br>The likely setting for this appearance, a place of gathering and fellowship for the disciples.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resurrection.htm">The Resurrection</a></b><br>The pivotal event of Jesus rising from the dead, confirming His victory over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_the_resurrection.htm">The Reality of the Resurrection</a></b><br>Jesus' request for food underscores the physical reality of His resurrection.

Prophetic fulfillment<p>&#8211; The risen Christ is the &#8220;firstfruits&#8221; of those who sleep (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>).

Shared fellowship<p>&#8211; Throughout His ministry, table fellowship signaled acceptance (<a href="/luke/5-29.htm">Luke 5:29-32</a>; 15:2). Even in glory, He seeks to dine with His people, foreshadowing the Marriage Supper of the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/24-41.htm">Luke 24:41</a> captures a beautiful tension: the disciples&#8217; hearts race with glad disbelief, and Jesus meets them right there. He gently bridges the gap between wonder and faith by doing something as ordinary&#8212;and as extraordinary&#8212;as asking for dinner. In that simple request He proves His bodily resurrection, fulfills prophecy, and invites ongoing fellowship. The verse reassures us that our risen Lord is both gloriously real and graciously near, turning our stunned amazement into confident, joyful belief.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">While they yet believed not for joy.</span>--We again note St. Luke's characteristic tendency to psychological analysis. As men sleep for sorrow (<a href="/luke/22-45.htm" title="And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,">Luke 22:45</a>), so they disbelieve for very joy. What is brought before their eyes is too good to be true.<p><span class= "bld">Have ye here any meat?</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">anything to eat, any food.</span> Here again there is an agreement with St. John (21:5). A new crucial test is given of the reality of the resurrection-body. It could be no shadow or spectre that thus asked for food. This we all feel; but the further question, whether there was not only the power to receive food, but a life in any sense dependent upon the laws which govern the bodily life of men, leads us into a region of problems which we cannot solve, and on which it is profitless to dwell. What seems suggested is a spiritual existence capable, by an act of volition, of assuming, in greater or less measure, the conditions of corporeal. We note how the Apostles dwelt afterwards on what now occurred as a proof of their Lord's resurrection. They had "eaten and drunk with Him" (<a href="/acts/10-41.htm" title="Not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.">Acts 10:41</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 41, 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And while</span> <span class="cmt_word">they yet believed not for joy.</span> The awful joy of the disciples <span class="accented">now</span> was something too. deep for words, even for calm belief. St. John records it, too, with simple pathos. "Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord." This was the fulfilment of his promise to them, when, full of sadness, they were listening to him that last solemn Passover evening in the upper room. "Ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you" (<a href="/john/16-22.htm">John 16:22</a>). In after-days, as John preached and taught in his old age, how the remembrance of <span class="accented">that hour</span> must have stirred in his heart when he thus wrote of it! <span class="cmt_word">Have ye here any meat?</span> <span class="cmt_word">And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb</span>. The Master would not permit this state of wondering ecstasy to continue; so he changes the current of their thoughts by thus descending into the region of everyday life, at the same time powerfully demonstrating by this further proof that, though changed, his resurrection, body was no mere Docetic semblance, no phantom, but that he could eat if he chose. The next sentence (ver. 43) tells simply how he took the food, and ate before them. The fish and honeycomb which they gave him no doubt formed the staple of their evening meal. Fish was part of the common food of the disciples - we see this from the miracles of the five thousand and the four thousand, and also from the narrative of <a href="/john/21-9.htm">John 21:9</a>. Honey, we know, in Canaan, the laud flowing with milk and honey, was common enough to enter into the diet of the poor (compare, among many passages, <a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8, 17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-9.htm">Deuteronomy 26:9, 15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/11-5.htm">Jeremiah 11:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15, 22</a>; <a href="/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">While</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
