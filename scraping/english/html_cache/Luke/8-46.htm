His declaration is significant as it demonstrates His awareness and authority. This moment is a turning point in the narrative, emphasizing Jesus' role as a teacher and healer. The use of "declared" suggests a public announcement, drawing attention to the importance of the event.<p><b>Someone touched Me</b><br>The phrase indicates Jesus' sensitivity to the faith and needs of individuals, even in a large crowd. This touch was not accidental but intentional, reflecting the woman's faith and desperation. In the cultural context, touching a rabbi or teacher was not common, especially for a woman, which underscores the boldness of her action. This moment also highlights the personal nature of Jesus' ministry, where individual faith is recognized and rewarded.<p><b>for I know that power has gone out from Me</b><br>This statement reveals Jesus' divine nature and the reality of His healing power. The concept of power going out from Him suggests a tangible transfer of divine energy, which is unique to Jesus as the Son of God. It connects to other instances in the Gospels where Jesus heals through touch or command, demonstrating His authority over physical ailments. This power is not diminished by being shared, indicating the infinite nature of His divine resources.
