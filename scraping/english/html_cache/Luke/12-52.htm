It suggests an immediate and ongoing effect of His teachings and presence. The division Jesus speaks of is not a future event but something that starts with His coming. This aligns with the prophetic nature of Jesus' mission, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the Messiah's role in bringing change and division is foretold.<p><b>five in one household will be divided</b><br>The number five here is symbolic, representing a complete family unit in the cultural context of the time. Households in ancient Israel often included extended family, and the division within such a unit would have been significant. This division is not just a physical separation but a spiritual and ideological one, reflecting the transformative and sometimes divisive nature of the Gospel. The concept of division within families can be seen in <a href="/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a>, which Jesus references in <a href="/matthew/10-35.htm">Matthew 10:35-36</a>, highlighting the cost of discipleship.<p><b>three against two and two against three</b><br>This specific division emphasizes that the conflict will not be one-sided or predictable. It suggests that the acceptance of Jesus' message will vary even among those closest to each other. The numbers three and two may not have specific symbolic meanings but illustrate the unpredictability and personal nature of the response to Jesus' teachings. This division is a fulfillment of the prophecy that the Messiah would be a stumbling block (<a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a>) and a sign that would be opposed (<a href="/luke/2-34.htm">Luke 2:34</a>). The division also reflects the broader spiritual battle between belief and unbelief, as seen throughout the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, Jesus is addressing His disciples and the crowd, teaching about the cost of discipleship and the division that His message will bring.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teachings in this chapter, they are being prepared for the challenges they will face as followers of Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_household.htm">The Household</a></b><br>Represents the intimate and personal sphere of life, indicating that the division Jesus speaks of will affect even the closest relationships.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A larger group present during Jesus' teaching, representing the broader audience who would hear and be affected by His message.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/division.htm">Division</a></b><br>The event or outcome Jesus predicts, highlighting the inevitable conflict that arises from differing responses to His message.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">The Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>Following Jesus may lead to division even in the most intimate relationships.

Households once united around blood ties may fracture along spiritual lines, sometimes in unpredictable configurations. The Lord does not relish conflict, yet He insists on exclusive loyalty that inevitably exposes opposing hearts. Our task is to stand lovingly but firmly with Him, knowing that eternal unity awaits all who do.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/12-52.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">From</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(apo)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_575.htm">Strong's 575: </a> </span><span class="str2">From, away from.
