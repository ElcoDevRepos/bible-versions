In the cultural context of the time, a manager or steward was responsible for overseeing the affairs of a wealthy landowner. This role required trust and competence. The manager's self-reflection indicates a moment of crisis, prompting him to consider his future actions. This introspection is a common biblical theme, seen in other parables where individuals must confront their circumstances and make decisions, such as the Prodigal Son in <a href="/luke/15-17.htm">Luke 15:17</a>.<p><b>&#8216;What shall I do,</b><br>The question reflects a moment of desperation and uncertainty. In the biblical narrative, questions often precede significant decisions or divine intervention. This mirrors the human condition of seeking guidance when faced with difficult situations. The manager's question is reminiscent of other biblical figures who faced pivotal moments, such as the rich young ruler in <a href="/matthew/19-16.htm">Matthew 19:16</a>, who asked Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life.<p><b>now that my master is taking away my position?</b><br>The loss of position signifies a loss of identity and security. In the historical context, a steward's role was crucial for managing estates, and losing this position would mean losing social standing and livelihood. This reflects the broader biblical theme of stewardship and accountability, as seen in the Parable of the Talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where servants are held accountable for their management of the master's resources.<p><b>I am too weak to dig</b><br>This phrase indicates the manager's physical limitations and unsuitability for manual labor. In the cultural context, digging or manual labor was considered low-status work, often reserved for the poor or enslaved. The manager's acknowledgment of his inability to perform such work highlights his reliance on his current position and the skills associated with it. This can be contrasted with Paul's encouragement in <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>, where he emphasizes the importance of work and self-sufficiency.<p><b>and too ashamed to beg.</b><br>Begging was seen as a last resort and carried a social stigma. In the historical and cultural context, begging was associated with shame and loss of dignity. The manager's reluctance to beg underscores his desire to maintain some level of respectability and avoid public humiliation. This reflects the biblical theme of pride and humility, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-2.htm">Proverbs 11:2</a>, which warns that pride leads to disgrace, but humility brings wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_manager.htm">The Manager (Steward)</a></b><br>A servant responsible for managing his master's resources.

Scripture often records such inner conversations when God is exposing a person&#8217;s heart (<a href="/psalms/4-4.htm">Psalm 4:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>). Like the rich fool who &#8220;thought to himself&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-17.htm">Luke 12:17</a>), this steward is forced to look inward. God sees the talk we carry on inside, and accountability begins there (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What shall I do</b><p>A crisis has arrived, and the steward feels the weight of immediate decision&#8212;&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221; The same cry rises from convicted crowds in <a href="/luke/3-10.htm">Luke 3:10</a> and <a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a>. When God presses truth on the conscience, neutral ground disappears:<p>&#8226; He must act, not merely feel remorse (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Delay only worsens the outcome (<a href="/proverbs/27-1.htm">Proverbs 27:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Now that my master is taking away my position</b><p>The servant acknowledges that his fate rests with the master. He has been called to give an account, echoing Jesus&#8217; teaching that &#8220;it is required of stewards that they be found faithful&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>).<p>&#8226; His role was a trust, not a possession (<a href="/luke/12-42.htm">Luke 12:42-46</a>).<p>&#8226; Losing the position pictures the coming judgment when every believer will render an account to Christ (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am too weak to dig</b><p>Manual labor is honest work, yet the steward confesses physical&#8212;or perhaps moral&#8212;weakness. He is unwilling to embrace strenuous effort (<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:10</a>). Paul&#8217;s rule that &#8220;If anyone is not willing to work, he shall not eat&#8221; (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>) stands in sharp contrast to this attitude. His self-confessed frailty pushes him toward shrewd planning rather than hard labor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And too ashamed to beg</b><p>Pride now surfaces. Begging, though better than theft, would bruise his reputation. Scripture warns, &#8220;When pride comes, then comes disgrace&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/11-2.htm">Proverbs 11:2</a>) and &#8220;God opposes the proud&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). Unlike the prodigal who humbled himself to say, &#8220;I am no longer worthy&#8221; (<a href="/luke/15-19.htm">Luke 15:19</a>), this man cannot stomach humiliation. His shame is not over sin; it is over perceived loss of status.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/16-3.htm">Luke 16:3</a> captures a steward&#8217;s moment of exposure. He realizes his stewardship is ending, conducts an inner debate, rejects honest toil, and recoils from humility. Jesus uses this snapshot to illustrate how worldly people can act decisively to secure their future, challenging believers to show at least as much resolve in using present resources for eternal ends.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.</span>--In the outer framework of the parable there is something eminently characteristic in this utterance of the steward's thoughts. He has lost the manliness and strength which would have fitted him for actual labour. He retains the false shame which makes him prefer fraud to poverty. He shudders at the thought that it might be his lot to sit, like Lazarus, and ask an alms at the rich man's door. Spiritually, we may see what happens to a religious caste or order, like the Pharisees, when it forfeits its true calling by misuse. It has lost the power to prepare the ground for future fruitfulness by the "digging," which answers, as in <a href="/luke/13-8.htm" title="And he answering said to him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:">Luke 13:8</a>, to the preliminary work of education and other influences that lie outside direct religious activity. It is religious and ecclesiastical, or it is nothing. It is ashamed to confess its spiritual poverty, and to own that it is "poor, and blind, and naked" (<a href="/revelation/3-17.htm" title="Because you say, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and know not that you are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:">Revelation 3:17</a>). Anything seems better than either of those alternatives.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship</span>. This day of dismissal <span class="accented">must</span> be prepared for; very carefully, very anxiously, the man who has received the sentence of doom ponders over his future. The lesson of the Master is spoken to all; it is a solemn warning to each of us to see what we can do by way of providing for the inevitable day when we shall find ourselves alone and naked and perhaps friendless in the great, strange world to come. The hero of the parable seems suddenly, after a life of carelessness and thoughtlessness, to have awakened to a sense of his awful danger. So the voice of the <span class="accented">real Owner</span> of the goods, which we have so long deluded ourselves into thinking were our own, comes to us, bidding us make ready to give them back again to him, their Owner, and at the same time to render an account of our administration of them. The voice comes to us in the varied forms of conscience, sickness, misfortune, old age, sorrow, and the like; well for us if, when we hear it, we at once determine, as did the steward of the parable, to make a wise use of the goods in our power for the little time they are still left to us to dispose of as we will. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/16-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
