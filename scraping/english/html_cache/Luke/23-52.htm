This action required courage, as Pilate was the Roman governor who had authorized Jesus' crucifixion. Joseph's approach to Pilate indicates his high social standing and influence, as not everyone would have had access to the governor. This act also fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being with a rich man in His death.<p><b>to ask for the body of Jesus.</b><br>In Roman practice, the bodies of crucified criminals were often left on the cross to decay or be eaten by scavengers. However, Jewish law, as stated in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>, required that a body be buried the same day. Joseph's request ensured that Jesus' body was treated with respect and buried according to Jewish customs. This act of devotion and care for Jesus' body also highlights Joseph's faith and reverence for Jesus, despite the potential risk to his reputation and standing among the Jewish leaders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph_of_arimathea.htm">Joseph of Arimathea</a></b><br>A member of the Jewish council, described as a good and righteous man who was waiting for the kingdom of God.
