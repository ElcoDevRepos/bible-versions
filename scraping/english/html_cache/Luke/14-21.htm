The master symbolizes God or Christ, who has prepared a great banquet, representing the Kingdom. The servant's return and report indicate accountability and the importance of faithfully delivering God's message. This reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, as seen in other parables like the Parable of the Talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>).<p><b>Then the owner of the house became angry</b><br>The owner's anger signifies God's righteous indignation towards those who reject His invitation. This reflects the broader biblical theme of divine justice and the consequences of rejecting God's grace. The anger is not arbitrary but a response to the rejection of a generous offer, similar to the reaction of God towards Israel's disobedience in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/65-2.htm">Isaiah 65:2-3</a>).<p><b>and said to his servant, &#8216;Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the city,</b><br>The urgency in the command "Go out quickly" underscores the immediacy of the Kingdom's invitation and the limited time to respond. The "streets and alleys of the city" represent the public places where the marginalized and outcasts of society would be found. This reflects Jesus' ministry focus on reaching the lost and those considered unworthy by societal standards, as seen in His interactions with tax collectors and sinners (<a href="/luke/5-30.htm">Luke 5:30-32</a>).<p><b>and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase highlights the inclusivity of God's Kingdom, extending grace to those marginalized by society. The poor, crippled, blind, and lame symbolize those who are spiritually needy and aware of their dependence on God. This echoes the prophetic vision of the Messianic banquet in <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6-9</a>, where all nations are invited to partake in God's salvation. It also prefigures the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), emphasizing the universal call to salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>A representative of the master, tasked with inviting guests to the banquet.

Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:2</a>. The former word includes the "piazza" or "place" of an Eastern town; the latter is the long, narrow "street" or "lane" hardly wide enough for a man to ride through. It is the word used for the "street called straight" in Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-11.htm" title="And the Lord said to him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prays,">Acts 9:11</a>). In the application of the parable these represent the by-ways of Jewish life--the suburbs, and the wretched courts and alleys, which no scribe deigned to enter, and which lay entirely outside the notice and the functions of the priesthood. "The poor, the maimed, the halt, and the blind" are the publicans and sinners and harlots and men of violence, who obeyed the summons and pressed eagerly into the kingdom. The repetition of the same four adjectives as had been used in <a href="/luke/14-13.htm" title="But when you make a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:">Luke 14:13</a> is singularly suggestive. Our Lord was following, in the spiritual feast of His kingdom, the very rule which He had given for those who made great feasts on earth. Each class may possibly represent some spiritual fact which would seem to men a disqualification, but which was, for the pitying love of Christ, the very ground of invitation and acceptance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind</span>. The invitations to the great feast, seeing that those first bidden were indifferent, were then sent out far and wide - through broad streets and narrow lanes, among wealthy publicans (tax-collectors) and poor artisans.
