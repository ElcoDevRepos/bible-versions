The sending of another servant indicates God's persistent attempts to reach His people despite their previous rejections. This reflects the historical pattern of Israel's treatment of prophets, as seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a>, where God repeatedly sent messengers to His people.<p><b>but they beat him</b><br>The act of beating the servant signifies the physical persecution and mistreatment of God's prophets. This mirrors the experiences of many Old Testament prophets, such as Jeremiah, who was beaten and imprisoned (<a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>). It highlights the violent resistance to God's message and messengers throughout Israel's history.<p><b>and treated him shamefully</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the dishonor and contempt shown towards the servant, reflecting the broader rejection of God's authority. The shameful treatment can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual rebellion and moral corruption of the people. It also foreshadows the ultimate rejection and humiliation of Jesus Christ, who was despised and rejected by men (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<p><b>sending him away empty-handed</b><br>The servant's return without the expected produce symbolizes the failure of Israel to produce the fruits of righteousness and justice that God desired. This imagery is consistent with the prophetic calls for repentance and fruitfulness, such as in <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, where Israel is depicted as a vineyard that yields wild grapes instead of good fruit. The empty-handed return also prefigures the rejection of Christ, who came to His own, but His own did not receive Him (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_owner_of_the_vineyard.htm">The Owner of the Vineyard</a></b><br>Represents God, who has entrusted His vineyard (Israel) to the tenants (leaders of Israel).<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servants.htm">The Servants</a></b><br>Symbolize the prophets sent by God to call His people back to righteousness and obedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tenants.htm">The Tenants</a></b><br>Represent the religious leaders of Israel who have been entrusted with the care of God's people but have failed in their duties.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vineyard.htm">The Vineyard</a></b><br>Symbolizes Israel, God's chosen people, whom He has nurtured and cared for.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beating_and_shameful_treatment.htm">The Beating and Shameful Treatment</a></b><br>Illustrates the rejection and persecution faced by God's prophets throughout history.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_patience_and_persistence.htm">God's Patience and Persistence</a></b><br>God repeatedly sends His messengers to call His people back to Him, demonstrating His patience and desire for repentance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/rejection_of_god's_messengers.htm">Rejection of God's Messengers</a></b><br>The consistent rejection of God's prophets is a warning against hardening our hearts to God's message and messengers today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability_of_leadership.htm">Accountability of Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders are entrusted with the care of God's people and will be held accountable for their actions and stewardship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_disobedience.htm">The Cost of Disobedience</a></b><br>Ignoring God's call and mistreating His messengers leads to spiritual barrenness and judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_god's_call.htm">Responding to God's Call</a></b><br>We are called to listen and respond to God's message with humility and obedience, recognizing the authority of His Word.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_20_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 20:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_20_11_God_s_patience_shown_how.htm">How does Luke 20:11 illustrate God's patience with humanity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_do_humans_reject_God_s_messengers.htm">What does the servant's treatment reveal about human rejection of God's messengers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Identify_respect_God_s_servants_today_2.htm">How can we identify and respect God's "servants" in our lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Luke_20_11_vs_OT_prophets_similarities.htm">Compare Luke 20:11 with Old Testament prophets' experiences.

God does not give up on His vineyard&#8212;Israel&#8212;even when past warnings were ignored (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15</a>).<p>&#8226; For us, the line reminds that every new call to repentance is an act of mercy, not obligation (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but they beat him</b><p>&#8226; The escalation from simple dismissal to violence mirrors Israel&#8217;s history with God&#8217;s spokesmen.
