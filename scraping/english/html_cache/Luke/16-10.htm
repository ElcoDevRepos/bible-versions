In biblical times, stewardship was a common concept, as many people worked as servants or managers of household affairs. Faithfulness in small matters is seen as a test of character and integrity. This principle is echoed in the Parable of the Talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where servants are rewarded based on their management of the master's resources. The "very little" can symbolize earthly possessions or responsibilities, suggesting that God values how we handle even the smallest tasks.<p><b>will also be faithful with much</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the reward for faithfulness. In the biblical context, being entrusted with "much" can refer to greater responsibilities or blessings, both in this life and in the eternal kingdom. The idea is that God observes our actions and entrusts us with more based on our proven reliability. This principle is seen in the lives of biblical figures like Joseph, who was faithful in Potiphar's house and later entrusted with the governance of Egypt (Genesis 39-41).<p><b>and whoever is dishonest with very little</b><br>Dishonesty, even in minor matters, reveals a lack of integrity. In the cultural context of the Bible, honesty was a highly valued trait, essential for maintaining trust within communities. The phrase warns that small acts of dishonesty can lead to larger moral failures. This is illustrated in the story of Ananias and Sapphira (<a href="/acts/5.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>), where deceit in financial matters led to severe consequences.<p><b>will also be dishonest with much</b><br>This concluding phrase underscores the consistency of character. Just as faithfulness in small things leads to greater trust, dishonesty in small matters can lead to greater corruption. The Bible consistently teaches that one's character is revealed through actions, regardless of the scale. This principle is a warning against the dangers of allowing small sins to grow unchecked, as seen in the life of King Saul, whose initial disobedience led to his downfall (1 Samuel 15).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, Jesus uses this teaching to instruct His disciples and the Pharisees about the importance of faithfulness and integrity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teaching, they are being prepared for their future roles in spreading the Gospel and leading the early Church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>Although not directly addressed in this verse, they are present in the broader context of the chapter and are often challenged by Jesus for their hypocrisy and love of money.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_parable_of_the_shrewd_manager.htm">The Parable of the Shrewd Manager</a></b><br>This parable precedes the verse and sets the context for Jesus' teaching on faithfulness and stewardship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_god.htm">The Kingdom of God</a></b><br>The ultimate context of Jesus' teaching, emphasizing the values and principles of God's Kingdom, including faithfulness and integrity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_small_things.htm">Faithfulness in Small Things</a></b><br>God values our faithfulness in the small, everyday tasks.

Scripture consistently highlights faithfulness as God&#8217;s first requirement for service (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>). We are stewards, not owners, and God watches for reliable hearts (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>). Faithfulness is not flashy; it is steady obedience rooted in love (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with very little</b><p>The Lord usually tests us in the ordinary&#8212;timecards, household chores, unseen acts of kindness, the handling of a few coins. Small matters reveal big loyalties. Compare the steward in <a href="/luke/12-42.htm">Luke 12:42&#8211;44</a> who manages daily rations, or David guarding sheep before facing Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34-37</a>). <a href="/proverbs/28-20.htm">Proverbs 28:20</a> affirms, &#8220;A faithful man will abound with blessings,&#8221; showing that everyday integrity positions us for God&#8217;s favor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will also be faithful with much</b><p>God&#8217;s economy rewards trustworthiness with expanded responsibility. In the parable of the talents, the master says, &#8220;You have been faithful over a few things; I will set you over many&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21, 23</a>). Likewise, <a href="/luke/19-17.htm">Luke 19:17</a> shows a servant ruling ten cities after handling a single mina well. The principle is literal: present obedience prepares us for future assignments, both in this life and in Christ&#8217;s coming kingdom (<a href="/2_timothy/2-12.htm">2 Timothy 2:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and whoever is dishonest with very little</b><p>Dishonesty does not wait for a large payday; it begins in the corners of the heart. Ananias and Sapphira held back a portion and lost their lives (<a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>). Achan&#8217;s secret theft in <a href="/bsb/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a> brought national defeat. &#8220;He who is crooked in a small matter will fall headlong&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/28-18.htm">Proverbs 28:18</a>). Small compromises nurture a pattern of deceit that hardens the conscience (<a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will also be dishonest with much</b><p>If unfaithfulness shows up in minor dealings, greater resources only amplify it. Judas pilfered from the moneybag before betraying the Lord for silver (<a href="/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>).

The Master watches the little things&#8212;because they reveal the true state of our hearts and determine the scope of our future service with Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">He that is faithful in that which is least . . .</span>--The context shows that by "that which is least" is meant what men call wealth, and which to most of them seems as the greatest, highest good. To be faithful in that is to acknowledge that we have it as stewards, not as possessors, and shall have to give an account of our stewardship. The word of warning was meant, we may believe, specially for the disciples. They, coming, for the most part, from the poorer classes, thought that they were in no danger of worshipping mammon. They are told, probably with special reference to the traitor Judas, that the love of money may operate on a narrow as well as on a wide scale, and that wrong-doing in the one case tests character not less perfectly than in the other. This seems truer to the meaning of "much" than to find in it simply the higher wealth of the kingdom of God, generically different from the former, though this also may be included in the wider operation of the laws thus asserted.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much</span>. This and the next three verses are closely connected with the parable of the unjust steward. Our Lord no doubt continued speaking, and these four verses contain a general <span class="accented">resume</span> of what may be called his reflections on the important piece of teaching he had just delivered. We have here the broad rule, upon which God will decide the soul's future, laid down. If the man has been faithful in his administration of the comparatively unimportant goods of earth, it is clear that he can be entrusted with the far more important things which belong to the world to come. There is, too, in these words a kind of limitation and explanation of the foregoing parable of the unjust steward. The conduct of that steward, regarded in one point of view, was held to be wise, and we, though in a very different way, were advised to imitate it; yet here we are distinctly told that it is fidelity, not unfaithfulness, which will be <span class="accented">eventually</span> re-warded - the just, not the unjust steward. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/16-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Whoever</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
