In the context of <a href="/luke/7.htm">Luke 7</a>, Jesus is entering the town of Nain, a small village in Galilee. The term "Lord" signifies His divine authority and recognition as the Messiah. This moment reflects Jesus' omniscience and His ability to perceive the suffering of others, aligning with His role as the Good Shepherd who knows His sheep (<a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>).<p><b>He had compassion on her</b><br>Compassion is a recurring theme in Jesus' ministry, demonstrating His deep empathy and love for humanity. The Greek word used here, "splanchnizomai," conveys a visceral, heartfelt response. This compassion is consistent with God's character throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, where God is described as "compassionate and gracious." Jesus' compassion often precedes miraculous acts, underscoring His divine nature and fulfilling prophecies of the Messiah who would heal and restore (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>).<p><b>and said, &#8220;Do not weep.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus' command not to weep is both comforting and authoritative. In the cultural context, mourning was a public and communal activity, often involving professional mourners. Jesus' words indicate His intention to change the situation, offering hope and foreshadowing the miracle of raising the widow's son. This mirrors other instances where Jesus brings comfort and life, such as in <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>, where He declares Himself the resurrection and the life.

As far as it goes it confirms the view suggested in the previous Note, that the narrative came from those who had a profound reverence for the Master they had followed, and at a time when they had learnt thus to speak of Him. (Comp. the language of Mary Magdalene in <a href="/john/20-2.htm" title="Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.">John 20:2</a>; <a href="/john/20-13.htm" title="And they say to her, Woman, why weep you? She said to them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid him.">John 20:13</a>.) It may be noted further that this use of "the Lord" occurs more frequently in St. Luke and St. John than in the other Gospels. Comp. <a href="/luke/7-31.htm" title="And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?">Luke 7:31</a>; <a href="/luke/10-1.htm" title="After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, where he himself would come.">Luke 10:1</a>; <a href="/luke/11-39.htm" title="And the Lord said to him, Now do you Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.">Luke 11:39</a>; <a href="/luke/12-42.htm" title="And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?">Luke 12:42</a>; <a href="/context/luke/17-5.htm" title="And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith.">Luke 17:5-6</a>; <a href="/luke/19-8.htm" title="And Zacchaeus stood, and said to the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.">Luke 19:8</a>; <a href="/luke/22-61.htm" title="And the Lord turned, and looked on Peter.

The last three or four references show that the disciples habitually used the same mode of speech, but it would not follow that in their lips it necessarily meant more at first than our "Sir," or "Master."

It is rare in the Gospels to find the expression, "the Lord," used by itself, "Jesus" being the usual term. It agrees with the unanimous tradition in the Church respecting the authorship of this Gospel - neither Luke nor Paul had been with Jesus. These had always looked on Jesus, thought of him, as <span class="accented">the Lord</span> risen from the dead, enthroned in heaven.
