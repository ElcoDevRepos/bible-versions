This phrase indicates a direct response from the master, symbolizing the personal relationship and accountability each believer has with Christ. The master&#8217;s reply is a moment of judgment and reward, reflecting the eschatological theme of the final judgment.<p><b>&#8216;Well done, good servant!</b><br>This commendation highlights the approval and pleasure of the master in the servant's actions. The phrase "well done" is an affirmation of the servant's diligence and integrity. The term "good" denotes moral quality and faithfulness, aligning with biblical teachings on the fruits of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). It echoes the commendation found in <a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>, emphasizing the importance of faithfulness in small tasks.<p><b>Because you have been faithful in a very small matter</b><br>The "very small matter" refers to the mina entrusted to the servant, symbolizing the resources, opportunities, and responsibilities given to believers. Faithfulness in small things is a recurring biblical principle (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>), teaching that God values and rewards even seemingly insignificant acts of obedience and stewardship. This reflects the cultural context of the time, where trustworthiness in minor tasks was essential for greater responsibilities.<p><b>you shall have authority over ten cities.</b><br>The reward of authority over ten cities signifies a significant increase in responsibility and honor. This reflects the biblical principle that faithfulness leads to greater opportunities and blessings (<a href="/matthew/25-23.htm">Matthew 25:23</a>). The number ten may symbolize completeness or abundance, as seen in other scriptural contexts. The concept of ruling over cities points to the future reign of believers with Christ in His kingdom (<a href="/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4-6</a>), illustrating the eschatological hope of sharing in Christ's authority and glory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>Represents Jesus Christ, who entrusts His servants with responsibilities and rewards them based on their faithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Symbolizes believers who are entrusted with God's gifts and resources, expected to use them wisely and faithfully.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ten_cities.htm">The Ten Cities</a></b><br>Represents the greater responsibilities and rewards given to those who are faithful in small matters.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_small_matters.htm">Faithfulness in Small Matters</a></b><br>God values our faithfulness in seemingly insignificant tasks.

"Authority over ten cities" must have something corresponding to it, some energy and work of guidance, in the realities of the unseen world, and cannot simply be understood as fulfilled in the beatific vision or the life of ceaseless praise and adoration.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Well,</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou good servant.</span> It is noticeable that, in the bestowal of the "five cities" upon the servant who had with his one pound gained five, no expression of praise like this "good servant" is used by the King on his return. Now, what does this omission teach us? Christ, we know, was very careful and very sparing in his use of moral epithets. "Why callest thou me good?" was his stern address to the young ruler who used the expression, not because he was convinced of its applicability, but because he was desirous of paying a flattering compliment to the wise Rabbi from whom he desired information. We may safely conclude that, from the second servant in the story, the one who had earned but five pounds, he withheld the noble appellation "good" because he felt he had not deserved it. He had done <span class="accented">well</span>, it is true, and was splendidly recompensed, but he might have done <span class="accented">more.</span> He had won a high and responsible place in the kingdom; he was appointed the ruler over five cities; but he had not earned the noble title, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "good." Very accurately, indeed, it seems, will places and names and power be awarded in the heaven-life, exactly in proportion to merits and deserts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/19-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[His master] replied,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
