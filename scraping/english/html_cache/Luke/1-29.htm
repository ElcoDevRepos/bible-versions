This response is seen in other biblical figures such as Zechariah (<a href="/luke/1-12.htm">Luke 1:12</a>) and Daniel (<a href="/daniel/10-7.htm">Daniel 10:7</a>). The phrase "greatly troubled" indicates a deep emotional disturbance, suggesting Mary's humility and awareness of her own unworthiness. In the cultural context of first-century Judea, angelic visitations were rare and often associated with significant divine interventions, which could explain her initial fear and confusion.<p><b>and wondered what kind of greeting this might be</b><br>Mary's pondering reflects a thoughtful and contemplative nature, characteristic of her responses throughout the Gospel narratives (<a href="/luke/2-19.htm">Luke 2:19, 2</a>:51). The greeting from Gabriel, "Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you," was unusual and unexpected for a young, humble woman from Nazareth. This greeting signifies God's special favor and presence, echoing Old Testament themes where God chooses unlikely individuals for His purposes, such as Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>). The cultural and historical context of the time would have made such a greeting even more surprising, as women were often not the primary recipients of divine messages. This moment foreshadows Mary's unique role in salvation history as the mother of Jesus, the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>A young Jewish woman, betrothed to Joseph, who is visited by the angel Gabriel.

Startled by the sudden appearance of Gabriel, she is troubled yet attentive, grounding her response in careful consideration of God&#8217;s word. Her wondering signals a receptive heart, and her questioning reveals discernment, not disbelief. The verse invites believers to meet divine interruptions with humble awe, active listening, reflective meditation, and faithful testing&#8212;trusting that God&#8217;s gracious greetings always herald His redemptive purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">she was troubled at his saying.</span>--The same word is used as had been used of Zacharias.
