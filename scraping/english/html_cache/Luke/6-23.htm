The "day" refers to the time when believers face opposition for their faith. Biblically, joy in suffering is a recurring theme (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-13.htm">1 Peter 4:13</a>). This joy is not based on present circumstances but on the assurance of God's promises and future glory.<p><b>and leap for joy</b><br>The expression "leap for joy" suggests an exuberant, physical manifestation of inner gladness. This reflects a deep-seated confidence in God's justice and the ultimate triumph of His kingdom. In the cultural context of the time, such expressions of joy were often associated with significant religious or communal celebrations, indicating the profound nature of the believer's hope.<p><b>because great is your reward in heaven</b><br>The promise of a "great reward in heaven" underscores the eternal perspective that Jesus encourages His followers to adopt. This reward is not earthly but heavenly, aligning with the teachings of storing treasures in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). The concept of heavenly rewards is rooted in Jewish eschatological expectations and is a central theme in the New Testament, emphasizing the future vindication and blessing of the faithful.<p><b>For their fathers treated the prophets in the same way</b><br>This phrase draws a parallel between the experiences of Jesus' followers and the Old Testament prophets, who were often persecuted for their messages (<a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>; <a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>). It situates the disciples within a historical continuum of God's messengers facing opposition. This connection serves as both a warning and an encouragement, affirming that suffering for righteousness aligns believers with the prophetic tradition and God's redemptive history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering the Sermon on the Plain, which parallels the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teachings, representing all believers who follow Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophets.htm">The Prophets</a></b><br>Referenced as those who were persecuted in the past, serving as examples of faithful endurance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>The place of eternal reward for those who endure persecution for righteousness' sake.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fathers.htm">The Fathers</a></b><br>The ancestors of the current generation who persecuted the prophets, illustrating a historical pattern of opposition to God's messengers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/joy_in_persecution.htm">Joy in Persecution</a></b><br>Believers are called to rejoice and leap for joy when facing persecution, as it aligns them with the prophets and promises a great reward in heaven.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_perspective.htm">Heavenly Perspective</a></b><br>Maintaining a focus on the eternal reward helps believers endure present trials and sufferings with hope and perseverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/historical_continuity.htm">Historical Continuity</a></b><br>Understanding that persecution is part of a historical pattern can provide comfort and solidarity with the faithful who have gone before.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_witness.htm">Faithful Witness</a></b><br>Like the prophets, believers are called to be faithful witnesses, even in the face of opposition, trusting in God's ultimate justice and reward.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_in_community.htm">Encouragement in Community</a></b><br>Sharing accounts of past and present persecution within the Christian community can strengthen and encourage believers to stand firm in their faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_6_23_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 6:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Rejoice_amid_faith_persecution.htm">How can we "rejoice in that day" despite facing persecution for our faith?

Not only did men like Paul and his brother apostles welcome persecution "for the Name" with joy, but long after Paul and his fellows had "fallen asleep," Christians in well-nigh every populous centre of the empire followed the same glorious lead. Indeed, we find the great teachers of the faith positively condemning the fiery zeal of men and women who even too literally obeyed this and other like charges of their adored Master, who positively courted a painful martyrdom, too willingly throwing away their lives, so deeply had words like these burned into their souls. The terrible persecutions which many of the old Hebrew prophets underwent were well known. These men of God endured this treatment during several generations, while evil princes sat on the thrones of Judah and Israel. Thus Elijah mourned the wholesale massacre of his brother prophets when Ahab and Jezebel reigned (<a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>). Urijah was slain by Jehoiakim (<a href="/jeremiah/26-23.htm">Jeremiah 26:23</a>). Jeremiah himself underwent long and painful persecution. Amos was accused and banished, and, according to tradition, beaten to death. Isaiah, so the Jews said, was sawn asunder by order of King Manasseh. These are only a few instances of the treatment which faithful prophets of the Lord had undergone. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/6-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Rejoice</span><br /><span class="grk">&#967;&#940;&#961;&#951;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(char&#275;te)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Passive - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5463.htm">Strong's 5463: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary verb; to be 'cheer'ful, i.e. Calmly happy or well-off; impersonally, especially as salutation, be well.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
