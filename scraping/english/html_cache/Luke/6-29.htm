A slap on the cheek was considered an insult rather than a physical assault. Jesus' teaching here challenges the natural human response of retaliation, emphasizing a radical form of non-retaliation and humility. This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/20-22.htm">Proverbs 20:22</a>, which advises against seeking revenge.<p><b>turn to him the other also.</b><br>Turning the other cheek symbolizes a refusal to retaliate and an invitation to further insult, demonstrating a commitment to peace and forgiveness. This teaching echoes the prophetic vision of the Suffering Servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who did not retaliate against his oppressors. It also prefigures Jesus' own response to his accusers during his trial and crucifixion.<p><b>And if someone takes your cloak,</b><br>In the historical context, a cloak was an essential garment, often used as a blanket at night. The taking of a cloak could be seen as a legal action to settle a debt, as described in <a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26-27</a>. Jesus' instruction here goes beyond the legal requirements, urging believers to respond with generosity rather than seeking restitution.<p><b>do not withhold your tunic as well.</b><br>The tunic was the inner garment worn next to the skin. By offering the tunic, Jesus calls for an extreme form of self-sacrifice and generosity. This teaching is consistent with the principle of loving one's enemies, as further elaborated in <a href="/luke/6-35.htm">Luke 6:35</a>. It reflects the self-giving love of Christ, who gave himself fully for humanity's redemption, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this teaching, Jesus is delivering a sermon that includes radical instructions on how to respond to personal offenses and injustices.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teachings, representing those who are committed to following Him and learning His ways.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_multitude.htm">The Multitude</a></b><br>A larger group of listeners who were present during Jesus' sermon, including people from various regions who were curious about His teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cheek_and_the_cloak.htm">The Cheek and the Cloak</a></b><br>Symbolic elements used by Jesus to illustrate His point about non-retaliation and generosity in the face of wrongdoing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sermon_on_the_plain.htm">The Sermon on the Plain</a></b><br>The context in which this teaching is given, a series of instructions and blessings that outline the values of the Kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/radical_love_and_non-retaliation.htm">Radical Love and Non-Retaliation</a></b><br>Jesus calls His followers to a higher standard of love that goes beyond natural human inclinations.

No reasonable, thoughtful man would feel himself bound to the letter of these commandments. Our Lord, for instance, himself did not offer himself to be stricken again (<a href="/john/18-22.htm">John 18:22, 23</a>), but firmly, though with exquisite courtesy, rebuked the one who struck him. St. Paul, too (<a href="/acts/23-3.htm">Acts 23:3</a>), never dreamed of obeying the letter of this charge. It is but an assertion of a great principle, and so, with the exception of a very few mistaken fanatics, all the great teachers of Christianity have understood it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/6-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[If someone] strikes</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#973;&#960;&#964;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(typtonti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5180.htm">Strong's 5180: </a> </span><span class="str2">To beat, strike, wound, inflict punishment. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(se)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
