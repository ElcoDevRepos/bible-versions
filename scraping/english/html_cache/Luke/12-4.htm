This reflects the intimate bond between Christ and His followers, emphasizing that His teachings are meant for those who are committed to Him. The use of "friends" aligns with <a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>, where Jesus calls His disciples friends because He has shared with them everything He learned from the Father.<p><b>do not be afraid of those who kill the body</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the reality of persecution and physical harm that believers may face. Historically, early Christians faced severe persecution from both Jewish authorities and the Roman Empire. Jesus is preparing His disciples for the trials they will encounter, encouraging them to maintain their faith despite threats to their physical well-being. This echoes the courage shown by Old Testament figures like Daniel, who faced the lion's den without fear.<p><b>and after that can do no more</b><br>Here, Jesus contrasts the temporary power of human persecutors with the eternal authority of God. While humans can harm the body, they cannot touch the soul or affect one's eternal destiny. This teaching is consistent with the broader biblical theme of the soul's immortality and the ultimate judgment by God, as seen in <a href="/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>, where Jesus further elaborates on fearing God rather than man. This perspective encourages believers to prioritize spiritual over physical concerns, trusting in God's ultimate justice and sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, addressing His disciples and followers.

The triumphant success of the great Christian preachers and the discredited condition of the old rabbinic schools is testified to by snell words as we find in St. Paul's letters. "Where is the wise? where is the scribe?" (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20</a>). But this success the Master well knew would be accompanied with many a suffering on the part of the heralds of his message. Persecution in its many dreary forms would dog their footsteps; a death of agony and shame not unfrequently would be their guerdon. It was, for instance, we know, the earthly recognition of that devoted servant of the Lord (Paul) who, we believe, guided the pen of Luke here. This painful way, which his disciples must surely tread, had already been indicated in no obscure language by the Master ("<span class="accented">some</span> of them" - my apostles - "they shall slay and persecute," <a href="/luke/11-49.htm">Luke 11:49</a>). A triumph, greater than any which had ever been given to the sons of men, would surely be theirs, but the Master would not conceal the <span class="accented">earthly</span> price which his chosen servants must pay for this splendid success. There was a point, however, beyond which human malice and enmity were utterly powerless; he would have his servants turn their thoughts on that serene region where men as men would have no power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/12-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I tell</span><br /><span class="grk">&#923;&#941;&#947;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(Leg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
