The parable involves a woman who marries seven brothers in succession, each dying without leaving children. This scenario is based on the practice of levirate marriage, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>, where a brother is to marry the widow of his deceased brother to produce offspring in his name. This practice was culturally significant in ancient Israel to preserve family lineage and inheritance rights.<br><br>The "second" brother here represents the continuation of this law, highlighting the Sadducees' attempt to challenge Jesus on the concept of resurrection by presenting a hypothetical situation. Theologically, this passage underscores the limitations of human understanding when it comes to divine matters such as life after death. It also serves to illustrate Jesus' authority and wisdom in addressing complex theological questions.<br><br>In a broader biblical context, this passage connects to the theme of resurrection found throughout the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>, where Paul elaborates on the resurrection of the dead.
