This setting reflects the heightened anticipation and curiosity among the people, many of whom were seeking physical signs and wonders. The increasing crowds also suggest a diverse audience, including both genuine seekers and skeptics.<p><b>Jesus said,</b><br>Jesus often used these moments of large gatherings to teach important spiritual truths. His words here are authoritative, reflecting His role as a teacher and prophet. The direct address to the crowd underscores the importance of the message He is about to deliver.<p><b>&#8220;This is a wicked generation.</b><br>Jesus' declaration of the generation as "wicked" highlights the moral and spiritual corruption prevalent among the people. This echoes the Old Testament prophets who often called out the unfaithfulness of Israel (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/7-28.htm">Jeremiah 7:28</a>). The term "generation" refers not just to a specific age group but to the collective mindset and spiritual state of the people at that time.<p><b>It demands a sign,</b><br>The demand for a sign indicates a lack of faith and a desire for proof beyond Jesus' teachings and previous miracles. This reflects a common attitude among the religious leaders and many in the crowd who were skeptical of Jesus' claims. In biblical context, demanding a sign often signifies unbelief and a hardened heart, as seen in the Israelites' repeated testing of God in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/17-7.htm">Exodus 17:7</a>).<p><b>but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.</b><br>The "sign of Jonah" refers to the prophet Jonah's experience in the belly of the great fish for three days and nights, which Jesus uses as a typology for His own death, burial, and resurrection (<a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>). Jonah's eventual emergence and his message to Nineveh serve as a foreshadowing of Jesus' resurrection and the call to repentance.

In St. Matthew the demand and the answer appear in close sequence.<p>The variations in St. Luke are (1) the omission of the explanation of the manner in which the sign of the prophet Jonah was to be fulfilled by the three days and three nights in the heart of the earth; (2) the position of the reference to the queen of the south, as coming between the sign of Jonah and the rising of the men of Nineveh.

Jesus now proceeds - the crowd was, we read, become denser - to reply to the unbelieving suggestion that he should show by a sign from heaven that it was not by the help of Satan and the powers of hell that he was enabled to exercise so mighty a power over the spirits of evil. No sign of the startling nature demanded would be given to the Jews of his day. Evidence in support of his high claims and lofty assertions was then in process of being supplied. What were their eyes beholding day by day, and their ears hearing? Evidence still more complete would vet be given them, but it would avail nothing! Lo, the solemn sign of the Prophet Jonas, who preached to wicked Nineveh after his strange resurrection - <span class="accented">that</span> would be given them. It is clear that St. Luke's account of our Lord's words is abbreviated. To make the symbolism of the resurrection-sign complete, we must compare St. Matthew's report (<a href="/matthew/12-39.htm">Matthew 12:39, 40</a>), where in plain terms the Lord's death, and the resting in the tomb, and subsequent resurrection is foretold, and compared to the well-known story of the entombment of Jonah at sea for three days. This simile of the Master's was no doubt one repeated on several occasions. It is likely enough that it was so well-known a comparison when St. Luke wrote his memoir of the life that the evangelist felt it was not needful to go into all the details of the comparison; to mention the simile was enough; no Christian individual, household, or congregation but could at once fill up the details originally spoken by the Lord here. In the catacombs the Jonah-story is, owing to its use by our Lord, an oft-repeated and very favourite representation on those long galleries of tombs of Christian men and women of the first three centuries. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/11-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(T&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Genitive Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
