They had gone to the tomb early in the morning to anoint Jesus' body with spices, a customary burial practice in Jewish culture. The tomb was located outside Jerusalem, likely in a garden setting, as was common for wealthy individuals' burial sites. The empty tomb is a pivotal moment in the resurrection narrative, fulfilling Jesus' prophecy about His resurrection (<a href="/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>).<p><b>they reported all these things</b><br>The women were the first to witness the empty tomb and the angelic message of Jesus' resurrection. Their role as the first messengers is significant, as women were not considered reliable witnesses in first-century Jewish society. This highlights the counter-cultural nature of the Gospel accounts. The "things" they reported included the stone rolled away, the absence of Jesus' body, and the angelic proclamation that He had risen (<a href="/luke/24-5.htm">Luke 24:5-7</a>).<p><b>to the Eleven</b><br>The Eleven refers to the remaining apostles, excluding Judas Iscariot, who had betrayed Jesus and subsequently died. The apostles were the primary leaders of the early church and were chosen by Jesus to be His witnesses (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). Their initial skepticism about the women's report (<a href="/luke/24-11.htm">Luke 24:11</a>) underscores the unexpected nature of the resurrection, even among Jesus' closest followers.<p><b>and to all the others</b><br>This phrase indicates that there were more disciples present than just the Eleven. The early Christian community included a broader group of followers who had been with Jesus throughout His ministry. This group likely included both men and women who were devoted to Jesus' teachings and mission. The inclusion of "all the others" emphasizes the communal aspect of the early church and the widespread impact of the resurrection message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_women.htm">The Women</a></b><br>These are the women who visited Jesus' tomb early on the first day of the week.
