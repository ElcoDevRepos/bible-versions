The context is significant as it follows the return of the seventy-two disciples who were sent out to preach and perform miracles. Jesus' choice to speak privately suggests the importance of the message and the special relationship He shares with His disciples. This private setting underscores the personal nature of Jesus' teaching and the privilege of being His close followers. It reflects the pattern of Jesus often revealing deeper truths to His disciples away from the crowds, as seen in other instances like <a href="/mark/4-34.htm">Mark 4:34</a>.<p><b>Blessed are the eyes that see what you see</b><br>The term "blessed" here conveys a sense of divine favor and happiness. Jesus is acknowledging the unique privilege the disciples have in witnessing His ministry and the unfolding of God's redemptive plan. This statement connects to the broader biblical theme of revelation and fulfillment of prophecy. The disciples are witnessing the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which speak of the coming of God's salvation with miraculous signs. The phrase also highlights the contrast between the disciples and the many prophets and kings who longed to see the Messiah's day but did not, as mentioned in the following verse, <a href="/luke/10-24.htm">Luke 10:24</a>. This moment is a fulfillment of God's promises and a pivotal point in salvation history, emphasizing the disciples' role as eyewitnesses to the life and work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching His disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are being directly addressed in this passage.
