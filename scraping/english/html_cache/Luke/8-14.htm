The thorns symbolize obstacles and distractions that prevent spiritual growth. In ancient agriculture, thorns and weeds were common and could easily overtake crops if not diligently removed, representing the persistent nature of worldly distractions.<p><b>are those who hear</b><br>Hearing the Word is the initial step in the process of faith. <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a> emphasizes that "faith comes from hearing the message." However, merely hearing is not sufficient for spiritual growth; it requires a response and commitment to nurture the seed of the Word.<p><b>but as they go on their way</b><br>This phrase suggests a progression in life where initial enthusiasm for the Word is not sustained. The journey of life presents various challenges and distractions that can divert attention from spiritual priorities. The imagery of "going on their way" implies a lack of rootedness and stability in faith.<p><b>they are choked by the worries, riches, and pleasures of this life</b><br>The thorns represent three specific distractions: worries, riches, and pleasures. Worries can consume thoughts and lead to anxiety, detracting from trust in God. Riches can create a false sense of security and lead to materialism, as warned in <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a> about the love of money. Pleasures can lead to hedonism, prioritizing temporary satisfaction over eternal values. These elements reflect the temptations Jesus faced in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>) and are common hindrances to spiritual maturity.<p><b>and their fruit does not mature</b><br>The ultimate goal of receiving the Word is to bear fruit, as seen in <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>, where Jesus speaks of the importance of abiding in Him to bear much fruit. The lack of maturity indicates a failure to develop the fruits of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>) and fulfill the purpose of a believer's life.

They sit in the same crowd as the good-soil hearers and initially welcome the seed (<a href="/luke/8-13.htm">Luke 8:13</a>). Hearing, in Scripture, is always the doorway to faith (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>) and must precede any harvest. Yet, as James warns, hearing alone is not enough if it never moves to obedient action (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As they go on their way</b><p>Life does not pause after the sermon. Work, school, family, and routine pressures immediately press in. The phrase pictures someone walking away from the moment of spiritual impact and re-entering ordinary traffic (cf. <a href="/luke/17-26.htm">Luke 17:26-30</a>). Without deliberate cultivation, the seed is left exposed to whatever else is growing in the heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Choked by the worries of life</b><p>&#8226; Everyday anxiety grows like thorny vines, crowding out spiritual focus.<p>&#8226; Jesus repeatedly commands &#8220;Do not worry&#8221; because worry competes for the throne of our thoughts (<a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-33</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; When fear over mortgages, health, or headlines rules, prayer and trust are strangled.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Choked by riches</b><p>&#8226; Wealth itself is not condemned, yet the craving for it pierces with many griefs (<a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Possessions promise security, but they silently demand our time, affection, and allegiance (<a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15-21</a>).<p>&#8226; The more energy invested in acquiring and maintaining riches, the less remains for the kingdom (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Choked by pleasures</b><p>&#8226; Pleasure is a gift when received with gratitude, but it becomes a tyrant when pursued as the chief aim (<a href="/titus/3-3.htm">Titus 3:3</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-4.htm">2 Timothy 3:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The allure of entertainment, indulgence, and comfort can dull spiritual appetite (<a href="/hebrews/11-25.htm">Hebrews 11:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Thorn-patch living trades lasting joy for temporary thrills.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Their fruit does not mature</b><p>&#8226; The seed remains alive, yet stunted.

As we step back into daily life, unchecked anxiety, materialism, and pursuit of pleasure can overrun the heart, suffocating spiritual growth and leaving us fruitless. The call is to recognize and uproot these thorns so the planted word can flourish into a mature, productive, God-glorifying harvest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Cares and riches and pleasures of this life.</span>--Better, simply, <span class= "ital">of life,</span> St. Luke's word (<span class= "ital">bios</span>) being different from that in the other two Gospels (<span class= "ital">?on,</span> a time, or period--and so used for "the world"). The insertion of "pleasures" is peculiar to St. Luke, as is also the specific "bring no fruit to perfection "instead of "becometh unfruitful." The one Greek word which St. Luke uses, and for which the English version substitutes five, occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, and belonging, as it does, to the vocabulary of a more polished literature, is characteristic of his general culture.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection</span>. There is something very sad in this, the thorn-choked class of believers. Each of them represents the <span class="accented">vie manquee</span>; the beautiful flower just spoiled as it was bursting into full bloom. These hear the Word, and, hearing it, grasp its deep solemn meaning, and for a <span class="accented">part</span> of each day honestly try to live the life which that Divine Word pressed home to them. But with these there is another life; side by side with the golden grain has grown up a crop of thorns, which, unless destroyed in time, will choke and utterly mar, as, alas, it often does, the true corn. Such men and women, the double-minded ones of St. James, try to serve two masters - God and the world. Dr. Morrison has a good note on the parallel passage in St. Mark, where, after suggesting that the cares, the riches, and the pleasures of this life in our time are such things as houses, land, works of art and <span class="accented">virtu</span>, posts of honour, gaiety of garments, grandeur of entertainments, and in general the myriad appliances of luxury, he goes on to say, "These come more or less in upon all men, but some men lay themselves peculiarly open to their influence, and allow them to twine and twist themselves like the serpents of Laocoon around every energy and susceptibility of their being." The rich young ruler whom Jesus loved is a fair instance of this not uncommon character, which perhaps is more often met with among the more cultured of society than among the poor and the artisan class. There must have been much that was really beautiful and true in that young man, or Jesus never had singled him out as one whom he especially loved, and yet in his case the thorns of riches and luxury had so twined themselves among the real corn that, as far as we know, it never brought fruit to perfection. Ananias and Sapphira may, too, be instanced. They had given up much for the Name's sake, associated themselves with a hated and persecuted sect, sacrificed a large portion of their property to help the poor of the flock, and yet these apparently devoted ones were living a double life; the thorns had so grown up and twined about the corn that in their field nothing ever ripened. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The [ seeds that ]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(To)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
