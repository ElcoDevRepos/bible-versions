In the context of the parable, the prodigal son recognizes his dire situation, symbolizing a sinner's acknowledgment of their spiritual poverty. This turning point is akin to the biblical concept of repentance, where one turns away from sin and towards God. The phrase echoes the call to self-examination found in <a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>, urging believers to assess their spiritual state.<p><b>and said,</b><br>The act of speaking to oneself here indicates an internal dialogue and decision-making process. This introspection is crucial in the journey of repentance and mirrors the biblical theme of confession, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>, where acknowledging one's sins is the first step towards forgiveness and restoration.<p><b>&#8216;How many of my father&#8217;s hired servants have plenty of food,</b><br>This comparison highlights the abundance and provision found in the father's house, symbolizing God's kingdom. The hired servants, who are not family members, still receive ample provision, illustrating God's grace and generosity. This abundance contrasts with the son's current lack, emphasizing the spiritual richness available to those who return to God. The imagery of a well-provided household reflects the blessings described in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>, where the Lord is portrayed as a shepherd who meets all needs.<p><b>but here I am,</b><br>The phrase underscores the son's current state of destitution and isolation, a result of his choices. It reflects the human condition of separation from God due to sin, as described in <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>. This acknowledgment of one's fallen state is essential for genuine repentance and reconciliation with God.<p><b>starving to death!</b><br>The physical hunger experienced by the son symbolizes spiritual starvation and the emptiness of a life apart from God. This dire situation serves as a metaphor for the consequences of sin, which leads to spiritual death, as stated in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>. The son's desperation highlights the urgency of returning to the father, paralleling the call to seek God while He may be found, as urged in <a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prodigal_son.htm">The Prodigal Son</a></b><br>A young man who squandered his inheritance in reckless living and found himself in dire need.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Represents God, who is loving and forgiving, waiting for the return of his lost son.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hired_servants.htm">Hired Servants</a></b><br>Workers in the father's household who have their needs met, symbolizing the provision and care of God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_far_country.htm">The Far Country</a></b><br>Represents a life lived away from God, characterized by sin and spiritual famine.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_moment_of_realization.htm">The Moment of Realization</a></b><br>The turning point where the prodigal son recognizes his dire situation and decides to return to his father.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/realization_of_need.htm">Realization of Need</a></b><br>Recognize the emptiness of a life lived apart from God.

The man's guilt was, that he had been self-indulgent; but he had been living to a self which was not his true self. The first step in his repentance is to wake as out of an evil dream, and to be conscious of his better nature, and then there comes the memory of happier days which is as "Sorrow's crown of sorrow." The "hired servants" are obviously those who serve God, not in the spirit of filial love, but from the hope of a reward. Even in that lower form of duty they find what satisfies their wants. They have not the craving of unsatisfied desire which the son feels who has cast away his sonship. He envies them, and would fain be as they are.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he came to himself</span>. This tardy repentance in the famous parable has been the occasion of many a sneer from the world. Even satiety, even soul-hunger, did not bring the prodigal to penitence; nothing but absolute bodily suffering, cruel hunger, drove him to take the step which in the end saved him. There is no doubt it would have been far more noble on the young man's part if, in the midst of his downhill career, he had suddenly paused, and, with a mighty and continued effort of self-control, had turned to purity, to duty, and to God. Certainly this had been hereto conduct - a term no one would think of applying to anything belonging to the life of the younger son of our story. But though not heroic, is not the conduct of the prodigal just what is of daily occurrence in common life? The world may sneer; but is not <span class="accented">such</span> a repentance, after all, a blessed thing? It is a poor mean way, some would tell us, of creeping into heaven; but is it not better to enter into God's city even thus, with bowed head, than not at all? Is it not better to consecrate a few months, or perhaps years, of a wasted life to God's service, to noble generous deeds, to brave attempts to undo past mischief and neglect, than to go sinning on to the bitter end? There is something intensely sorrowful in this consecrating to the Master the end of a sin-worn life; but there is what is infinitely worse. What a deep well, too, of comfort has the Church-taught teacher here to draw from in his weary life-experiences! How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! Among the bitternesses of his present degradation, not the least was the memory of his happy childhood and boyhood in his old home. <p><span class="accented">"For a sorrow's crown of sorrows<br />Is remembering happier things."</span> The family of the prodigal, as we have already remarked, was certainly possessed of wealth, and was probably one of high rank. In the old home there was nothing wanting. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/15-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Finally</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he came</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#955;&#952;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(elth&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2064.htm">Strong's 2064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, go. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7984;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Eis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1519.htm">Strong's 1519: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition; to or into, of place, time, or purpose; also in adverbial phrases.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his senses</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(heauton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Reflexive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1438.htm">Strong's 1438: </a> </span><span class="str2">Himself, herself, itself. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[and] said,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#966;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(eph&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5346.htm">Strong's 5346: </a> </span><span class="str2">To say, declare.
