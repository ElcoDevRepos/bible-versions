The use of signs indicates that Zechariah was not only mute but possibly also deaf, as the people communicated with him through gestures. This reflects the fulfillment of the angel's words and highlights the miraculous nature of John's birth. The community's involvement in the naming process underscores the cultural importance of naming and the communal aspect of family life in Jewish society.<p><b>to find out what he wanted</b><br>The act of seeking Zechariah's input shows respect for the father's authority in naming his child, a significant cultural practice in Jewish tradition. Naming was often associated with the child's destiny or divine purpose, as seen in other biblical accounts such as the naming of Isaac (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>) and Jesus (<a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>). This moment also emphasizes the anticipation and curiosity surrounding the child's future, given the extraordinary circumstances of his conception and birth.<p><b>to name the child</b><br>Naming in biblical times was a profound act, often reflecting divine revelation or prophetic insight. In this case, the name "John" was divinely appointed (<a href="/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13</a>), meaning "Yahweh is gracious." This name signifies the grace of God in granting Elizabeth and Zechariah a child in their old age and foreshadows John's role in preparing the way for Jesus, the ultimate expression of God's grace. The insistence on the name John, despite cultural expectations to name the child after his father, highlights the divine intervention and purpose in John's life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>- A priest of the division of Abijah, husband to Elizabeth, and father of John the Baptist.
