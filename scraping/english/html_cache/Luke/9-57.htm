The road signifies the path of discipleship, a journey that requires commitment and perseverance. In the context of <a href="/luke/9.htm">Luke 9</a>, Jesus is on His way to Jerusalem, a journey that ultimately leads to His crucifixion. This highlights the seriousness and cost of following Him.<p><b>someone said to Jesus</b><br>The identity of the person is not specified, which suggests that the message is universal, applicable to anyone who desires to follow Jesus. This encounter is one of several in the Gospels where individuals express a desire to follow Christ, each revealing different aspects of what true discipleship entails.<p><b>&#8220;I will follow You wherever You go.&#8221;</b><br>This declaration of commitment is bold and seemingly unconditional. It echoes the call of discipleship found in other parts of the New Testament, such as <a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>, where Jesus says, "If anyone would come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me." The phrase "wherever You go" implies a willingness to face uncertainty and potential hardship, reflecting the call to prioritize Jesus above all else. This commitment is reminiscent of the loyalty shown by Old Testament figures like Ruth, who said to Naomi, "Where you go, I will go" (<a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16</a>), highlighting the depth of devotion required.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is traveling and teaching His disciples about the cost of following Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_enthusiastic_follower.htm">The Enthusiastic Follower</a></b><br>An unnamed individual who expresses a desire to follow Jesus unconditionally.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_road.htm">The Road</a></b><br>Symbolic of the journey of discipleship, representing the path of following Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">The Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>Following Jesus requires a willingness to sacrifice personal comfort and security.

The verse highlights that discipleship arises in everyday moments, demands personal initiative, and requires a readiness to share in Christ&#8217;s unknown journeys. The eager words &#8220;I will follow You wherever You go&#8221; invite each believer to consider whether willingness is matched by steadfast obedience when the road grows costly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(57-60) <span class= "bld">Lord, I will follow thee.</span>--See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/8-19.htm" title="And a certain scribe came, and said to him, Master, I will follow you wherever you go.">Matthew 8:19-22</a>. The two anecdotes, if we may so call them, are placed by the two Evangelists in a very different connection. It is clear that their isolated, fragmentary character, with no definite notes of time and place, left a large margin to the discretion of each compiler as to where they should appear. The difference between the "certain man" of St. Luke's report, and the "scribe" of St. Matthew's, slight as it is, takes its place among the signs of the mutual independence of the two Gospels.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 57-62.</span> <span class="accented">- Three would-be disciples. The Lord</span>, <span class="accented">in plain terms</span>, <span class="accented">tells them what is required of men who seek his service.</span> The first two of these incidents in the life of Jesus are related by St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/7-19.htm">Matthew 7:19-22</a>), but he places them in an earlier period. They evidently did not occur together, but most probably they took place about this time in the ministry. They are placed in one group as examples of the way in which the Master replied to numerous offers of service made to him under different conditions. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 57, 58.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lord, I will</span> <span class="cmt_word">follow thee whithersoever thou goest. And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head</span>. St. Matthew tells us that the "certain man" who made this offer of service was a scribe. This detail is useful, as showing that those who were attracted by our Lord's teaching were by no means confined to the peasant and artisan class. If we look a little below the surface of the gospel story, we find numberless indications of this. In the Master's reply it is probable that the depression, naturally the result of the churlish refusal of the Samaritan villagers to receive him (ver. 53), coloured the sad but true reflection. The wise Master distrusted the too-ready enthusiasm of his would-be disciple. He saw it would never stand the test of the severe privation or the painful self-sacrifice which would be the sure lot of any one, especially at that juncture, really faithful to him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-57.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As they</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
