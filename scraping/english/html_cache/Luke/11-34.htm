The eye, as a metaphorical lamp, represents perception and understanding. In Jewish thought, the eye was often seen as a window to the soul, reflecting one's inner spiritual state. This phrase suggests that the way one perceives the world can illuminate or darken one's entire being. The eye's function as a lamp is to guide and direct, much like the Word of God is described as a lamp to one's feet (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>).<p><b>When your eyes are good, your whole body also is full of light.</b><br>The term "good" here can be understood as healthy or clear, indicating spiritual insight and purity. A good eye symbolizes a heart and mind focused on God and His righteousness. In the cultural context, a "good eye" was associated with generosity and a positive outlook, contrasting with an "evil eye," which implied greed or envy. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount, where He emphasizes the importance of storing treasures in heaven and having a single-minded devotion to God (<a href="/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22-23</a>).<p><b>But when they are bad, your body is full of darkness.</b><br>A "bad" eye, in contrast, signifies spiritual blindness or moral corruption. In the ancient Near East, a "bad eye" was often linked to selfishness and a lack of compassion. This darkness represents a life disconnected from God's truth and light. The imagery of darkness is frequently used in Scripture to describe separation from God and the presence of sin (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-21</a>). The warning here is clear: allowing one's perception to be clouded by sin or worldly desires results in spiritual darkness, affecting one's entire being.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, providing spiritual teaching to His disciples and the crowd.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teachings, representing followers of Christ who seek to understand His message.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The broader audience present during Jesus' teaching, symbolizing the general public who are exposed to His message.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_eye.htm">The Eye</a></b><br>Used metaphorically by Jesus to represent spiritual perception and discernment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_body.htm">The Body</a></b><br>Symbolizes the whole being of a person, influenced by the spiritual state of the "eye."<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_perception.htm">Spiritual Perception</a></b><br>The "eye" represents our spiritual perception.

In some respects the sequence of thought in St. Luke differs from that in St. Matthew, and seems somewhat closer. In the Sermon on the Mount, the company of Christ's disciples are the light, and each of them is as the lamp on its proper stand, and the teaching as to the "light of the body," and the corresponding "'eye" of the soul, is separated from that illustration by our Lord's comment on the corrupt traditional interpretations of the scribes. Here the two thoughts are brought into close proximity. The moral sense, the "vision and the faculty divine" that has its intuitions of eternal truths, this is the light which is so set that those who "are entering in" (this feature, as in <a href="/luke/8-16.htm" title="No man, when he has lighted a candle, covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed; but sets it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.">Luke 8:16</a>, is peculiar to St. Luke)--the seekers and inquirers who are drawn to look in, as it were, upon the house of Christ's Church, the "unlearned" or "unbelievers" of <a href="/1_corinthians/14-23.htm" title="If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?">1Corinthians 14:23</a>--may see the light and turn to it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 34, 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness. Take heed therefore that the light which is in</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee be not darkness.</span> He goes on, though, with his solemn warning words. Plainly visible though the <span class="accented">sign</span> would be - shining bright as a lighted lamp set on high - still it, too, was possible to miss seeing it. If the eye, the organ of the body which perceives the light, be sound and healthy, then the illumination given by the lamp is seen, and the whole body, so to speak, is full of light; but if the eye was diseased, purblind, no bright shining light would be seen - the body then would be full of darkness. The word rendered "single" denotes the eye in its natural healthy state; that translated "evil" speaks of the eye as diseased, as incapable of perceiving the rays of light. The imagery to those Orientals, accustomed to parable and allegory in the stories and poems they had listened to from their childhood, was easily translated into the language of everyday life. If they gave way to passion, jealousy, prejudice, impurity, lawlessness in its hundred forms, then for them the spiritual eye of the soul would become diseased, and therefore incapable of rightly discerning any heavenly sign. It was this danger that the Master was pointing out to the crowd. "Ah!" he seems to say, "you ask a heavenly sign which will substantiate my lofty claims; that sign, in a grander and more stately form than ever you have dreamed of, shall, indeed, be given you. Have no fear on <span class="accented">that</span> score; rather dread that blindness, the punishment of a hard and evil heart, will come upon you, and render you incapable of seeing the sign you ask for, and which I mean to give you." <span class="accented">He was speaking still of his resurrection.</span> Alas, for them! the blindness of which he warned them was the unhappy lot, we know, of very many of those listening then. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/11-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Your</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(sou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
