Their plea reflects the ancient Near Eastern custom of hospitality, where travelers were often invited to stay for the night. This act of inviting a stranger in was a common practice, emphasizing the importance of community and care for others. The disciples' request also shows their desire for further understanding and fellowship, as they were intrigued by the insights Jesus shared about the Scriptures.<p><b>&#8220;Stay with us</b><br>This invitation highlights the disciples' longing for companionship and further teaching. In the context of the resurrection, it symbolizes the desire for the presence of Christ in the believer's life. The request for Jesus to stay is a metaphor for the Christian's desire for a deeper relationship with God. It also reflects the biblical theme of God dwelling with His people, as seen in the tabernacle and temple in the Old Testament and fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ.<p><b>for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over.&#8221;</b><br>The mention of evening and the end of the day underscores the urgency and necessity of their request. In biblical times, travel at night was dangerous due to the lack of lighting and the presence of robbers. This practical concern adds a layer of immediacy to their plea. Symbolically, the setting sun can represent the closing of an era or the end of an old covenant, with the resurrection of Jesus marking the dawn of a new covenant and a new creation.<p><b>So He went in to stay with them.</b><br>Jesus' acceptance of their invitation demonstrates His willingness to reveal Himself to those who seek Him. This act of staying with the disciples prefigures the intimate fellowship believers can have with Christ. It also fulfills the promise of God's presence with His people, as seen in the Emmanuel prophecy (<a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>) and Jesus' assurance in <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>, "I am with you always."

They could not bring themselves to part with one who had done so much for them. Devout imagination has, however, legitimately read other meanings in it. "Abide with me" has become the burden of the most popular of evening hymns, the true prayer for the evening of each day, for the evening of each man's life, for the moments when hopes fail and we commune one with another and are sad; for those, also, when our hearts burn within us in the half-consciousness that Christ is speaking to us through the lips of human teachers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he went in to tarry with them</span>.
