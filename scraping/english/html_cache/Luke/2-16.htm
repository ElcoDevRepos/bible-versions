This reflects the importance and immediacy of the message they received.

This urgency can be seen as a model for how believers should respond to divine revelation.<p><b>and found Mary and Joseph</b><br>The shepherds' journey led them to the Holy Family, fulfilling the angel's message.

His birth marks the incarnation of God, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, which speaks of a virgin bearing a son. The shepherds' discovery of the Baby signifies the beginning of the New Covenant, where God dwells among His people.<p><b>who was lying in the manger.</b><br>The manger, a feeding trough for animals, symbolizes humility and the unexpected nature of the Messiah's arrival.
