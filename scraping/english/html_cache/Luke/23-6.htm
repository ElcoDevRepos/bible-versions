His role in the trial of Jesus is significant, as he represents the Roman authority. The phrase indicates Pilate's reaction to the information presented to him, which is crucial in understanding the legal proceedings of the time. Pilate's involvement fulfills the prophecy of Jesus being handed over to the Gentiles (<a href="/luke/18-32.htm">Luke 18:32</a>).<p><b>he asked if the man was a Galilean</b><br>Galilee was a region in northern Israel, known for its diverse population and distinct cultural identity. Jesus' association with Galilee is significant, as it fulfills the prophecy of the Messiah coming from this region (<a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>). Pilate's question reflects his attempt to determine jurisdiction, as Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee, was in Jerusalem at the time. This inquiry sets the stage for Jesus being sent to Herod, highlighting the political dynamics and the fulfillment of Jesus being rejected by both Jewish and Gentile leaders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pilate.htm">Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea, who is responsible for overseeing the trial of Jesus.

These are political charges aimed at forcing Pilate&#8217;s hand&#8212;far more threatening to Rome than mere religious debate (compare <a href="/john/18-31.htm">John 18:31-32</a>).<p>&#8226; Pilate&#8217;s reaction mirrors his earlier questioning recorded in <a href="/john/18-33.htm">John 18:33-38</a>, where he probes Jesus about His kingdom. He senses something unusual and wants clarity before acting.<p>&#8226; We see a ruler weighing evidence, as <a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a> warns against judging a matter without hearing it fully. Pilate&#8217;s initial hearing phase fulfills that caution&#8212;he listens first, then moves to action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He asked</b><p>&#8226; Pilate doesn&#8217;t pronounce judgment; he asks a question. This reveals a desire to verify jurisdiction rather than rush to verdict (<a href="/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4</a>).<p>&#8226; By asking, Pilate also exposes the weakness of the charges&#8212;he needs more than heated accusations (<a href="/john/18-38.htm">John 18:38</a>, &#8220;I find no basis for a charge&#8221;).<p>&#8226; His inquiry illustrates how God uses even hesitant pagan officials to advance His redemptive plan (<a href="/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27-28</a> mentions Pilate among those gathered &#8220;to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose had determined&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Questioning rather than condemning keeps the prophecy alive that the Messiah would be &#8220;oppressed and afflicted, yet He opened not His mouth&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>), because Jesus remains largely silent through it all (<a href="/luke/23-9.htm">Luke 23:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If the man was a Galilean</b><p>&#8226; Pilate&#8217;s question targets geography: Galilee fell under Herod Antipas, not his own direct province (<a href="/luke/3-1.htm">Luke 3:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Discovering Jesus to be a Galilean affords Pilate a political escape hatch&#8212;he can transfer the case to Herod and avoid upsetting local Jewish leaders (<a href="/luke/23-7.htm">Luke 23:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The move also fulfills <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, where &#8220;the kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the LORD and against His Anointed.&#8221; Pilate and Herod become joint participants in that prophecy (<a href="/luke/23-12.htm">Luke 23:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Ironically, Galilee&#8212;the region once called &#8220;Galilee of the Gentiles&#8221; where light dawned (<a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, echoed in <a href="/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13-16</a>)&#8212;now becomes the technicality that propels Jesus closer to the cross. God turns political maneuvering into providential momentum.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Pilate&#8217;s simple question, &#8220;On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean&#8221;, reveals more than courtroom etiquette. It shows a governor listening before judging, probing jurisdiction to evade responsibility, and inadvertently setting in motion a transfer that advances God&#8217;s sovereign plan. Accusations fly, motives tangle, yet the Lord guides every detail so the spotless Lamb journeys inexorably toward the sacrifice foretold from the foundation of the world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">When Pilate heard of Galilee.</span>--The incident that follows is peculiar to St. Luke, and may have been obtained by him from Manaen or other persons connected with the Herodian household with whom he appears to have come in contact. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>) It is obvious that Pilate catches at the word in the hope of shifting on another the responsibility of con demning One whom he believed to be innocent and had learnt to respect, while yet he had not the courage to acquit Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the Man were a Galilaean. And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time</span>. Now, Pilate dreaded lest these Jews should make his clemency towards the Prisoner a ground of accusation against him at Rome. Pilate had enemies in the capital. His once powerful patron Sejanus had just fallen. His own past, too, he was well aware, would not bear examination; so, moved by his cowardly fears, he refrained from releasing Jesus in accordance with what his heart told him was just and right; and yet he could not bring himself to condemn One to whom he was drawn by an unknown feeling of reverence and respect. But hearing that Jesus was accused among other things of stirring up sedition in Galilee, he thought he would shift the responsibility of acquitting or condemning, on to the shoulders of Herod, in whose jurisdiction Galilee lay. Herod was in Jerusalem just then, because of the Passover Feast. His usual residence was Capernaum. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/23-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Pilate</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#953;&#955;&#8118;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Pilatos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4091.htm">Strong's 4091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pilate.
