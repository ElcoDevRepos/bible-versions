The term "firstborn" signifies Jesus' preeminence and unique status, as well as Mary's virginity at the time of His birth. In Jewish culture, the firstborn son held special significance, often receiving a double portion of the inheritance and having religious duties (<a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>). This also sets the stage for Jesus' role as the firstborn over all creation (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>).<p><b>She wrapped Him in swaddling cloths</b><br>Swaddling cloths were strips of cloth used to wrap newborns tightly, providing warmth and security. This practice was common in ancient Near Eastern cultures and symbolized care and protection. The mention of swaddling cloths emphasizes Jesus' humanity and vulnerability as a newborn. It also reflects the humble circumstances of His birth, contrasting with His divine nature.<p><b>and laid Him in a manger,</b><br>A manger is a feeding trough for animals, indicating that Jesus was born in a setting associated with livestock, likely a stable or cave. This humble beginning fulfills the prophecy of the Messiah's lowly origins (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>). The manger symbolizes Jesus' accessibility to all people, including the lowly and marginalized, and foreshadows His role as the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), providing spiritual nourishment.<p><b>because there was no room for them in the inn.</b><br>The lack of room in the inn underscores the theme of rejection and humility in Jesus' life. Inns in ancient times were often simple guest rooms or caravansaries, and the overcrowding due to the census (<a href="/luke/2.htm">Luke 2:1-3</a>) left Mary and Joseph without proper lodging. This situation reflects the world's unpreparedness to receive the Savior and prefigures the rejection Jesus would face throughout His ministry (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>). The phrase also invites reflection on the spiritual readiness of individuals to make room for Christ in their lives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>The mother of Jesus, chosen by God to bear His Son.

Caves in the limestone rocks of Judaea were so often used as stables, that there is nothing improbable in the tradition. The present Church of the Nativity has beneath it a natural crypt or cavern, in which St. Jerome is said to have passed many years, compiling his Latin translation (that known as the Vulgate) of the Sacred Scriptures.

This khan of Bethlehem had a memorable history of its own, being named in <a href="/jeremiah/41-17.htm">Jeremiah 41:17</a> as the 'inn of Chimham,' the place of rendezvous from which travelers started on their journey to Egypt. It was so called after the son of Barzillai, whom David seems to have treated as an adopted son (<a href="/2_samuel/19-37.htm">2 Samuel 19:37, 38</a>), and was probably built by him in his patron's city as a testimony of his gratitude" (Dean Plumptre). The stable was not unfrequently a limestone cave, and there is a very ancient tradition that there was a cave of this description attached to the "inn," or caravanserai, of Bethlehem. This "inn" would, no doubt, be a large one, owing to its being in the neighborhood of Jerusalem, and would often be crowded with the poorer class of pilgrims who went up to the temple at the seasons of the greater feasts. Bethlehem is only six miles from Jerusalem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/2-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">she gave birth to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#964;&#949;&#954;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eteken)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5088.htm">Strong's 5088: </a> </span><span class="str2">A strengthened form of a primary teko tek'-o; to produce, literally or figuratively.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">her</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8134;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Feminine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
