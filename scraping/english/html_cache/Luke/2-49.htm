It reflects a moment of transition where Jesus begins to assert His divine purpose. The question implies that His parents should have understood His need to be in the temple, a place of learning and worship. This moment is significant as it marks the first recorded words of Jesus in the Gospels, emphasizing His self-awareness and the beginning of His public ministry. The question also invites reflection on the nature of seeking Jesus, a theme that resonates throughout the Gospels, where individuals are called to seek and find Him.<p><b>&#8220;He asked.&#8221;</b><br>The act of asking questions was a common method of teaching in Jewish culture, often used by rabbis to engage students in deeper thought and understanding. Jesus, even as a child, employs this method, indicating His role as a teacher. This approach is seen throughout His ministry, where He frequently uses questions to provoke thought and reveal deeper truths. The use of questions also demonstrates Jesus' relational approach to teaching, inviting dialogue and reflection.<p><b>&#8220;Did you not know that I had to be in My Father&#8217;s house?&#8221;</b><br>This statement reveals Jesus' understanding of His divine sonship and His relationship with God the Father. The phrase "My Father&#8217;s house" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the center of Jewish worship and the dwelling place of God's presence. Jesus' use of "My Father" signifies His unique relationship with God, distinct from the general Jewish understanding of God as the Father of the nation. This moment foreshadows His later teachings about His unity with the Father and His role in fulfilling the Father's will. The temple, as the setting, underscores the importance of worship, learning, and the fulfillment of prophecy, as Jesus embodies the true temple where God dwells among His people. This statement also connects to the broader biblical narrative of Jesus fulfilling the law and the prophets, as He is the ultimate revelation of God's presence and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>At twelve years old, Jesus is found in the temple, engaging with the teachers, demonstrating His early understanding of His divine mission.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary_and_joseph.htm">Mary and Joseph</a></b><br>Jesus' earthly parents, who are initially unaware of His whereabouts and are anxious when they cannot find Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of Jewish worship and learning, where Jesus is found discussing with the teachers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_teachers.htm">The Teachers</a></b><br>Jewish religious leaders and scholars who are amazed by Jesus' understanding and answers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover_festival.htm">Passover Festival</a></b><br>The annual Jewish festival commemorating the Exodus, during which this event takes place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_jesus'_mission.htm">Understanding Jesus' Mission</a></b><br>Jesus' statement reveals His awareness of His divine mission from a young age.

Yet the Lord responds, &#8220;Why were you looking for Me?&#8221;.<p>&#8226; He is not rebuking their concern but revealing that He was never truly &#8220;lost.&#8221; In God&#8217;s providence He was exactly where He ought to be&#8212;much like later moments when He walks purposefully into Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-36.htm">Matthew 26:36</a>) or sets His face toward Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>).<p>&#8226; This gentle question exposes a gap between human anxiety and divine certainty. Jesus&#8217; sense of security rests in the Father&#8217;s plan. Compare <a href="/psalms/31-14.htm">Psalm 31:14&#8211;15</a>, where David affirms, &#8220;I trust in You, O LORD&#8230; my times are in Your hands.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Did you not know</b><p>&#8226; Mary had heard Gabriel proclaim her Child would be called &#8220;the Son of the Most High&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32</a>). Joseph had been told by an angel that Jesus would &#8220;save His people from their sins&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Given those revelations, the Lord&#8217;s question implies, &#8220;You of all people should understand My priorities.&#8221; Similar divine reminders surface when God asks Elijah, &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/19-9.htm">1 Kings 19:9</a>) or when Jesus asks Philip, &#8220;Have I been with you all this time&#8230; and you still do not know Me?&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s people are often startled by how literally the Lord fulfills His word. As Simeon had prophesied in this very temple, &#8220;My eyes have seen Your salvation&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-30.htm">Luke 2:30</a>). Mary and Joseph now witness their twelve-year-old Son acting in perfect harmony with that prophecy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I had to be</b><p>&#8226; The phrase signals divine necessity&#8212;an inner compulsion springing from obedience to the Father&#8217;s will. Jesus later speaks the same way: &#8220;I must preach the good news of the kingdom&#8221; (<a href="/luke/4-43.htm">Luke 4:43</a>), &#8220;The Son of Man must suffer&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-7.htm">Luke 24:7</a>), and &#8220;I must be about the works of Him who sent Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>).<p>&#8226; This sense of &#8220;had to&#8221; underscores His sinless submission (<a href="/hebrews/10-7.htm">Hebrews 10:7</a>) and hints at the unfolding plan of redemption first announced in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>. From childhood onward, Christ&#8217;s steps are ordered by Scripture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in My Father&#8217;s house</b><p>&#8226; In the text Jesus identifies the temple as &#8220;My Father&#8217;s house.&#8221; The same wording appears when He later drives out the money changers: &#8220;Stop turning My Father&#8217;s house into a marketplace!&#8221; (<a href="/john/2-16.htm">John 2:16</a>).<p>&#8226; By calling God &#8220;My Father,&#8221; He reveals a unique, eternal relationship&#8212;distinct from the &#8220;our Father&#8221; taught in the Lord&#8217;s Prayer (<a href="/luke/11-2.htm">Luke 11:2</a>). This is the earliest recorded declaration of His divine Sonship.<p>&#8226; The temple was the earthly meeting place between God and man (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27-30</a>). Jesus&#8217; presence there foreshadows His role as the true Temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>) and the sole Mediator (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Luke ends his Gospel echoing this scene: after the resurrection, the disciples are &#8220;continually in the temple, praising God&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-53.htm">Luke 24:53</a>), affirming that the Father&#8217;s house remains central to the saving plan until Christ builds a living temple of believers (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/2-49.htm">Luke 2:49</a> unveils the heart of the twelve-year-old Jesus: He is conscious of His divine Sonship, compelled by the Father&#8217;s will, and perfectly at home in the place where God&#8217;s glory dwells. His gentle questions call all believers to trust the Father&#8217;s plan, recognize the necessity of obedience, and delight in the presence of God above every earthly concern.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(49) <span class= "bld">Wist ye not . . .?--</span>This is, as it were, the holy Child's defence against the implied reproach in.

The words are the first recorded utterance of the Son of Man, and they are a prophecy of that consciousness of direct Sonship, closer and more ineffable than that of any other of the sons of men, which is afterwards the dominant idea of which His whole life is a manifestation. We find in a Gospel in other respects very unlike St. John's, the germ of what there comes out so fully in such words as, <span class= "ital">"</span>My Father worketh hitherto, and I also work" (<a href="/john/5-17.htm" title="But Jesus answered them, My Father works till now, and I work.">John 5:17</a>), "I and My Father are One" (<a href="/john/10-30.htm" title="I and my Father are one.">John 10:30</a>). The words are obviously emphasised as an answer to Mary's words, "Thy father." Subject unto His parents as He had been before and was afterwards, there was a higher Fatherhood for Him than that of any earthly adoption.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 49.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How is it that ye sought me?</span> To the gently veiled reproach of Mary, Jesus replies, apparently with wonderment, with another question. It had come upon him so quietly and yet with such irresistible force that the temple of God was his real earthly home, that he marvelled at his mother's slowness of comprehension. Why should she have been surprised at his still lingering in the sacred courts? Did she not know who he was, and whence he came? Then he added, <span class="cmt_word">Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?</span> There was an expression of Mary's which evidently distressed the Child Jesus. Godet even thinks that he discerns a kind of shudder in his quick reply to Mary's "thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing." "In my Father's house, where my Father's work is being done, there ought I to be busied. Didn't you know this?" But the twelve silent uneventful years of life at Nazareth, the poor home, the village carpentry, the natural development of the sacred Child, had gradually obscured for Mary and Joseph the memories of the infancy. They had not forgotten them, but time and circumstances had covered them with a veil. Now they were very gently reminded by the Boy's own quiet words of what had happened twelve years before. Scholars hesitate whether or not to adopt the rendering of the old Syriac Version, "in my Father's house," instead of the broader and vaguer "about my Father's business," as the Greek will allow either translation. It seems to us the best to retain the old rendering we love so well, "about my Father's business." The whole spirit of Jesus' after-teaching leads us irresistibly to this interpretation of the Master's first recorded saying. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/2-49.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Why</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Ti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
