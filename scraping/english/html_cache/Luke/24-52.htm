Worship, in Jewish tradition, is reserved for God alone, highlighting their acknowledgment of Jesus as God incarnate. This act of worship fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>, where every knee shall bow to God. The disciples' worship also reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' own words in <a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23-24</a> about worshiping in spirit and truth. The Greek word used here for worship, "proskuneo," implies a deep reverence and submission, often involving physical gestures such as bowing or kneeling.<p><b>and returned to Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem holds significant theological and historical importance as the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple. It is also the city where Jesus was crucified and resurrected, making it a focal point for the early Christian community. The disciples' return to Jerusalem signifies obedience to Jesus' command in <a href="/luke/24-49.htm">Luke 24:49</a> to stay in the city until they are "clothed with power from on high." This return sets the stage for the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, as described in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, marking the birth of the Church.<p><b>with great joy</b><br>The disciples' joy contrasts with their previous sorrow and confusion following Jesus' crucifixion. This joy is rooted in the assurance of Jesus' victory over death and His promise of the Holy Spirit. It reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' words in <a href="/john/16-20.htm">John 16:20-22</a>, where He tells the disciples that their grief will turn to joy. This joy is not merely emotional but is a profound spiritual state resulting from the realization of God's redemptive plan through Christ. It also serves as a testament to the transformative power of the resurrection, which is a central theme in Christian theology.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who witnessed His ascension and responded with worship and joy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The risen Lord who ascended into heaven, fulfilling His earthly mission and promising the Holy Spirit.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city to which the disciples returned, a central place in biblical history and the early church.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ascension.htm">Ascension</a></b><br>The event where Jesus was taken up into heaven, marking the end of His physical presence on earth.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_of_olives.htm">Mount of Olives</a></b><br>The location near Bethany from where Jesus ascended, a place of significant biblical events.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/w/worship_as_a_response_to_revelation.htm">Worship as a Response to Revelation</a></b><br>The disciples' immediate response to Jesus' ascension was worship.

They bowed before the risen, glorified Lord because they now grasped fully that He is God the Son, worthy of the same honor given to the Father (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>; <a href="/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Their response echoes earlier moments when believers recognized Jesus&#8217; divine identity&#8212;such as the women at the empty tomb (<a href="/matthew/28-9.htm">Matthew 28:9-10</a>) and the gathered disciples in Galilee (<a href="/matthew/28-17.htm">Matthew 28:17</a>). Each scene reinforces that worship is the fitting reaction to Christ&#8217;s victory over death.<p>&#8226; Jesus receives their adoration without rebuke, which underscores His deity (<a href="/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-12.htm">Revelation 5:12-14</a>). Angels and prophets always deflected worship (<a href="/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>), but the Lord accepts it because He is, in truth, &#8220;Immanuel&#8212;God with us.&#8221;<p>&#8226; For us, this line points to the heart of Christian life: devotion that centers on who Jesus is, not merely what He gives. The risen Savior invites wholehearted praise, echoing <a href="/psalms/95-6.htm">Psalm 95:6</a>, &#8220;Come, let us bow down in worship.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and returned to Jerusalem with great joy</b><p>&#8226; The disciples obeyed Christ&#8217;s final instruction to wait in the city &#8220;until you are clothed with power from on high&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-49.htm">Luke 24:49</a>). Their obedience was immediate and cheerful&#8212;faith expressing itself through action (<a href="/james/2-22.htm">James 2:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Joy surged because the resurrection and ascension removed every lingering doubt. What Jesus foretold in <a href="/john/16-22.htm">John 16:22</a>&#8212;&#8220;your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away&#8221;&#8212;was now reality.<p>&#8226; This joy was forward-looking: they anticipated the promised Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4-5</a>) and the worldwide mission ahead (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). Even before Pentecost, the certainty of God&#8217;s plan filled them with gladness, much like the prophetic picture of <a href="/isaiah/55-12.htm">Isaiah 55:12</a>, &#8220;you will go out in joy and be led forth in peace.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Luke often highlights joy as the hallmark of God&#8217;s salvation (<a href="/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10</a>; 15:7, 10). Here, the disciples embody that theme&#8212;returning to the very city where fear once locked them behind doors (<a href="/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a>), now overflowing with praise (<a href="/psalms/30-11.htm">Psalm 30:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/24-52.htm">Luke 24:52</a> shows the disciples responding to Jesus&#8217; ascension with two intertwined realities: heartfelt worship that acknowledges His deity, and overflowing joy that propels obedient mission. Their example invites every believer to honor the risen Lord with the same adoration and to live in the confident, Spirit-powered gladness that flows from His finished work and unfailing promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(52) <span class= "bld">They worshipped him.</span>--These words also are absent from most of the best MSS.

They <span class="accented">knew</span> that henceforth, not for a little time as before the cross, not fitfully as since the Resurrection, but that for ever, though their eyes might not see him, would they feel his blessed presence near (see <a href="/john/14-28.htm">John 14:28</a>; <a href="/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>). One question more connected with the Ascension presses for an answer. Much modern criticism regards this last scene simply as one of the ordinary disappearances of the forty days, and declines to admit any external, visible fact in which the Ascension was manifested. But St. Luke's description. both in his Gospel and in the Acts, is plainly too circumstantial to admit of any hypothesis which limits the Ascension to a purely spiritual elevation. At the end of his earthly ministry, the evening before the cress, Jesus asked back his glory: "Now, O Father, glorify thou <span class="accented">me</span> with thine own sell, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was" (<a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>). The Ascension and consequent session at the right hand was the answer to the prayer of Christ. It was necessary for the training of the first teachers of Christianity that the great fact should be represented in some outward and visible form. "The physical elevation," writes Dr. Westcott, "was a speaking parable, an eloquent symbol, but not the truth to which it pointed, or the reality which it foreshadowed, The change which Christ revealed by the Ascension was not a change of place, but a change of state; not local, but spiritual. Still, from the necessities of our human condition, the spiritual change was represented sacramentally, so to speak, in an outward form He passed beyond the sphere of man's sensible existence to the open presence of God" ('Tim Revelation of the Risen Lord'). <span class="accented">The session at the right hand of God</span> (<a href="/mark/16-19.htm">Mark 16:19</a>) cannot designate any particular place. The ascension, then, of Jesus is not the exchange of one locality, <span class="accented">earth</span>, merely for another we term <span class="accented">heaven.</span> It is a change of state; it is a passing from all confinement within the limits of space to <span class="accented">omnipresence.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-52.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(autoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
