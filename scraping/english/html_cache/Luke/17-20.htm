Their inquiry about the kingdom of God reflects a common expectation among Jews of the time for a messianic kingdom that would restore Israel's national glory. This expectation was rooted in Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in Isaiah and Daniel, which spoke of a future reign of God. The Pharisees likely anticipated a political or military leader who would overthrow Roman rule and establish a sovereign Jewish state.<p><b>Jesus replied</b><br>Jesus often responded to questions with answers that challenged conventional thinking and revealed deeper spiritual truths. His responses were designed to provoke reflection and understanding beyond the surface level. In this instance, Jesus addresses the misconception of the kingdom of God as a physical or political entity.<p><b>The kingdom of God will not come with observable signs</b><br>Jesus emphasizes that the kingdom of God is not something that can be seen or predicted through external signs. This statement contrasts with the Jewish expectation of a visible, earthly kingdom. Instead, Jesus teaches that the kingdom is spiritual and internal, aligning with His earlier teachings in passages like <a href="/luke/13-18.htm">Luke 13:18-21</a>, where He compares the kingdom to a mustard seed and leaven, both of which grow quietly and invisibly. This concept is further supported by Jesus' declaration in <a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a> that His kingdom is not of this world. The kingdom's presence is marked by the transformation of hearts and lives, rather than by political upheaval or cosmic events.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, providing a profound teaching on the nature of God's kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for their strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

There were some who were really looking for the coming of the Messianic kingdom; there were some who altogether rejected the claim of Jesus of Nazareth to be the Christ. In the lips of the one set, the question implied a taunt; in those of the other, something like impatience. The terms of the answer contain that which met both cases.<p><span class= "bld">Cometh not with observation.</span>--The English noun exactly answers to the meaning of the Greek, as meaning careful and anxious watching. There was, perhaps, a special force in the word, as referring to the two forms of "watching" of which our Lord had been the object. Some of the Pharisees had "observed" Him once and again with a purpose more or less hostile. (Comp. <a href="/luke/6-7.htm" title="And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.">Luke 6:7</a>; <a href="/luke/14-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him.">Luke 14:1</a>; <a href="/mark/3-2.htm" title="And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.">Mark 3:2</a>; where the Greek verb is that from which the noun here used is derived.) Others were looking for some sign from heaven, to show that He was the promised Head of the Kingdom. They are told that when it comes it will not be in conjunction with any such "observation" of outward things; it would burst upon them suddenly. In the meantime they must look for the signs of its presence in quite another region. The marginal reading, "outward shew"--that which is subject to observation--though giving an adequate meaning, is rather a paraphrase than a translation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come</span>. The following discourse of the Lord in reply to the Pharisee's question, 'When cometh the kingdom? was delivered, clearly, in the closing days of the ministry, probably just before the Passover Feast, and in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem. The query was certainly not put in a friendly spirit. The questioners had evidently caught the drift of much of our Lord's late teaching, and had seen how plainly he was alluding to himself as Messiah. This seems to have been the starting-point of their bitter, impatient inquiry. We must remember that the great rabbinic schools in which these Pharisees had received their training connected the coming of Messiah with a grand revival of Jewish power. If in reality this Galilaean Rabbi, with his strange powers, his new doctrines, his scathing words of reproach which he was ever presuming to address to the leaders in Israel, - if in reality he were Messiah, when was that golden age, which the long looked-for Hope of Israel was to introduce, to commence? But the words, we can well conceive, were spoken with the bitterest irony. With what scorn those proud, rich men from Jerusalem looked on the friendless Teacher of Galilee, we know. We seem to hear the muttering which accompanied the question: "Thou our King Messiah!" The kingdom of God cometh not with observation. This answer of our Lord's may be paraphrased: "The kingdom of God cometh not in conjunction with such observation and watching for external glorious things as now exist among you here. Lo, it will burst upon you suddenly, unawares." The English word "<span class="accented">observation"</span> answers to the signification of the Greek as meaning a singularly anxious watching. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/17-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When asked</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Eper&#333;t&#275;theis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1905.htm">Strong's 1905: </a> </span><span class="str2">To interrogate, question, demand of.
