Scripture roots the scene in historical time, real people, and measurable distance, underscoring that the resurrection is not myth but fact. As they walk, Christ will meet them, proving that He still draws near to seekers on life&#8217;s road today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">And, behold, two of them.</span>--The long and singularly interesting narrative that follows is peculiar to St. Luke, and must be looked upon as among the "gleaning of the grapes," which rewarded his researches even after the full vintage had apparently been gathered in by others. The Emmaus in Galilee, about a mile from Tiberias, was famous for its medicinal warm springs (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xviii. 2, ? 3; <span class= "ital">Wars,</span> iv. 1, ? 3), and had the narrative referred to it, we might have supposed St. Luke to have visited it on that account. We have no record of any such springs in the Emmaus near Jerusalem, which is also named by Josephus (<span class= "ital">Wars, vii.</span> 6, ? 6) as at a distance of sixty <span class= "ital">stadia,</span> or furlongs, from Jerusalem. The name, however, was probably, as Josephus states (as above), significant, connected with the modern Arabic term, <span class= "ital">Hammam,</span> or <span class= "ital">Hummum, </span>for a "bath," and indicating, therefore, like the Latin "Aquae," or the French "Aix," the presence of such springs, and if so, the same hypothesis may fit in here. In the case of the Emmaus (afterwards Nicopolis), in the plain of Philistia, there was a fountain mentioned by early writers as famous for its healing powers (Euseb. <span class= "ital">Chron.</span> 41). We can hardly doubt, from the prominence given to the name of Cleopas, that he was St. Luke's informant. We are not told when the disciples started, but as it was "towards evening" when they reached Emmaus, it could not well have been before their noontide meal. The fulness with which the whole account is given may well lead us to think of it as taken down at the time from the lips of the narrator.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-35.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">meeting with the risen Jesus on the way to Emmaus.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, two of them</span>. This long piece, which relates in a singularly vivid and picturesque manner one of the earliest appearances of the Risen, is peculiar to St. Luke. St. Mark (<a href="/mark/16-12.htm">Mark 16:12, 13</a>) mentions it, but as it were only in passing. This Gospel, written probably after the Gospels of SS. Matthew and Mark, holds a middle place between the earliest apostolic memoirs represented by the first two Gospels and the last memoir, that of St. John, which was probably put out in its present form by the apostle "whom Jesus loved" some time in the last fifteen years of the first century. Writers of varied schools unite in expressions of admiration for this singularly beautiful "memory of the Lord." Godet styles it one of the most admirable pieces in St. Luke's Gospel. Renan, belonging to another, perhaps the most cheerless of all schools of religious thought, writes thus: "<span class="accented">L'episode</span> des disciples d'Emmaus est un des recits les plus fins, les plus nuances qu'il y ait duns aucune langue" ('Les Evangiles,' p. 282). Dean Plumptre speaks of "the long and singularly interesting narrative peculiar to St. Luke." He says, "It must be looked upon as among the ' gleaning of the grapes,' which rewarded his researches even after the full vintage had apparently been gathered in by others" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> SS. Matthew and Mark). The "two of them," although doubtless well known in the apostolic age, seem to have held no distinguished place in early Christian history (see note on ver. 18, where Cleopas is mentioned). <span class="cmt_word">That</span> <span class="cmt_word">same day.</span> The first day of the week - the first Easter Day. The events of the early morning of the Resurrection have been already commented upon. <span class="cmt_word">To a village called Emmaus</span>. This Emmaus, the narrative tells us, was about sixty furlongs - some six miles and a half - from the holy city. It was situated east-south-east from Jerusalem. The name is connected with the modern Arabic term <span class="accented">Hammam</span> (a bath), and indicates probably, like the Latin <span class="accented">Aquae</span>, or the French <span class="accented">Aix</span>, and the English "Bath," or "Wells," the presence of medicinal springs; and this may possibly account for St. Luke the physician's attention having in the first instance been drawn to the spot. This Emmaus is now called <span class="accented">Kulonieh. A</span> curious Talmudical reference, quoted by Godet, belongs to this place Emmaus, now Kulonieh: "At Mattza they go to gather the green boughs for the Feast of Tabernacles" (Talmud, 'Succa,' 4:5). Elsewhere it is said that "Maflza is Kulonieh." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">That</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8135;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Dative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
