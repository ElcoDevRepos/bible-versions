It is a sign of the covenant between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-16.htm">Exodus 31:16-17</a>).

We hear little of our Lord's public teaching in the synagogues of the towns and villages through which he was then passing in this his last long journey. In the earlier months of the ministry of Jesus he seems to have taught frequently in these houses of prayer, very possibly every sabbath day. It has been suggested, with considerable probability, that owing to the persistent enmity of the hierarchy and dominant class at Jerusalem, he was excluded from some at least of the synagogues by what was termed the "lesser excommunication." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/13-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[One]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Sabbath</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#940;&#946;&#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(sabbasin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Dative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4521.htm">Strong's 4521: </a> </span><span class="str2">The Sabbath, a week. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7982;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#274;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
