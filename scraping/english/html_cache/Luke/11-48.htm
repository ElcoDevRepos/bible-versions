In biblical context, the term "witnesses" implies not just observation but also a form of agreement or endorsement. The religious leaders of Jesus' time were seen as upholding the traditions and actions of their forefathers, who had rejected and killed the prophets sent by God. This reflects a recurring theme in the Bible where the people of Israel often turned away from God's messengers. The idea of being a "witness" also connects to the legal and covenantal language found throughout the Old Testament, where witnesses were crucial in establishing truth and accountability (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>).<p><b>They killed the prophets,</b><br>This phrase refers to the historical pattern of Israel rejecting and persecuting the prophets sent by God. Prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Zechariah faced severe opposition and, in some cases, were killed for their messages of repentance and return to God. This rejection is a significant theme in the Old Testament, illustrating the people's resistance to divine correction and guidance. The killing of prophets is also a foreshadowing of the ultimate rejection and crucifixion of Jesus Christ, who is seen as the greatest prophet and the fulfillment of the prophetic tradition (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>).<p><b>and you build their tombs.</b><br>Building tombs for the prophets can be seen as an act of honoring them posthumously, yet it also serves as an indictment of hypocrisy. The religious leaders of Jesus' time were outwardly venerating the prophets by constructing elaborate tombs, but their actions and attitudes mirrored those of their ancestors who had rejected the prophets' messages. This act of building tombs is symbolic of a superficial religiosity that fails to embrace the true spirit and teachings of the prophets. It underscores the disconnect between external religious practices and genuine faithfulness to God's word. This critique of hypocrisy is echoed in other parts of the Gospels, where Jesus condemns the Pharisees and scribes for their outward displays of piety that lack true righteousness (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, addressing the Pharisees and experts in the law, highlighting their hypocrisy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees_and_experts_in_the_law.htm">Pharisees and Experts in the Law</a></b><br>Religious leaders of the time who are being criticized by Jesus for their actions and attitudes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Messengers sent by God in the Old Testament, many of whom were persecuted and killed by the ancestors of the current religious leaders.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancestors/fathers.htm">Ancestors/Fathers</a></b><br>The forebears of the Pharisees and experts in the law, who were responsible for the persecution and killing of the prophets.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tombs.htm">Tombs</a></b><br>Physical structures built to honor the prophets, which ironically serve as a testament to the hypocrisy of the religious leaders.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/hypocrisy_in_religious_practice.htm">Hypocrisy in Religious Practice</a></b><br>Jesus condemns the Pharisees for outwardly honoring the prophets while inwardly sharing the same spirit of rebellion as their ancestors.
