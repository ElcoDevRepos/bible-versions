In the context of first-century Judea, crowds often gathered around teachers and miracle workers, but Jesus' ability to heal set Him apart. The act of touching is significant in Jewish culture, as it often conveyed a transfer of blessing or power. This scene echoes the desperation and faith of the woman with the issue of blood in <a href="/luke/8-43.htm">Luke 8:43-48</a>, who believed that touching Jesus' garment would heal her. The crowd's eagerness to touch Jesus underscores their recognition of His divine authority and the hope they placed in Him for physical and spiritual restoration.<p><b>because power was coming from Him</b><br>This phrase indicates the divine nature of Jesus' ministry. The power emanating from Him is a testament to His identity as the Son of God, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>, which speaks of the Messiah bearing our infirmities. The Greek word for power, "dynamis," suggests a miraculous force or ability, emphasizing that Jesus' healings were not mere acts of compassion but demonstrations of divine authority. This power is also a type of the Holy Spirit, which would later be given to the apostles and the early church, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>.<p><b>and healing them all</b><br>The comprehensive nature of Jesus' healing ministry is highlighted here. Unlike other healers of the time, Jesus healed all who came to Him, regardless of their condition or social status. This universal healing reflects the inclusive nature of the Gospel, as Jesus came to save all of humanity, not just a select few. It also fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah bringing healing and restoration, such as in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>. The healings serve as a foretaste of the ultimate healing and restoration that will occur in the Kingdom of God, as described in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in this passage, known for His miraculous healing power and divine authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Represents the multitude of people seeking healing and deliverance from Jesus, demonstrating their faith and desperation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/healing.htm">Healing</a></b><br>A significant event where Jesus' divine power is manifested through physical and spiritual restoration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_faith.htm">The Power of Faith</a></b><br>The crowd's desire to touch Jesus signifies their faith in His ability to heal.
