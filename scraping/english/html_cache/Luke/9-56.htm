This group often traveled together, emphasizing the communal aspect of Jesus' ministry. The presence of the disciples also underscores the importance of discipleship in the Christian faith, where learning and following Jesus' teachings are central.<p><b>went on to another village.</b><br>This part of the verse indicates movement and mission. Jesus' ministry was itinerant, meaning He traveled from place to place to preach the Kingdom of God. The decision to move to another village reflects Jesus' commitment to spreading His message widely, not limited to one location. This movement can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, where the Messiah is described as bringing good news to the poor and proclaiming liberty to the captives. The phrase also suggests a rejection or lack of acceptance in the previous location, which is a recurring theme in the Gospels, highlighting the varied responses to Jesus' message. This movement to another village can be seen as a strategic decision to reach more people and fulfill His mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus (Son of Man)</a></b><br>Central figure in this passage, emphasizing His mission of salvation rather than destruction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/james_and_john.htm">James and John (Disciples)</a></b><br>Known as the "Sons of Thunder," they initially suggested calling down fire from heaven on a Samaritan village that rejected Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaritan_village.htm">Samaritan Village</a></b><br>The location that refused to welcome Jesus, highlighting the tension between Jews and Samaritans.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The broader group accompanying Jesus, learning from His teachings and actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/another_village.htm">Another Village</a></b><br>Represents the continuation of Jesus' mission despite rejection, emphasizing perseverance in ministry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/m/mission_of_mercy.htm">Mission of Mercy</a></b><br>Jesus' mission is characterized by mercy and salvation, not judgment and destruction.

This entire clause is absent in a large majority of the elder authorities. On every principle of criticism it must be, if not struck out, at least marked as of doubtful authenticity. Commentators are, however, vary loth to part with the words, which breathe, as has been remarked, "a spirit far purer, loftier, and rarer than is usually discernible in ecclesiastical interpolations." They are certainly very old, as old almost as the apostolic age, being found in the Italic and Peshito, the most venerable of versions. Many, therefore, of the contemporaries of apostolic men must have read these words as a genuine utterance of our Lord<span class="cmt_word">. And they went to another village</span>. The Greek word translated "another" suggests that our Lord, after the insult offered by the Samaritans, quietly turned his steps to a Jewish community. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-56.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they went on</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#949;&#973;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eporeuth&#275;san)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4198.htm">Strong's 4198: </a> </span><span class="str2">To travel, journey, go, die. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1519.htm">Strong's 1519: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition; to or into, of place, time, or purpose; also in adverbial phrases.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">another</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7953;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(heteran)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2087.htm">Strong's 2087: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) of two: another, a second, (b) other, different, (c) one's neighbor.
