His role as a forerunner to the Messiah is emphasized in the Gospels. His ministry fulfills <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, preparing the way for the Lord. John&#8217;s response indicates his awareness of the people's expectations and his role in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>I baptize you with water:</b><br>John's baptism symbolizes repentance and purification, a common Jewish practice for ritual cleansing. It signifies a preparatory act, pointing to a deeper spiritual transformation. This baptism is external, contrasting with the internal change brought by the Messiah.<p><b>but One more powerful than I will come:</b><br>John acknowledges the superiority of the coming Messiah, highlighting the transition from his preparatory work to the fulfillment of God's promise. This statement reflects the messianic expectation prevalent among the Jews, who awaited a powerful deliverer.<p><b>the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie:</b><br>In Jewish culture, untying sandals was a task for the lowest servants. John&#8217;s humility underscores the greatness of Jesus, emphasizing the divine nature and authority of the Messiah. This humility is a model for Christian discipleship, recognizing Christ's supremacy.<p><b>He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire:</b><br>This promise points to the transformative work of Jesus, who offers a baptism that transcends the physical. The Holy Spirit represents empowerment, guidance, and the indwelling presence of God, as seen at Pentecost (Acts 2). Fire symbolizes purification and judgment, refining believers and separating the righteous from the wicked.

John humbly points beyond himself to the Messiah whose authority surpasses all. Jesus immerses the repentant in the Holy Spirit, bringing new life and ongoing purification, while His fiery judgment awaits all who refuse Him. The verse calls believers to cherish their Spirit&#8211;given transformation and to revere the Lord who alone is worthy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I indeed baptize you with water; but One mightier than I cometh.</span> To refute this growing conviction that he was the Messiah, John tells the people plainly tidal Another far greater than he was coming. He, John, certainly washed (baptized) those who came to him, but his washing was merely symbolical - <span class="accented">it</span> could not purify them; his work had been to stir them up to repentance, to arouse them to change their lives. But the One who was coming, before whom he (John) was unworthy to stand and perform the humblest menial office, that great One should baptize too, but his baptism would be a very different thing. <span class="cmt_word">He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost</span>. There was, indeed, a difference between John's baptism and the baptism of the Messiah who was to come after him. John could do no more with his words and symbol baptism than rouse the people to struggle after repentance and a change of heart and life, while Messiah would furnish to men the influence from above, that was really needed in order to purity of heart and life. He would procure and pour out the influence of the Divine Spirit (see Dr. Morrison, <a href="/mark/1-8.htm">Mark 1:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And with fire</span>. Not with <span class="accented">punitive</span> fire, which interpretation would be quite alien from the context here. Those expositors who have adopted this meaning of the fire here have been most likely influenced by the mention of the unquenchable fire in the next sentence. The fire which was to enter into Messiah's baptism was rather <span class="accented">the flame of purification</span>. So we read of the coal of fire taken from off the altar and laid on the mouth of Isaiah the prophet (<a href="/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6, 7</a>).
