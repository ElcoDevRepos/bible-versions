Parables are simple stories used to illustrate a moral or spiritual lesson. Jesus often used them to reveal truths to those who were open to understanding while concealing them from those who were not receptive. This particular parable is unique to Luke's Gospel, emphasizing the importance of prayer and perseverance.<p><b>about their need to pray at all times</b><br>Prayer is a central theme in the teachings of Jesus, and this phrase underscores the necessity of constant communication with God. The idea of praying "at all times" suggests a lifestyle of prayer, not limited to specific times or places. This aligns with Paul's exhortation in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a> to "pray without ceasing." The cultural context of the time included set times for prayer, but Jesus is advocating for a more continuous and personal relationship with God.<p><b>and not lose heart:</b><br>The phrase "not lose heart" addresses the human tendency to become discouraged, especially when prayers seem unanswered. In the historical context, the Jewish people were under Roman occupation, and many were longing for deliverance. Jesus encourages persistence in prayer, reflecting the belief that God is faithful and will respond in His timing. This teaching is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>, which encourages believers not to grow weary in doing good. The call to perseverance in prayer is a reminder of the hope and trust believers should have in God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples about the importance of persistent prayer.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who are called to a life of prayer.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/parable.htm">Parable</a></b><br>A teaching method used by Jesus to convey spiritual truths through simple accounts or analogies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_persistent_prayer.htm">The Necessity of Persistent Prayer</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes the need for continual prayer, indicating that it should be a regular part of a believer's life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/do_not_lose_heart.htm">Do Not Lose Heart</a></b><br>The encouragement to not lose heart suggests that prayer requires perseverance, especially when answers are delayed.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_timing.htm">Faith in God's Timing</a></b><br>Trusting in God's perfect timing is crucial, as persistent prayer builds faith and reliance on Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_as_a_relationship_builder.htm">Prayer as a Relationship Builder</a></b><br>Persistent prayer fosters a deeper relationship with God, aligning our hearts with His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_in_community.htm">Encouragement in Community</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to support one another in prayer, strengthening the community of faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_18_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 18:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_18_1_s_lesson_on_persistent_prayer.htm">How does Luke 18:1 encourage persistent prayer in our daily lives?

The whole verse is remarkable as being one of the few instances (<a href="/luke/18-9.htm" title="And he spoke this parable to certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:">Luke 18:9</a> being another) in which a parable is introduced by a distinct statement as to its drift and aim. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-14.</span> - <span class="accented">The Lord speaks the two parables on prayer</span> - <span class="accented">the importunate widow, and the Pharisee and publican.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint</span>.

Indeed, the connection between the first of the two parables, which urges restless continued prayer, and the picture which the Lord had just drawn of men's state of utter forgetfulness of God, is obvious. "The Son of man has been rejected; he has gone from view; the masses are plunged in gross worldliness; men of God are become as rare as, in the days of Abraham, they were in Sodom. What, then, is the position of the Church? That of a widow whose only weapon is incessant prayer. It is only by means of this intense concentration that faith will be preserved. But such is precisely the disposition which Jesus fears may not be found even in the Church at his return" (Godet). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/18-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] told</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7964;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Elegen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
