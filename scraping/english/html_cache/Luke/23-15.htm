Herod's involvement in Jesus' trial highlights the political complexities of the time, as Herod was a client king under Roman authority. Herod's lack of a guilty verdict aligns with the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, which speaks of the innocence of the suffering servant. This phrase also underscores the fulfillment of <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a>, where rulers conspire against the Lord's anointed, yet find no fault in Him.<p><b>for he sent Him back to us</b><br>Herod's decision to send Jesus back to Pilate indicates his reluctance to take responsibility for Jesus' fate. This act reflects the political maneuvering typical of Roman and Jewish leaders, who often sought to maintain power without inciting unrest. The return to Pilate signifies the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy about His suffering and death at the hands of both Jewish and Gentile authorities (<a href="/luke/18-32.htm">Luke 18:32-33</a>). It also illustrates the fulfillment of <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, where the Messiah is surrounded by those who mock and reject Him.<p><b>As you can see</b><br>Pilate's statement to the crowd emphasizes the transparency of the trial proceedings. It suggests that the evidence presented was insufficient to warrant a death sentence. This phrase highlights the public nature of Jesus' trial, which was conducted in front of many witnesses, fulfilling the legal requirements of the time. It also points to the broader theme of Jesus' innocence, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>, which states that He committed no sin.<p><b>He has done nothing deserving of death</b><br>This declaration of Jesus' innocence is crucial, as it fulfills the Old Testament requirement for a spotless sacrifice (<a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>). Jesus, the Lamb of God, is without blemish, making Him the perfect atonement for sin. The statement also connects to <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, which prophesies that the suffering servant would be without deceit or violence. Pilate's acknowledgment of Jesus' innocence underscores the injustice of His crucifixion and highlights the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan through the death of His Son.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_antipas.htm">Herod Antipas</a></b><br>The tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, who was involved in the trial of Jesus.
