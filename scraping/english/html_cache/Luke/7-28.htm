It emphasizes the importance of the statement that follows. Jesus often used this phrase to introduce significant teachings or truths, underscoring His role as a teacher and prophet.<p><b>among those born of women</b><br>This expression is a Semitic idiom referring to all human beings. It highlights the humanity of John the Baptist, placing him within the context of human history and experience. The phrase underscores the natural birth process, contrasting it with spiritual rebirth.<p><b>there is no one greater than John,</b><br>John the Baptist is acknowledged as the greatest among those born of women, signifying his unique role as the forerunner of Christ. His greatness is tied to his prophetic office and his mission to prepare the way for Jesus, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>. John's life of asceticism and his bold proclamation of repentance set him apart as a pivotal figure in salvation history.<p><b>yet even the least in the kingdom of God</b><br>This phrase introduces a paradox, contrasting the greatness of John with the status of those in the kingdom of God. The "kingdom of God" refers to the reign of God inaugurated by Jesus, which is both a present reality and a future hope. The least in this kingdom are those who have accepted Christ and are part of the new covenant community.<p><b>is greater than he.&#8221;</b><br>This statement highlights the transformative power of the kingdom of God. It suggests that the spiritual status of believers in the kingdom surpasses even the greatest of the old covenant prophets. This reflects the new relationship with God made possible through Jesus' life, death, and resurrection, as seen in passages like <a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>.

These striking words close the Master's splendid testimony to the great pioneer. The usual explanation adopted by most if not all modern theologians of the last clause of the verse is, <span class="accented">that</span>, great as John was, yet he that is least among Christians who have been <span class="accented">born of God</span> and have accepted as an article of their faith the crucifixion and ascension of the Son of God, is greater than that great prophet; or, in other words, the humblest child of the new kingdom is superior to the greatest prophet of the old. But many of the wisest and best of the Fathers of the Church - amongst others Chrysostom, Augustine, Hilary, and Theophylact - find grave difficulty in accepting this too sweeping and facile explanation of a hard saying. They suggest what seems to the writer of this Exposition a more reverential meaning to the Lord's words here. By "the least" we prefer, then, with Chrysostom and other ancient Fathers, to understand <span class="accented">Jesus himself.</span> The literal meaning of the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is "the lesser," not "least" (in the Revised Version, in the text we find "he that is but little," but in the margin "lesser"). By "lesser" or "little" Chrysostom supposes that the Saviour refers to himself as <span class="accented">less than John in age and according to the opinions of many.</span> "Thus, then, among the sons of men no prophet greater than John the Baptist has arisen; yet there is one among you lesser in age and perhaps in public estimation, - in the kingdom of God, though, greater than he." Wordsworth strengthens the above interpretation by his comment on the words, "among those that are born of women." "No one among those born of human parents had appeared greater than this John the Baptist; but do not suppose that he is greater than I. I am not <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, and though after him in the gospel because he is my precursor, yet I am greater than he." This great expositor, while on the whole preferring the usual interpretation, yet considers that the explanation which refers "he that is least" to Christ, is not lightly to be set aside. If this interpretation be adopted, the usual punctuation of the passage must be slightly altered thus: "He that is lesser, in the kingdom of God is greater than he." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/7-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I tell</span><br /><span class="grk">&#923;&#941;&#947;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(Leg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
