Jesus had just crossed the Sea of Galilee, demonstrating His authority over nature by calming a storm (<a href="/luke/8-22.htm">Luke 8:22-25</a>). His arrival on the shore signifies His readiness to confront spiritual forces, showcasing His divine authority over both the natural and supernatural realms. The act of stepping ashore can be seen as a deliberate move into Gentile territory, as this region was predominantly non-Jewish, highlighting the universal scope of Jesus' mission.<p><b>He was met by a demon-possessed man from the town</b><br>The immediate confrontation with a demon-possessed man underscores the spiritual warfare theme prevalent in the Gospels. This man, coming from the town, indicates that he was once part of the community but had been ostracized due to his condition. Demon possession in biblical times was often associated with severe physical and mental afflictions, and this encounter illustrates the destructive power of evil. The presence of demons also points to the reality of spiritual beings opposed to God's kingdom, a theme consistent throughout Scripture (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p><b>For a long time this man had not worn clothing or lived in a house</b><br>The man's lack of clothing and homelessness are indicative of his complete alienation and the dehumanizing effect of demonic possession. In Jewish culture, nakedness was often associated with shame and disgrace (<a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>, <a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2-4</a>). His condition reflects the total control the demons had over him, stripping him of dignity and community. This detail emphasizes the depth of his suffering and the transformative power of Jesus' impending intervention.<p><b>but he stayed in the tombs</b><br>Living among the tombs highlights the man's isolation and the severity of his condition. Tombs were considered unclean places according to Jewish law (<a href="/numbers/19-16.htm">Numbers 19:16</a>), and residing there would have made him ritually impure. This setting underscores the man's separation from society and the living, symbolizing spiritual death. The tombs also serve as a stark backdrop for Jesus' power over death and the forces of darkness, foreshadowing His ultimate victory through His own death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of God.

It is as though he had taken pains to inquire whether this case of frenzied insanity had presented the phenomenon with which his experience as a physician had made him familiar in others.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There met him out of the city a certain man</span>; better rendered, <span class="accented">there met him a man of the city.</span> He had been a dweller in Gergesa in old days before the terrible possession began. St. Matthew, in his account, tells us of two demoniacs. SS, Mark and <span class="accented">Luke</span>, however, both only mention one, the other for some reason or other had passed out of their thoughts - possibly the malady was much less severe, and the strange dialogue and its results had not taken place in his case. <span class="cmt_word">Which had devils long time</span>; better, <span class="accented">daemons</span> (<span class="accented">daimonia</span>). One of the current Jewish traditions was that these evil spirits were not fallen angels, but the spirits of wicked men who were dead (see Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 7:06. 3). The plural form "devils" - bitterly referred to later by the sufferer, when he was asked his name - seems in his case to speak of a very aggravated form of the awful malady. <span class="cmt_word">And ware no clothes, neither abode in any</span> <span class="cmt_word">house</span>. These were no uncommon features of the soul-malady - the horror at any bodily restraint, either connected with clothes or dwellings; a similar shrinking is not unusual even in the comparatively modified modern phases of madness. <span class="cmt_word">But in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the tombs.</span> Until the teaching and spirit of Jesus had suggested, even among men who had no faith in his Name, some thought and consideration for the helpless sufferers of humanity, neither hospital, nor home, nor asylum existed where these unhappy ones could find a refuge. In these gloomy tombs hollowed out of the rock on the mountain-side - polluted spots for the living, according to the Jewish ritual - these maniacs found the utter solitude they craved for. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
