The act of calling in the manager reflects the divine summons for accountability. This mirrors the biblical theme of stewardship, where individuals are called to account for their actions and management of God's resources (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).<p><b>&#8216;What is this I hear about you?</b><br>This phrase indicates that the rich man has received reports or accusations about the manager's conduct. In biblical times, reputation and word-of-mouth were crucial, as they often determined one's standing in the community. This reflects the omniscience of God, who is aware of all actions and intentions (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p><b>Turn in an account of your management</b><br>The demand for an account signifies a time of judgment and evaluation. In the cultural context, stewards were expected to maintain detailed records of their transactions. This parallels the biblical teaching that believers will give an account of their lives and stewardship before God (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>).<p><b>for you cannot be manager any longer.</b><br>The removal of the manager from his position signifies the consequences of mismanagement and unfaithfulness. This serves as a warning about the seriousness of stewardship and the potential loss of privilege and responsibility due to unfaithfulness. It echoes the biblical principle that those who are unfaithful with little will not be entrusted with more (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10-12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rich_man.htm">The Rich Man</a></b><br>Represents God or a figure of authority who holds others accountable for their stewardship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_manager.htm">The Manager</a></b><br>Symbolizes believers or individuals entrusted with responsibilities and resources.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_accusation.htm">The Accusation</a></b><br>The manager is accused of wasting the rich man's possessions, prompting an audit of his management.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_account.htm">The Call to Account</a></b><br>The rich man demands an account of the manager's stewardship, signifying a moment of judgment or evaluation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dismissal.htm">The Dismissal</a></b><br>The manager faces the consequence of losing his position, highlighting the seriousness of mismanagement.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability_before_god.htm">Accountability Before God</a></b><br>Every believer is accountable to God for how they manage their time, talents, and resources.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_stewardship.htm">Faithful Stewardship</a></b><br>God expects us to be faithful stewards of what He has entrusted to us, using it for His glory and purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_mismanagement.htm">Consequences of Mismanagement</a></b><br>Mismanagement of God-given resources can lead to loss of opportunities and blessings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/self-examination.htm">Self-Examination</a></b><br>Regular self-examination and reflection on our stewardship can help us align with God's expectations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_judgment.htm">Preparation for Judgment</a></b><br>Believers should live with the awareness that they will one day give an account to God, motivating them to live righteously.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_16_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 16:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_16_2_Accountability_in_stewardship.htm">How does Luke 16:2 challenge us to be accountable in our stewardship?

Faithfulness today secures continued trust and future reward; neglect invites loss.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">How is it that I hear this of thee?</span>--(1) The opening words of the steward's master imply wonder as well as indignation. They remind us so far of the words of the lord of the vineyard in another parable, "Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?" (<a href="/isaiah/5-4.htm" title="What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? why, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?">Isaiah 5:4</a>). Speaking after the manner of men, it was a marvel and a mystery that men with so high a calling as the scribes and teachers of Israel should have proved so unfaithful to their trust. (2) The words that follow, "Give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward," while they admit legitimately enough a personal application to each individual at the close of any period of trust and probation, and therefore at the close of life, are yet far from being limited to that application, and in their primary significance, do not even admit it. The close of a stewardship, for a party like the Pharisees--for a school like that of the scribes--for any Church or section of a Church--is when its day of judgment comes, when its work in the Kingdom is done, when history, and God in history, pass their sentence upon it. And that day of judgment was coming fast upon those who then heard the parable.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/16-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">he called</span><br /><span class="grk">&#966;&#969;&#957;&#942;&#963;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(ph&#333;n&#275;sas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5455.htm">Strong's 5455: </a> </span><span class="str2">From phone; to emit a sound; by implication, to address in words or by name, also in imitation.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">him in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(auton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
