The context is the night of Jesus' arrest, following the Last Supper. The disciples, having been warned by Jesus of His impending betrayal and arrest, are now witnessing the arrival of the crowd led by Judas. This moment fulfills Jesus' earlier predictions about His suffering (<a href="/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22, 18</a>:31-33). The garden setting is significant, as Gethsemane, located on the Mount of Olives, was a place Jesus often visited with His disciples (<a href="/john/18-2.htm">John 18:2</a>). The disciples' awareness of the situation reflects their growing understanding of the gravity of the events unfolding, though they still lack full comprehension of Jesus' mission.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Lord, should we strike with our swords?&#8221;</b><br>The disciples' question reveals their instinct to defend Jesus using physical force. This reflects a common misunderstanding of the nature of Jesus' kingdom, which is not of this world (<a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>). The mention of swords connects to an earlier conversation where Jesus instructed them to buy swords (<a href="/luke/22-36.htm">Luke 22:36-38</a>), which was likely metaphorical, emphasizing preparedness for spiritual challenges rather than physical combat. The disciples' readiness to fight contrasts with Jesus' mission of peace and submission to God's will. This moment also highlights the tension between human impulses and divine purposes, as Jesus' path to the cross involves non-violence and sacrificial love, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, where the Messiah is described as a lamb led to slaughter without resistance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, the Son of God, who is about to be arrested.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are present with Him in the Garden of Gethsemane.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/garden_of_gethsemane.htm">Garden of Gethsemane</a></b><br>The location where Jesus is praying and where His arrest takes place.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_arresting_party.htm">The Arresting Party</a></b><br>A group consisting of chief priests, officers of the temple guard, and elders who come to arrest Jesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sword.htm">The Sword</a></b><br>Represents the disciples' readiness to defend Jesus physically, highlighting their misunderstanding of His mission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_jesus'_mission.htm">Understanding Jesus' Mission</a></b><br>Jesus' mission was not to establish an earthly kingdom through violence but to bring spiritual salvation.
