The term "tetrarch" refers to a ruler of a fourth part of a region, a title given by the Romans. Herod was the son of Herod the Great, who was known for his role in the events surrounding the birth of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/2.htm">Matthew 2:1-16</a>). The happenings Herod heard about included the miracles and teachings of Jesus, which were spreading rapidly throughout the region. This reflects the growing influence of Jesus' ministry and the concern it caused among political leaders.<p><b>he was perplexed</b><br>Herod's perplexity indicates his confusion and anxiety over the reports of Jesus' activities. This reaction is significant as it shows the impact of Jesus' ministry on the political and social structures of the time. Herod's perplexity may also stem from his guilty conscience regarding his role in the execution of John the Baptist, as he feared a supernatural consequence or uprising.<p><b>For some were saying that John had risen from the dead</b><br>The belief that John the Baptist had risen from the dead highlights the widespread recognition of John's prophetic ministry and the fear it instilled in Herod. John was a significant figure, calling for repentance and preparing the way for Jesus (<a href="/mark/1-2.htm">Mark 1:2-4</a>). The idea of resurrection was not foreign to Jewish thought, as seen in the Pharisees' belief in the resurrection (<a href="/acts/23-8.htm">Acts 23:8</a>). This rumor reflects the people's attempt to understand Jesus' miraculous powers by associating them with a known prophet. It also foreshadows the resurrection of Jesus, a central tenet of Christian faith, and underscores the theme of life overcoming death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_the_tetrarch.htm">Herod the Tetrarch</a></b><br>Herod Antipas, son of Herod the Great, ruled over Galilee and Perea.

This was Herod Antipas; he was a son of Herod the Great; his mother's name was Malthace. After his father's death he became tetrareh or prince-ruler of Galilee, Peraea, and of a fourth part of the Roman province of Syria. His first wife was daughter of Aretas, a famous Arabian sheik spoken of by St. Paul as "king of the Damascenes" (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-32.htm">2 Corinthians 11:32</a>). This princess he divorced, and contracted a marriage at once incestuous and adulterous with his niece Herodias, the beautiful wife of his half-brother Philip. Philip was not a sovereign prince, and it was probably from motives of ambition that she deserted Philip for the powerful tetrarch Herod Antipas. It was owing to his fearless remonstrances against this wicked marriage that John the Baptist incurred the enmity of Herodias, who was only satisfied with the head of the daring preacher who presumed to attack her brilliant wicked life. What Herod now heard was the report of the widespread interest suddenly aroused by the mission of the twelve - a mission, we know, supported by miraculous powers, following close upon the Galilaean ministry of the Lord, which, as far as regarded the numbers who thronged his meetings, and the outward interest his words and works excited, had been so successful. Rumours of all this at last reached the court circle, wrapped up in its own selfish and often wanton pleasures and false excitement. <span class="cmt_word">Because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead.</span> Herod Antipas was probably inclined to the Sadducee creed, which believed in neither angel nor spirit. But Sadduceeism and the easy doctrines of Epicurus, which no doubt found favour in the luxurious palace of Herod, are but a flimsy protection at best against the ghastly reminiscences and the weird forebodings of a guilty conscience. The murder of John had been, Herod knew, strongly condemned by the public voice. He would not believe it was his old monitor risen, but vet the prince was anxious and perturbed in his mind. The murmur that the great prophet was Elias (Elijah) disquieted him, too. Herod could not help recalling to his mind the lifelong combat of that great and austere servant of God against another wicked sovereign and his queen, Ahab and Jezebel, whose great crime was that <span class="accented">they</span>, too, had slain the Lord's prophets. That history, Herod felt, had to some extent been reproduced by himself and Herodias. There was a rooted expectation among the Jews that Elijah would reappear again on earth, and that his appearance would herald the advent of the Messiah.
