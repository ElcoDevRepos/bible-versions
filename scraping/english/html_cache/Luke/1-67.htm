His role as a priest places him in a position of spiritual authority and knowledge of the Scriptures. His experience in the temple, where he was struck mute for doubting the angel's message, highlights the importance of faith and obedience. Zechariah's lineage connects him to the priestly traditions of Israel, emphasizing the fulfillment of God's promises through his family.<p><b>was filled with the Holy Spirit</b><br>The filling of the Holy Spirit signifies divine inspiration and empowerment. In the Old Testament, the Holy Spirit would come upon individuals for specific purposes, such as prophecy or leadership. This moment marks a transition to the New Testament era, where the Holy Spirit plays a central role in the lives of believers. Zechariah's filling is reminiscent of the prophets of old, who spoke God's truth under the Spirit's influence.<p><b>and prophesied:</b><br>Prophecy in the biblical sense involves speaking forth God's message, often with a focus on future events or divine truths. Zechariah's prophecy is a declaration of God's redemptive plan, highlighting the coming of the Messiah and the role of his son, John, in preparing the way. This act of prophecy connects Zechariah to the prophetic tradition of Israel, where God communicated His will through chosen individuals. The content of his prophecy, which follows in the subsequent verses, aligns with Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah and the salvation of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A priest from the division of Abijah, husband to Elizabeth, and father of John the Baptist.

The hymn that follows appears as the report, written, probably, by Zachariah himself, of the praises that had been uttered in the first moments of his recovered gift of speech. As such, we may think of it as expressing the pent-up thoughts of the months of silence.

The inspired hymn which follows - thought out, no doubt, with the Holy Spirit's help in the course of the long enforced seclusion which his first want of faith had brought upon him - holds a prominent place in all Western liturgics. Like the Magnificat, it is believed to have been first introduced into the public worship of the Church about the middle of the sixth century by St. Csesarius of Aries. It may be briefly summarized as a thanksgiving for the arrival of the times of Messiah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/1-67.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">his</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
