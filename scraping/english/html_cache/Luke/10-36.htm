In the cultural and religious context of first-century Judea, priests and Levites were respected religious figures, while Samaritans were often despised by Jews due to historical and theological differences. The question challenges the listener to reconsider preconceived notions of righteousness and neighborliness.<p><b>do you think</b><br>This phrase invites personal reflection and judgment. It emphasizes the importance of individual discernment and moral reasoning. The question is posed to the expert in the law, encouraging him to engage with the parable on a deeper level and to apply its lessons to his own understanding of the law.<p><b>was a neighbor</b><br>The concept of "neighbor" is central to the parable and to Jesus' teaching. In Jewish law, a neighbor was traditionally understood as a fellow Israelite. However, Jesus expands this definition to include anyone in need, regardless of ethnic or religious boundaries. This redefinition aligns with the broader biblical theme of love and compassion for all people, as seen in passages like <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a> and <a href="/matthew/5-43.htm">Matthew 5:43-44</a>.<p><b>to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?&#8221;</b><br>This phrase describes the victim of the parable, who was attacked while traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho, a route known for its danger due to rough terrain and frequent robberies. The man's plight highlights the vulnerability and need for compassion in a world marked by sin and violence. The parable underscores the call to act mercifully, as seen in other scriptural teachings such as <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a> and <a href="/james/2-13.htm">James 2:13</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The teacher and central figure in the Gospel of Luke, who is sharing the parable of the Good Samaritan to illustrate the concept of true neighborly love.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lawyer.htm">The Lawyer</a></b><br>A Jewish expert in the Law who questions Jesus, seeking to test Him and justify himself by asking, "And who is my neighbor?"<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_good_samaritan.htm">The Good Samaritan</a></b><br>A character in Jesus' parable who shows compassion and mercy to a wounded man, contrasting with the actions of the priest and the Levite.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest_and_the_levite.htm">The Priest and the Levite</a></b><br>Religious figures in the parable who pass by the injured man without offering help, representing a failure to live out the Law's command to love one's neighbor.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wounded_man.htm">The Wounded Man</a></b><br>A victim of robbery and violence, left for dead, whose plight becomes the focal point for Jesus' teaching on mercy and compassion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_true_neighborliness.htm">Understanding True Neighborliness</a></b><br>The parable challenges us to redefine who our neighbor is, extending beyond cultural and religious boundaries to include anyone in need.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_over_ritual.htm">Compassion Over Ritual</a></b><br>The actions of the Good Samaritan demonstrate that genuine love and compassion take precedence over religious rituals and social norms.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_love_in_action.htm">Active Love in Action</a></b><br>The parable calls believers to not only feel compassion but to act on it, providing practical help to those in distress.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/breaking_down_prejudices.htm">Breaking Down Prejudices</a></b><br>The Samaritan's actions encourage us to overcome prejudices and biases, showing love to all people regardless of their background.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_christ's_love.htm">Reflecting Christ's Love</a></b><br>As followers of Christ, we are called to reflect His love and mercy in our interactions, serving as His hands and feet in the world.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_10_36_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 10:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Luke_10_36_redefine_neighbor.htm">How does Luke 10:36 challenge us to redefine who our "neighbor" is?

The point under discussion was as to whom the Jew should look on as his neighbour. It is answered indirectly by the narrative, which showed who had proved himself a neighbour to the Jew. The Samaritan had shown himself a better interpreter of the commandment than the orthodox scribe. He had recognised a neighbour even in the Jew. The Jew therefore should recognise a neighbour even in the Samaritan. From the human point of view there is something noble in the manner in which our Lord thus singles out the Samaritan as a type of excellence, after His own recent repulse (<a href="/luke/9-53.htm" title="And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.">Luke 9:53</a>) by men of the same race; something also courageous in His doing so after He had been recently reproached as being Himself a Samaritan (<a href="/john/8-48.htm" title="Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that you are a Samaritan, and have a devil?">John 8:48</a>). It may be noted that His journey, "as it were in secret" (<a href="/john/7-10.htm" title="But when his brothers were gone up, then went he also up to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.">John 7:10</a>), to the Feast of Tabernacles, must have probably led Him through Samaria, and that in all probability He must have spent the first day of the Feast in that country. (See Note on <a href="/john/8-48.htm" title="Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that you are a Samaritan, and have a devil?">John 8:48</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 36, 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?</span> And he said, He that showed mercy on him. The deep pathos of the little story, the meaning of which the trained-scholar mind of the lawyer at once grasped, went right home to the ]mart. The Jewish scribe, in spite of prejudice and jealousy, was too noble not to confess that the Galilaean Master's estimate of a neighbour was the true one, and the estimate of the Jerusalem schools the wrong one; so at once he replies, "He <span class="accented">that showed mercy on him."</span> Even then, in that hour of the noblest confession his lips had ever made, the lawyer trained in those strange and mistaken schools, the outcome of which is the Talmud, could not force himself to name the hated Samaritan name, but paraphrases it in this titan. The scene closes with the Lord's charge, "Then imitate <span class="accented">that</span> act." <span class="cmt_word">Go, and do thou likewise</span>. The parable thus answers the question - Who is my neighbour? Any one, it replies, who needs help, and whom I have power and opportunity to help, no matter what his rank, race, or religion may be. Neighbourhood is made coextensive with humanity; any human being is my neighbour who needs aid, or to whom I can render aid. But it answers the other and the still larger and deeper question with which the scene which called the parable out began. "Master," asked the lawyer (ver. 25), "what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" Or in other words, "What is the virtue which saves?" The Scriptures teach that without holiness no one shall see the Lord, that is, shall inherit eternal life; and in this parable two kinds of holiness are set before us - the one spurious, the other genuine. The spurious holiness is that of the priest and Levite, two officially holy persons; - spurious holiness is sanctity divorced from charity. In the person of the Samaritan the nature of true sanctity is exhibited; - we are taught that the way to please God, the way to genuine holiness, is the practice of charity. Another and a very different exposition of this great and loving parable treats it as a Divine allegory. It commends itself to the present generation less than the plain matter-of-fact exegesis adopted in the foregoing notes. In the allegory, the wounded traveller represents mankind at large, stripped by the devil and his angels; he is left by them grievously wounded, yet not dead outright. Priest and Levite were alike powerless to help. "Many passed us by," once wrote a devout mediaeval writer, "and there was none to save." Moses and his Law, Aaron and his sacrifices, patriarch, prophet, and priest, - these were powerless. Only the true Samaritan (Christ), beholding, was moved with compassion and poured oil into the wounds. Among the ancients, Chrysostom and Clement of Alexandria and Augustine might be cited as good examples of these allegorical expositors. Among mediaeval Churchmen, Bernard and his devout school. Although this method of exposition has not been adopted here, still an exegesis which has commended itself so heartily to learned and devout Churchmen in all the Christian ages deserves at least a more respectful mention than the scornful allusion or the contemptuous silence with which it is nowadays too often dismissed. Godet, for instance, describes this allegorical interpretation adopted by the Fathers as rivalling that of the Gnostics. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/10-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Which</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
