It is a sign of the covenant between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-16.htm">Exodus 31:16-17</a>). Observing the Sabbath was central to Jewish identity and religious practice. The Pharisees had developed extensive traditions regarding what constituted work on the Sabbath, often leading to legalistic interpretations.<p><b>Jesus was passing through the grainfields</b><br>This setting indicates a rural area, likely in Galilee, where Jesus conducted much of His ministry. Grainfields were common in this region, and the act of walking through them suggests a journey between towns or villages. Jesus often used such settings to teach His disciples and engage with the people.<p><b>and His disciples began to pick the heads of grain</b><br>According to <a href="/deuteronomy/23-25.htm">Deuteronomy 23:25</a>, it was permissible for travelers to pick grain by hand from a neighbor's field to satisfy immediate hunger, but not to harvest it with a sickle. This action was not theft but an exercise of a provision in the Law for the needy and travelers.<p><b>rub them in their hands</b><br>This act of rubbing the grain heads was necessary to separate the edible kernels from the chaff. It was a simple, everyday task, but according to Pharisaic interpretation, it could be considered threshing, which was classified as work and thus prohibited on the Sabbath.<p><b>and eat them</b><br>The disciples' eating of the grain highlights their immediate need for sustenance. This act of eating on the Sabbath became a point of contention with the Pharisees, who accused them of breaking the Sabbath law.

Its employment by St. Luke may be noted as indicating his wish to be accurate as an historian. He sought to gather, as far as he could, definite dates; and hearing, in the course of his inquiries, of this, as fixing the time of what followed, inserted it in his record.<p>It may be noted that the facts of the case fix limits on either side. The corn was ripe enough to be rubbed in the hands, and yield its grain. It had not yet been gathered. It could not therefore be much earlier than the Passover, when the barley harvest began, and not much later than the Pentecost, when the wheat was ripe. If it preceded, as it appears to have done (see <a href="/luke/9-12.htm" title="And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said to him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.">Luke 9:12</a>), the feeding of the Five Thousand, it must have been before the Passover (<a href="/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a>). The conjectures, such as they are, are as follows:--<p>(1.) The <span class= "ital">first</span> Sabbath of the <span class= "ital">second</span> month of the year, taking Nisan (in which the Passover occurred) as the first month.<p>(2.) The <span class= "ital">first</span> Sabbath after the <span class= "ital">second</span> day of the Passover, that day being itself kept as a supplementary feast.<p>(3.) The <span class= "ital">first</span> Sabbath in the <span class= "ital">second</span> year of the sabbatic cycle of seven years.<p>(4.) As the Jewish year had two beginnings, one (the civil) reckoning from the month Tisri (including part of September and October); the other (the ecclesiastical) from Nisan, it has been supposed that the first Sabbath in Tisri was called <span class= "ital">first-first,</span> the first in Nisan <span class= "ital">second-first.</span><p>(5.) The Sabbath in the Pentecostal week, the <span class= "ital">second chief</span> or <span class= "ital">first</span> Sabbath, as that in the Passover week was the first. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> <span class="accented">- The Lord's teaching on the question of the observance of the sabbath.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first</span>. The expression accompanying this note of time of St. Luke, "the second sabbath after the first," more literally, "the second-first sabbath," has always been a difficulty with expositors of this Gospel. The word is absolutely unique, and is found in no other Greek author. Recent investigations in the text of the New Testament have proved that this word is not found in the majority of the more ancient authorities. Of the modern critical editors, Alford and Lachmann enclose the disputed word in brackets; Tregelles and Meyer omit it altogether; but the Revisers of the English Version relegate it to the margin in its literal form, "second-first;" Tischendorf alone admits it in his text. The question is of interest to the antiquarian, but scarcely of any to the theologian. It was, perhaps, introduced at an early date into many of the manuscripts of St. Luke, owing to some copyist writing n the margin of his parchment in this place "first" to distinguish <span class="accented">this</span> sabbath and its scene from the <span class="accented">other</span> sabbath alluded to four verses further on; "second" was not unlikely to have been written in correction of "first" by some other copyist using the manuscript, thinking it better thus to distinguish this from the sabbath alluded to in <a href="/luke/4-31.htm">Luke 4:31</a>; and thus the two corrections may have got confused in many of the primitive copies. It can scarcely be imagined, if it really formed part of the original work of St. Luke, that so remarkable a word could ever have dropped out of the text of the most ancient and trustworthy authorities. Supposing it to have been a part of the original writing, scholars have suggested many explanations. Of these the simplest and most satisfactory are: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The first sabbath of each of the seven years which made a sabbatic cycle was called first, second, third, etc., sabbath. Thus the "second-first" sabbath would signify the first sabbath of the second year of the seven-years' cycle. This is Wieseler's theory. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The civil year of the Jews began in autumn about mid-September to mid-October (month Tisri), and the ecclesiastical year in spring, about mid-March to mid-April (month Nisan). Thus there were every year two first sabbaths - one at the commencement of the civil year, which would be called '<span class="accented">first-first</span>;' the other at the beginning of the ecclesiastical year, which would be called '<span class="accented">second-first.</span> The period here alluded to by St. Luke would perfectly agree with either of these explanations. The latter theory was suggested by Louis Cappel, and is quoted with approval by Godet. <span class="cmt_word">And his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands</span>. St. Matthew adds here that they "were an hungred." This they might well have been in following the Master in his teaching in different places, even though some of their homes were nigh at hand. We have no need to introduce the question of their poverty - which, in the case of several of them at least, we know did not exist - here leading them to this method of satisfying their hunger. They had probably been out for some hours with Jesus without breaking their fast, and, finding themselves in a field of ripe corn, took this easy, present means of gratifying a natural want.
