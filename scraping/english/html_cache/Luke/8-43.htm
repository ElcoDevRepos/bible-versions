This would have isolated her socially and religiously, as she would be unable to participate in communal worship or even have normal social interactions. The duration of twelve years is significant, as it underscores the severity and persistence of her suffering. In biblical numerology, twelve often symbolizes completeness or the nation of Israel, suggesting her suffering was complete and total. Her condition also parallels the twelve-year-old daughter of Jairus, whom Jesus heals later in the chapter, highlighting Jesus' power over both chronic and acute conditions.<p><b>She had spent all her money on physicians,</b><br>This phrase indicates the woman's desperation and the extent of her efforts to find healing. In the first-century context, medical practices were rudimentary and often ineffective, and physicians were not always able to provide cures. The Talmud, a central text of Rabbinic Judaism, lists various remedies for such conditions, but they were often superstitious and costly. Her financial depletion emphasizes her hopelessness and the futility of human solutions, setting the stage for the miraculous intervention of Jesus. This also reflects the broader biblical theme of human insufficiency and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>but no one was able to heal her.</b><br>The inability of the physicians to heal her highlights the limitations of human ability and knowledge, contrasting with Jesus' divine power. This sets the stage for Jesus' miraculous healing, demonstrating His authority over physical ailments and His compassion for those marginalized by society. The phrase also echoes the prophetic anticipation of a Messiah who would bring healing and restoration (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>). In the broader narrative of the Gospels, Jesus' healings serve as signs of the in-breaking Kingdom of God, where suffering and sickness are overcome. This account foreshadows the ultimate healing and restoration found in Christ's redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_with_the_issue_of_blood.htm">The Woman with the Issue of Blood</a></b><br>A woman who had been suffering from a chronic bleeding condition for twelve years.

It may be assumed that the disease from which she suffered made her, according to the Levitical Law, ceremonially unclean: this had separated her in a great measure for a very long period from all contact with the outer world. This would well account for her shrinking from any public appeal to the great Physician. The border of the Lord's garment which the woman touched was one of the four tassels which formed part of the Jewish tallith, or mantle; one of these was always arranged so as to hang down over the shoulder at the back; it was this one which the sufferer's fingers grasped. There was a certain sacredness about these tassels, as being part of the memorial dress enjoined by the Levitical Law, which, no doubt, induced the woman to touch this particular portion of the Saviour's dress. <span class="cmt_word">And immediately</span> <span class="cmt_word">her issue of blood stanched.</span> This is not the only instance of this kind of strange faith mingled with superstition being signally rewarded. The case of the miraculous efficacy of the handkerchiefs and aprons which had had contact with Paul's body (<a href="/acts/19-12.htm">Acts 19:12</a>) is an interesting example. A still more startling one exists in the healing influence of the <span class="accented">shadow</span> of Peter falling on the sick as he passed along the street (<a href="/acts/5-15.htm">Acts 5:15</a>). The lesson evidently intended to be left on the Church of Christ by this and similar incidents is a very instructive one. Faith in Christ is a broad inclusive term: it is accepted and blest by the Master, as we see from the gospel story, in all its many degrees of development, from the elementary shape which it assumed in the case of this poor loving superstitious soul, to the splendid proportions which it reached in the lives of a Stephen and a Paul. Faith in him, from its rudest form to its grandest development, the Master knew would ever purify and elevate the character. It would, as it grew, be the best teacher and the truest monitor of the noble, generous life he loved. Therefore he watched for it, encouraged it, helped it; and his Church, if it would imitate its Master, would do well to follow his wise and loving example by fostering in every form, however crude, faith m Jesus Christ; for this incident in the Divine and perfect life which we have just dwelt on, teaches us with striking clearness that he can and will bless the dimmest, most imperfect faith, the faith of the little child, and of the poorest untaught one. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">including</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">a woman</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#965;&#957;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(gyn&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1135.htm">Strong's 1135: </a> </span><span class="str2">A woman, wife, my lady.
