This includes His disciples and other followers who had been with Him during His ministry. The use of "all" suggests a collective gathering, emphasizing the impact of Jesus' life and teachings on a diverse group. This group likely included the apostles, other disciples, and perhaps even those who had been healed or taught by Him. Their presence at the crucifixion highlights their loyalty and the deep bond they shared with Jesus, despite the fear and danger associated with being identified with Him at this time.<p><b>including the women who had followed Him from Galilee</b><br>The mention of women is significant, as it underscores their important role in Jesus' ministry. Women like Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome are noted in other Gospel accounts as being present. These women had supported Jesus financially and logistically, demonstrating their commitment and faith. Their journey from Galilee to Jerusalem with Jesus shows their dedication. In a cultural context where women were often marginalized, their inclusion here highlights the counter-cultural nature of Jesus' ministry, where women were valued and integral to His mission.<p><b>stood at a distance</b><br>This detail reflects the fear and uncertainty experienced by Jesus' followers. Standing at a distance could indicate their fear of being associated with Jesus and potentially facing persecution themselves. It also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>, where the shepherd is struck and the sheep scatter. Despite their physical distance, their presence shows a desire to remain connected to Jesus, even in His suffering. This distance can also symbolize the separation between humanity and God that Jesus' death would ultimately bridge.<p><b>watching these things</b><br>The act of watching implies a sense of helplessness and sorrow. The followers of Jesus were witnesses to the fulfillment of His prophecies about His death. This moment is pivotal, as it marks the culmination of Jesus' earthly ministry and the beginning of the new covenant through His sacrifice. Their observation of these events would later serve as a powerful testimony to the resurrection and the truth of Jesus' teachings. This scene also connects to <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, a messianic psalm that describes the suffering of the righteous, which Jesus fulfills through His crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_knew_him.htm">Those Who Knew Him</a></b><br>This refers to the followers of Jesus, including His disciples and others who had been impacted by His ministry.

Their presence at the crucifixion highlights their devotion and courage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crucifixion.htm">The Crucifixion</a></b><br>The event of Jesus' crucifixion is central to Christian faith, representing the sacrificial death of Jesus for the sins of humanity. It is a moment of profound sorrow and significance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/galilee.htm">Galilee</a></b><br>A region in northern Israel where Jesus conducted much of His ministry. It is significant as the place from which these women originated, showing their long-term commitment to Jesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_distance.htm">The Distance</a></b><br>The physical distance at which the followers stood may symbolize the emotional and spiritual distance they felt during this moment of despair and confusion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_witnesses.htm">Faithful Witnesses</a></b><br>The presence of the women at the crucifixion serves as a powerful example of steadfast faith and loyalty.

It challenges us to recognize and value the contributions of women in the Church today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/standing_at_a_distance.htm">Standing at a Distance</a></b><br>The physical distance of the followers can reflect our own spiritual distance at times. We are encouraged to draw near to Christ, especially in moments of doubt or fear.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">The Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>Witnessing the crucifixion was a painful experience for Jesus' followers.

The scene underscores His faithfulness in keeping His own&#8212;even at the cross.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>including the women who had followed Him from Galilee,</b><p>- Luke emphasizes the women because they exemplify steadfast devotion.
