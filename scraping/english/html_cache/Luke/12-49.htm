Fire in biblical terms often symbolizes purification, judgment, or the presence of God (e.g., <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>, <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>). Jesus' coming initiates a new covenant, challenging existing religious structures and calling for repentance. The imagery of fire suggests both the refining of believers and the judgment of those who reject Him. This aligns with John the Baptist's prophecy in <a href="/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11-12</a>, where he speaks of Jesus baptizing with the Holy Spirit and fire.<p><b>and how I wish it were already kindled!</b><br>This expression reveals Jesus' eagerness for His mission to be fulfilled. The "kindling" of the fire can be seen as the beginning of the transformative work of the Holy Spirit, which would be fully realized after His death and resurrection. It reflects Jesus' anticipation of the coming kingdom and the urgency of His message. This longing is echoed in other scriptures where Jesus expresses a desire for the fulfillment of God's plan, such as in <a href="/john/12-27.htm">John 12:27-28</a>.

We are compelled to assume a pause, a moment's thought, as in one whose gaze looks out into the future, and who at once feels its terrors and yet accepts them. The fire which He came to send is the fire of judgment which shall burn up the chaff (see Note on <a href="/matthew/3-12.htm" title="Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.">Matthew 3:12</a>), the baptism of fire which shall purify and cleanse as well as destroy. The Son of Man knew that this, with all its terrors, was what He came to work. If the fire was already kindled, if judgment was already passed upon the unfaithful stewards and the servants who knew their Lord's will and did it not, why should He wish to check it? What other wish or will was right for Him than that it should complete what it had begun, even though it brought not peace, but a sword--not union, but division?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 49.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- I am come to send fire on the earth</span>. It is still the same train of thought that the Master pursues - a train which had been only slightly diverted by Peter's question. The text, so to speak, of the whole discourse was "the strange attraction which riches possess for men, and the palsying effect which this attraction, when yielded to, exercises over the whole life." The Master's argument was as follows: "Beware of covetousness; let your attachment to earthly possessions sit very lightly on you all; and as for <span class="accented">you</span>, my disciples, do you have <span class="accented">nothing</span> to do with these perishable goods." And here, with an abrupt solemnity, probably the voice changing here, and ringing with an awful emotion, he enforces his charge to the disciples with the words, "I am come to send fire on the earth." "My stern, sad work is to inaugurate a mighty struggle, to cast a firebrand on the earth. Lo, my presence will stir up men - you will see this in a way none now dream of; a vast convulsion will rend this people asunder. In the coming days of war and tumult, what have you, my disciples, who will be in the forefront of this movement, - what have you to do with earthly goods? Toss them away from you as useless baggage. The pioneers of the army of the future, surely <span class="accented">they</span> must be unencumbered in the war, which is about to break out; for remember, 'I am come to send fire on the earth.'<span class="cmt_word">" And what will I, if it be already kindled?</span> better rendered, <span class="accented">how I would that it had been already kindled!</span> That is to say, "How I wish that this fire were already burning!" (so Olshausen, De Wette, Bleek, and Farrar). Through all the woe, however, the Redeemer could see, shining as it were through a dark cloud, the unspeakable glory and blessedness of his work. But this fire could not be kindled into a flame until something had happened. The cross must be endured by him; till then his work was not finished; and in his pure human nature - it is with stammering tongue and trembling pen we speak or write here - he felt, we believe, the bitter stinging pain of dread expectation of what was coming. With this onlook he was weighed down, we know, at times; witness especially the Gethsemane agony.
