In a crowded synagogue, He notices the woman, demonstrating His compassion and divine insight. This reflects God's omniscience and care for individuals, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>, where God knows every detail of our lives. Jesus' attention to her plight underscores His mission to seek and save the lost (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>).<p><b>He called her over</b><br>Jesus initiates the interaction, highlighting His authority and willingness to engage with those marginalized by society. In the cultural context, women often had a lower status, and a woman with a disability would be even more marginalized. By calling her over, Jesus breaks social norms, similar to His interaction with the Samaritan woman in <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4</a>, showing that His ministry transcends societal boundaries.<p><b>and said,</b><br>The act of speaking to her directly is significant. In Jewish tradition, a rabbi speaking to a woman in public was unusual, yet Jesus consistently defies cultural expectations to demonstrate God's love and truth. His words carry authority, as seen in other miracles where His spoken word brings healing (e.g., <a href="/john/5-8.htm">John 5:8</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Woman, you are set free</b><br>The phrase "set free" indicates liberation, not just from physical ailment but also from spiritual bondage. This echoes <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, a prophecy about the Messiah proclaiming freedom for captives, which Jesus reads in <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>, affirming His messianic role. The use of "woman" is respectful and personal, emphasizing her dignity and worth in God's eyes.<p><b>from your disability.&#8221;</b><br>The term "disability" here refers to a physical ailment, but it also symbolizes spiritual oppression. In <a href="/luke/13-11.htm">Luke 13:11</a>, the woman is described as having a disabling spirit, suggesting a spiritual dimension to her condition. Jesus' healing acts as a type of His ultimate victory over sin and death, foreshadowing the complete restoration promised in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>. This miracle demonstrates Jesus' power over both physical and spiritual realms, affirming His divine authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs the miracle of healing in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>A woman who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years, representing those who are bound by physical or spiritual afflictions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_synagogue.htm">The Synagogue</a></b><br>The place where this event occurs, a center for Jewish worship and teaching, highlighting the setting of Jesus' ministry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_healing.htm">The Healing</a></b><br>The miraculous event where Jesus heals the woman, demonstrating His authority over physical and spiritual ailments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_compassion.htm">Jesus' Compassion</a></b><br>Jesus sees and acknowledges those who are suffering.
