In the context of first-century Judea, the Jewish leaders did not have the authority to execute capital punishment, which is why they needed to involve the Roman government. This fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as being despised and rejected by men. The act of being delivered to the Gentiles also signifies the rejection of Jesus by His own people, as seen in <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>, where it states, "He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him."<p><b>and will be mocked</b><br>Mocking was a common form of humiliation used by the Romans to demean those they considered inferior or rebellious. This act of mockery fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a>, which describes the suffering servant being ridiculed. The mockery of Jesus is further detailed in the Gospels, where Roman soldiers dress Him in a purple robe and place a crown of thorns on His head, sarcastically hailing Him as "King of the Jews" (<a href="/mark/15-17.htm">Mark 15:17-20</a>). This mockery underscores the misunderstanding and rejection of Jesus' true kingship.<p><b>and insulted</b><br>Insulting Jesus was part of the broader pattern of abuse He endured during His trial and crucifixion. The cultural context of the time saw verbal abuse as a way to strip a person of dignity and honor. This aligns with the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>, where the servant of the Lord is described as offering His back to those who beat Him and His cheeks to those who pull out His beard, not hiding His face from mocking and spitting. The insults hurled at Jesus highlight the depth of human sin and the extent of His suffering for humanity's redemption.<p><b>and spit upon</b><br>Spitting was considered one of the most degrading acts of contempt in ancient cultures, symbolizing utter disdain and rejection. This act fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>, where the suffering servant does not hide His face from disgrace and spitting. The act of spitting on Jesus is recorded in the Gospels during His trial before the Sanhedrin and later by the Roman soldiers (<a href="/matthew/26-67.htm">Matthew 26:67</a>, <a href="/mark/14-65.htm">Mark 14:65</a>). This ultimate act of humiliation emphasizes the extent of Jesus' suffering and His willingness to endure shame for the sake of fulfilling His redemptive mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is foretelling His own suffering and crucifixion.
