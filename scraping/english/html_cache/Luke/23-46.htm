The loud voice signifies strength and authority, even in His final moments. It contrasts with the typical weakening of a crucified person, emphasizing His control over the situation. This act fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>, where the suffering servant cries out to God. The loud voice also serves as a public declaration, ensuring that those present, including Roman soldiers and Jewish leaders, hear His final words.<p><b>&#8220;Father, into Your hands I commit My Spirit.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus addresses God as "Father," indicating a personal and intimate relationship, consistent with His teachings throughout the Gospels. This phrase is a direct quotation from <a href="/psalms/31-5.htm">Psalm 31:5</a>, a psalm of trust and deliverance, showing Jesus' reliance on Scripture even in death. By committing His spirit to the Father, Jesus demonstrates His trust in God's plan and His voluntary surrender, fulfilling His role as the obedient Son. This act signifies the completion of His earthly mission and the beginning of His exaltation. It also reflects the Jewish custom of entrusting one's spirit to God at the time of death.<p><b>And when He had said this, He breathed His last.</b><br>The phrase "He breathed His last" indicates the moment of Jesus' physical death. This moment is significant as it marks the completion of His sacrificial work on the cross, fulfilling the prophecies of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. The voluntary nature of His death is emphasized, as He chooses the moment to give up His spirit, aligning with His earlier statement in <a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a> that He has the authority to lay down His life. This act of breathing His last signifies the end of His earthly suffering and the beginning of the new covenant through His atoning sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is crucified for the sins of humanity.

The object of the receiving the refreshment of the vinegar - the sour wine (<a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>) - was that his natural forces, weakened by the long suffering, should be restored sufficiently for him to render audible the last two sayings - the "It is finished!" of St. John, and the commending his soul to his Father, of St. Luke. <span class="cmt_word">Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit</span>. St. John (John 19:30) has related now already Jesus had uttered the triumphal cry, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>! "It is finished!" This was <span class="accented">his farewell to earth.</span> St. Luke records the words which seem almost immediately to have followed the "It is finished!" This commending his spirit to his Father has been accurately termed <span class="accented">his entrance greeting to heaven.</span> This placing his spirit as a trust in the Father's hands is, as Stier phrases it, an expression of the profoundest and most blessed repose after toil. "It is finished!" has already told us that the struggling and combat were sealed and closed for ever. Doctrinally it is a saying of vast importance; for it emphatically asserts that the soul will exist apart from the body <span class="accented">in the hands of God.</span> This at least is its proper home. The saying has been echoed on many a saintly death-bed. Stephen, full of the Holy Ghost, in his great agony shows us the form of this blessed prayer we should properly use for ourselves at that supreme hour, when he asked the <span class="accented">Lord Jesus</span> to receive his spirit, and then fell asleep. Thus coming to the Son, we come through him to the Father. Huss, on his way to the stake, when his enemies were triumphantly giving over his soul to devils, said with no less theological accuracy than with sure, calm faith, "But I commit my spirit into thy hand, O Lord Jesus Christ, who hast redeemed it." <span class="cmt_word">And having said thus, he gave up the ghost</span>. This setting his spirit free was his own voluntary act. He already told his disciples of his own independent power to lay down and take up his life (<a href="/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17, 18</a>). The great teachers of the early Church evidently lay stress on; his (see Tertullian, 'Apol.,' ch. 21). Augustine's words are striking: "Quis ita dormit quando voluerit, sicut Jesus mortuus est quando voluit? Quis ita vestem ponit quando voluerit, sieur se came exuit quando writ? Quis ita cum voluerit abit, quomodo the cure voluit obiit?" and he ends with this practical conclusion: "<span class="accented">Quanta</span> spe-randa vel timenda potestas est judicantis, si apparuit tanta morientis?" "Under these circumstances," writes Dr. Westeott, "it may not be fitting to speculate on the physical cause of the Lord's death, but it h,s been argued that the symptoms agree with a rupture of the heart, such as might <span class="accented">i.e.</span> produced by intense mental agony." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/23-46.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">called out</span><br /><span class="grk">&#966;&#969;&#957;&#942;&#963;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(ph&#333;n&#275;sas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5455.htm">Strong's 5455: </a> </span><span class="str2">From phone; to emit a sound; by implication, to address in words or by name, also in imitation.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in a loud voice,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#966;&#969;&#957;&#8135;</span> <span class="translit">(ph&#333;n&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Dative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5456.htm">Strong's 5456: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably akin to phaino through the idea of disclosure; a tone; by implication, an address, saying or language.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Father,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#940;&#964;&#949;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(Pater)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3962.htm">Strong's 3962: </a> </span><span class="str2">Father, (Heavenly) Father, ancestor, elder, senior.
