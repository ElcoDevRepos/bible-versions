In this context, Mary is the sister of Martha and Lazarus, who lived in Bethany, a village near Jerusalem. This Mary is distinct from other Marys in the Bible, such as Mary Magdalene or Mary, the mother of Jesus. The family is known for their close relationship with Jesus, as seen in other passages like <a href="/john/11.htm">John 11</a>, where Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead. The mention of Mary here sets the stage for a contrast between her contemplative nature and Martha's active service.<p><b>who sat at the Lord&#8217;s feet</b><br>Sitting at someone's feet was a traditional posture of a disciple learning from a teacher. This indicates Mary's role as a devoted follower of Jesus, eager to learn from Him. In Jewish culture, disciples would sit at the feet of rabbis to receive instruction, signifying humility and a desire for wisdom. This act of sitting at Jesus' feet also symbolizes submission and reverence, acknowledging His authority and wisdom. It reflects the importance of prioritizing spiritual learning and relationship with Christ over other concerns.<p><b>listening to His message</b><br>Mary's focus on listening highlights the importance of receiving and understanding Jesus' teachings. In the Gospels, Jesus often emphasizes the value of hearing and obeying His words, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>, where He compares those who hear His words and act on them to a wise builder. The message of Jesus encompasses His teachings about the Kingdom of God, love, forgiveness, and salvation. Mary's attentiveness contrasts with Martha's distraction, underscoring the theme of choosing the "better part" by prioritizing spiritual nourishment. This moment foreshadows the New Covenant, where believers are called to be attentive to the voice of Christ, the ultimate Teacher and Prophet.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>The sister of Martha and Lazarus, known for her devotion and attentiveness to Jesus' teachings.
