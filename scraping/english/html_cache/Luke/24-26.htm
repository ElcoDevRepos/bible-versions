The concept of a suffering Messiah is rooted in Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which describes the "Suffering Servant" who bears the sins of many. The necessity of suffering is also seen in <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, which vividly portrays the anguish of the Messiah. The idea of a suffering Messiah was not widely accepted in Jewish thought at the time, as many expected a conquering king. However, Jesus' suffering was essential to fulfill the prophecies and to accomplish the atonement for humanity's sins.<p><b>and then to enter His glory?</b><br>This phrase refers to the resurrection and ascension of Jesus, marking His entry into glory. The resurrection is a pivotal event in Christian theology, signifying Jesus' victory over sin and death. It fulfills the promise of eternal life for believers and confirms Jesus' divine nature. The ascension, as described in <a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>, further emphasizes His glorification and return to the Father. This transition from suffering to glory is a pattern seen in the lives of believers, as they are called to share in Christ's sufferings and ultimately in His glory, as noted in <a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>. The phrase also connects to <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-11</a>, where Jesus' humility and obedience lead to His exaltation by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of this passage, who is explaining the necessity of His suffering and subsequent glorification.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples_on_the_road_to_emmaus.htm">The Disciples on the Road to Emmaus</a></b><br>Two followers of Jesus who are traveling from Jerusalem to Emmaus and are initially unaware that they are speaking with the resurrected Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_road_to_emmaus.htm">The Road to Emmaus</a></b><br>The setting of this encounter, symbolizing a journey of revelation and understanding for the disciples.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_suffering_and_glory_of_christ.htm">The Suffering and Glory of Christ</a></b><br>The events of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection, which fulfill Old Testament prophecies and reveal the divine plan of salvation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_suffering.htm">The Necessity of Suffering</a></b><br>Jesus' suffering was not an accident but a divine necessity for the redemption of humanity.

"St. Luke dwells on the Resurrection as a spiritual necessity; St. Mark, as a great fact; St. Matthew, as a glorious and majestic manifestation; and St. John, in its effects on the members of the Church... If this suffering and death were a necessity (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), if it was in accordance with the will of God <span class="accented">that the Christ should suffer</span>, and so <span class="accented">enter into his glory</span>, and if we can be enabled to see this necessity, and see also the noble issues which flow from it, then we can understand how the same necessity must in due measure be laid upon his brethren" (Westcott). And so we obtain a key to some of the darkest problems of humanity. Thus the Stranger led the "two" to see the true meaning of the "prophets," whose burning words they had so often read and heard without grasping their real deep signification. Thus he led them to see that the Christ must be a <span class="accented">suffering</span> before he could be a <span class="accented">triumphing</span> Messiah; that the crucifixion of Jesus, over which they wailed with so bitter a wailing, was in fact an essential part of the counsels of God. Then he went on to show that, as his suffering is now fulfilled - for the Crucifixion and death were past - nothing remains of that which is written in the prophets, but the entering into his glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Was it not necessary for</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#948;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(edei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1163.htm">Strong's 1163: </a> </span><span class="str2">Third person singular active present of deo; also deon deh-on'; neuter active participle of the same; both used impersonally; it is Necessary.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
