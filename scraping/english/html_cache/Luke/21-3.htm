It is a common introduction in the Gospels, indicating that Jesus is about to reveal a significant spiritual truth. The use of "truly" underscores the certainty and authority of His words, reflecting His role as a divine teacher. This phrase is similar to the Hebrew "Amen," which means "so be it" or "truth," and is used to affirm the reliability of a statement.<p><b>He said,</b><br>This indicates that Jesus is speaking directly to His disciples and those around Him. The context of this passage is Jesus teaching in the temple courts in Jerusalem, a place of significant religious activity and authority. His teachings often challenged the prevailing religious norms and highlighted deeper spiritual truths.<p><b>&#8220;this poor widow has put in more than all the others.&#8221;</b><br>The "poor widow" represents the marginalized and vulnerable in society, often overlooked and undervalued. In the cultural and historical context, widows were among the most destitute, lacking a male protector or provider. Jesus' observation highlights the widow's sacrificial giving, contrasting it with the contributions of the wealthy. Her offering, though monetarily small, was of greater value in God's eyes because it was given out of her poverty and with complete trust in God. This teaching aligns with the biblical principle that God values the heart and intent behind the gift more than the amount (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). It also reflects the theme of God's preferential concern for the poor and humble, as seen throughout Scripture (<a href="/james/2-5.htm">James 2:5</a>). This act of the widow can be seen as a type of Christ's own sacrificial giving, where He gave everything for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is observing and teaching in the temple.

Scripture records that &#8220;the crowds were astonished at His teaching, because He taught as one who had authority&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28-29</a>).<p>&#8226; The simple reminder &#8220;He said&#8221; ties this moment to countless others where Jesus&#8217; spoken word carried power&#8212;stilling storms (<a href="/luke/8-24.htm">Luke 8:24</a>) and offering eternal life (<a href="/john/6-68.htm">John 6:68-69</a>).<p>&#8226; When the Lord speaks, His people listen; ignoring His assessment of this widow would mean ignoring the Judge of all (<a href="/john/12-48.htm">John 12:48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>this poor widow has put in more than all the others.</b><p>&#8226; Jesus contrasts earthly calculations with heaven&#8217;s ledger. Others &#8220;contributed out of their surplus, but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on&#8221; (<a href="/luke/21-4.htm">Luke 21:4</a>; see the parallel in <a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>).<p>&#8226; God evaluates gifts by sacrifice, not sum. David echoed the same heart: &#8220;I will not offer to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The widow&#8217;s two small coins outweighed rich offerings because she held nothing back&#8212;mirroring the principle &#8220;if the readiness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-12.htm">2 Corinthians 8:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Her faith illustrates that the Lord &#8220;looks at the heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). Quiet, unseen obedience pleases Him far more than public displays (<a href="/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jesus prefaces His comment with an ironclad &#8220;Truly,&#8221; stressing that what He says is reality from God&#8217;s viewpoint. As the authoritative Son, His judgment is final. Looking past large sums, He celebrates a destitute widow who gave everything, teaching that value in God&#8217;s kingdom is measured by sacrificial faith, not monetary amount.
