These roles were essential for the sustenance of the household, reflecting the agrarian society of the time. The imagery of plowing and shepherding is also significant in biblical symbolism, representing hard work and diligence. Shepherding, in particular, is a recurring theme in Scripture, with figures like David and Jesus Himself being described as shepherds (Psalm 23, <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>). This phrase sets the stage for a teaching on duty and humility, emphasizing the servant's role in fulfilling their responsibilities.<p><b>will say to him, &#8216;Come at once and sit down to eat&#8217;?</b><br>In the cultural context of the first century, it was uncommon for a master to serve a servant. The expectation was that the servant would continue to serve the master even after completing their fieldwork. This reflects the hierarchical social structure of the time, where servants were expected to fulfill their duties without expecting immediate rewards or special treatment. The rhetorical question posed by Jesus highlights the natural order of service and duty, drawing attention to the attitude of humility and obedience expected of believers. This teaching aligns with other scriptural principles of servanthood and humility, such as those found in <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-7</a>, where Christ's own example of servanthood is highlighted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, teaching His disciples about humility and service.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/servant.htm">Servant</a></b><br>Represents believers who are called to serve God faithfully.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/master.htm">Master</a></b><br>Symbolizes God, who expects faithful service from His followers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/field.htm">Field</a></b><br>The place of labor, representing the world where believers are called to work.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/plowing/shepherding.htm">Plowing/Shepherding</a></b><br>Metaphors for the work and responsibilities of believers in their service to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_role_as_servants.htm">Understanding Our Role as Servants</a></b><br>Believers are called to serve God with humility, recognizing that our service is a duty, not a favor to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_expectation_of_faithful_service.htm">The Expectation of Faithful Service</a></b><br>Just as a servant works diligently in the field, Christians are expected to labor faithfully in their spiritual and earthly responsibilities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_service.htm">Humility in Service</a></b><br>True service to God is marked by humility, understanding that our work is for His glory, not for personal gain or recognition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_our_reward.htm">The Nature of Our Reward</a></b><br>Our reward is not immediate or earthly; it is eternal and given by God in His timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_christ's_example.htm">Reflecting Christ&#8217;s Example</a></b><br>Jesus exemplified perfect servanthood, and believers are called to follow His example in their daily lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_17_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 17:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_17_7_Servant_s_role_in_faith.htm">How does Luke 17:7 illustrate the servant's role in our Christian walk?

They had been asking for faith, not only in a measure sufficient for obedience, but as excluding all uncertainty and doubt. They were looking for the crown of labour before their work was done, for the wreath of the conqueror before they had fought the battle. He presses home upon them the analogies of common human experience. The slave who had been "ploughing" or "feeding <span class= "ital">sheep</span>" (the word is that always used of the shepherd's work, as in <a href="/john/21-16.htm" title="He said to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my sheep.">John 21:16</a>, <a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>, <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm" title="Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;">1Peter 5:2</a>, and so both the participles are suggestive of latent parables of the spiritual work of the Apostles) is not all at once invited to sit down at the feast. He has first to minister to his master's wants, to see that his soul is satisfied, and then, in due course, his own turn will come. So, in the life of the disciples, outward ministerial labour was to be followed by personal devotion. In other words, the "increase of faith" for which the Apostles prayed, was to come through obedience, outward and inward obedience, to their Master's will. Faith was to show itself in virtue, and virtue would bring knowledge, and knowledge would strengthen faith. Comp. <a href="/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2Peter 1:5</a>, as showing that the lesson had been learnt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But which of you, having a servant ploughing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by-and-by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat? and will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?</span> And here we have the Lord's answer to his disciples' request to increase their faith. They were asking for a boon he would not, nay, could not, grant them yet. A small measure of <span class="accented">real</span> faith was sufficient to teach them that God would give them strength enough to keep themselves from committing this offence against love and charity of which he warned them so solemnly; but they prayed for more. "They were asking for faith, not only in a measure sufficient for obedience, but for a faith which would exclude all uncertainty and doubt. They were looking for the crown of labour <span class="accented">before</span> their work was done, for the wreath of the conqueror <span class="accented">before</span> they had fought the battle... In other words, the 'increase of faith' 'for which the apostles prayed was only to come through obedience to their Master's will" (Dean Plumptre). The little parable was to teach them that they were not to look to accomplishing great things by a strong faith given to them in a moment of time, but they were to labour on patiently and bravely, and <span class="accented">afterwards</span>, as in the parable-story, <span class="accented">they too should eat and drink.</span> It was to show them that in the end they should receive that higher faith they prayed for, which was to be the reward for patient, gallant toil. <span class="accented">And gird thyself, and serve me.</span> It is scarcely wise, as we have before remarked, to press each separate detail of the Lord's parables. Zeller, quoted by Stier," makes, however, an application of this to the 'inner world of the heart,' in which there is no going straightway to sit down at table when a man comes from his external calling and sphere of labour, but we must gird ourselves to serve the Lord, and so prepare ourselves for the time when he will receive us to his supper." This is interesting, but it is doubtful if the Lord intended these special applications. The general sense of the parable is clear. It teaches two things to all who would be, then or in the ages to come, his disciples - <span class="accented">patience</span> and <span class="accented">humility.</span> It reminds men, too, that his service is an arduous one, and that for those really engaged in it it not only brings hard toil in the fields during the day, but also further duties often in the evening-tide. There is no rest for the faithful and true servant of Jesus, and this restless work must be <span class="accented">patiently</span> gone through, perhaps for long years. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/17-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Which</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
