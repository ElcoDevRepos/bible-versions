However, Jesus, who is the fulfillment of the Law, demonstrates His authority over ceremonial laws and death itself. This act of taking her by the hand signifies His compassion and willingness to engage personally with those in need. It also reflects the intimacy and personal nature of His miracles, as seen in other instances where He touches those He heals (<a href="/mark/1-41.htm">Mark 1:41</a>, <a href="/matthew/8-3.htm">Matthew 8:3</a>).<p><b>and called out</b><br>The act of calling out is significant in demonstrating Jesus' authority. In the Gospels, Jesus often uses His voice to command nature, spirits, and even death (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>, <a href="/luke/4-35.htm">Luke 4:35</a>). This reflects the power of God's Word, as seen in creation when God spoke the world into existence (Genesis 1). Jesus' voice carries divine authority, emphasizing His identity as the Son of God.<p><b>&#8220;Child, get up!&#8221;</b><br>This command is a direct and powerful demonstration of Jesus' authority over life and death. The simplicity of His words highlights His divine power, as no elaborate ritual or incantation is needed. This mirrors other instances where Jesus raises the dead, such as the son of the widow of Nain (<a href="/luke/7-14.htm">Luke 7:14</a>) and Lazarus (<a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43</a>). It fulfills the prophetic imagery of the Messiah bringing life and restoration (<a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>). Jesus' command to "get up" is also symbolic of spiritual awakening and resurrection, pointing to the ultimate resurrection at the end of the age (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God, who performs a miraculous act of raising a young girl from the dead.

Jesus is not thwarted by death; He is Lord over it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Took her by the hand</b><p>- Jesus does not heal from a distance this time; He physically touches the lifeless girl.
