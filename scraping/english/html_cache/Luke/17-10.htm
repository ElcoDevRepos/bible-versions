It follows a parable about servants, emphasizing the role of followers of Christ as servants in God's kingdom. The use of "you also" connects the teaching to the broader context of humility and service.<p><b>when you have done everything commanded of you,</b><br>This highlights the expectation of obedience to God's commands. The phrase suggests completeness in fulfilling God's will, echoing the biblical theme of obedience found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a> and <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>. It underscores the idea that believers are to follow God's commands fully, not selectively.<p><b>should say,</b><br>This implies a prescribed response or attitude that believers are to adopt. It suggests a verbal acknowledgment of one's position before God, reflecting a heart posture of humility and recognition of God's sovereignty.<p><b>&#8216;We are unworthy servants;</b><br>The term "unworthy" reflects a recognition of one's position before God, acknowledging that any service rendered is not meritorious but a duty. This echoes the humility of figures like John the Baptist, who said he was not worthy to untie Jesus' sandals (<a href="/john/1-27.htm">John 1:27</a>). The concept of servanthood is central to Jesus' teachings, as seen in <a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>, where Jesus describes Himself as a servant.<p><b>we have only done our duty.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the idea of duty rather than merit. It reflects the biblical principle that service to God is an obligation, not something that earns favor or reward. This aligns with the teachings in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where believers are urged to offer themselves as living sacrifices, which is described as their "reasonable service." The notion of duty also connects to the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where servants are expected to fulfill their responsibilities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, providing a teaching to His disciples about humility and service.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all followers of Christ who are called to serve.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants.htm">Servants</a></b><br>A metaphorical reference to believers, emphasizing their role and duty in the Kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_role.htm">Understanding Our Role</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to be servants of Christ.

God, we are taught, may recognise and reward the varying use which men make of gifts and opportunities.
