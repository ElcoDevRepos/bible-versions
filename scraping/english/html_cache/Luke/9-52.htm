The act of sending messengers ahead is a practical step, ensuring that there is a place prepared for Him and His disciples. This reflects the organized and intentional nature of Jesus' ministry. The use of messengers is reminiscent of the Old Testament practice where prophets and kings would send envoys to prepare the way, as seen in <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, which speaks of a messenger preparing the way for the Lord. This also prefigures the role of John the Baptist as a forerunner to Christ.<p><b>who went into a village of the Samaritans</b><br>The mention of Samaritans is significant due to the historical enmity between Jews and Samaritans. Samaritans were descendants of Israelites who had intermarried with foreigners after the Assyrian conquest, leading to religious and cultural differences. This animosity is evident in <a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9</a>, where the Samaritan woman expresses surprise that Jesus, a Jew, would speak to her. Jesus' decision to send messengers to a Samaritan village highlights His mission to break down barriers and reach out to all people, foreshadowing the inclusion of Gentiles in the New Covenant.<p><b>to make arrangements for Him</b><br>The phrase indicates the need for hospitality and preparation, which was a common cultural practice in the ancient Near East. Hospitality was a significant aspect of Jewish and Samaritan culture, as seen in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18:1-8</a> with Abraham's hospitality to the three visitors. The need for arrangements suggests that Jesus was seeking a place to stay and possibly a venue for teaching. This also reflects the itinerant nature of His ministry, where He relied on the hospitality of others, as seen in <a href="/luke/10-5.htm">Luke 10:5-7</a>, where He instructs His disciples to accept the hospitality offered to them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, who is sending messengers ahead of Him as He travels.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/messengers.htm">Messengers</a></b><br>Disciples or followers of Jesus tasked with preparing the way for His arrival.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaritan_village.htm">Samaritan Village</a></b><br>A location in Samaria, significant due to the historical tensions between Jews and Samaritans.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/journey_to_jerusalem.htm">Journey to Jerusalem</a></b><br>The broader context of this passage is Jesus' journey towards Jerusalem, where He will ultimately face crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_barriers_and_the_gospel.htm">Cultural Barriers and the Gospel</a></b><br>Jesus' decision to send messengers to a Samaritan village demonstrates His mission to break down cultural and ethnic barriers.

Rather than drifting into villages, He &#8220;sent&#8221; representatives, showing purposeful mission (compare <a href="/luke/10-1.htm">Luke 10:1</a>, where He &#8220;sent them two by two ahead of Him&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The pattern of sending runs through His ministry&#8212;He earlier &#8220;sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God&#8221; (<a href="/luke/9-2.htm">Luke 9:2</a>) and later dispatched two disciples to secure the colt for the triumphal entry (<a href="/mark/11-1.htm">Mark 11:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; This simple phrase reminds us that Christ involves His followers in His work. Like those messengers, we are called to go before Him, clearing obstacles and preparing hearts (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who went into a village of the Samaritans</b><p>&#8226; The route from Galilee to Jerusalem passed through Samaritan territory. Many devout Jews skirted it, but Jesus chose engagement over avoidance (<a href="/john/4-4.htm">John 4:4-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Samaritans and Jews harbored centuries-old hostility (<a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>; <a href="/ezra/4-1.htm">Ezra 4:1-5</a>). By sending messengers there, Jesus demonstrated His heart for reconciliation and the breaking down of ethnic barriers&#8212;foreshadowing the gospel&#8217;s advance to Samaria in <a href="/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4-8</a>.<p>&#8226; Earlier, He praised a Samaritan leper&#8217;s gratitude (<a href="/luke/17-16.htm">Luke 17:16</a>) and would soon tell the parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-33.htm">Luke 10:33</a>). Each encounter underscores that the kingdom welcomes anyone who responds in faith, regardless of background.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to make arrangements for Him</b><p>&#8226; The messengers&#8217; task was practical&#8212;securing lodging, food, and a receptive setting. Their service illustrates that mundane details matter in kingdom work (<a href="/mark/14-12.htm">Mark 14:12-16</a>; <a href="/luke/22-8.htm">Luke 22:8-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Hospitality was crucial for itinerant teachers.

The verse highlights His strategic mission, His bridge-building toward outsiders, and the importance of faithful service in seemingly ordinary tasks.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(52) <span class= "bld">And sent messengers before his face.</span>--It is remarkable that the words "Samaria" and "Samaritan" do not occur at all in St. Mark, and in St. Matthew in one passage only (<a href="/matthew/10-5.htm" title="These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter you not:">Matthew 10:5</a>), and then in the command given to the Twelve that they were not to enter into any city of the Samaritans. St. Luke, on the other hand, seems to have carried his inquiries into that country, and to have treasured up whatever he could find of our Lord's acts and words in relation to it. This seems accordingly the right place for a short account of the region and the people, and of their relations, in our Lord's time, to their neighbours of Judaea and Galilee. The city of Samaria (the modern <span class= "ital">Sebastieh</span>) first comes into notice as built by Omri to be the capital of the kingdom of Israel (<a href="/context/1_kings/16-23.htm" title="In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.">1Kings 16:23-24</a>). It continued to occupy that position till its capture by Salmaneser, B.C. 721. After the deportation of the ten tribes, Esar-haddon (<a href="/ezra/4-2.htm" title="Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said to them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as you do; and we do sacrifice to him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up here.">Ezra 4:2</a>; <a href="/ezra/4-10.htm" title="And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a time.">Ezra 4:10</a>), after the manner of the great monarchs of the East, brought a mingled race from Babylon, and Cuthah, and Ava, and Hamath, and Sepharvaim (<a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm" title="And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelled in the cities thereof.">2Kings 17:24</a>), to occupy the district thus left depopulated, and from these the Samaritans of later history were descended. They were accordingly of alien races, and their neighbours of Judaea kept up the memory of their foreign origin by speaking of them as Cuthaeans. Under the influence of a priest of Israel sent by the king of Assyria, they became worshippers of Jehovah (<a href="/2_kings/17-41.htm" title="So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they to this day.">2Kings 17:41</a>), and on the return of Judah and Benjamin from the Captivity, they sought to be admitted as co-religionists, to share with them in the work of rebuilding the Temple, and therefore to obtain like privileges as worshippers in its courts. That claim was, however, refused, and they in return, B.C. 409, guided by Manasseh, a priest who had been expelled from Jerusalem by Nehemiah. for an unlawful marriage with the daughter of Sanballat the Horonite (<a href="/nehemiah/13-28.htm" title="And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.">Nehemiah 13:28</a>), obtained permission from the Persian king, Darius Nothus, to erect a temple on Mount Gerizim. Josephus, it should be added (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xi. 7), places the whole story much later, in the time of Darius Nothus and Alexander the Great. The new worship thus started, placed them at once in the position of a rival and schismatical sect, and their after-history presented the usual features of such antagonism. They refused all hospitality to pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem, or would way-lay and maltreat them on their journey. They mocked the more distant Jews by false signals of the rising of the Paschal moon at Jerusalem. (See Note on <a href="/luke/6-1.htm" title="And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.">Luke 6:1</a>.) They found their way into the Temple, and profaned it by scattering dead men's bones on the sacred pavement (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xviii. 2, ? 2; xx. 6, ? 1). Outrages of this kind rankled in the memory of the Jews, and they, in their turn, looked on the Samaritans as worse than heathen, "had no dealings with them" (<a href="/john/4-9.htm" title="Then said the woman of Samaria to him, How is it that you, being a Jew, ask drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.">John 4:9</a>), cursed them in their synagogues, and even the wise of heart among them, like the son of Sirach, named them as a people that they abhorred (<a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/1-25.htm" title="The parables of knowledge are in the treasures of wisdom: but godliness is an abomination to a sinner.">Ecclesiasticus 1:25-26</a>). Probably in consequence of this bitter hostility, the Samaritans became more and more jealous in their observance of the Law, boasted that they possessed the authentic copy of it, substituted Gerizim for Ebal in <a href="/deuteronomy/27-4.htm" title="Therefore it shall be when you be gone over Jordan, that you shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with plaster.">Deuteronomy 27:4</a>, to support its claim to sanctity, and maintained that it, and not the Temple at Jerusalem, was the chosen sanctuary of Jehovah. They too were looking for the Messiah, who would come as a prophet, and tell them all things (<a href="/john/4-25.htm" title="The woman said to him, I know that Messias comes, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.">John 4:25</a>). Such was the relative position of the two races in the time of our Lord's ministry, and we cannot wonder that He should have shrunk (if we may so speak) from bringing His disciples at the outset of their work into contact with a people who hated all Jews, and whom all Jews had learnt to hate in return. He Himself, however, had not shrunk from that contact; and some few of the disciples, at all events, had, at an early period of His work, learnt that He saw in them those whom He owned as the sheep of His flock, though not of that fold. In the narrative now before us we find Him apparently endeavouring to continue the work which had then begun so successfully. (See Note on <a href="/john/4-39.htm" title="And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.">John 4:39</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 52.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And sent messengers before his face</span>. Probably, as the sequel shows, these were John and James. This was necessary at this period of the Lord's life. A numerous company now usually followed the Lord; it is probable that many of those most devoted to him, both men and women, scarcely ever left him, now that the popular enthusiasm was waning, and the number of his deadly enemies increasing. <span class="cmt_word">And they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him</span>. These Samaritans were the descendants of a, mixed race brought by Esarhaddon ( <span class="date">eighth century B.C.</span>) from Babylon, Cuthah, Ava, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, to replace the ten tribes carried captive to the East. These became worshippers of Jehovah, and, on the return of Judah and Benjamin from captivity, sought to be allowed to share in the rebuilding of the temple, and then to be admitted as Jews to share in the religious privileges of the chosen race. Their wishes, however, were not complied with. They subsequently erected a rival temple on Mount Gerizim, and henceforward were known as a schismatical sect, and continued in a state of deadly enmity with the orthodox Jews. This bitter hatred is noticed in the New Testament (see <a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9</a>), where it is stated that the Jews "had no dealings with the Samaritans," whom they looked on as worse than heathen. In the synagogues these Samaritans were cursed. The Son of Sirach named them as a people that they abhorred (Ecclus. 1:25, 26); and in the Talmud we read this terrible passage, "Let not the Samaritans have part in the resurrection!"
