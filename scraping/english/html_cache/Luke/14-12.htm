Here, He addresses the host of a meal, a common setting for His teachings. In Jewish culture, meals were significant social events, often used to establish or reinforce social bonds. Jesus uses this opportunity to challenge societal norms and expectations.<p><b>When you host a dinner or a banquet</b><br>Hosting a meal in ancient Jewish society was a sign of wealth and social status. Banquets were occasions for displaying hospitality and generosity. Jesus is addressing the cultural practice of reciprocal hospitality, where hosts expected to be repaid with similar invitations.<p><b>do not invite your friends or brothers or relatives or rich neighbors</b><br>Jesus challenges the conventional wisdom of inviting those who can reciprocate. In the cultural context, inviting friends, family, and wealthy neighbors was a way to maintain social standing and ensure future invitations. Jesus calls for a radical departure from this self-serving practice.<p><b>Otherwise, they may invite you in return, and you will be repaid</b><br>The expectation of reciprocity was deeply ingrained in the culture. Jesus points out that such actions are self-serving, as they seek earthly rewards rather than heavenly ones. This teaching aligns with His broader message of selflessness and serving others without expecting anything in return, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6.htm">Matthew 6:1-4</a>, where He speaks about giving in secret.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, offering a teaching on humility and selflessness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_host.htm">The Host</a></b><br>A Pharisee who invited Jesus to a meal, representing those who seek social status and reciprocity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/friends,_brothers,_relatives,_rich_neighbors.htm">Friends, Brothers, Relatives, Rich Neighbors</a></b><br>Symbolic of those whom society typically favors in social gatherings for mutual benefit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/luncheon_or_dinner.htm">Luncheon or Dinner</a></b><br>A social event where cultural norms of reciprocity and social climbing were often practiced.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees'_house.htm">Pharisees' House</a></b><br>The setting of this teaching, highlighting the cultural and religious context of the time.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/selfless_generosity.htm">Selfless Generosity</a></b><br>Jesus calls us to give without expecting anything in return, challenging societal norms of reciprocity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/true_hospitality.htm">True Hospitality</a></b><br>Biblical hospitality extends beyond social circles to include those who cannot repay us, reflecting God's grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/k/kingdom_values.htm">Kingdom Values</a></b><br>The Kingdom of God operates on principles of love and selflessness, contrasting with worldly values of status and gain.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_rewards.htm">Eternal Rewards</a></b><br>Our focus should be on eternal rewards rather than temporary, earthly recognition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_service.htm">Humility in Service</a></b><br>Serving others without seeking personal gain reflects Christ's humility and love.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_14_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 14:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_14_12_Rethink_hospitality_norms.htm">How does Luke 14:12 challenge our approach to hospitality and generosity?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Luke_14_12_show_selfless_giving.htm">What does Jesus' teaching in Luke 14:12 reveal about selfless giving?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_invite_the_poor_today.htm">How can we apply "invite the poor" from Luke 14:12 today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Old_Testament_links_to_Luke_14_12.htm">What Old Testament principles align with Jesus' message in Luke 14:12?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Luke_14_12_Seek_eternal_over_earthly.htm">How does Luke 14:12 encourage us to seek eternal rewards over earthly ones?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_14_12_on_selflessness_hospitality.htm">What does Luke 14:12 teach about selflessness and hospitality?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Luke_14_12_vs_societal_reciprocity.htm">How does Luke 14:12 challenge societal norms on reciprocity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_invite_the_poor_in_Luke_14_12.htm">Why does Jesus emphasize inviting the poor in Luke 14:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_14.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/honor_parents_or_not_(ex._20_12_vs._lk._14_26).htm">Should we honor our parents?

It might not be wrong in itself, but it could take no place, as the Pharisee clearly thought it would do, in the list of good works by which he sought to win God's favour. The very fact that it met with its reward on earth excluded it, almost <span class= "ital">ipso facto,</span> from the reward of the resurrection of the just.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompense be made thee. This remark of Jesus took place somewhat later in the course of the feast.</span> Those present were evidently mostly, if not all, drawn from the upper ranks of Jewish society, and the banquet was no doubt a luxurious and costly entertainment. Godet's comment is singularly interesting, and well brings out the half-sorrowful, half-playful sarcasm of the Master. He was the rich Pharisee's Guest; he was partaking of his hospitality, although, it is true, no friendly feelings had dictated the invitation to the feast, but still he was partaking of the man's bread and salt; and then, too, the miserable society tradition which then as now dictates such conventional hospitality, all contributed to soften the Master's stern condemnation of the pompous hollow entertainments; so he "addresses to his host a lesson on charity, which he clothes, like 'the preceding, in the graceful form of a recommendation of intelligent self-interest." The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">lest</span> (ver. 12), carries a tone of liveliness and almost of pleasantry. "Beware of it; it is a misfortune to be avoided. For, once thou shalt have received human requital, it is all over with Divine recompense." Jesus did not mean to forbid our entertaining those whom we love. He means simply, "In view of the life to come, thou canst do better still." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/14-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7964;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Elegen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
