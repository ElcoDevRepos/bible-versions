In biblical prophecy, "that day" frequently denotes a moment of God's decisive action, as seen in passages like <a href="/zechariah/14.htm">Zechariah 14:1</a> and <a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5</a>. It emphasizes urgency and the need for readiness, echoing themes found in the Olivet Discourse (Matthew 24, <a href="/mark/13.htm">Mark 13</a>).<p><b>let no one on the housetop come down to retrieve his possessions</b><br>In ancient Israel, houses often had flat roofs used for various activities, accessible by an external staircase.

The instruction parallels the urgency found in the story of Lot's escape from Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-17.htm">Genesis 19:17</a>), where lingering or looking back led to destruction. It underscores the transient nature of earthly possessions compared to eternal matters.<p><b>Likewise, let no one in the field return for anything he has left behind</b><br>Fields were common places of work, and this phrase highlights the necessity of leaving behind daily labor and concerns when faced with divine intervention. It reflects the call to discipleship, where following Christ requires leaving behind former ways of life (<a href="/luke/9-62.htm">Luke 9:62</a>).

The Lord, with this striking imagery, describes, not the attitude which men who would be saved must assume when he appears with power and great glory - there will be no time then to shape any new way of life - but it pictures the attitude they must always maintain, if they would be his servants, towards the things of this world. His servants must be ready to abandon all earthly blessings at a moment's notice; none but those who have been sitting loosely to these will be able, when the sudden cry comes, at once to toss away all, and so to meet the long-tarrying Bridegroom. The reminder of Lot's wife - a very familiar story to Jews - warned all would-be disciples of the danger of the double service, God and the world, and how likely the one who attempted it would be to perish miserably. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/17-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">On</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
