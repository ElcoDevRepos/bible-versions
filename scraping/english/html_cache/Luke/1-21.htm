This reflects the communal aspect of Jewish worship, where the priest's actions inside the temple were closely connected to the people's prayers outside. The anticipation of the people highlights the importance of the priestly role and the expectation of divine interaction during these sacred rituals.<p><b>and wondering why he took so long in the temple.</b><br>The delay of Zechariah inside the temple was unusual and would have caused concern among the people. The temple service was a well-ordered and time-sensitive ritual, and any deviation from the norm could signify an extraordinary event. This moment foreshadows the divine encounter Zechariah experienced with the angel Gabriel, which was a rare and significant occurrence. The people's wonderment sets the stage for the revelation of God's intervention in human history, as seen in other biblical instances where divine messages were delivered in unexpected ways, such as the angelic announcements to Mary and the shepherds later in Luke's Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A priest serving in the temple, chosen by lot to burn incense.

The Talmud tells us that even the high priest did not terry long in the holy of holies on the Day of Atonement. The same feeling of holy awe would induce the ministering priest of the day to perform his functions with no unnecessary delay, and to leave as soon as possible the holy place. The people praying in the court without were in the habit of waiting until the priest on duty came out of the sacred inner chamber, after which they were dismissed with the blessing. The unusual delay in the appearance of Zacharias puzzled and disturbed the worshippers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/1-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Meanwhile,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
