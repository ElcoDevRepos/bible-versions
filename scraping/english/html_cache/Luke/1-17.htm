The role of going "before the Lord" indicates a forerunner or herald, similar to how ancient kings would have messengers announce their arrival. This aligns with the prophecy in <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, where a messenger is sent to prepare the way for the Lord.<p><b>in the spirit and power of Elijah</b><br>Elijah was a prophet known for his boldness and miraculous deeds, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17-19</a>. The reference to Elijah here is not about a literal reincarnation but rather that John the Baptist would embody the same prophetic spirit and power. This connection is significant because Elijah was expected to return before the "great and dreadful day of the Lord" (<a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5</a>), and John fulfills this role symbolically.<p><b>to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children</b><br>This phrase emphasizes reconciliation and restoration of relationships, a theme central to the message of repentance that John the Baptist preached. It echoes <a href="/malachi/4-6.htm">Malachi 4:6</a>, which speaks of turning the hearts of fathers to their children, symbolizing a return to righteous living and covenant faithfulness.<p><b>and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous</b><br>John's mission included calling people to repentance, turning them from disobedience to a life aligned with God's wisdom. This transformation is a hallmark of true repentance, where individuals abandon sinful ways and embrace the teachings and lifestyle of the righteous, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, which highlights the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom.<p><b>to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</b><br>The ultimate goal of John's ministry was to prepare the people for the coming of Jesus Christ. This preparation involved spiritual readiness, repentance, and a return to God. The concept of preparation is akin to <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, which speaks of preparing the way for the Lord, making straight paths for Him, indicating a call to holiness and readiness for the Messiah's arrival.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>The verse refers to John the Baptist, who is prophesied to come in the spirit and power of Elijah.

There was a confident hope among the Jews, dating frown the days of the prophecy of Malachi, some four hundred years before the vision of Zacharias, that the days of Messiah would be heralded by an appearance of the Prophet Elijah. The selfsame expectation is still cherished by every pious Jew. <span class="cmt_word">To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just.</span> The usual explanation of these words of the angel, who uses here the language of Malachi (<a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5, 6</a>), is that the result of the preaching of this new prophet, who is about to be raised up, will be to restore harmony to the broken and disturbed family life of Israel, whereas now the home life of the chosen race was split up - the fathers, perhaps, siding with the foreign or Roman faction, as represented by Herod and his friends; the sons, on the other hand, being Zealots attached to the national party, bitterly hostile to the Herodians. So also in one house some would belong to the Pharisee, others to the Sadducee, sect. These fatal divisions would, in many cases, be healed by the influence of the coming one. There is, however, another interpretation far deeper and more satisfactory; for nothing in the preaching of the Baptist, as far as we are aware, bore specially on the domestic dissensions of the people; it had a much wider range. The true sense of the angel's words here should be gathered from prophetic passages such as <a href="/isaiah/29-22.htm">Isaiah 29:22, 23</a>, "Jacob shall no more be ashamed, neither shall his face wax pale, when he seeth (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) his children become the work of my hands;" <a href="/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>, "Doubtless thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O Lord, art our Father, our Redeemer!" -The patriarchs, the fathers of Israel, beholding from their abodes of rest the works and days of their degenerate children, mourned over their fall, and, to use earthly language, "were ashamed" of the conduct of their unworthy descendants. These would be glad and rejoice over the result of the preaching of the coming prophet. Godct well sums up the angel's words: "It will be John's mission then to reconstitute the moral unity of the people by restoring the broken relation between the patriarchs and their degenerate descendants." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/1-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">he</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
