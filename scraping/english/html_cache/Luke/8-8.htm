In the parable of the sower, the "good soil" represents those who hear the word, understand it, and bear fruit. This imagery is rooted in agricultural practices familiar to Jesus' audience, where soil quality determined the success of a crop. Spiritually, it signifies a heart prepared to receive and nurture the gospel. The concept of "good soil" can be connected to the Old Testament, where the heart is often described as the seat of understanding and receptivity (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>).<p><b>where it sprang up and produced a crop&#8212;a hundredfold.</b><br>The phrase "sprang up and produced a crop&#8212;a hundredfold" emphasizes the abundant and miraculous yield that results from the word of God taking root in a receptive heart. In ancient Palestine, a tenfold yield was considered good, so a hundredfold is extraordinary, symbolizing divine blessing and the supernatural power of God's word. This echoes the promise of fruitfulness found in <a href="/genesis/26-12.htm">Genesis 26:12</a>, where Isaac reaped a hundredfold because the Lord blessed him. It also points to the transformative power of the gospel, which can produce spiritual fruit beyond human expectation.<p><b>As Jesus said this, He called out,</b><br>This indicates the importance and urgency of Jesus' message. By calling out, Jesus emphasizes the need for attentive listening and understanding. It reflects the teaching style of a rabbi who seeks to engage his audience fully. This method of teaching is consistent with the prophetic tradition, where prophets often called out to the people to heed God's message (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/58.htm">Isaiah 58:1</a>).<p><b>&#8220;He who has ears to hear, let him hear.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase is a call to discernment and spiritual awareness. It challenges listeners to go beyond mere auditory reception to a deeper, spiritual understanding. This call is a recurring theme in Jesus' teachings (e.g., <a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>, <a href="/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>) and serves as a warning that not everyone will understand or accept the message of the kingdom. It underscores the necessity of a willing and open heart to truly comprehend and act upon the teachings of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching a parable to a large crowd.

This is by no means an unheard-of increase even in the West, where vegetation is less luxuriant. Herodotus, quoted by Trench ('Parables'), mentions that two hundredfold was a common return in the Plain of Babylon, and sometimes three hundredfold; and Niebuhr mentions a species of maize that returns four hundredfold. On the marvellous fruit-bearing which would take place in the days of the Lord's future kingdom on earth, Irenaeus gives a quotation from Papias, who gave it on the authority of those who had heard St. John speak of the teaching of the Lord to that effect. Professor Westcott ('Introduction to the Study of the Gospels,' Appendix C, 21) thinks that the tradition was based on the real discourses of the Lord. It is, of course, allegorical, for is it not a memory cf. a conversation between Jesus and his disciples arising out of this parable of the sower? "The Lord taught of those days (of his future kingdom on earth) and said, The <span class="accented">days will come in which vines shall spring up</span>, <span class="accented">each having</span>, <span class="accented">ten thousand stocks</span>, <span class="accented">and on each stock ten thousand branches</span>, <span class="accented">and on each branch ten thousand shoots</span>, <span class="accented">and on each shoot ten thousand bunches</span>, <span class="accented">and on each bunch ten thousand grapes</span>, <span class="accented">and each grape when pressed shalt give five and twenty measures of wine.
