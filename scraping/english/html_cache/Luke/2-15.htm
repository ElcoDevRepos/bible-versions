Angels are often messengers of God, as seen in other biblical accounts such as <a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21-23</a> and <a href="/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>. Their return to heaven indicates the completion of their earthly mission. Heaven is depicted as the dwelling place of God and His angels, reinforcing the divine origin of the message delivered to the shepherds.<p><b>the shepherds said to one another</b><br>Shepherds were considered lowly and humble in Jewish society, often marginalized and living on the outskirts. Their role in this narrative highlights God's choice to reveal the birth of Christ to the humble and lowly, aligning with themes found in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>, where God chooses the weak to shame the strong. The shepherds' immediate response to the angelic message demonstrates their faith and willingness to act upon divine revelation.<p><b>&#8220;Let us go to Bethlehem</b><br>Bethlehem, known as the City of David, holds significant historical and prophetic importance. It is the prophesied birthplace of the Messiah, as foretold in <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>. The town is also the setting for the story of Ruth and Boaz, ancestors of David, and ultimately, Jesus. The shepherds' decision to go to Bethlehem fulfills the angelic message and aligns with God's redemptive plan through history.<p><b>and see this thing that has happened</b><br>The shepherds express a desire to witness the fulfillment of the angelic announcement. This reflects a common biblical theme of seeking and witnessing God's works, as seen in <a href="/psalms/66-5.htm">Psalm 66:5</a>. Their eagerness to see the event underscores the importance of personal experience and testimony in the life of faith.<p><b>which the Lord has made known to us.&#8221;</b><br>The shepherds acknowledge that the revelation comes from the Lord, emphasizing God's initiative in revealing His plans to humanity. This divine disclosure is consistent with God's pattern of revealing His will to those He chooses, as seen in <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>. The phrase also highlights the shepherds' recognition of the Lord's sovereignty and their role as recipients of His grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Heavenly messengers who announced the birth of Jesus to the shepherds.

Just as Gabriel left Mary once his assignment was complete (<a href="/luke/1-38.htm">Luke 1:38</a>), these angels withdraw the moment their task is done, underlining that every angelic appearance is purposeful and timed by God (<a href="/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Their exit signals a shift from supernatural announcement to human response. God often allows a holy silence after revelation so that people can choose faith-filled action&#8212;think of Elijah after the fire and earthquake, listening for the still small voice (<a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And gone into heaven</b><p>&#8226; Scripture treats heaven as a real locale, not myth. The angels &#8220;went into heaven,&#8221; the same direction the risen Christ would later ascend (<a href="/acts/1-10.htm">Acts 1:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; By returning there, the angels show they are servants dispatched from God&#8217;s throne (<a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>). Their departure reminds us that every revelation ultimately points back to the glory of God in heaven (<a href="/revelation/5-13.htm">Revelation 5:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The shepherds said to one another</b><p>&#8226; Notice the immediate peer-to-peer conversation. Faith stirs community; they don&#8217;t keep the news private. The early church mirrored this pattern when believers &#8220;spoke the word of God boldly&#8221; together after fresh revelation (<a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31-32</a>).<p>&#8226; Shepherds&#8212;ordinary laborers&#8212;illustrate God&#8217;s delight in using humble people (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>). Their dialogue models how spiritual truth is meant to be shared and confirmed in fellowship (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let us go to Bethlehem</b><p>&#8226; Their response is active, not theoretical. Like Abraham who, upon hearing God&#8217;s word, &#8220;went as the Lord had told him&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>), the shepherds move without delay.<p>&#8226; Bethlehem matters: <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a> foretold Messiah&#8217;s birthplace, and the shepherds step right into that fulfilled prophecy. Obedience aligns believers with God&#8217;s redemptive timetable (<a href="/john/7-42.htm">John 7:42</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And see this thing that has happened</b><p>&#8226; They expect to witness something already accomplished. Faith treats God&#8217;s word as fact before evidence is in hand (<a href="/hebrews/11-1.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Their desire to &#8220;see&#8221; echoes John&#8217;s later testimony: &#8220;What we have seen with our eyes&#8230; we proclaim to you&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1-3</a>). Encounter precedes proclamation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Which the Lord has made known to us</b><p>&#8226; The shepherds credit God, not angels, as the source of revelation. True messengers always point away from themselves to the Lord (<a href="/revelation/22-8.htm">Revelation 22:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; God chooses to reveal the advent of His Son to shepherds rather than kings, fulfilling Jesus&#8217; later prayer: &#8220;You have hidden these things from the wise and learned and revealed them to little children&#8221; (<a href="/luke/10-21.htm">Luke 10:21-22</a>). This underscores divine grace toward the lowly (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/2-15.htm">Luke 2:15</a> shows a seamless flow: divine revelation, angelic withdrawal, human conversation, immediate obedience, personal encounter, and grateful acknowledgment of God&#8217;s initiative.
