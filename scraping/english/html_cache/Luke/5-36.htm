This approach allowed listeners to engage with the message on multiple levels, often revealing deeper meanings to those who were spiritually perceptive. Parables were a way to fulfill prophecy, as seen in <a href="/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a>, which speaks of teaching in parables.<p><b>No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and sews it on an old one:</b><br>This imagery would have been familiar to Jesus' audience, who understood the value of garments and the impracticality of using new fabric to patch old clothing. The new cloth represents the new covenant and teachings of Jesus, which cannot be simply added to the old covenant of the Law. This reflects the transformative nature of Jesus' ministry, which was not just an addition to Judaism but a fulfillment and expansion of it.<p><b>If he does, he will tear the new garment as well:</b><br>This phrase highlights the damage done to the new garment, symbolizing the loss or compromise of the new covenant's integrity when mixed with the old. It underscores the incompatibility of the new teachings of Jesus with the old legalistic practices. This can be connected to <a href="/galatians/5-4.htm">Galatians 5:4</a>, where Paul warns against mixing law and grace.<p><b>and the patch from the new will not match the old:</b><br>The mismatch signifies the fundamental differences between the old and new covenants. The new covenant, based on grace and truth through Jesus Christ, cannot be contained within the old framework of the Law. This is further illustrated in <a href="/hebrews/8-13.htm">Hebrews 8:13</a>, which speaks of the old covenant becoming obsolete with the establishment of the new.

Parables deliver literal divine wisdom through familiar images (<a href="/matthew/13-34.htm">Matthew 13:34&#8211;35</a>). In the immediate context, He has just answered questions about fasting (<a href="/luke/5-33.htm">Luke 5:33&#8211;35</a>). By moving to a parable, He signals that the coming point transcends ritual debates and exposes the heart issue&#8212;whether people will receive the new work God is doing through His Son (<a href="/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and sews it on an old one</b><p>Listeners knew you would never ruin a brand-new cloak just to fix a worn-out one.

Oriental teaching has ever delighted in using these vivid and picturesque metaphors and parables taken from the everyday life of the people; here the reference is, of course, to the question put by the. Pharisees and John's disciples respecting fasting. This and the following little parable, and the curious simile which he added directly after, is part of the Lord's answer to his questioners. They charged him in their query with throwing (by the neglect of fasting) a slur on the time-honoured practices and observances of the most religious men of Israel. His reply acknowledged that, as far as he was concerned, they were right. He had quietly put aside the rigidly appointed fasts and other ceremonial rites by means of which the great Jewish teachers - to use their own expression - had put a hedge about the Law. They were right, too, in the conclusion they had come to, implied but not expressed, in their evidently hostile questioning. His <span class="accented">was</span> a totally new form of the old Hebrew' religon - new altogether in the grandeur of its conception and in the breadth of its influence. His was a totally new garment that he was about to offer to the people; now to patch up the beautiful new work with the old one would be surely to mar both. In the older authorities the text is slightly longer and more vivid than the text from which our own more corrupt Authorized Version was translated. It would run thus: "No one rending a patch from a new garment putteth it upon an old garment." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/5-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He also told</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7964;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Elegen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
