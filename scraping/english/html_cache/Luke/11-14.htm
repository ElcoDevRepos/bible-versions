The mention of a "mute" demon highlights the specific affliction it caused, which was the inability to speak. This reflects the belief in the ancient world that physical ailments could be caused by spiritual forces. The act of driving out demons is a sign of the in-breaking of God's kingdom, as Jesus fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, where the mute will speak. This event also underscores Jesus' role as the Messiah, who has power over evil.<p><b>And when the demon was gone, the man who had been mute spoke.</b><br>The immediate restoration of speech upon the demon's departure illustrates the direct impact of Jesus' miraculous intervention. This healing serves as a testament to Jesus' divine authority and compassion. It also fulfills the messianic expectations found in the Old Testament, where the coming of the Messiah would bring healing and restoration (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>). The transformation of the man's condition from silence to speech symbolizes the liberation and renewal that Jesus brings to those oppressed by spiritual forces.<p><b>The crowds were amazed,</b><br>The reaction of the crowds reflects the common response to Jesus' miracles throughout the Gospels. Their amazement indicates both a recognition of the extraordinary nature of Jesus' actions and a sense of wonder at His authority. This amazement often leads to a division among the people, as some are drawn to faith while others remain skeptical or hostile. The crowd's reaction also sets the stage for the subsequent discussions and controversies about Jesus' identity and the source of His power, as seen in the following verses.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, performing a miraculous act of driving out a demon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mute_man.htm">The Mute Man</a></b><br>A man afflicted by a demon that caused him to be mute, who is healed by Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_demon.htm">The Demon</a></b><br>A spiritual being causing the man's muteness, which Jesus expels.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowds.htm">The Crowds</a></b><br>The people witnessing the miracle, who react with amazement.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_jesus_over_demons.htm">Authority of Jesus Over Demons</a></b><br>Jesus demonstrates His divine authority by casting out demons, affirming His power over the spiritual realm.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_faith.htm">The Power of Faith</a></b><br>Witnessing Jesus' miracles should strengthen our faith in His ability to overcome any spiritual or physical affliction.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Believers are reminded of the reality of spiritual warfare and the need to rely on Jesus' power and authority in such battles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_witnessing.htm">The Role of Witnessing</a></b><br>The amazement of the crowds serves as a reminder of the importance of sharing testimonies of Jesus' work to inspire faith in others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_and_healing.htm">Compassion and Healing</a></b><br>Jesus' act of healing the mute man reflects His compassion and desire to restore individuals to wholeness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_11_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 11:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_11_14_Jesus_power_over_demons.htm">How does Luke 11:14 demonstrate Jesus' authority over evil spirits today?

Their accusation of the Lord that he was in league with the evil one. His reply.</span> The grave and terrible charge which was formally made by persons evidently of rank and position sent down from the capital to watch, and if possible to entrap, the hated Galilaean Teacher, was a charge no doubt brought against the Lord on more than one occasion. Of this we have clear evidence in the Gospel narratives. Puzzled and dismayed by the marvellous acts of power worked by Jesus, it was only too easy to say that he had friends and helpers among these spirits of evil which the Jew knew well were working unseen on earth. The circumstances under which the accusation was made, and the reply of the Lord spoken, were as follows: The scene is still in the provinces, the time somewhere in the period between October and the spring of the last Passover the period which the Master spent in that slow solemn progress, through as yet unvisited places, towards Jerusalem. Learned and experienced members of the Pharisee party, scribes and doctors of the Law, had been told off to watch the dangerous and popular Galilaean Teacher, and, whenever it was possible, to lessen his influence among the people. Jesus (ver. 14) had been occupied in one of his (probably) daily works of healing. He had expelled an evil spirit from a sufferer whose malady had assumed the grave form of insanity which refused to speak. The people around were wondering at this gracious act of power; then broke in voices of accusation, voices to challenge him to show them some sign from heaven, saying that his power was only derived from evil sources. To this the Master replies with consummate skill, knowing the trained minds with whom just then he had to do. He is interrupted by murmurs of approval from the crowd (vers. 27, 28). He notices these for a me-merit, and then proceeds in detail to reply to that subtle request that he would prove his claims by showing them some sign from heaven. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb</span>. Some very terrible and apparently helpless form of possession which manifested itself in a mute, possibly in a motionless, melancholy insanity. And the people wondered.
