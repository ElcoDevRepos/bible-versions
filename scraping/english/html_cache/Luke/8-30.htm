In ancient Jewish and Greco-Roman traditions, knowing the name of a spirit or demon was believed to give one power over it. By asking for the demon's name, Jesus demonstrates His authority over the spiritual realm. This moment also highlights Jesus' compassion and personal engagement with individuals, even those possessed by evil spirits. The act of naming in the Bible often signifies authority and understanding, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-19.htm">Genesis 2:19-20</a> when Adam names the animals.<p><b>&#8220;Legion,&#8221; he replied,</b><br>The term "Legion" is a reference to a Roman military unit, which typically consisted of about 5,000 to 6,000 soldiers. This indicates the vast number of demons possessing the man, emphasizing the severity of his condition. The use of a Roman military term also reflects the cultural and political context of the time, as Judea was under Roman occupation. This term underscores the oppressive and organized nature of the demonic forces, drawing a parallel to the Roman forces that occupied the land.<p><b>because many demons had gone into him.</b><br>This phrase confirms the multitude of demons afflicting the man, illustrating the depth of his torment and the power of evil. The presence of many demons highlights the spiritual warfare theme prevalent throughout the Gospels. It also sets the stage for the demonstration of Jesus' supreme authority over evil, as He is able to command and expel such a large number of demons. This event foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ over all evil forces, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a> and fulfilled in <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who confronts the demon-possessed man.

The Lord's words, as Dean Plumptre suggests, would serve "to recall to the man's mind that he had once a human name, with all its memories of human fellowship. It was a stage, even in spite of the paroxysm that followed, in the process of recovery, in so far as it helped to disentangle him from the confusion between himself and the demons which caused his misery. But, at first, the question seems only to increase the evil. 'My name is Legion, for we are many.' The irresistible might, the full array of the Roman legion, with its six thousand soldiers, seemed to the demoniac the one adequate symbol of the wild, uncontrollable impulses of passion and of dread that were sweeping through his soul." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;What</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Ti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
