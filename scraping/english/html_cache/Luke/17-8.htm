In the first-century Greco-Roman world, servants were expected to follow the master's instructions without question. This reflects the hierarchical social structure where the master-servant relationship was clearly defined. The rhetorical nature of the question implies that the answer is obvious to the audience, highlighting the duty and obedience expected of a servant.<p><b>&#8216;Prepare my meal</b><br>The preparation of a meal was a common task for servants, indicating their role in providing for the master's needs. In biblical times, meal preparation involved significant effort, including gathering ingredients, cooking, and setting the table. This task underscores the servant's responsibility to prioritize the master's needs over their own. The act of preparing a meal can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual readiness and service, as seen in other scriptures where food and meals symbolize spiritual nourishment (e.g., <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>and dress yourself to serve me</b><br>"Dress yourself" implies readiness and proper attire for service, reflecting the cultural norms of the time where servants wore specific garments while serving. This phrase emphasizes the importance of being prepared and presentable in one's duties. The act of dressing for service can be paralleled with the Christian call to "put on" virtues such as compassion, kindness, and humility (<a href="/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>), indicating a readiness to serve God and others.<p><b>while I eat and drink,</b><br>The master eating and drinking signifies a time of relaxation and enjoyment, which the servant facilitates. This reflects the social customs of hospitality and the importance of meals as a time for fellowship and relationship-building. In biblical symbolism, eating and drinking often represent communion and fellowship with God, as seen in the Last Supper (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19-20</a>) and the future Messianic banquet (<a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>).<p><b>and afterward you may eat and drink&#8217;?</b><br>This phrase highlights the servant's delayed gratification, as they must first fulfill their duties before attending to their own needs. It reflects the principle of selflessness and prioritizing the needs of others, a key tenet of Christian discipleship (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>). The promise of eating and drinking afterward can also be seen as a type of the heavenly reward awaiting faithful servants of Christ, who are called to serve diligently in this life with the assurance of future blessings (<a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The

sits inside a brief parable (<a href="/luke/17-7.htm">Luke 17:7-10</a>) where Jesus pictures a servant coming in from the field. Rather than receiving praise or immediate refreshment, the servant is expected to continue working by preparing the master&#8217;s supper. Jesus uses this everyday scenario to show His disciples their proper attitude of humble obedience. Similar scenes appear in <a href="/matthew/24-45.htm">Matthew 24:45-47</a> and <a href="/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35-38</a>, where readiness and faithful service are highlighted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Instead, won&#8217;t he tell him,&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The master&#8217;s question underscores normal expectations in first-century households&#8212;authority belongs to the master.<p>&#8226; Jesus is not commending harshness but illustrating the rightful order between master and servant, mirroring our relationship to God (<a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6</a>; <a href="/romans/9-20.htm">Romans 9:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; The rhetorical &#8220;won&#8217;t he?&#8221; anticipates a &#8220;yes&#8221; from the listeners, setting up the lesson on duty that follows in <a href="/luke/17-10.htm">Luke 17:10</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Prepare my meal&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The servant&#8217;s first responsibility inside the house is to ready the evening meal, showing that service does not end when one task is finished (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; The verb points to intentional effort&#8212;planning, cooking, arranging&#8212;echoing how believers are to offer thoughtful, wholehearted worship (<a href="/psalms/100-2.htm">Psalm 100:2</a>; <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Dress yourself to serve me while I eat and drink&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The servant girds himself, changing clothes suited for table service. Likewise, disciples &#8220;clothe&#8221; themselves with humility (<a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>) and readiness (<a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The master expects uninterrupted attention until his needs are met. Jesus later models this by washing the disciples&#8217; feet (<a href="/john/13-4.htm">John 13:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; The picture presses home that even after strenuous labor, God&#8217;s servants keep serving until His purposes, not theirs, are satisfied (<a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;And afterward you may eat and drink&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Reward is not denied; it is simply postponed until the master&#8217;s will is complete (<a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The order&#8212;first the master, then the servant&#8212;guards against entitlement and nurtures gratitude (<a href="/luke/14-10.htm">Luke 14:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus promises that faithful servants will indeed share in His joy and banquet one day (<a href="/luke/12-37.htm">Luke 12:37</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-9</a>), but timing remains His.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/luke/17-8.htm">Luke 17:8</a> reminds believers that, like household servants, we owe continuous, humble service to our Lord. Our first priority is His honor and satisfaction; only then comes our refreshment. By embracing this attitude, we echo Jesus&#8217; own words: &#8220;We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty&#8221; (<a href="/luke/17-10.htm">Luke 17:10</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Gird thyself, and serve me.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">minister to me.</span> The words receive a fresh significance if we connect them with <a href="/luke/12-37.htm" title="Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he comes shall find watching: truly I say to you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.">Luke 12:37</a>, of which they are, as it were, the complement. There the Master promises that He will gird Himself, and minister to His disciples. Here He tells them that He too requires a service. They must give Him the meat and the drink of seeing that His Father's will is done on earth (<a href="/john/4-32.htm" title="But he said to them, I have meat to eat that you know not of.">John 4:32</a>; <a href="/john/4-34.htm" title="Jesus said to them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.">John 4:34</a>), and then they too shall be sharers in His joy. Yet another aspect of the same truths is found in the later promise of the Lord of the Churches to the servant who watches for His coming, "I will sup with him, and he with Me" (<a href="/revelation/3-20.htm" title="Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.">Revelation 3:20</a>).<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/17-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Instead,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(all&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
