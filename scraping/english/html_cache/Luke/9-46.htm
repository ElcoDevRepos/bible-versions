This argument reflects their human tendencies towards pride and ambition. In the context of first-century Jewish culture, where honor and status were highly valued, it is not surprising that the disciples would be concerned with their standing. This moment also highlights their misunderstanding of the kingdom of God, which Jesus consistently taught was not about earthly power or status.<p><b>as to which of them would be the greatest.</b><br>The concept of "greatness" in the disciples' minds was likely influenced by contemporary societal norms, where greatness was associated with authority, power, and recognition. However, Jesus redefined greatness in terms of servanthood and humility, as seen in His teachings in passages like <a href="/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26-28</a>, where He states that whoever wants to become great must be a servant. This argument among the disciples foreshadows Jesus' later teachings on humility and service, which are central themes in His ministry. The disciples' debate also connects to the broader biblical narrative of human pride and the need for divine grace, as seen in stories like the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11) and the fall of Lucifer (<a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who were chosen to learn from Him and spread His teachings.

And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart.</span> Somewhere on their journey back to the south, between the neighbourhood of Caesarea Philippi and the old scene of his labours, Capernaum, this dispute must have taken place. Shortly after their arrival at Capernaum, the Master called them together, and gave them the following lesson on human greatness. <span class="cmt_word">Took a child, and set him by him</span>. St. Mark mentions that this teaching was "in the house," and commentators have suggested, with some probability, that the house was St. Peter's, and the child one of his. Clement of Alexandria ('Stromata,' 3:448, B) especially mentions that this apostle had children. St. Matthew relates this incident at greater length, and, still dwelling upon the text of "<span class="accented">the</span> little <span class="accented">one</span>," gives us another and different sketch of the <span class="accented">Master's</span> teaching on this occasion. St. Mark tells us how Jesus folded his arms round the little creature in loving fondness. If the child, as above suggested, was Peter's own, such an incident as that embrace would never have been forgotten by the father, and would, of course, find a place in the memoir of his faithful disciple Mark. A (late) tradition of the Eastern Church identifies this child with him who afterwards became the famous Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, a martyr. Ignatius styled himself Theophoros; this, understood in a <span class="accented">passive</span> sense, would signify "one who had been carried by God." But in this Father's own writings we find the name used by himself in an <span class="accented">active</span> sense, as "one who carries God within himself." <span class="accented">And Jesus</span>, <span class="accented">perceiving the thought of their heart</span>, <span class="accented">took a child.</span> The dispute "which of them should be greatest," which no doubt had taken place among themselves in their last journey from the north of the Holy Land to Capernaum, was still a leading thought in the hearts of the twelve, so little had they really understood their Master's teaching, and especially his later solemn words which pointed the <span class="accented">way of the cross</span> as the only way to heaven and to <span class="accented">real greatness.</span> The Lord reads these poor sinful hearts; then, calling them together, he takes a child in his arms, and sets him by him. <span class="accented">By this action</span> the Lord answers the silent questioning thought of the worldly twelve. "The child stands as the type of the humble and childlike disciple, and (the dispute having been about the comparative greatness of the disciples) such a disciple is the greatest; he is so honoured by God that he stands on earth as the representative of Christ, and of God himself (ver. 47), since "he that is [willingly] least among you all, the same shall be [truly] great' (ver. 48)" (Meyer). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-46.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">an argument</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(dialogismos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1261.htm">Strong's 1261: </a> </span><span class="str2">From dialogizomai; discussion, i.e. consideration, or debate.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">started</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7984;&#963;&#8134;&#955;&#952;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Eis&#275;lthen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1525.htm">Strong's 1525: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go in, come in, enter.
