The "arm" of God is a metaphor for His ability to act decisively in history, often in delivering His people. This imagery is consistent with Old Testament references, such as in <a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>, where God's right hand is described as glorious in power, shattering the enemy. The mighty deeds could refer to God's historical acts of salvation and judgment, such as the deliverance of Israel from Egypt, victories in battles, and the preservation of the remnant. These acts demonstrate God's sovereignty and faithfulness to His covenant promises. Theologically, this phrase underscores God's active involvement in the world, fulfilling His purposes through His divine power.<p><b>He has scattered those who are proud in the thoughts of their hearts.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's opposition to pride and arrogance. The scattering of the proud is a theme found throughout Scripture, where God humbles those who exalt themselves. <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a> warns that pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. The phrase "in the thoughts of their hearts" suggests that God discerns the inner attitudes and intentions of individuals, not just their outward actions. This scattering can be seen in historical events where God disrupts the plans of the proud, such as the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>) or the downfall of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/4-28.htm">Daniel 4:28-37</a>). In the New Testament, this theme is echoed in the teachings of Jesus, who often spoke against the self-righteousness of the Pharisees. This phrase serves as a reminder of the biblical principle that God exalts the humble and brings down the proud, aligning with the broader narrative of God's justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>- The mother of Jesus, who is speaking this verse as part of the Magnificat, a song of praise to God for His mighty works and mercy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>- The subject of the verse, who performs mighty deeds and scatters the proud.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_proud.htm">The Proud</a></b><br>- Those who are arrogant in their thoughts and hearts, whom God scatters.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>- The nation to whom Mary belongs, often the recipient of God's mighty deeds throughout history.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_magnificat.htm">The Magnificat</a></b><br>- The song of praise from Mary, found in <a href="/luke/1-46.htm">Luke 1:46-55</a>, expressing themes of God's power, mercy, and justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_mighty_arm.htm">God's Mighty Arm</a></b><br>God's power is unmatched, and His deeds are mighty.

The &#8220;arm&#8221; pictures His personal strength reaching into human history&#8212;never distant, always engaged.<p>&#8226; All through Scripture, that arm rescues and redeems. <a href="/psalms/98-1.htm">Psalm 98:1</a> rejoices, &#8220;His right hand and holy arm have worked salvation for Him,&#8221; echoing the Red Sea deliverance where Moses sang, &#8220;Your right hand, O LORD, was majestic in power&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Those mighty deeds are not relics of the past. <a href="/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a> foretells, &#8220;The LORD has bared His holy arm before all the nations,&#8221; fulfilled supremely when God raised Jesus from the dead; Paul ties resurrection power to &#8220;the immeasurable greatness of His power toward us who believe&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Mary&#8217;s song in <a href="/bsb/luke/1.htm">Luke 1</a> celebrates that identical power now moving toward her&#8212;an unwed village girl&#8212;showing that God&#8217;s strength is perfect for the weak and available today.<p>&#8226; Practical take-away: Whatever threatens or overwhelms, the same arm that hurled plagues on Egypt and rolled away the stone is active for believers, inviting trust rather than anxiety (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He has scattered those who are proud in the thoughts of their hearts</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s power also overturns human arrogance. &#8220;He has scattered those who are proud in the thoughts of their hearts&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-51.htm">Luke 1:51</a>) traces a consistent biblical rhythm: the proud devise, but the Lord disperses.<p>&#8226; The Tower of Babel shows the pattern&#8212;&#8220;the LORD scattered them from there over the face of all the earth&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/11-8.htm">Genesis 11:8</a>). Centuries later, He shattered Pharaoh&#8217;s pride (<a href="/exodus/14-18.htm">Exodus 14:18</a>) and humbled Nebuchadnezzar until he confessed, &#8220;He is able to humble those who walk in pride&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/4-37.htm">Daniel 4:37</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a> warns, &#8220;He mocks the mockers,&#8221; a truth repeated in <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a> and <a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>: &#8220;God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.&#8221; The scattering in <a href="/bsb/luke/1.htm">Luke 1</a> is not random cruelty; it is righteous correction, dismantling self-reliance so that sinners may seek mercy.<p>&#8226; Notice where pride operates&#8212;&#8220;in the thoughts of their hearts.&#8221; God reads motives, not merely actions (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). That insight invites honest self-examination: Have I become self-sufficient, crediting success to my own insight? When pride rules, unity fractures, plans unravel, and peace evaporates&#8212;evidence of divine scattering meant to draw us back to humility under His mighty hand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/1-51.htm">Luke 1:51</a> shows a two-sided portrait of God&#8217;s unchanging character. With one strong arm He works breathtaking rescue for those who trust Him; with the same power He scatters every proud scheme. Leaning on His strength brings deliverance; clinging to self-importance invites downfall. The choice is simple: humble faith finds the mighty arm raised in our favor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(51) <span class= "bld">He hath shewed strength.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">He wrought strength.</span> Here the parallelism with <a href="/1_samuel/2-3.htm" title="Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogance come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.">1Samuel 2:3</a> becomes very close. Of whom the speaker thought as among the "proud," we cannot know. They may have been the potentates of the world in which she lived, Herod and the Emperor of Rome. They may have been the men of Jerusalem, who despised Galilee; or those of the other towns and villages of Galilee, who despised Nazareth; or, though less probably, those of Nazareth itself, who despised the carpenter and his betrothed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 51-53.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath showed strength with his arm; he hath soattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree. He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away</span>. From adoration, Mary's hymn proceeds to celebrate the mighty results effected by the Divine pity. As so often in thee prophetic strains, the speaker or writer speaks or writes as though the future had become the past; so Mary here describes the Messianic reversal of man's conception of what is great and little, as though the unborn Babe had already lived and done his strange mighty work in the world. The "glorious arm" which, in old days, had wrought such mighty things for Israel, she recognized as belonging to the coming Deliverer (verse 51). His chosen instruments would be those of whom the world thought little, like herself. The proud and mighty would be put down; the men of low degree, and poor and humble, would be exalted. The hungry would be filled; and they who were rich only in this world's goods would have no share in the new kingdom - they would be sent empty away. How strangely had the virgin of Nazareth caught the thought, almost the very words, of the famous sermon her Divine Son, some thirty years later, preached on the mountain-side near Gennesaret! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/1-51.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He has performed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#960;&#959;&#943;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Epoi&#275;sen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4160.htm">Strong's 4160: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I make, manufacture, construct, (b) I do, act, cause.
