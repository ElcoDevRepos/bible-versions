In Jewish culture, shaking off the dust from one's feet was a gesture of disassociation and judgment, indicating that the town was considered pagan or unclean. This act is rooted in the Jewish practice of shaking off Gentile dust when returning to Israel, signifying separation from those outside the covenant community. The disciples' action served as a public declaration that the town had rejected the message of the Gospel and, consequently, the peace and blessings associated with it. This gesture is also a warning of impending judgment, as seen in other biblical instances where rejection of God's messengers leads to divine consequences (e.g., <a href="/acts/13-51.htm">Acts 13:51</a>).<p><b>Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God is near.</b><br>This statement emphasizes the urgency and immediacy of the message the disciples were delivering. The "kingdom of God" refers to God's sovereign rule and the fulfillment of His promises through Jesus Christ. The phrase "is near" indicates that the kingdom is both present in the person and work of Jesus and imminent in its full realization. This echoes the prophetic announcements in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>, where the coming of God's reign is proclaimed as good news. The nearness of the kingdom calls for a response of repentance and faith, as seen in Jesus' own preaching (<a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>). The disciples' proclamation serves as both an invitation to enter the kingdom and a warning of the consequences of rejecting it.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a
