Jesus had instructed Peter and John to go into the city and follow a man carrying a jar of water to a house where they would prepare the Passover. The fact that they found everything exactly as Jesus had described underscores His divine foreknowledge and authority. This mirrors other instances in the Gospels where Jesus demonstrates His omniscience, such as when He tells Nathanael He saw him under the fig tree (<a href="/john/1-48.htm">John 1:48</a>) or when He instructs Peter to find a coin in a fish's mouth (<a href="/matthew/17-27.htm">Matthew 17:27</a>). The disciples' experience here reinforces the reliability of Jesus' words and the fulfillment of His promises.<p><b>And they prepared the Passover.</b><br>The preparation of the Passover is significant both historically and theologically. The Passover commemorates the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, as described in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>. It involves the sacrifice of a lamb, which is a type of Christ, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The preparation would have included securing a lamb, ensuring it was without blemish, and making arrangements for the meal, which included unleavened bread and bitter herbs. This event foreshadows the Last Supper, where Jesus institutes the New Covenant in His blood (<a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>). The Passover meal becomes a profound symbol of Jesus' sacrificial death, aligning with the prophetic imagery of <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the suffering servant is likened to a lamb led to the slaughter. The disciples' preparation of the Passover thus sets the stage for the pivotal events of Jesus' passion and crucifixion, fulfilling the typology and prophecies of the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who instructs His disciples on how to find the place to prepare the Passover meal.
