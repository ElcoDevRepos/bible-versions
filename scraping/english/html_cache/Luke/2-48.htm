Despite knowing Jesus' divine origin, they were still surprised by His actions. This moment highlights the dual nature of Christ as both fully divine and fully human. The temple, a central place of worship and learning in Jerusalem, was a fitting location for Jesus to reveal His wisdom and understanding, even at a young age. This event foreshadows His future ministry and teaching authority.<p><b>&#8220;Child, why have You done this to us?&#8221; His mother asked.</b><br>Mary's question reveals her maternal concern and the natural distress of a parent who has temporarily lost a child. It also underscores the close relationship between Jesus and His earthly parents. The use of "Child" emphasizes Jesus' youth and the familial bond. This moment can be seen as a precursor to the later misunderstandings and challenges Jesus would face in His ministry, even from those closest to Him. It also reflects the fulfillment of Simeon's prophecy in <a href="/luke/2-35.htm">Luke 2:35</a>, where he foretold that a sword would pierce Mary's soul, indicating the emotional trials she would endure.<p><b>&#8220;Your father and I have been anxiously searching for You.&#8221;</b><br>Mary's reference to Joseph as Jesus' father highlights the legal and social role Joseph played in Jesus' life, despite Jesus' divine paternity. The anxiety expressed by Mary and Joseph is a testament to their deep love and responsibility for Jesus. This search can be seen as symbolic of humanity's search for understanding and connection with the divine. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of seeking and finding, as seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>, where God promises that those who seek Him with all their heart will find Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>At this point in the Gospel of Luke, Jesus is a twelve-year-old boy who has stayed behind in the temple in Jerusalem, engaging with the teachers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>The mother of Jesus, who expresses her concern and astonishment upon finding Jesus in the temple after searching for Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>Referred to as Jesus' father in this context, he is also part of the anxious search for Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the temple is located, and where Jesus is found after being missing for three days.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of Jewish worship and learning, where Jesus is found discussing with the teachers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_jesus'_mission.htm">Understanding Jesus' Mission</a></b><br>Jesus' actions in the temple reveal His awareness of His divine mission even at a young age.

Finding Him calmly dialoguing with the teachers in the temple left them momentarily speechless.<p>&#8226; Their astonishment echoes earlier moments of wonder surrounding Jesus&#8217; birth (<a href="/luke/2-33.htm">Luke 2:33</a>) and foreshadows repeated amazement at His ministry (<a href="/mark/6-2.htm">Mark 6:2</a>; <a href="/luke/9-43.htm">Luke 9:43</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene underscores both Jesus&#8217; uniqueness and His genuine incarnation within an ordinary family setting&#8212;parents reacting exactly as any loving parents would.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Child, why have You done this to us?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Mary addresses Him with tender family language&#8212;&#8220;Child&#8221; (compare <a href="/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a> where she calls Him &#8220;Son&#8221;). Her question arises from love, not accusation; she is trying to understand His actions.<p>&#8226; This mirrors other biblical moments when God&#8217;s people ask heartfelt &#8220;why&#8221; questions (<a href="/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/1-2.htm">Habakkuk 1:2</a>). Scripture validates honest inquiry born of relationship.<p>&#8226; Mary&#8217;s words reveal how Jesus&#8217; divine mission was still unfolding before His earthly parents; they knew He was unique (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>), yet the day-to-day implications continued to surprise them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His mother asked</b><p>&#8226; Luke foregrounds Mary&#8217;s voice&#8212;not Joseph&#8217;s&#8212;highlighting her reflective nature noted earlier (&#8220;Mary treasured up all these things,&#8221; <a href="/luke/2-19.htm">Luke 2:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Just as Mary had questioned Gabriel (<a href="/luke/1-34.htm">Luke 1:34</a>) and would later store up more memories (<a href="/luke/2-51.htm">Luke 2:51</a>), she again processes events by asking.<p>&#8226; Her role models responsive faith: she doesn&#8217;t suppress confusion; she brings it directly to Jesus, trusting Him for clarity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Your father and I have been anxiously searching for You.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Your father&#8221; points to Joseph&#8217;s legal guardianship (<a href="/matthew/1-25.htm">Matthew 1:25</a>).

Mary&#8217;s words spotlight the cost of their stewardship: raising the Messiah involved real trials.<p>&#8226; Their diligent search recalls the shepherd seeking a lost sheep (<a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4</a>) and affirms a biblical principle: those entrusted with others&#8217; care pursue them until they are found.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/2-48.htm">Luke 2:48</a> captures a heartfelt collision of the ordinary and the divine. Mary and Joseph, devoted yet limited parents, react with astonishment and anxious relief when they find their twelve-year-old Son in the temple. Mary&#8217;s tender question exposes genuine concern while underscoring that even those closest to Jesus needed to grow in understanding His mission. The verse invites readers to marvel at Jesus&#8217; uniqueness, appreciate godly parental care, and bring every perplexity&#8212;like Mary did&#8212;directly to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(48)<span class= "bld">Behold, thy father and I have sought.</span>--The latter clause expresses a continuous act, <span class= "ital">We were seeking thee; </span>and our Lord uses the same tense in His answer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 48.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.</span> Mary's words have in them something of reproach.
