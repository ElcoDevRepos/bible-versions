In the context of <a href="/luke/24-53.htm">Luke 24:53</a>, this phrase indicates the disciples' response to the resurrection and ascension of Jesus. Their continuous praise signifies a deep, abiding joy and recognition of God's sovereignty and faithfulness. This aligns with the Psalms, where praise is a frequent expression of trust and reverence for God (e.g., <a href="/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34:1</a>, "I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise will always be on my lips"). The disciples' praise is also a fulfillment of Jesus' teachings, as He emphasized the importance of worship and gratitude (<a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23-24</a>).<p><b>in the temple</b><br>The temple in Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship and a significant location in the life and ministry of Jesus. It was here that Jesus taught, confronted religious leaders, and prophesied about its destruction (<a href="/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24:1-2</a>). The disciples' presence in the temple underscores their continued connection to their Jewish heritage and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah. The temple was a place of prayer and sacrifice, symbolizing God's dwelling among His people. By praising God in the temple, the disciples were publicly affirming their faith in Jesus as the Messiah and the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets. This act also foreshadows the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, which would empower them to spread the Gospel beyond the confines of the temple and Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2:1-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who witnessed His resurrection and ascension.

The disciples have just witnessed the risen Lord depart and, confident in His promise, they return to Jerusalem filled with joy. What follows is a description of their immediate response, broken down phrase by phrase.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Praising God</b><p>&#8226; Their first instinct is worship. Earlier in the Gospel, others responded the same way&#8212;Zechariah &#8220;began to speak, praising God&#8221; when his tongue was loosed (<a href="/luke/1-64.htm">Luke 1:64</a>), and Simeon blessed God when he met the infant Jesus (<a href="/luke/2-28.htm">Luke 2:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Praise acknowledges God&#8217;s faithfulness. The disciples have seen prophecy fulfilled, from <a href="/bsb/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> to <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>; their praise springs from certainty, not mere emotion.<p>&#8226; Praise points outward. In <a href="/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a> the early church is &#8220;praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people,&#8221; showing that worship is also witness.<p>&#8226; Praise keeps the focus on God, not on themselves. As <a href="/psalms/115-1.htm">Psalm 115:1</a> declares, &#8220;Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to Your name give glory.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Continually</b><p>&#8226; The word signals an ongoing lifestyle. <a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46-47</a> echoes it: &#8220;Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts&#8230; praising God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Their perseverance flows from confidence in the risen Christ. <a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a> exhorts, &#8220;Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Continuity ties earth to heaven. <a href="/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a> pictures unending worship around the throne, and the disciples now join that eternal chorus.<p>&#8226; Practical outworking:<p>&#8211; Regular gathering (<a href="/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>)<p>&#8211; Ceaseless prayer and gratitude (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:16-18</a>)<p>&#8211; Obedient service (<a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>), because true praise shapes daily conduct.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the temple</b><p>&#8226; The temple was the heart of Jewish life. By worshiping there, the disciples affirm God&#8217;s plan first announced to Israel (<a href="/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>).<p>&#8226; Their presence fulfills Jesus&#8217; command to begin witness &#8220;in Jerusalem&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). <a href="/acts/3-1.htm">Acts 3:1</a> and <a href="/acts/5-42.htm">Acts 5:42</a> show them returning repeatedly, preaching Christ where sacrifice and Scripture met.<p>&#8226; The temple setting underscores continuity with Old Testament revelation. Solomon dedicated the first temple with praise (<a href="/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13-14</a>); now, in the second temple, praise rises again because the promised Messiah has come.<p>&#8226; It also demonstrates bold faith. The same courts where Jesus was tried (<a href="/luke/22-66.htm">Luke 22:66</a>) now ring with allegiance to Him, making their worship both declaration and invitation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/24-53.htm">Luke 24:53</a> reveals a community shaped by the resurrection: worshiping hearts (&#8220;praising God&#8221;), steady devotion (&#8220;continually&#8221;), and public witness (&#8220;in the temple&#8221;). The verse invites believers today to live the same rhythm&#8212;constant, joyful, Christ-centered praise that spills into everyday life and visible testimony.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(53) <span class= "bld">And were continually in the temple.</span>--The statement is obviously not inconsistent with that in the Acts (<a href="/acts/1-13.htm" title="And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where stayed both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.">Acts 1:13</a>), that they were abiding in an upper-chamber in Jerusalem. What it indicates is, that their days were spent, not in the routine of common life, but in the prayer of fervent expectation; and for this no place was so fitting as the Temple, which their Master had taught them to look on as in very deed His "Father's house," the "house of prayer," in which the soul of the true worshipper could find access to its God (<a href="/luke/20-46.htm" title="Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;">Luke 20:46</a>; <a href="/john/2-16.htm" title="And said to them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.">John 2:16</a>).

Amen.</span> These last words of the Gospel just alluded to the life of the first teachers, which is dwelt upon with considerable detail in the Acts. In the early days which succeeded the Ascension, the temple and its courts were the principal resort of the teachers of the new "way." We know that in an extraordinarily short time the numbers of adherents to the crucified and risen Jesus, in Jerusalem only, were counted by thousands. The temple and its vast courts, from its storied past, from its having been the scene of much of the Master's last teaching, was the natural centre for these leaders of the new "way." When Luke wrote the words, "were continually in the temple," it is almost certain that he proposed continuing his great narrative in the book we know as the Acts of the Apostles, in which, guided by the Divine Spirit, he relates to us how the Lord Jesus continued to work on earth - in and by his Church - from his glory-throne in heaven. The early chapters of the Acts take up the thread of the gospel story, and describe the life and work of the friends of Jesus in the great Jerusalem temple, the dangers they had to encounter, and the splendid success which rewarded their brave, faithful toil. These same Acts, in the first lines of their thrilling story, take up again the Ascension scene, which is described with fresh and vivid details From these details we learn how, when the disciples' eyes were fixed on that cloud which veiled their ascending Master, they became aware of two stranger-forms with them, clad in white and glistening garments. They knew these belonged to no earthly company. They were two among the thousands of thousands of angels, possibly the angels of the Resurrection, who sat in the empty garden-tomb. These angels tell the awe-struck friends of the ascended Jesus that their adored Master will one day (<a href="/acts/1-2.htm">Acts 1:2</a>) come back to <span class="accented">earth</span> in like manner as they had seen him go to heaven. "O earth, thou grain of sand on the shore of the great ocean of the universe of God, thou Bethlehem among the princes of the regions of heaven, thou art and thou ever wilt be, among ten thousand times ten thousand suns and worlds, the loved one, the elect of the Lord; thee will he visit again; thou shalt provide him a throne, even as thou gavest him a manger; thou shalt rejoice in the splendour of his glory, even as thou drankest his blood and his tears, and mournedst at his death. On thee he hath a great work yet to accomplish" (Hafeli, quoted by Stier). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-53.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">praising</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8016;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eulogountes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2127.htm">Strong's 2127: </a> </span><span class="str2">(lit: I speak well of) I bless; pass: I am blessed.
