It is significant as it occurs after His resurrection, emphasizing the importance of His teachings and the fulfillment of His mission. The setting is likely in Jerusalem, where Jesus appeared to His disciples, providing them with reassurance and instruction.<p><b>These are the words I spoke to you while I was still with you</b><br>Here, Jesus refers to His previous teachings during His earthly ministry. This underscores the continuity and consistency of His message. It highlights the importance of His words and the necessity for the disciples to remember and understand them. This also serves as a reminder of the prophetic nature of His mission, which He had explained to them before His crucifixion.<p><b>Everything must be fulfilled</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the necessity and inevitability of the fulfillment of prophecy. It reflects the divine plan and purpose that Jesus came to accomplish. The use of "must" indicates that these events were predetermined and essential for the salvation narrative. It reassures the disciples that everything that happened was according to God's sovereign will.<p><b>that is written about Me</b><br>Jesus points to the Scriptures as the authoritative source that foretold His life, death, and resurrection. This phrase affirms the messianic prophecies and their fulfillment in Jesus. It also serves as a validation of His identity as the Messiah, the one whom the Scriptures anticipated.<p><b>in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms</b><br>This phrase categorizes the Hebrew Scriptures into three main sections: the Law (Torah), the Prophets (Nevi'im), and the Writings (Ketuvim), with Psalms being a prominent book within the Writings. This tripartite division was a common way to refer to the entire Old Testament. Jesus is asserting that the entirety of the Scriptures bear witness to Him. The Law of Moses includes types and shadows of Christ, such as the Passover lamb. The Prophets contain direct messianic prophecies, like <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. The Psalms include both direct and typological references to the Messiah, such as <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>.

And that method was not an afterthought. It had been given in hints and outlines before; now they were led to see it in its fulness. The three-fold division of the Law, the Prophets (including most of the historic books), and the Psalms (the latter term standing for the whole of the <span class= "ital">Kethubim,</span> the <span class= "ital">Hagiographa</span> or "holy writings," of which the Psalms were the most conspicuous portion), corresponded to that which was in common use among the Jews. (See <span class= "ital">General Introduction I.</span>--<span class= "ital">The Books of the New Testament.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 44-49.</span> - A <span class="accented">summary of some of the Lord's last words.</span> The next six verses do not record sayings uttered the same first Easter evening. They are, in fact, a very brief summary of instructions given by the Master on different occasions during the forty days which elapsed between the Resurrection and the Ascension. In considering the reasons of the omission of any special reference to the Galilaean appearances of the risen Lord, two points must be borne in mind. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Neither Luke nor Paul had any personal reminiscences, like Matthew, or Mark (who wrote down, we believe, St. Peter's memories), or St. John. Luke was dependent on other sources altogether. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Luke, when he wrote the Gospel bearing his name, probably proposed to complete his recital of the close of the earthly ministry of the Lord in his second work, the Acts of the Apostles. His knowledge of what took place after the Resurrection was evidently derived from a source unfamiliar with the Galilaean manifestations of the risen Lord. St. Luke's knowledge of the Ascension seems to have been most precise. He evidently lays great stress upon the importance of this last scene, both as a piece of evidence and as a theme of teaching; for he not only concludes his Gospel with it, but commences his book of the Acts with the same recital, accompanied with further details. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto them, These are the words which I spoke unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the Law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me</span>. The words, "while I was yet with you," plainly show that, in the Master's mind, the period of his sojourn with men was, in the human sense of the expression, <span class="accented">past.</span> His abode now was elsewhere. This and the next verse (45) probably refer to what the Master said that first Easter evening to the assembled disciples, but the exact fixing the time in the forty days (the time specially mentioned by St. Luke in the Acts as elapsing between the Resurrection and the Ascension, <a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>) is of comparatively small importance. What is, however, of real moment is the weight Jesus showed that he attached to Old Testament words and types and prophecies by this repeated mention. The remarks of Meyer and Van Oosterzee on this subject are well worthy of being quoted: "If the exegete should read the Old Testament Scriptures without knowing to whom and to what they everywhere point, the New Testament clearly directs his understanding, and places him under an obligation, if he would be a sound Christian teacher, to acknowledge its authority and interpret accordingly. Doubt as to the validity of our Lord and of his apostles' method of expounding, involves necessarily a renunciation of Christianity" (Meyer). "They who consult the teaching of Jesus and his apostles with respect to the prophecies concerning the Messiah, need not grope in uncertainty, but should, nevertheless, remember that the Lord probably directed the attention of the disciples, on this occasion (he is referring to the walk to Emmaus), less to isolated Scriptures than to the whole tenor of the Old Testament in its typical and symbolical character" (Van Oosterzee). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Jesus] said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
