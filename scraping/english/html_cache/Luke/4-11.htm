The psalm is a promise of God's protection for those who trust in Him. The imagery of being lifted up in hands suggests divine intervention and care, akin to how a parent might protect a child from harm. In the context of Jesus' temptation, it highlights the misuse of Scripture by Satan, who attempts to manipulate God's promises for his own purposes. The phrase also foreshadows the angelic support Jesus receives throughout His ministry, such as in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43</a>).<p><b>so that You will not strike Your foot against a stone.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes God's protection from harm. In the wilderness temptation, Satan uses this to challenge Jesus to test God's faithfulness. The cultural context of the time saw stones as common obstacles in the rugged terrain of Judea, making the metaphor relatable. Theologically, it underscores the theme of trust in God's providence without putting Him to the test. Jesus' response to this temptation (<a href="/luke/4-12.htm">Luke 4:12</a>) reflects <a href="/deuteronomy/6-16.htm">Deuteronomy 6:16</a>, teaching reliance on God without demanding signs. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of Jesus as the true Israel, who succeeds where Israel failed in the wilderness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is being tempted by Satan in the wilderness.
