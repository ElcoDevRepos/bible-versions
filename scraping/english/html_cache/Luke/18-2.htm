Parables often use everyday settings to convey deeper spiritual truths. The unspecified town suggests a universal application, indicating that the lesson is relevant to all listeners, regardless of their specific location or situation.<p><b>there was a judge</b><br>Judges in biblical times were responsible for maintaining justice and order. They were expected to uphold the law and act with integrity. The role of a judge was significant in Jewish society, as seen in the Old Testament with figures like Deborah and Samuel. This judge, however, is depicted negatively, contrasting with the ideal of a just and righteous judge.<p><b>who neither feared God</b><br>Fear of God is a central theme in the Bible, often associated with wisdom and righteousness (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). This judge's lack of fear indicates a disregard for divine authority and moral accountability. It highlights his secular mindset, contrasting with the biblical expectation that leaders should be God-fearing.<p><b>nor respected men</b><br>Respect for others is a fundamental biblical principle, rooted in the command to love one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, <a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>). The judge's lack of respect for people suggests a self-centered and unjust character. This detail emphasizes his moral deficiency and sets the stage for the parable's message about persistence and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_judge.htm">The Judge</a></b><br>A central figure in the parable, described as someone who neither fears God nor respects people.

Town life means everybody eventually comes before local authorities, so the lesson lands close to home (compare <a href="/luke/4-31.htm">Luke 4:31</a>; <a href="/john/4-46.htm">John 4:46</a>).<p>- By not naming the place, the Lord signals that this scenario could unfold anywhere, reminding us that earthly justice systems vary but human hearts remain similar (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>there was a judge</b><p>- Civil authority is God-ordained (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1&#8211;4</a>), yet the individual holding that authority can wield it well or poorly.<p>- Judges were expected to apply the Law impartially (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18&#8211;20</a>). When that calling is ignored, the vulnerable suffer.<p>- Christ purposely selects a judge instead of another official to highlight stark contrast: the one who should protect righteousness instead embodies its opposite (<a href="/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who neither feared God</b><p>- Scripture teaches that &#8220;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). This judge starts from the wrong foundation, so his decisions will naturally skew.<p>- Absence of godly fear often precedes social breakdown (<a href="/psalms/36-1.htm">Psalm 36:1</a>; <a href="/romans/3-18.htm">Romans 3:18</a>).<p>- By introducing a godless official, Jesus sets up a dramatic backdrop for God&#8217;s faithfulness. If even this man can be moved by persistence, how much more will the righteous Judge respond to His people (<a href="/luke/18-7.htm">Luke 18:7&#8211;8</a>)?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>nor respected men</b><p>- Disregard for people violates the second great commandment, &#8220;Love your neighbor as yourself&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>).<p>- Isaiah condemned leaders who &#8220;turn aside the needy&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/10-2.htm">Isaiah 10:2</a>). The judge&#8217;s callousness echoes that indictment.<p>- Without reverence for God or regard for people, justice becomes self-serving. Yet God can still use flawed instruments to achieve His purposes, proving His sovereignty (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-4.htm">Proverbs 16:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/18-2.htm">Luke 18:2</a> paints a bleak picture: a godless, heartless judge presides over a town&#8217;s legal system. Jesus purposely chooses this extreme example to magnify two truths: human courts can fail, and persistent faith matters. If an unjust earthly judge can be swayed, believers may rest assured that the perfectly just Heavenly Judge hears and answers the cries of His elect.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">There was in a city a judge.</span>--The words have an interest historically, as testifying to the general disorganisation and corruption of justice which prevailed under the then government of Galilee and Peraea. Under the direct administration of the Roman Procurator, severe as his rule was, there was probably a better state of things.<p>The case put for the purpose of the parable was obviously an extreme one. Every motive that ordinarily leads men in office to act rightly was absent. Conscience was dead, and there was no love of approbation or fear of blame to supply its place.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man</span>.
