The act of coming home signifies the completion of the search and the return to a place of safety and belonging. This reflects the biblical theme of restoration and reconciliation, as seen in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11-16</a>, where God promises to search for His sheep and bring them back to their own land. The homecoming symbolizes the joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, as mentioned in <a href="/luke/15-7.htm">Luke 15:7</a>.<p><b>and calls together his friends and neighbors to tell them</b><br>The shepherd's action of calling friends and neighbors highlights the communal aspect of joy and celebration in the biblical context. In ancient Jewish culture, community and relationships were central to daily life. This reflects the importance of shared experiences and collective rejoicing, as seen in other biblical celebrations such as the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="/leviticus/23-33.htm">Leviticus 23:33-43</a>). The act of calling others to share in the joy underscores the value of community in God's kingdom.<p><b>&#8216;Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost sheep!&#8217;</b><br>The invitation to rejoice emphasizes the joy and relief of recovering what was lost. This mirrors the heavenly joy over repentance, as described in <a href="/luke/15-10.htm">Luke 15:10</a>. The shepherd's joy is a type of Christ's joy in the salvation of sinners, fulfilling prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>, where the Messiah bears the iniquities of the lost. The phrase also connects to the theme of divine joy in <a href="/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>, where God rejoices over His people with gladness.

The journey ends with rest, echoing <a href="/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>, &#8220;I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever,&#8221; and showing the certainty of salvation once the sheep is secured.<p>&#8226;

Worship becomes the fitting response to grace (<a href="/psalms/95-1.htm">Psalm 95:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Celebration is commanded, not suggested, because the rescue is that significant (<a href="/isaiah/12-3.htm">Isaiah 12:3-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For I have found my lost sheep!</b><p>&#8226;

There are times when we do well to recognise the natural and social ties that bind man and man. Chiefly is it right to do so when we make them sharers in our own spiritual life, and raise and purify their life by calling on them to sympathise, not with our sufferings only, but with our purer and nobler joys. In its bearing upon our Lord's own work we may think of His "friends and neighbours" as being the disciples whom He had chosen; we may think also of "the angels of God," and the spirits of the just made perfect, who rejoice over one sinner that repenteth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost</span>. And here the shepherd craves for <span class="accented">sympathy</span> from his fellows; he would have others share in his joy in finding the perishing, suffering sheep. This sympathy with his effort to win the lost the Galilaean Master had looked for among the rulers and teachers of Israel in vain. Now, sympathy, it must be remembered, is not merely sentiment or courtesy. True sympathy with a cause means working in good earnest for the cause. This, however, the ruling spirits in Israel, in every sect, coldly refused. They not only declined their sympathy with the acts of Jesus; they positively condemned his works, his efforts, his teaching. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/15-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">comes</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#955;&#952;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(elth&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2064.htm">Strong's 2064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, go. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">home,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7990;&#954;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oikon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3624.htm">Strong's 3624: </a> </span><span class="str2">A dwelling; by implication, a family.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[and] calls together</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#8150;</span> <span class="translit">(synkalei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4779.htm">Strong's 4779: </a> </span><span class="str2">To call together.
