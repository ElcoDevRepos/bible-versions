This phrase suggests that Jesus was in the company of others at a meal, likely a Sabbath meal at the house of a Pharisee, as indicated earlier in the chapter. The act of reclining signifies a position of rest and fellowship, which is significant in understanding the communal aspect of the Kingdom of God. The person who speaks is likely a fellow guest, possibly a Pharisee, who is responding to Jesus' teachings about humility and the invitation to the heavenly banquet.<p><b>he said to Jesus</b><br>The direct address to Jesus highlights the respect and recognition of His authority and wisdom. In the Gospels, Jesus often engages in dialogue with those around Him, using these interactions to teach deeper spiritual truths. The speaker's response is prompted by Jesus' preceding parable about choosing places of honor and the invitation to the poor, which challenges social norms and expectations.<p><b>&#8220;Blessed is everyone who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reflects a common Jewish expectation of a messianic banquet, a theme rooted in Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>, which speaks of a feast prepared by the Lord for all peoples. The idea of a future, divine banquet was a symbol of God's ultimate salvation and the fulfillment of His promises. The use of "blessed" indicates a state of divine favor and joy, aligning with the Beatitudes in <a href="/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5</a>. The speaker's declaration may reveal an assumption that he and his peers are assured a place at this feast, a notion Jesus challenges in the subsequent parable of the Great Banquet. This parable emphasizes that the invitation to God's kingdom is extended to all, including those marginalized by society, and warns against complacency and presumption regarding one's place in God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching about the kingdom of God through parables and interactions with those around Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_reclining_guest.htm">The Reclining Guest</a></b><br>An unnamed individual who is dining with Jesus and others.

What follows in the parable of the great banquet (<a href="/luke/14-16.htm">Luke 14:16-24</a>) will expose how mere verbal assent falls short if the heart refuses God&#8217;s invitation (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Blessed is everyone who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The guest echoes prophetic hope:<p>&#8211; <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6-9</a> picturing the LORD&#8217;s rich feast for &#8220;all peoples.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a> where God prepares a table before His own.<p>&#8211; <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a> &#8220;Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.&#8221;<p>&#8226; He rightly affirms blessing, yet Jesus will press him to see:<p>&#8211; Invitation demands response&#8212;many invited first (Israel) will decline (<a href="/luke/14-18.htm">Luke 14:18-20</a>).<p>&#8211; Others considered outsiders (the &#8220;poor, crippled, blind, and lame,&#8221; and finally those &#8220;along the roads and country lanes&#8221;) will gladly come (<a href="/luke/14-21.htm">Luke 14:21-23</a>; <a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46-48</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse therefore sets up two truths:<p>1.

It may have been a more or less familiar formula among devout Jews who expected the coming of the Christ. It may have embodied some recollections of the great discourse at Capernaum (<a href="/context/john/6-26.htm" title="Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek me, not because you saw the miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves, and were filled.">John 6:26-59</a>). On the whole it seems more natural to see in it a burst of honest, unwonted enthusiasm, kindled by sympathy with what our Lord had said, than to regard it as spoken hypocritically, with a view to drawing from His lips some heretical utterance that might ensure His condemnation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-24.</span> - <span class="accented">In</span> <span class="accented">reply to an observation of one of the guests, Jesus relates the parable of the great supper, in which he shows how few really cared for the joys of God's kingdom in the world to come.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.</span> One of those who were partaking of the banquet, and had witnessed the whole scene, now speaks to the Stranger Guest. He had looked on the miracle performed for the afflicted man: he had heard the wise words spoken by the Galilaean Rabbi; he had listened to the gentle and yet pungent rebuke to the Pharisee for his ostentatious hospitality to the rich and great; he had marked the quiet reminder as to the many sufferers who really stood in need of the viands so plentifully spread for those who wanted them not; he had been specially struck by the mention of the recompense which the just who remembered the poor would receive at the resurrection. This quiet observer, noticing that the Master's remarks were touching upon the recompense of the just in the world to come, now breaks in with a remark on the blessedness of him who should eat bread in the kingdom of God. The words do not seem to have been spoken in a mocking spirit, but to have been the genuine outcome of the speaker's admiration of the Guest so hated and yet so wondered at. There is, no doubt, lurking in the words a certain Pharisaic self-congratulation - a something which seems to imply, "Yes, that blessedness to which you, O Master, are alluding, I am looking forward confidently to share in. How happy will it be for us, Jews as we are, when the time comes for us to sit down at that banquet in the kingdom of heaven l" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/14-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">one</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
