And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed? / He grew up before Him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no stately form or majesty to attract us, no beauty that we should desire Him. / He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief.

These books lay the foundation for the Jewish faith and contain the Law, which is central to understanding the covenant relationship between God and His people. The mention of "all the Prophets" refers to the subsequent books of the Old Testament, which include both the Major and Minor Prophets. These texts contain numerous prophecies and teachings that point to the coming of the Messiah. Jesus' use of these scriptures underscores the continuity and fulfillment of the Old Testament in His life and mission.<p><b>He explained to them</b><br>The act of explaining suggests that Jesus provided a detailed interpretation or exposition of the Scriptures. This implies that the disciples needed guidance to understand the deeper meanings and connections within the texts. The Greek word used here for "explained" can also mean "interpreted," indicating that Jesus was revealing the true significance of the Scriptures in light of His life, death, and resurrection. This moment is crucial as it highlights the necessity of divine revelation and understanding to fully grasp the message of the Bible.<p><b>what was written in all the Scriptures</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the comprehensive nature of Jesus' teaching. "All the Scriptures" suggests that the entire Old Testament bears witness to Him, not just isolated passages. This holistic approach to the Scriptures reveals that the message of Christ is woven throughout the biblical narrative, from Genesis to Malachi. It underscores the unity and coherence of the Bible as a testimony to God's redemptive plan through Jesus Christ.<p><b>about Himself</b><br>The focus of Jesus' explanation is on how the Scriptures testify about Him. This indicates that the central theme of the Bible is the revelation of Jesus as the Messiah. The Old Testament contains numerous types, shadows, and prophecies that point to Christ. For example, the sacrificial system, the Passover lamb, and the suffering servant in Isaiah all prefigure aspects of Jesus' life and work. By interpreting these texts, Jesus reveals that He is the fulfillment of God's promises and the culmination of the biblical story.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The resurrected Lord who is explaining the Scriptures to the two disciples on the road to Emmaus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>Represents the Law, the first five books of the Old Testament, which contain prophecies and types pointing to Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophets.htm">The Prophets</a></b><br>Refers to the writings of the Old Testament prophets who foretold the coming of the Messiah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples_on_the_road_to_emmaus.htm">The Disciples on the Road to Emmaus</a></b><br>Two followers of Jesus who were traveling from Jerusalem to Emmaus and were initially unaware that they were speaking with the risen Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/emmaus.htm">Emmaus</a></b><br>A village about seven miles from Jerusalem, where the encounter between Jesus and the two disciples took place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/christ-centered_interpretation.htm">Christ-Centered Interpretation</a></b><br>Jesus is the fulfillment of the entire Old Testament.

Dr. Davison, in his book on prophecy, pp. 266-287, shows that there is not one of the prophets without some distinct reference to Christ, except Nahum, Jonah (who was himself a type and prophetic sign), and Habakkuk, who, however, uses the memorable words quoted in <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>. To these we must add references to several of the psalms, notably to the sixteenth and twenty-second, where sufferings and death are spoken of as Belonging to the perfect picture of the Servant of the Lord and the ideal King. His hearers would know well how strangely the agony of Calvary was foreshadowed in those vivid word-pictures he called before their memories in the course of that six-mile walk from Jerusalem to Emmaus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">beginning</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#961;&#958;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(arxamenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_756.htm">Strong's 756: </a> </span><span class="str2">To begin.
