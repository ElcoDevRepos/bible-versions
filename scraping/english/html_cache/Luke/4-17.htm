The scroll of Isaiah, a significant prophetic book, was given to Jesus, indicating the high regard for Isaiah's writings. Isaiah is often quoted in the New Testament, highlighting its messianic prophecies. The act of handing the scroll to Jesus signifies His authority and the fulfillment of prophecy. Isaiah's prophecies, written around 700 years before Christ, contain numerous references to the coming Messiah, which Jesus fulfills.<p><b>Unrolling it,</b><br>Scrolls were the primary form of written scripture in the first century, made from papyrus or parchment. Unrolling the scroll was a deliberate act, showing Jesus' intention to read a specific passage. This action demonstrates His familiarity with the scriptures and His role as a teacher. The physical act of unrolling also symbolizes the revelation of God's word and the unfolding of His divine plan through Jesus.<p><b>He found the place where it was written:</b><br>Jesus intentionally selects a passage, showing His purpose and mission. This indicates His deep knowledge of scripture and His understanding of its fulfillment in His ministry. The passage He chooses is <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>, which speaks of the anointed one bringing good news, freedom, and healing. This choice underscores Jesus' identity as the Messiah and His mission to bring spiritual and physical restoration.

Isaiah repeatedly foretold a Servant who would bring salvation (<a href="/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1&#8211;7</a>; 61:1&#8211;2), and handing that precise scroll to Jesus is no accident.<p>&#8226; The scene underscores the unity of Scripture. Old-Testament revelation is placed directly into Jesus&#8217; hands, illustrating <a href="/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27</a>, where Jesus later explains &#8220;Moses and all the Prophets&#8221; as speaking about Himself.<p>&#8226; By receiving the scroll, Jesus accepts the authority of written Scripture. He does not dismiss or replace it; He opens it, echoing <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a> that &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Unrolling it</b><p>&#8226; Scrolls required deliberate unrolling; Jesus must actively seek the passage. This shows intentionality, not chance. As <a href="/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39</a> reminds, the Scriptures &#8220;testify about Me,&#8221; and Jesus is purposefully demonstrating that truth.<p>&#8226; His familiarity with the scroll affirms both His literacy and His upbringing in the Word (cf. <a href="/luke/2-46.htm">Luke 2:46&#8211;47</a>, where the boy Jesus sat among the teachers). The incarnate Word honors the written Word.<p>&#8226; The unrolling picture invites believers to imitate Him&#8212;opening the Scriptures themselves rather than waiting for someone else to summarize them (<a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>).<p>&#8226; It also foreshadows the unsealing of God&#8217;s redemptive plan; <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5&#8211;9</a> shows the Lamb opening a scroll in heaven, tying earthly synagogue worship to the heavenly throne room.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He found the place where it was written</b><p>&#8226; Jesus locates <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1&#8211;2</a> (linked with <a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a>). He will immediately read, &#8220;The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>). By choosing that specific text, He declares Himself the promised Anointed One.<p>&#8226; Finding &#8220;the place&#8221; affirms the precision of prophecy. God did not speak in vague generalities; He provided pinpoint promises fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/acts/13-27.htm">Acts 13:27&#8211;29</a>).<p>&#8226; Luke stresses that Jesus &#8220;found&#8221; it, underscoring purposeful fulfillment rather than accidental correlation. <a href="/hebrews/10-7.htm">Hebrews 10:7</a> captures this mindset: &#8220;Behold, I have come&#8230; in the scroll of the book it is written of Me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The moment bridges expectation and revelation. The congregation had long heard Isaiah read; now the Author reads Himself into the narrative (<a href="/luke/4-21.htm">Luke 4:21</a>: &#8220;Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Application points for believers:<p>&#8211; Recognize Jesus as the center of every biblical promise.<p>&#8211; Trust the reliability of Scripture; if God precisely fulfilled <a href="/bsb/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61</a> in Christ, He will keep every other promise (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<p>&#8211; Approach Scripture expectantly, looking for Christ on every page (<a href="/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44-45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/4-17.htm">Luke 4:17</a> shows Jesus receiving, opening, and intentionally selecting a prophetic text about Himself. The scroll&#8217;s transfer highlights divine providence, the unrolling displays reverent engagement with God&#8217;s Word, and the chosen passage proclaims Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah. The verse invites believers to prize Scripture&#8217;s authority, pursue it actively, and see Christ as the fulfillment of every promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">The book of the prophet Esaias.</span>--The Law--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the Pentateuch--was commonly written on one long roll. The other books, in like manner--singly or combined, according to their length--were written on rolls of parchment, and were unrolled from the cylinder to which they were fastened. Here, it is clear, Isaiah formed a roll by itself. It is a natural inference from the fact that it was given to Him, that it contained the prophetic lesson for the day. In the calendar of modern Jews, the lessons from Isaiah run parallel with those from Deuteronomy. The chapter which He read stands as the second lesson for the day of Atonement. We cannot prove that the existing order obtained in the time of our Lord's ministry, but everything in Judaism rests mainly on old traditions; and there is therefore nothing extravagant in the belief that it was on the day of Atonement that the great Atoner thus struck what was the key-note of His whole work.<p><span class= "bld">When he had opened the book.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">when He had unrolled.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- And there was delivered unto him the Book of the Prophet Esaias</span>. In the sabbath service there were two lessons read. The first was always taken from the Pentateuch (the Law). The five books of Moses were written on parchment, (usually) between two rollers, and the day's lesson was left unrolled for the reader's convenience. The Prophets were on single rollers, no special portion being left open. It has been suggested that the great and famous Messianic passage read by our Lord was the lesson for the day. This is quite uncertain; indeed, it is more probable that Jesus, when the roll of Isaiah was handed to him by the ruler of the synagogue, specially selected the section containing this passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/4-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[the] scroll of</span><br /><span class="grk">&#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#943;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(biblion)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_975.htm">Strong's 975: </a> </span><span class="str2">A papyrus roll.
