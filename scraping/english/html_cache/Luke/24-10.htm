She was delivered from seven demons by Jesus (<a href="/luke/8-2.htm">Luke 8:2</a>) and became one of His most faithful followers. Her presence at the resurrection highlights her role as a key witness to the pivotal event of Christianity. Her inclusion here underscores the transformative power of Jesus' ministry, as she went from being demon-possessed to a herald of the resurrection.<p><b>Joanna</b><br>Joanna is mentioned in <a href="/luke/8-3.htm">Luke 8:3</a> as the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward. Her presence among the women who followed Jesus indicates the diverse backgrounds of His followers, including those from influential social standings. Joanna's involvement in Jesus' ministry and her witness to the resurrection demonstrate the reach of Jesus' message across different societal levels.<p><b>Mary the mother of James</b><br>This Mary is often identified as the mother of James the Less, one of the twelve apostles. Her mention here, alongside other women, highlights the important role women played in Jesus' ministry and the early church. The identification of her son connects her to the apostolic circle, emphasizing the familial and communal nature of the early Christian movement.<p><b>and the other women with them</b><br>The phrase acknowledges the presence of additional women who were part of Jesus' followers. This group of women, who supported Jesus' ministry (<a href="/luke/8.htm">Luke 8:1-3</a>), were the first to witness the empty tomb, signifying their crucial role in the resurrection narrative. Their inclusion challenges cultural norms of the time, where women's testimonies were often undervalued.<p><b>who told this to the apostles</b><br>The women were the first to proclaim the resurrection to the apostles, a significant detail given the cultural context where women were not considered reliable witnesses. This underscores the authenticity of the Gospel accounts, as such a detail would be counterproductive if fabricated. The apostles' initial skepticism (<a href="/luke/24-11.htm">Luke 24:11</a>) further highlights the unexpected nature of the resurrection and the radical shift it brought to their understanding of Jesus' mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary_magdalene.htm">Mary Magdalene</a></b><br>A devoted follower of Jesus, Mary Magdalene is often noted for her presence at both the crucifixion and the resurrection.
