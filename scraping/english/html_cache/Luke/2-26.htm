This phrase indicates the active presence of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers, even before Pentecost. The Holy Spirit's revelation to Simeon underscores the Spirit's role in prophecy and divine communication, as seen throughout the Old Testament with prophets like Isaiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>that he would not see death</b><br>This promise to Simeon is a personal assurance of witnessing the fulfillment of God's salvation plan. It reflects the biblical theme of God's faithfulness to His promises. The concept of not seeing death until a divine promise is fulfilled can be paralleled with the experiences of other biblical figures who received specific promises from God, such as Abraham and the promise of Isaac.<p><b>before he had seen the Lord&#8217;s Christ</b><br>"The Lord's Christ" refers to the Messiah, the anointed one sent by God to deliver His people. This title emphasizes Jesus' divine mission and fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a> and <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>. The anticipation of the Messiah was a central hope for the Jewish people, and Simeon's revelation highlights the culmination of this hope in Jesus. The phrase also connects to the broader narrative of Luke, which presents Jesus as the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simeon.htm">Simeon</a></b><br>A devout and righteous man in Jerusalem who was waiting for the consolation of Israel.

The idea of the aged Simeon comes from a notice in the apocryphal 'Gospel of the Nativity,' which speaks of him as a hundred and thirteen years old. These legendary "Gospels" are totally devoid of all authority; here and there possibly a true "memory" not preserved in any of the "four" may exist, but in general they are extravagant and improbable. The Arabic 'Gospel of the Infancy' here speaks of Simeon seeing the Babe shining like a pillar of light in his mother's arms. There is an old and striking legend which speaks of this devout Jew being long puzzled and disturbed by the Messianic prophecy (<a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>), "A virgin shall conceive;" at length he received a supernatural intimation that he should not see dearth until he had seen the fulfillment of the strange prophecy, the menacing of which he had so long failed to see. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/2-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(tou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Genitive Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
