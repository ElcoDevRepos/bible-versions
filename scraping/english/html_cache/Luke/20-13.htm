In the parable, the vineyard owner represents God, and the vineyard symbolizes Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>). The question highlights God's long-suffering nature and His desire to reach His people despite their repeated rejections. The vineyard owner's contemplation mirrors God's willingness to provide multiple opportunities for repentance and reconciliation.<p><b>&#8216;I will send my beloved son.</b><br>The decision to send the beloved son signifies the ultimate act of love and sacrifice. The term "beloved son" is significant, as it echoes God's declaration of Jesus at His baptism and transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17, 17</a>:5). This phrase underscores Jesus' unique relationship with the Father and His role as the heir. It also foreshadows the sending of Jesus Christ to the world, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a> and <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, where the Messiah is depicted as God's Son.<p><b>Perhaps they will respect him.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase indicates hope and expectation. The vineyard owner's hope that the tenants will respect his son reflects God's desire for humanity to honor and accept Jesus. It also highlights the tragic reality of human rejection of divine overtures. The expectation of respect ties into the broader biblical theme of honoring God's messengers, as seen in the rejection of prophets throughout Israel's history (<a href="/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25-26</a>). The phrase also points to the eventual rejection and crucifixion of Jesus, fulfilling prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as despised and rejected by men.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/owner_of_the_vineyard.htm">Owner of the Vineyard</a></b><br>Represents God the Father, who is the creator and sustainer of all things.

It is a place of cultivation and expected fruitfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/beloved_son.htm">Beloved Son</a></b><br>Represents Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

The words represented <span class="cmt_word"></span> here by Jesus as spoken by God, possess the deepest doctrinal value. They, under the thin veil of the parable-story, answer the question of the Sanhedrim (ver. 2), "By what authority doest thou these things?" The deliberative words, "What shall I do?" recall the Divine dialogue alluded to in Gem. 1:26.
