This phrase indicates the increasing popularity of Jesus, which is a recurring theme in the Gospels. The spread of news can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophetic anticipation of a coming Messiah who would draw people to Himself. The phrase also reflects the oral culture of the time, where news was primarily spread by word of mouth, emphasizing the authenticity and power of Jesus' works that compelled people to share what they had witnessed.<p><b>and great crowds came to hear Him</b><br>The gathering of great crowds signifies the deep spiritual hunger and anticipation among the people of Israel for a deliverer. This mirrors the Old Testament prophecies of a shepherd who would gather His flock (<a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>). The crowds' desire to hear Jesus underscores His role as a teacher and prophet, akin to Moses, who delivered God's word to the people. The presence of large crowds also foreshadows the eventual opposition Jesus would face from religious leaders who felt threatened by His influence.<p><b>and to be healed of their sicknesses</b><br>The healing of sicknesses by Jesus serves as a testament to His divine authority and compassion. It fulfills the messianic prophecies such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>, which speak of the Messiah bearing the infirmities of the people. Healing was a sign of the in-breaking of God's kingdom, demonstrating Jesus' power over physical and spiritual ailments. This phrase also highlights the holistic nature of Jesus' ministry, addressing both the spiritual and physical needs of individuals, and prefigures the ultimate healing and restoration promised in the eschatological hope of the new creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, whose teachings and healing power draw large crowds.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/great_crowds.htm">Great Crowds</a></b><br>Represents the multitude of people who are drawn to Jesus, seeking both His teachings and His healing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sicknesses.htm">Sicknesses</a></b><br>The ailments and diseases from which the people sought healing, highlighting Jesus' role as a healer.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_testimony.htm">The Power of Testimony</a></b><br>The spreading news about Jesus underscores the importance of sharing personal testimonies of His work in our lives.

The crowds recognized that authoritative truth met their spiritual hunger (<a href="/luke/4-32.htm">Luke 4:32</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene anticipates the Sermon on the Mount dynamic&#8212;listeners gathering for life-giving instruction (<a href="/matthew/5-1.htm">Matthew 5:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and to be healed of their sicknesses</b><p>&#8226; Physical maladies in Scripture often symbolize deeper spiritual need; Jesus addresses both.

It is evident that his wishes and commands were neglected, possibly out of a mistaken feeling of gratitude. The result was that his work of teaching was hindered by the crowds who resorted to him at once as a Physician of extraordinary power. But he had graver and much more important work before him than even the blessed task of relieving suffering. So he withdrew himself, says our evangelist, and again spent a short season in solitude and prayer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/5-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
