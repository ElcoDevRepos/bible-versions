In the context of <a href="/luke/9.htm">Luke 9</a>, Jesus is addressing a would-be follower, emphasizing the cost of discipleship. This interaction highlights Jesus' role as a teacher and His method of using everyday situations to impart spiritual truths.<p><b>Foxes have dens</b><br>Foxes are common in the region of Judea and symbolize cunning and survival. The mention of dens implies a place of security and rest. In the Old Testament, foxes are sometimes used metaphorically to describe destructive forces (<a href="/songs/2-15.htm">Song of Solomon 2:15</a>). Here, Jesus contrasts the natural provision for animals with His own lack of earthly security.<p><b>and birds of the air have nests</b><br>Birds are often used in Scripture to illustrate God's provision (<a href="/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>). Nests represent a place of rest and safety. The mention of birds emphasizes the natural order where even the smallest creatures have a place to call home, underscoring the contrast with Jesus' situation.<p><b>but the Son of Man</b><br>This title, "Son of Man," is a messianic term rooted in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where it describes a figure with authority and dominion. Jesus frequently uses this title to refer to Himself, highlighting both His humanity and His divine mission. It reflects His role as the representative of humanity and the fulfillment of prophecy.<p><b>has no place to lay His head</b><br>This phrase underscores Jesus' voluntary poverty and His itinerant lifestyle. Unlike the animals, Jesus lacks a permanent home, symbolizing His total reliance on God and His commitment to His mission. It also foreshadows the rejection He would face, culminating in His crucifixion. This statement challenges followers to consider the cost of discipleship and the transient nature of earthly comforts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to someone who expressed a desire to follow Him.

Creation itself demonstrates God&#8217;s orderly provision&#8212;foxes possess secure burrows designed for rest and protection.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/104-21.htm">Psalm 104:21&#8211;23</a> pictures animals receiving what they need from the Creator&#8217;s hand; <a href="/job/38-41.htm">Job 38:41</a> reminds us that God even feeds young ravens. If the Lord faithfully supplies habitats for wildlife, His sovereignty over every creature is certain.<p>&#8226; The statement underscores that material shelter is normal and expected for living beings. By highlighting something as ordinary as a fox&#8217;s den, Jesus sets up a striking contrast with His own earthly situation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and birds of the air have nests</b><p>&#8226; The second example deepens the point: &#8220;and birds of the air have nests.&#8221; Nests are crafted places of warmth, security, and nurture.<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a> affirms that the Father feeds the birds; <a href="/psalms/84-3.htm">Psalm 84:3</a> notes that even a sparrow &#8220;finds a home&#8221; near God&#8217;s altar. In other words, the smallest creatures experience the Creator&#8217;s tangible care.<p>&#8226; Mentioning both ground-dwelling foxes and sky-soaring birds covers the whole scope of animal life. Everywhere you look&#8212;from burrows below to nests above&#8212;there is a place to call home. Listeners would naturally assume that the promised Messiah should enjoy at least as much stability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but the Son of Man</b><p>&#8226; With the contrast prepared, Jesus speaks of Himself: &#8220;but the Son of Man.&#8221; This Messianic title, drawn from <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a> and used frequently in the Gospels, highlights both His full humanity and His divine authority.<p>&#8226; <a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a> explains the mission behind the title: &#8220;For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.&#8221; The One endowed with everlasting dominion deliberately embraces lowliness.<p>&#8226; By identifying as &#8220;Son of Man,&#8221; Jesus connects His experience to ours. He feels hunger (<a href="/luke/4-2.htm">Luke 4:2</a>), fatigue (<a href="/john/4-6.htm">John 4:6</a>), and rejection (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>). His coming in flesh is literal, tangible, and historically grounded.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>has no place to lay His head</b><p>&#8226; Here is the startling reality: &#8220;has no place to lay His head.&#8221; Unlike foxes with dens and birds with nests, Jesus chooses an itinerant, unsettled life.<p>&#8226; Practically, He lived without personal property or permanent lodging, relying on hospitality (<a href="/luke/8-1.htm">Luke 8:1-3</a>) and sometimes sleeping outdoors (<a href="/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, this underscores the cost of redemptive mission. Second Corinthians 8:9 reminds us, &#8220;though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor.&#8221; The Creator accepts homelessness in the world He made.<p>&#8226; For any would-be follower (the immediate context of <a href="/luke/9-57.htm">Luke 9:57-62</a>), the lesson is clear: discipleship may involve forsaking comfort, security, and conventional stability. <a href="/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a> records the same saying, linking it directly to the call, &#8220;Follow Me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verse also anticipates the ultimate rejection at the cross&#8212;where even a borrowed tomb is needed (<a href="/luke/23-50.htm">Luke 23:50-53</a>). Earth offered Him no resting place until His work of salvation was finished.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/9-58.htm">Luke 9:58</a> contrasts the natural provision enjoyed by animals with the deliberate poverty embraced by Jesus. Foxes and birds illustrate God&#8217;s care, yet the Son of Man, though Lord of all, travels without a home. His choice models sacrificial mission, exposes worldly notions of security, and calls every disciple to value obedience above comfort. The verse stands as a vivid reminder that following Christ may cost us earthly conveniences, but it brings us into fellowship with the One who gave up everything to redeem us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-58.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
