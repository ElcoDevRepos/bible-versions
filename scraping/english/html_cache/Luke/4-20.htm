Jesus, having read from the scroll of Isaiah, demonstrates His respect for the Jewish tradition by rolling it up carefully. This act signifies the completion of the reading and the transition to teaching. The scroll, likely made of parchment or papyrus, was a precious and sacred object, emphasizing the importance of the Scriptures in Jewish life. The passage He read (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>) is a messianic prophecy, highlighting His role as the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets.<p><b>returned it to the attendant</b><br>The attendant, or "chazzan," was responsible for the care of the synagogue's scrolls. By returning the scroll, Jesus shows adherence to the synagogue's customs and respect for the established order. This act also signifies the end of the public reading and the beginning of His teaching, which was customary for a rabbi or teacher after reading the Scriptures. The role of the attendant underscores the organized structure of synagogue worship and the reverence for the Word of God.<p><b>and sat down</b><br>In Jewish tradition, teachers would sit to teach, a position of authority and respect. By sitting down, Jesus assumes the role of a rabbi, ready to expound on the Scriptures. This posture indicates that He is about to deliver an important message, inviting the congregation to listen attentively. Sitting to teach was a common practice, as seen in other parts of the Gospels, where Jesus often sits to deliver His teachings, such as the Sermon on the Mount.<p><b>The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on Him</b><br>The congregation's focus on Jesus highlights the anticipation and expectation of His teaching. Having read a significant messianic prophecy, the people are eager to hear His interpretation and application. This moment captures the tension and curiosity surrounding Jesus' ministry, as He often spoke with authority and insight that challenged traditional understandings. The phrase also foreshadows the impact of His words and actions, which would captivate and sometimes divide His audience throughout His ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus has just read from the scroll of Isaiah in the synagogue, declaring the fulfillment of the prophecy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_synagogue.htm">The Synagogue</a></b><br>A place of Jewish worship and teaching, where Jesus often taught.
