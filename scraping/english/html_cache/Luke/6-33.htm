In the Greco-Roman culture, relationships were often transactional, based on mutual benefit. Jesus challenges this norm by calling His followers to a higher standard of love and kindness that transcends mere reciprocity. This teaching aligns with the broader biblical theme of selfless love, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>, where Jesus instructs to love enemies and pray for persecutors. The call to do good without expecting anything in return reflects the character of God, who is kind to the ungrateful and wicked (<a href="/luke/6-35.htm">Luke 6:35</a>).<p><b>what credit is that to you?</b><br>The term "credit" here can be understood as a form of spiritual reward or merit. In Jewish thought, acts of righteousness were often associated with accruing favor with God. However, Jesus emphasizes that merely reciprocating kindness does not distinguish His followers from the world. This teaching is consistent with the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus speaks of rewards in heaven for those who practice righteousness for God's sake rather than human approval (<a href="/matthew/6.htm">Matthew 6:1-4</a>). The focus is on the purity of motives and the call to reflect God's grace, which is given freely and not earned.<p><b>Even sinners do the same.</b><br>By using the term "sinners," Jesus refers to those outside the covenant community, often perceived as morally or religiously inferior by the Jewish audience. This statement underscores the universality of reciprocal kindness, which is not unique to the followers of Christ. It challenges believers to rise above the common ethical standards of the day. The call is to embody a love that mirrors God's unconditional love, as seen in <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>, where Christ's sacrificial love is extended to humanity while still in sin. This radical love serves as a witness to the transformative power of the Gospel, setting believers apart as children of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering a sermon that includes teachings on love, mercy, and the nature of true righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teachings, though the message is applicable to all followers of Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sinners.htm">Sinners</a></b><br>A term used to describe those who are not living according to God's commandments, often used in contrast to those who are righteous.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sermon_on_the_plain.htm">The Sermon on the Plain</a></b><br>The context in which this teaching is delivered, a collection of Jesus' teachings similar to the Sermon on the Mount.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_god.htm">The Kingdom of God</a></b><br>The overarching theme of Jesus' teachings, emphasizing the values and behaviors expected of its citizens.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_true_righteousness.htm">The Nature of True Righteousness</a></b><br>True righteousness goes beyond reciprocal kindness.

Everyone understands the social rule, &#8220;You scratch my back, I&#8217;ll scratch yours.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Earlier in the same sermon He had already raised the bar: &#8220;But to you who are listening I say, &#8216;Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/luke/6-27.htm">Luke 6:27</a>). The Lord is contrasting ordinary fairness with supernatural love.<p>&#8226; Similar contrasts appear in <a href="/matthew/5-46.htm">Matthew 5:46</a> where He asks, &#8220;If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?&#8221; and in <a href="/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a> where Paul says, &#8220;Do not repay anyone evil for evil.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The command therefore pushes us beyond instinctive kindness toward self-sacrificial love that mirrors God&#8217;s gracious character (<a href="/luke/6-35.htm">Luke 6:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what credit is that to you?</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Credit&#8221; (a word also used in <a href="/1_peter/2-20.htm">1 Peter 2:20</a>) speaks of heavenly commendation. Good done merely for mutual benefit earns no special notice from God.<p>&#8226; Jesus is keenly interested in motives. Acts done solely for reciprocity may receive human thanks, but they do not store up treasure in heaven (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/3-14.htm">1 Corinthians 3:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The question exposes self-interest: Am I serving because Christ loved me first (<a href="/1_john/4-19.htm">1 John 4:19</a>), or because I expect a payback?<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/17-9.htm">Luke 17:9&#8211;10</a> illustrates the point with servants who do only what is required&#8212;they merit no extra praise. Likewise, love that limits itself to fair exchange receives no kingdom &#8220;credit.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even sinners do the same</b><p>&#8226; The Lord draws a stark line between the redeemed and the unredeemed. Unbelievers (&#8220;sinners&#8221;) commonly practice reciprocal kindness; it requires no spiritual regeneration.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/2-19.htm">James 2:19</a> reminds us that intellectual belief alone doesn&#8217;t distinguish a person; genuine faith produces works that exceed natural norms.<p>&#8226; Jesus wants His disciples to exhibit a love so uncommon that it serves as a family resemblance: &#8220;By this everyone will know that you are My disciples, if you love one another&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>).<p>&#8226; When believers go beyond &#8220;doing the same,&#8221; they display the Father&#8217;s perfect mercy (<a href="/luke/6-36.htm">Luke 6:36</a>) and fulfill the royal law to &#8220;love your neighbor as yourself&#8221; (<a href="/james/2-8.htm">James 2:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/6-33.htm">Luke 6:33</a> calls followers of Christ to surpass ordinary reciprocity with grace-filled, self-giving love.
