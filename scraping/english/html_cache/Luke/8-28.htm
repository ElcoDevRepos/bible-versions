The immediate recognition of Jesus by the possessed man highlights the spiritual authority and divine nature of Jesus, as even the demons are aware of His identity.<p><b>he cried out and fell down before Him</b><br>The act of falling down is a sign of submission and recognition of authority. In the presence of Jesus, the demons within the man are compelled to acknowledge His superior power. This act foreshadows the ultimate submission of all creation to Christ, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>, where every knee will bow to Jesus.<p><b>shouting in a loud voice</b><br>The loud voice signifies the desperation and fear of the demons. It also emphasizes the spiritual turmoil within the man. This loud cry can be seen as a manifestation of the spiritual battle taking place, as the forces of darkness confront the light of Christ.<p><b>&#8220;What do You want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God?</b><br>The demons recognize Jesus' divine identity, calling Him the "Son of the Most High God." This title affirms Jesus' unique relationship with God the Father and His authority over all spiritual realms. The acknowledgment by the demons contrasts with the lack of understanding by many of Jesus' contemporaries, including His own disciples at times.<p><b>I beg You not to torture me!&#8221;</b><br>The demons' plea not to be tortured reveals their awareness of Jesus' power to judge and their fear of impending punishment. This reflects the eschatological reality of Christ's ultimate victory over evil and the final judgment, as described in <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>.

In the parallel account, &#8220;When the man saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees before Him&#8221; (<a href="/mark/5-6.htm">Mark 5:6</a>).<p>- Demons are never indifferent to Christ&#8217;s arrival; their reaction confirms <a href="/james/2-19.htm">James 2:19</a>&#8212;&#8220;Even the demons believe that&#8212;and shudder.&#8221;<p>- The instant visual contact underscores Jesus&#8217; complete authority; no hiding, no delay, no negotiation. Light exposes darkness the moment it appears (cf. <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He cried out</b><p>- The cry is involuntary, revealing the internal torment of evil confronted by holiness. Similar outbreaks occur in <a href="/luke/4-33.htm">Luke 4:33&#8211;34</a>, where an unclean spirit &#8220;cried out in a loud voice.&#8221;<p>- Evil spirits cannot mask their fear; their audio outburst betrays their dread of judgment (cf. <a href="/mark/1-23.htm">Mark 1:23&#8211;24</a>).<p>- For onlookers&#8212;and for us reading today&#8212;this cry verifies that spiritual warfare is real and personal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And fell down before Him</b><p>- Physical prostration displays forced submission. &#8220;Whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, they fell down before Him&#8221; (<a href="/mark/3-11.htm">Mark 3:11</a>).<p>- This scene prefigures <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>, when &#8220;at the name of Jesus every knee should bow.&#8221;<p>- Even hostile powers acknowledge Jesus&#8217; supremacy; their capitulation demonstrates the literal truth that Christ is Lord of all realms.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shouting in a loud voice</b><p>- The volume amplifies the urgency. Terror drives the demon to broadcast its alarm. Compare <a href="/luke/4-33.htm">Luke 4:33</a> (&#8220;cried out in a loud voice&#8221;) and <a href="/acts/16-17.htm">Acts 16:17</a> (the possessed slave girl &#8220;shouting&#8221;).<p>- Loudness here does not indicate authority; it exposes panic. Evil may roar, but it is powerless in Christ&#8217;s presence.<p>- The public nature of the shout allows witnesses&#8212;and readers&#8212;to see the clash between darkness and the Savior played out transparently.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;What do You want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God?&#8221;</b><p>- The spirit verbally confesses Jesus&#8217; divine identity, echoing <a href="/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a> and <a href="/luke/4-34.htm">Luke 4:34</a>.<p>- &#8220;Son of the Most High God&#8221; affirms Christ&#8217;s unique status even from the mouth of a demon, reminding us that truth remains truth regardless of the speaker.<p>- The question &#8220;What do You want with me?&#8221; admits Jesus&#8217; right to command, judge, and dispose of evil as He wills (cf. <a href="/mark/1-24.htm">Mark 1:24</a>: &#8220;Have You come to destroy us?&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I beg You not to torture me!&#8221;</b><p>- The plea reveals foreknowledge of coming judgment. Demons understand <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a> and <a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>; they know their destiny is torment.<p>- The verb &#8220;beg&#8221; parallels <a href="/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a> (&#8220;Have You come here to torment us before the proper time?&#8221;); it shows demons can only request, never dictate.<p>- Christ&#8217;s very presence is a preview of their future defeat, so they seek any delay possible. Their fear magnifies the certainty of divine justice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/8-28.htm">Luke 8:28</a> portrays the immediate, involuntary submission of demonic powers when confronted by Jesus. The demoniac&#8217;s sight of Christ triggers a cry of terror, a posture of surrender, a loud public acknowledgment of Jesus&#8217; divine status, and a desperate plea to avoid judgment. Every movement and word in the verse confirms that Jesus is the sovereign Son of the Most High God, before whom even the fiercest spiritual enemies must bow, confess, and await inevitable condemnation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">What have I to do with thee?</span>--Note the exact agreement with St. Mark's report rather than St. Matthew's, both as to there being but one demoniac, and as to the words used by him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice aid, What have I to do with</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee, Jesus?</span> "The sight of Jesus appears to have produced an extraordinary impression upon him. The holy, calm, gentle majesty, the tender compassion, and <span class="cmt_word">the</span> conscious sovereignty which were expressed in the aspect of our Lord, awakened in him, by force of contrast, the humbling consciousness of his own state of moral disorder" (Godet). <span class="cmt_word">Thou Son</span> <span class="cmt_word">of God most high</span>. There seems some probability that this expression was frequently used in cases of exorcism of evil spirits; for again in <a href="/acts/16-17.htm">Acts 16:17</a> the poor slave-girl, who we read had a Pythoness-spirit, which brought in no small gain to her masters, speaks of Paul and his friends, just before the apostle in his Master's Name cast the spirit out, as servants of the most high God. <span class="cmt_word">I beseech thee, torment me not</span>. In this form of possession one remarkable and very terrible feature seems to have been the divided consciousness; the sufferer identifies himself with the demons, and now one speaks, now the other. St. Matthew adds a dread detail to this petition to the Lord, "<span class="accented">before the time</span>:" the evil spirits thus recognizing a period when certain torment would be their hapless destiny. The expression "torment" meets us in the parable of Lazarus; the dwelling-place of the rich man after death is <span class="accented">a place of torment.</span> In <a href="/matthew/18-34.htm">Matthew 18:34</a> the ministers of judgment are the <span class="accented">tormentors.</span> One very solemn reason why this special case of exorcism on the part of our Lord is related with so much detail and repeated by the three evangelists, SS. Matthew, Mark, and Luke, seems to be the glimpse which the dialogue between the evil spirits and the Master opens to us of the dread realities hidden in the future for those who sin <span class="accented">deliberately</span> against the will of God. The existence of the place or state of torment is affirmed very pointedly by our Lord and his disciples; but having done this they dwell but little on it. There is a striking and solemn quotation in Dr. Morrison's 'Commentary on St. Mark' on this clear but guarded reference to the final sufferings of those who will not be submissive to the moral will of God, "Further curiosity as to the <span class="accented">when</span>, the <span class="accented">where</span>, and the <span class="accented">how</span>, does not become beings whose main business and greatest wisdom is to fly from, not to pry too close into, these terrible secrets of the dark kingdom." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he saw</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#948;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Id&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;soun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he cried out</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#958;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(anakraxas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_349.htm">Strong's 349: </a> </span><span class="str2">To shout aloud, cry out.
