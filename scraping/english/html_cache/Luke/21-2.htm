This moment occurs in the temple courts, a place bustling with activity, yet Jesus notices the seemingly insignificant act of the widow. His ability to see beyond the surface reflects His role as the ultimate judge and discerner of hearts, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God looks at the heart rather than outward appearances.<p><b>a poor widow</b><br>Widows in biblical times often represented the most vulnerable members of society, lacking financial support and social standing. The Law of Moses provided specific instructions to care for widows (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>, <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>), highlighting God's concern for them. This widow's poverty underscores her faith and dependence on God, reminiscent of the widow of Zarephath in <a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17</a>, who also demonstrated great faith in dire circumstances.<p><b>put in</b><br>The act of giving, especially in the temple, was a significant part of Jewish worship and religious duty. The temple treasury was located in the Court of Women, where both men and women could contribute. The widow's action of putting in her offering signifies her participation in worship and her willingness to give despite her lack.<p><b>two small copper coins</b><br>These coins, known as lepta, were the smallest denomination in circulation, equivalent to a fraction of a day's wage. The widow's offering, though monetarily insignificant, represents a profound sacrifice, as she gave all she had to live on. This act of giving all she had is a powerful illustration of total surrender and trust in God, paralleling the call to discipleship where Jesus asks for complete devotion (<a href="/luke/14-33.htm">Luke 14:33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, observing and teaching in the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/poor_widow.htm">Poor Widow</a></b><br>A woman of humble means who contributes two small copper coins to the temple treasury, demonstrating profound faith and sacrifice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple.htm">Temple</a></b><br>The setting of this event, a place of worship and teaching in Jerusalem where Jesus often taught.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are present as Jesus uses this moment to teach them about true giving.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/treasury.htm">Treasury</a></b><br>The location within the temple where offerings were collected, serving as the backdrop for this lesson on sacrificial giving.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_giving.htm">Sacrificial Giving</a></b><br>The widow's offering teaches us that true giving is measured by the heart and sacrifice, not the amount.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_over_wealth.htm">Faith Over Wealth</a></b><br>Her act demonstrates that faith and trust in God are more valuable than material wealth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god_sees_the_heart.htm">God Sees the Heart</a></b><br>Jesus' observation of the widow's offering reminds us that God sees and values the intentions of our hearts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>Like the widow, we are called to trust in God's provision, even when we have little.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/inspiring_generosity.htm">Inspiring Generosity</a></b><br>Her example encourages us to give generously and selflessly, regardless of our financial situation.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_21_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 21:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_21_2_Rethink_true_generosity.htm">How does Luke 21:2 challenge our understanding of true generosity and giving?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_widow_s_offering_on_giving.htm">What can we learn from the widow's offering about sacrificial giving today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Luke_21_2_2_Cor_9_7_on_giving.htm">How does Luke 21:2 connect with 2 Corinthians 9:7 on cheerful giving?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_mirror_the_widow_s_faith.htm">In what ways can we emulate the widow's faith in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Widow_s_gift_Trust_God_over_wealth.htm">How does the widow's offering inspire trust in God's provision over material wealth?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_21_2_Jesus_on_wealth_generosity.htm">What does Luke 21:2 reveal about Jesus' view on wealth and generosity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Widow_s_offering_vs_modern_giving_views.htm">How does the widow's offering in Luke 21:2 challenge modern views on giving?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_the_widow_s_gift_important.htm">Why is the widow's contribution significant in the context of Luke 21:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_widow's_mite_teach.htm">What lesson does the widow's mite teach about giving?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_work-life_balance.htm">What is worth doing even if done poorly?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_charity.htm">What does the Bible say about giving to the poor?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_generosity.htm">What are the Bible's teachings on generosity?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Luke 21:2 Mean</div><b>He saw</b><p>&#8220;Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury, and He saw&#8230;&#8221;

Scripture affirms that &#8220;the eyes of the LORD roam to and fro over all the earth&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>), reminding us that nothing escapes His attention, whether public or private (<a href="/matthew/6-4.htm">Matthew 6:4</a>).<p>&#8226; In this moment Jesus is not merely watching external movements; He is discerning hearts, as in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a> where God looks on the heart rather than appearance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a poor widow</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;a poor widow&#8230;&#8221;

Comparably, the widow of Zarephath gave her last meal to Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/17-8.htm">1 Kings 17:8&#8211;16</a>), demonstrating trust in God&#8217;s provision.<p>&#8226; Jesus had just warned about leaders who &#8220;devour widows&#8217; houses&#8221; (<a href="/luke/20-47.htm">Luke 20:47</a>); now He highlights a widow who, despite mistreatment by the system, remains faithful.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>put in</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;put in&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/luke/21-2.htm">Luke 21:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Her act is deliberate.
