In the ancient Near East, towers were often built for defense, storage, or as watchtowers in vineyards. The imagery of a tower would resonate with Jesus' audience, who understood the significance of such structures. The desire to build a tower implies ambition and foresight, qualities that are necessary for discipleship. This metaphor can be connected to the spiritual ambition required to follow Christ, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>, where Jesus speaks of taking up one's cross.<p><b>does not first sit down and count the cost</b><br>The act of sitting down suggests deliberate and thoughtful planning. Counting the cost involves assessing the resources and sacrifices necessary to achieve a goal. In the context of discipleship, this means evaluating the personal sacrifices and commitments required to follow Jesus. This principle is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/24-27.htm">Proverbs 24:27</a>, which advises preparing one's work outside and making it fit for oneself in the field before building a house. The concept of counting the cost is crucial in understanding the demands of true discipleship, as Jesus often spoke of the need to forsake all to follow Him (<a href="/luke/14-33.htm">Luke 14:33</a>).<p><b>to see if he has the resources to complete it?</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of ensuring that one has the necessary resources to finish what one starts. In the cultural context of the time, failing to complete a building project would lead to public shame and ridicule. This is a call to commitment and perseverance in the Christian life, as seen in <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>, where Paul expresses confidence that God, who began a good work in believers, will carry it on to completion. The idea of completion also ties into the concept of spiritual maturity and the fulfillment of God's purposes, as seen in <a href="/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10</a>, where believers are described as being complete in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, teaching His disciples and the crowds about the cost of discipleship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_builder.htm">The Builder</a></b><br>A hypothetical person in the parable who desires to build a tower, representing anyone considering a significant undertaking.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tower.htm">The Tower</a></b><br>A metaphor for any significant project or commitment, symbolizing the life of discipleship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost.htm">The Cost</a></b><br>Represents the necessary resources and sacrifices required to complete a task, particularly the cost of following Jesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The audience listening to Jesus, including His disciples and others interested in His teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/counting_the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">Counting the Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>Before committing to follow Christ, one must understand and be willing to accept the sacrifices involved.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/wise_planning.htm">Wise Planning</a></b><br>Just as a builder plans before constructing a tower, Christians should thoughtfully consider their spiritual journey and commitments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/resource_assessment.htm">Resource Assessment</a></b><br>Evaluate whether you have the spiritual resources, such as faith, perseverance, and community support, to sustain your walk with Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_completion.htm">Commitment to Completion</a></b><br>True discipleship requires a commitment to see it through to the end, despite challenges and obstacles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_investment.htm">Spiritual Investment</a></b><br>Investing in your spiritual life is crucial, much like ensuring you have the necessary resources to complete a building project.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_14_28_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 14:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_14_28_Why_is_planning_vital.htm">How does Luke 14:28 emphasize the importance of planning in Christian life?

Pilate had begun to build--certainly an aqueduct, probably a tower--and had not been able to finish. (See Notes on <a href="/luke/13-4.htm" title="Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think you that they were sinners above all men that dwelled in Jerusalem?">Luke 13:4</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-16.htm" title="And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.">Matthew 27:16</a>.) He had not "counted the cost," and when he was hindered from laying hands on the Corban, or treasure of the Temple, his resources failed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28-30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it? Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him, saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.</span> The imagery was not an unfamiliar one in those days. The magnificent Herodian house had a passion for erecting great buildings, sacred and profane, in the varied cities under their sway. They would doubtless be often imitated, and no doubt many an unfinished edifice testified to the foolish emulation of some would-be imitator of the extravagant royal house. Now, such incomplete piles of masonry and brickwork simply excite a contemptuous pity for the builder, who has so falsely calculated his resources when he drew the plan of the palace or villa he was never able to finish. So in the spiritual life, the would-be professor finds such living harder than he supposed, and so gives up trying after the nobler way of living altogether; and the world, who watched his feeble efforts and listened with an incredulous smile when he proclaimed his intentions, now ridicules him, and pours scorn upon what it considers an unattainable ideal. Such an attempt and failure injure the cause of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/14-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Which</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
