The act of sailing suggests a deliberate journey, often used by Jesus to reach different regions for His ministry. The Sea of Galilee, also known as Lake Gennesaret, was central to many of Jesus' teachings and miracles.<p><b>to the region of the Gerasenes</b><br>The Gerasenes refers to a region on the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee. This area was part of the Decapolis, a group of ten cities with a significant Gentile population. The presence of Gentiles is important as it shows Jesus' ministry extending beyond the Jewish people, fulfilling the prophecy of being a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>). The region is sometimes associated with Gadara or Gergesa, indicating a broader area rather than a specific city.<p><b>across the lake from Galilee</b><br>This phrase highlights the geographical transition from the predominantly Jewish region of Galilee to a more Gentile area. The Sea of Galilee served as a natural boundary between these cultural regions. This crossing signifies Jesus' intentional outreach to non-Jewish communities, emphasizing the universal scope of His mission. The lake itself is a significant biblical location, known for its sudden storms and as the site of many of Jesus' miracles, such as calming the storm (<a href="/luke/8-22.htm">Luke 8:22-25</a>) and walking on water (<a href="/matthew/14-22.htm">Matthew 14:22-33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel, performing miracles and teaching about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who accompany Him on His journey, learning from His teachings and witnessing His miracles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/region_of_the_gerasenes.htm">Region of the Gerasenes</a></b><br>A Gentile region across the Sea of Galilee, significant for its cultural and religious differences from Jewish territories.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sea_of_galilee.htm">Sea of Galilee</a></b><br>A freshwater lake in Israel, known for its role in Jesus' ministry and the miracles performed there.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gerasene_demoniac.htm">Gerasene Demoniac</a></b><br>The man possessed by demons whom Jesus encounters and heals in the subsequent verses.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_authority_over_all_realms.htm">Jesus' Authority Over All Realms</a></b><br>Jesus' journey to the Gerasenes demonstrates His authority over both Jewish and Gentile territories, symbolizing His universal lordship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/crossing_cultural_boundaries.htm">Crossing Cultural Boundaries</a></b><br>Jesus' willingness to enter a Gentile region challenges believers to reach beyond cultural and religious boundaries to share the Gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>The encounter with the demoniac highlights the reality of spiritual warfare and the power of Jesus to deliver and heal.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The disciples' journey with Jesus across the lake is a reminder of the call to follow Him into unknown and challenging situations, trusting in His guidance and power.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_8_26_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 8:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_8_26_Jesus_spiritual_authority.htm">How does Luke 8:26 demonstrate Jesus' authority over spiritual realms in our lives?

In the three narratives of Matthew, Mark, and Luke the older manuscripts vary between "Gergesenes," "Gerasenes," and" Gadarenes." <span class="accented">Gatiara</span> was a city of some importance, about three hours' journey distant from the southern end of the Lake of Gennesaret. Its ruins are well known, and are distinguished by the remains of two amphitheatres. <span class="accented">Gerasa</span> was also a place of mark, and was situate about fifty miles from the lake. These cities might in the days of our Lord have either given its name to a great district stretching to the borders of the lake. <span class="accented">Gergesa</span> was a small and very obscure town nearly opposite Capernaum. There are some ruins now on this spot still known by the very slight corruption of <span class="accented">Kerzha.</span> There is scarcely any doubt that the scene of the miracle on the poor demoniac, and of the subsequent possession of the swine, must be looked for on this spot. But it was an obscure, little-known spot, and in very early days the preachers who told the story of the great miracle may have often spoken of the country as the district of the <span class="accented">well-known</span> Gerasa or Gadara, rather than of the <span class="accented">unknown</span> village of Gergesa. Hence probably the variations in the name in the older manuscripts here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They sailed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#960;&#955;&#949;&#965;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(katepleusan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2668.htm">Strong's 2668: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sail down (from the high seas to the shore).
