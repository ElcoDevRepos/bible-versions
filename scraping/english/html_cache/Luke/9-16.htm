The five loaves and two fish were likely a typical meal for a small family, emphasizing the miraculous nature of what is about to occur. This act is reminiscent of Elisha's miracle in <a href="/2_kings/4-42.htm">2 Kings 4:42-44</a>, where a small amount of food was multiplied to feed many. It underscores Jesus' role as a provider and foreshadows the Last Supper, where bread and wine are used symbolically.<p><b>and looking up to heaven</b><br>Looking up to heaven signifies Jesus' acknowledgment of God the Father as the source of all provision. This gesture is a common Jewish practice of prayer and blessing, indicating reliance on divine power. It also reflects Jesus' intimate relationship with the Father, as seen throughout the Gospels, and sets an example of gratitude and dependence on God.<p><b>Jesus spoke a blessing</b><br>The blessing spoken by Jesus is a traditional Jewish practice before meals, thanking God for His provision. This act of blessing is significant as it transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, preparing for the miracle of multiplication. It also points to Jesus' authority and His role as the mediator between God and humanity, as He blesses the food on behalf of the people.<p><b>and broke them</b><br>Breaking the bread is a symbolic act that prefigures the breaking of Jesus' body on the cross. It is a gesture of sharing and distribution, emphasizing community and fellowship. This act is mirrored in the Last Supper (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19</a>) and is foundational for the Christian practice of Communion, where believers remember Christ's sacrifice.<p><b>Then He gave them to the disciples</b><br>Jesus involving the disciples in the distribution of the food highlights their role in His ministry. It serves as a training moment, preparing them for their future mission to spread the Gospel. This act also demonstrates the principle of stewardship, where Jesus entrusts His followers with resources to serve others.<p><b>to set before the people</b><br>The disciples setting the food before the people illustrates the orderly and communal nature of the miracle. It reflects the structure and organization within the early Christian community. This act of service is a model for Christian ministry, emphasizing the importance of meeting both spiritual and physical needs. It also fulfills the imagery of Jesus as the Good Shepherd, providing for His flock.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, performing the miracle of feeding the multitude.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who distribute the food to the crowd.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A large group of people, numbering about five thousand men, who are fed by Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_five_loaves_and_two_fish.htm">The Five Loaves and Two Fish</a></b><br>The small amount of food that Jesus multiplies to feed the crowd.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>The place to which Jesus looks as He blesses the food, signifying His connection to the Father.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_provision.htm">Divine Provision</a></b><br>Jesus demonstrates God's ability to provide abundantly beyond human limitations.<br><br>Trust in God's provision even when resources seem insufficient.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/thanksgiving_and_blessing.htm">Thanksgiving and Blessing</a></b><br>Jesus models gratitude by blessing the food, teaching us to give thanks in all circumstances.<br><br>Recognize the importance of blessing what we have, no matter how small.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/participation_in_miracles.htm">Participation in Miracles</a></b><br>The disciples are active participants, distributing the food, showing that God often involves us in His work.<br><br>Be open to being used by God to bless others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>Jesus' actions encourage us to act in faith, trusting God to multiply our efforts.<br><br>Step out in faith, even when the outcome seems impossible.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_9_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 9:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_9_16_Jesus_power_over_nature.htm">How does Luke 9:16 demonstrate Jesus' authority over creation and provision?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Gratitude_lessons_from_Jesus_in_Luke_9_16.htm">What can we learn about gratitude from Jesus' actions in Luke 9:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Luke_9_16_and_OT_provision_links.htm">How does Luke 9:16 connect with Old Testament examples of God's provision?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Jesus_gratitude_daily_3.htm">How can we apply Jesus' example of giving thanks in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Luke_9_16_inspire_trust_in_God.htm">In what ways does Luke 9:16 encourage us to trust in God's provision?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_9_16_Jesus_divine_power_shown.htm">How does Luke 9:16 demonstrate Jesus' divine authority and power?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_Jesus_bless_loaves_and_fish.htm">What is the significance of Jesus blessing the loaves and fish in Luke 9:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Luke_9_16_How_does_it_show_provision.htm">How does Luke 9:16 reflect the theme of provision in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_occurred_on_the_emmaus_road.htm">What happened on the road to Emmaus with Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_miracles_did_jesus_do_in_the_bible.htm">What miracles did Jesus perform according to the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/did_jesus_appear_to_12_or_11_disciples.htm">How many disciples did Jesus appear to after his resurrection: Twelve (1 Cor 15:5) or Eleven (Matt 27:3-5;

The verse teaches that when surrendered to Christ, the little we possess becomes more than enough; gratitude precedes increase; and God delights to involve His people in distributing His abundance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then he took the five loaves and</span> <span class="cmt_word">the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples</span> <span class="cmt_word">to set before the multitude</span>. The blessing was the usual introduction of a pious Jewish family to a meal. It was pronounced by the head of the household. An ordinary formula was, "May God, the Ever-blessed One, bless what he has given us!" The Jewish barley loaves were broad, thin cakes; these were usually <span class="accented">broken</span>, not out - hence the expression, "and brake." In SS. Mark and Luke the tense of the verb rendered "gave," in the original Greek, is an imperfect, and signifies, "he gave, and kept on giving." This supplies a hint as to the way of working the miracle. Each disciple kept coming to him for a fresh supply of bread. It was, however, as it has been well said, a miracle of the highest order, one of creative power, and is to us inconceivable. The evangelists make no attempt to explain it. They evidently did not care to ask. They beheld it, and related it to us just as they saw it in its simple grandeur. Neither disciples nor crowds seem at first to have grasped the stupendous nature of the act. St. John tells us of its effect on the crowds, who, when they came to see what had been done, wished to take him by force and make him king. For a brief space they were convinced that in the poor Galilee Rabbi they had found King Messiah - none but he could have done this great thing.
