The absence of Jesus' body is significant as it fulfills His prophecy of rising on the third day (<a href="/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>). The empty tomb is a cornerstone of Christian faith, affirming the belief in Jesus' victory over death. Historically, the tomb was located outside Jerusalem, and its emptiness was confirmed by multiple witnesses, adding credibility to the resurrection account.<p><b>They came and told us</b><br>This refers to the women who first visited the tomb, as described earlier in <a href="/luke/24.htm">Luke 24</a>. In the cultural context of the time, women were not considered reliable witnesses, yet the Gospel accounts consistently highlight their role in discovering the empty tomb. This detail underscores the authenticity of the narrative, as it would be unlikely to invent a story with women as primary witnesses if it were fabricated.<p><b>they had seen a vision of angels,</b><br>The appearance of angels is a common biblical motif, often signifying divine intervention or revelation. In this context, the angels serve as messengers confirming Jesus' resurrection. The presence of angels at the tomb connects to other significant biblical events where angels appear, such as the annunciation to Mary (<a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26-38</a>) and the announcement of Jesus' birth to the shepherds (<a href="/luke/2-8.htm">Luke 2:8-14</a>).<p><b>who said that Jesus was alive.</b><br>This declaration is the crux of the Christian message: Jesus' resurrection. It fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, which speaks of God not allowing His Holy One to see decay. The resurrection is also a type of Christ's victory over sin and death, prefigured in events like Jonah's three days in the belly of the fish (<a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>).
