The Law includes commandments and teachings given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai. This question emphasizes the importance of Scripture as the ultimate authority. Jesus often pointed back to the Law to affirm its enduring relevance (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17-18</a>). The Law was central to Jewish identity and practice, and Jesus uses it to engage with the expert in the law, highlighting the need for understanding and obedience.<p><b>Jesus replied.</b><br>This indicates Jesus' method of teaching through dialogue and questioning, a common rabbinic technique. By engaging directly with the questioner, Jesus encourages personal reflection and understanding. His response is not just about providing answers but guiding others to discover truth through Scripture. This approach is consistent with His teaching style throughout the Gospels, where He often uses questions to provoke thought and self-examination (e.g., <a href="/matthew/16-15.htm">Matthew 16:15</a>).<p><b>How do you read it?</b><br>Here, Jesus challenges the expert in the law to interpret the Scriptures personally and thoughtfully. This question implies that understanding the Law requires more than rote knowledge; it demands insight and discernment. The phrase suggests that Scripture can be read in different ways, and Jesus is prompting the expert to consider the deeper meaning and application of the Law. This approach underscores the importance of not just knowing the text but also understanding its implications for life and faith. It aligns with the broader biblical theme of seeking wisdom and understanding (<a href="/proverbs/2-2.htm">Proverbs 2:2-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to a question from an expert in the law.

His reply frames the entire conversation on salvation (<a href="/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25</a>) around Scripture, not tradition (<a href="/mark/7-8.htm">Mark 7:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus models how to disciple: respond with the Word, then invite reflection (<a href="/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27</a>; <a href="/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39</a>).<p>&#8226; His response also fulfills His role as the living Word who came to affirm, not abolish, the written Law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; The interaction shows Jesus&#8217; patience; He doesn&#8217;t immediately lecture but guides the seeker to discover truth in the canonical text, just as He did on the Emmaus road (<a href="/luke/24-32.htm">Luke 24:32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>How do you read it?</b><p>&#8226; Responsibility shifts to the hearer: Scripture is clear, but each person must engage it rightly (<a href="/nehemiah/8-8.htm">Nehemiah 8:8</a>; <a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Interpretation involves both mind and heart&#8212;reading with understanding and intent to obey (<a href="/ezra/7-10.htm">Ezra 7:10</a>; <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; question exposes superficial or selective reading; genuine reading yields the great commandments to love God and neighbor (<a href="/luke/10-27.htm">Luke 10:27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase invites humility and dependence on God&#8217;s Spirit for illumination (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-12.htm">1 Corinthians 2:12-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical takeaways:<p>&#8211; Read the whole counsel of God, not isolated verses (<a href="/acts/20-27.htm">Acts 20:27</a>).<p>&#8211; Let Scripture interpret Scripture; the Law and Prophets harmonize (<a href="/matthew/22-40.htm">Matthew 22:40</a>).<p>&#8211; Approach the text prayerfully, expecting transformation (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/10-26.htm">Luke 10:26</a> shows Jesus steering the conversation about eternal life back to the written Word, affirming its absolute authority and calling each person to a thoughtful, obedient reading. By asking, &#8220;What is written in the Law?&#8221; He grounds truth in Scripture; by adding, &#8220;How do you read it?&#8221; He presses for personal engagement and accurate application.

These phylacteries were little leather boxes (the dimensions of these varied from the size of an ordinary hazelnut, to that of a large walnut, and even in some cases much larger).
