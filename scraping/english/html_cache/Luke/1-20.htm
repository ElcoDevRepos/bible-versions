The silence serves as both a punishment for disbelief and a sign of the truth of the angel Gabriel's message. In biblical times, being unable to speak was often seen as a sign of divine intervention. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where God uses physical conditions to convey a message, such as the blindness of Saul (<a href="/acts/9-8.htm">Acts 9:8-9</a>) before his conversion to Paul.<p><b>until the day this comes to pass</b><br>This specifies the duration of Zechariah's muteness, linking it directly to the fulfillment of the prophecy concerning the birth of John the Baptist. It underscores the certainty of God's promises and the importance of faith. The temporary nature of the punishment also highlights God's mercy and the restoration that follows obedience and fulfillment of His word.<p><b>because you did not believe my words</b><br>This phrase highlights the reason for Zechariah's punishment: his lack of faith. In the context of Jewish tradition, faith in God's promises was paramount, as seen in the stories of Abraham and Moses. Zechariah's doubt contrasts with Mary's faith later in the chapter (<a href="/luke/1-38.htm">Luke 1:38</a>), emphasizing the importance of trust in God's plan. This disbelief is significant given Zechariah's role as a priest, who was expected to have a deep faith in God's power and promises.<p><b>which will be fulfilled at their proper time.</b><br>This assures the fulfillment of God's promises, emphasizing divine timing. The phrase reflects the biblical theme that God's plans unfold according to His perfect schedule, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>. It reassures believers that, despite human doubt, God's word is reliable and will come to pass. This also connects to the broader narrative of salvation history, where God's timing is crucial, such as the coming of Jesus Christ "in the fullness of time" (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A priest serving in the temple, Zechariah is the father of John the Baptist.

Heaven does not procrastinate when dealing with unbelief. Think of how quickly the floodwaters came after Noah entered the ark (<a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11&#8211;12</a>) or how immediately Lot was urged out of Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-15.htm">Genesis 19:15&#8211;16</a>). God acts in real time, and the angel&#8217;s &#8220;now&#8221; tells Zechariah that divine discipline is not theoretical&#8212;it is happening this very moment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you will be silent and unable to speak</b><p>Zechariah&#8217;s voice is taken as both sign and sentence.<p>&#8226; A sign: Every time he tries to speak and nothing comes out, he is reminded&#8212;and so are others&#8212;of the angel&#8217;s credibility (compare <a href="/exodus/4-8.htm">Exodus 4:8&#8211;9</a>, where signs authenticate God&#8217;s word).<p>&#8226; A sentence: Muteness is corrective, not destructive. Like Ezekiel, who was rendered mute until God opened his mouth to prophesy (<a href="/ezekiel/3-26.htm">Ezekiel 3:26&#8211;27</a>), Zechariah experiences a holy hush that disciplines doubting lips while preserving his life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>until the day this comes to pass</b><p>Discipline is time-limited, hope-bounded.<p>&#8226; God often couples judgment with a finish line: the forty years in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-34.htm">Numbers 14:34</a>) or Jonah&#8217;s &#8220;forty days&#8221; over Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Here, the clock is tied to fulfillment of the promise&#8212;the birth of John. The silence lasts only as long as it takes God&#8217;s word to blossom, underscoring that divine correction always serves a redemptive end (<a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because you did not believe my words</b><p>Unbelief is never shrugged off in Scripture.<p>&#8226; Israel fell in the wilderness &#8220;because of unbelief&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/3-19.htm">Hebrews 3:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The disciples were rebuked for not believing the resurrection reports (<a href="/mark/16-14.htm">Mark 16:14</a>).<p>Zechariah&#8217;s doubt is serious precisely because God&#8217;s words are utterly trustworthy. The angel links the penalty directly to the heart issue, teaching us that faith is the conduit through which God&#8217;s promises flow into experience (<a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which will be fulfilled at their proper time</b><p>God&#8217;s calendar is perfect.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Though it lingers, wait for it; it will certainly come and will not delay&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;When the fullness of time had come, God sent His Son&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).<p>The phrase reassures Zechariah&#8212;and us&#8212;that divine timing is never off. Even human doubt cannot derail God&#8217;s schedule. His word carries its own power to reach maturity exactly when He has ordained (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/1-20.htm">Luke 1:20</a> shows that God lovingly yet firmly disciplines unbelief. Zechariah&#8217;s temporary muteness serves as a living sign of God&#8217;s unbreakable promise: John will be born. The episode teaches that<p>&#8226; God acts decisively (&#8220;And now&#8221;),<p>&#8226; He disciplines to correct, not destroy (&#8220;you will be silent&#8221;),<p>&#8226; He sets a definite limit to chastening (&#8220;until the day&#8221;),<p>&#8226; He identifies unbelief as the root issue (&#8220;because you did not believe&#8221;), and<p>&#8226; He guarantees the absolute reliability of His timetable (&#8220;which will be fulfilled at their proper time&#8221;).<p>The verse invites us to trust every word God speaks, confident that His promises will arrive right on schedule.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Behold, thou shalt be dumb.</span>--The question was answered, the demand for a sign granted, but the demand had implied a want of faith, and therefore the sign took the form of a penalty.
