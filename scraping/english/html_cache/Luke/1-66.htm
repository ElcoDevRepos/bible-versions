The community's amazement reflects the cultural context of the time, where signs and wonders were often seen as indicators of divine intervention. The phrase "wondered in their hearts" suggests a deep, contemplative reflection, indicating that the events were not just surprising but also spiritually significant. This mirrors other biblical instances where God&#8217;s actions provoke awe and contemplation, such as the shepherds' reaction to the angels in <a href="/luke/2-18.htm">Luke 2:18</a>.<p><b>and asked, &#8220;What then will this child become?&#8221;</b><br>The question posed by the people highlights the anticipation and expectation surrounding John's future. In Jewish culture, the birth of a child, especially under extraordinary circumstances, often led to speculation about their destiny. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God&#8217;s purpose for individuals, as seen in the lives of figures like Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/1-27.htm">1 Samuel 1:27-28</a>) and Samson (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>). The question also foreshadows John's role as the forerunner to Jesus, preparing the way for the Messiah, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>.<p><b>For the Lord&#8217;s hand was with him.</b><br>This phrase indicates divine favor and guidance, a common biblical motif signifying God&#8217;s presence and blessing. The "Lord&#8217;s hand" implies protection, empowerment, and purpose, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures like Joseph (<a href="/genesis/39-2.htm">Genesis 39:2-3</a>) and David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-14.htm">1 Samuel 18:14</a>). This divine endorsement underscores John's significant role in salvation history, preparing the way for Jesus Christ. It also connects to the prophecy in <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, where a messenger is sent to prepare the way before the Lord, emphasizing John's prophetic mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah_and_elizabeth.htm">Zechariah and Elizabeth</a></b><br>The parents of John the Baptist, who were righteous before God and advanced in years.

The "hand" implies, in the familiar language of the Old Testament (<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="/judges/2-15.htm" title="Wherever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn to them: and they were greatly distressed.">Judges 2:15</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/30-12.htm" title="Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.">2Chronicles 30:12</a>; <a href="/ezra/7-9.htm" title="For on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God on him.">Ezra 7:9</a>), what we more commonly call the "guidance" or the "providence" of God. The phrase was essentially a Hebrew one; one of the vivid anthropomorphic idioms which they could use more boldly than other nations, because they had clearer thoughts of God as not made after the similitude of men (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-12.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only you heard a voice.">Deuteronomy 4:12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 66.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the hand of the Lord was with him</span>. This kind of pause in the history is one of the peculiarities of St. Luke's style. We meet with it several times in the gospel story and in the history of the Acts. They are vivid pictures in a few words of what happened to an individual, to a family, or to a cause, during often a long. course of years. Here the story of the childhood of the great pioneer of Christ is briefly sketched out; in it all, and through it all, there was one guiding hand - the Lord's. The expression, "hand of the Lord," was peculiarly a Hebrew thought - one of the vivid anthropomorphic idioms which, as has been aptly remarked, they could use more boldly than other nations, because they had clearer thoughts of God as not made after the similitude of men (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-12.htm">Deuteronomy 4:12</a>). Maimonides, the great Jewish writer of the twelfth century, in his 'Yad Hachazakah,' says, "And there was under his feet (<a href="/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>); written with the finger of God (<a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>); the hand of the Lord (<a href="/exodus/9-3.htm">Exodus 9:3</a>); the eyes of the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-12.htm">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>); the ears of the Lord (<a href="/numbers/11-18.htm">Numbers 11:18</a>). All these are used with reference to the intellectual capacity of the sons of men, who can comprehend only corporeal beings; so that the Law spoke in the language of the sons of men, and all these are expressions merely, just as, If I whet my glittering sword (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41</a>); for has he, then, a sword? or does he slay with a sword? Certainly not: this is only a figure; and thus all are figures" ('Yad,' chapter 1:8). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/1-66.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pantes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
