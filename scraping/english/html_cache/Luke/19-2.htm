This is ironic given his profession and reputation. His story is exclusive to Luke's Gospel, highlighting Luke's emphasis on Jesus' ministry to the marginalized and despised. Zacchaeus' encounter with Jesus demonstrates the transformative power of Christ's love and forgiveness.<p><b>a chief tax collector</b><br>As a chief tax collector, Zacchaeus held a position of significant authority and wealth. Tax collectors were often despised by their fellow Jews because they worked for the Roman occupiers and were known for extorting money. Being a chief tax collector, Zacchaeus would have overseen other tax collectors, increasing his wealth and the disdain from his community. This role underscores the radical nature of Jesus' outreach to him, as tax collectors were often equated with sinners (<a href="/matthew/9-10.htm">Matthew 9:10-11</a>).<p><b>who was very wealthy</b><br>Zacchaeus' wealth is a critical detail in understanding his story. His riches were likely amassed through the exploitation and overcharging of taxes, a common practice among tax collectors. This wealth sets the stage for the dramatic change in Zacchaeus' life after meeting Jesus, as he later offers to give half of his possessions to the poor and repay those he defrauded fourfold (<a href="/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>). This act of restitution reflects the teachings of the Old Testament regarding restitution (<a href="/exodus/22.htm">Exodus 22:1</a>) and demonstrates genuine repentance and transformation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zacchaeus.htm">Zacchaeus</a></b><br>A chief tax collector in Jericho, known for his wealth.
