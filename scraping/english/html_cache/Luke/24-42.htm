The act of giving signifies hospitality and recognition of Jesus' physical presence. In Jewish culture, sharing a meal was a sign of fellowship and acceptance. This moment underscores the reality of Jesus' bodily resurrection, countering any notion that He was merely a spirit or apparition. The disciples' act of giving also reflects their initial disbelief and need for tangible proof of His resurrection.<p><b>a piece of</b><br>The specific mention of "a piece" highlights the simplicity and ordinariness of the offering. It emphasizes the humble circumstances of the disciples, who were not wealthy and likely had limited resources. This detail also serves to illustrate the authenticity of the Gospel accounts, as such specific and mundane details are characteristic of eyewitness testimony.<p><b>broiled fish</b><br>Fish was a common food in the region, especially around the Sea of Galilee, where many of the disciples were fishermen. Broiling was a typical method of cooking fish, indicating the everyday nature of the meal. This detail connects to other scriptural instances where Jesus is associated with fish, such as the feeding of the 5,000 and the miraculous catch of fish. The consumption of fish by the resurrected Jesus further affirms His physical resurrection, as spirits do not eat. This act also fulfills Jesus' earlier promise that He would eat and drink again with His disciples in the kingdom of God, symbolizing the inauguration of the new covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus has risen from the dead and is appearing to His disciples.
