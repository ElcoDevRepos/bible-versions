Gabriel's role as a messenger is significant, as angels often serve as divine intermediaries in Scripture, delivering God's messages to humans. This encounter emphasizes the importance of the message being delivered.<p><b>The Holy Spirit will come upon you</b><br>The Holy Spirit's involvement in the conception of Jesus highlights the divine nature of His birth. The phrase "come upon you" suggests an action initiated by God, reminiscent of the Spirit's role in creation (<a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>) and empowerment of individuals for God's purposes (<a href="/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>).

The imagery of overshadowing recalls the presence of God in the Old Testament, such as the cloud that covered the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>). This signifies God's protective and creative power at work, ensuring the sanctity and divine origin of Jesus' conception.<p><b>So the Holy One to be born</b><br>The designation "Holy One" underscores the sinless nature of Jesus, set apart for God's purposes. This title is often associated with God Himself (<a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>), indicating Jesus' divine identity. His holiness is essential for His role as the perfect sacrifice for sin, fulfilling the requirements of the Law and the prophecies concerning the Messiah.<p><b>will be called the Son of God</b><br>This title affirms Jesus' divine sonship and unique relationship with God the Father. It fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah being God's Son (<a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>) and establishes His authority and identity. The term "Son of God" also connects to the New Testament revelation of the Trinity, highlighting the unity and distinct roles within the Godhead.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_gabriel.htm">The Angel Gabriel</a></b><br>A messenger from God who delivers the news of Jesus' miraculous conception to Mary.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>A young virgin chosen by God to be the mother of Jesus, demonstrating her faith and obedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, who plays a crucial role in the conception of Jesus, emphasizing the divine nature of His birth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_most_high.htm">The Most High</a></b><br>A title for God, highlighting His supreme power and authority in orchestrating the miraculous birth of Jesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son_of_god.htm">The Son of God</a></b><br>A title for Jesus, affirming His divine nature and mission as the Savior.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit is active in the miraculous and the mundane, guiding believers and empowering them for God's purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sovereignty_and_human_obedience.htm">Divine Sovereignty and Human Obedience</a></b><br>God's plans often involve human cooperation.

Again the angel makes use of the term "Highest" when alluding to the eternal Father. The expression of Gabriel, "the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee," reminds us of the opening words of Genesis, where the writer describes the dawn of life in creation in the words, "The Spirit of God moved [or, 'brooded'] over the face of the deep." "The Word was conceived in the womb of a woman, not after the manner of men, but by the singular, powerful, invisible, immediate operation of the Holy Ghost, whereby a virgin was, beyond the law of nature, enabled to conceive, and that which was conceived in her was originally and cmnpletcly sanctified" (art. 3, Bishop Pearson on the Creed). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/1-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
