The healing of the ten lepers is a testament to Jesus' power and authority over physical ailments, which were often seen as a sign of sin or impurity in Jewish culture. Leprosy, in particular, rendered individuals ceremonially unclean, isolating them from society (Leviticus 13-14). The healing signifies not only physical restoration but also social and spiritual reintegration. This moment of awareness is crucial, as it marks the beginning of gratitude and acknowledgment of God's work.<p><b>he came back</b><br>The act of returning is significant, demonstrating a conscious decision to express gratitude. In the context of Jewish customs, the healed leper's return to Jesus instead of immediately going to the priest (as prescribed in <a href="/leviticus/14.htm">Leviticus 14</a>) underscores the recognition of Jesus as the true source of healing. This return can be seen as an act of faith, prioritizing thanksgiving over ritual compliance. It also reflects the broader theme of repentance and turning back to God, a central message in the teachings of Jesus.<p><b>praising God in a loud voice</b><br>The loud voice signifies the intensity and sincerity of the man's gratitude. Publicly praising God was a common practice in Jewish worship, often seen in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/100.htm">Psalm 100:1-2</a>). This act of vocal praise not only acknowledges God's power but also serves as a testimony to others. The healed man's response contrasts with the silence of the other nine, highlighting the importance of giving glory to God for His works. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of worship and thanksgiving as essential responses to God's grace and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who heals the ten lepers.
