Servants were expected to perform their duties without expectation of gratitude or reward beyond their sustenance and shelter. This reflects the societal norms where a servant's work was seen as fulfilling their obligation. The question posed here challenges the listener to consider the nature of duty and gratitude. In biblical terms, this can be connected to the idea of serving God without expecting earthly rewards, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/6.htm">Matthew 6:1-4</a>, where acts of righteousness are to be done without seeking human praise.<p><b>because he did what he was told?</b><br>This phrase emphasizes obedience and duty. In the biblical context, obedience to God's commands is a recurring theme, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/11.htm">Deuteronomy 11:1</a>, where the Israelites are instructed to love and obey God. The servant's actions are not extraordinary but are simply fulfilling what is expected. This can be paralleled with the Christian life, where believers are called to obey God's commandments as a natural response to His authority and love, rather than for personal gain. The concept of doing one's duty without expectation of thanks is also reflected in Jesus' teaching in <a href="/luke/17-10.htm">Luke 17:10</a>, where He instructs His followers to view themselves as unworthy servants who have only done their duty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, teaching His disciples about faith, duty, and humility.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Represents believers who are called to serve God faithfully without expecting special recognition.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>Symbolizes God, who has rightful authority over His servants and expects obedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all followers of Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_context_of_duty.htm">The Context of Duty</a></b><br>The broader teaching in <a href="/bsb/luke/17.htm">Luke 17</a> about faith, forgiveness, and the nature of servanthood.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_role_as_servants.htm">Understanding Our Role as Servants</a></b><br>Believers are called to serve God faithfully, recognizing that our service is a duty, not a means to earn favor or recognition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_service.htm">Humility in Service</a></b><br>True humility acknowledges that our service to God is a response to His grace, not a basis for boasting or seeking gratitude.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_obedience.htm">Faithful Obedience</a></b><br>Our obedience to God's commands should be motivated by love and reverence, not by a desire for reward or acknowledgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_for_god's_grace.htm">Gratitude for God's Grace</a></b><br>While we may not receive thanks for our service, we should remain grateful for the opportunity to serve and for the grace that enables us to do so.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_christ's_example.htm">Reflecting Christ's Example</a></b><br>Jesus exemplified perfect servanthood and humility, and we are called to follow His example in our daily lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_17_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 17:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_17_9_Serve_God_seek_no_praise.htm">How does Luke 17:9 illustrate our duty to serve God without seeking praise?

In order to understand their bearing, we must remember how the subtle poison of self-righteousness was creeping in, even into the souls of the disciples, leading them to ask, "What shall we have therefore?" (<a href="/matthew/19-19.htm" title="Honor your father and your mother: and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.">Matthew 19:19</a>), and to ask for high places in His kingdom (<a href="/matthew/20-21.htm" title="And he said to her, What will you? She said to him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on your right hand, and the other on the left, in your kingdom.">Matthew 20:21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not. So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.</span> And for the loyal, patient, unwearied worker there must be no saying, "What shall we have therefore?" (<a href="/matthew/19-27.htm">Matthew 19:27</a>). No spirit of self-complacency and of self-satisfaction must be allowed to brood over the faithful servant's thoughts. In much of the Lord's teaching at this period of his life the position of man as regards God seems to have been dwelt on. God is all; man is nothing. In God's great love is man's real treasure; man is simply a steward of some of God's possessions for a time; man is a servant whose duty it is to work ceaselessly for his Master, God. There are hints of great rewards reserved for the faithful steward in heaven, promises that a time should come when the unwearied servant should sit down and eat and drink in his Master's house; but these high guerdons were not <span class="accented">earned</span>, but were simply <span class="accented">free, gracious gifts</span> from the Divine Sovereign to his creatures who should try to do his will. This patient, unwearied toil; this deep sense of indebtedness to God who loves man with so intense, so strange a love; this feeling that we can never do enough for him, that when we have taxed all our energies to the utmost in his service, we have done little or nothing, and yet that all the while he is smiling on with his smile of indescribable love; - this is what will increase the disciples' faith, and only this. And in this way did the Lord reply to the disciples' prayer, "Increase our faith." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/17-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Does he</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(echei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
