The context is a series of interactions where the manager is attempting to secure his future by reducing the debts owed to his master. This reflects the cultural practice of debt negotiation in ancient times, where a steward had the authority to manage and adjust accounts.<p><b>&#8216;And how much do you owe?&#8217;</b><br>The question highlights the manager's role in assessing and managing debts. In the historical context, debt was a common part of economic life, and large landowners often had many debtors. This question also emphasizes the personal responsibility of the debtor to acknowledge their debt, a theme that resonates with spiritual accountability.<p><b>&#8216;A hundred measures of wheat,&#8217; he replied.</b><br>A hundred measures of wheat is a significant amount, indicating a large debt. In ancient Palestine, wheat was a staple crop, and such a quantity would represent a substantial economic value. This reflects the agrarian society of the time and the importance of agricultural produce in the economy. The measure used here, likely a "kor," would be equivalent to about ten to twelve bushels, underscoring the magnitude of the debt.<p><b>&#8216;Take your bill and write eighty,&#8217; he told him.</b><br>The reduction of the debt from a hundred to eighty measures of wheat demonstrates the manager's shrewdness in securing favor with the debtor. This act of reducing the debt can be seen as a form of grace, mirroring the forgiveness of sins. Theologically, it can be connected to the concept of mercy and the reduction of spiritual debt through Christ's atonement. The manager's actions, while dishonest, are used by Jesus to illustrate the importance of using worldly resources wisely to secure eternal relationships.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unjust_steward.htm">The Unjust Steward</a></b><br>A manager accused of wasting his master's possessions, who seeks to secure his future by reducing the debts of his master's debtors.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_debtors.htm">The Debtors</a></b><br>Individuals who owe significant amounts to the steward's master, representing those who are in financial obligation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>The owner of the debts, who later commends the steward for his shrewdness, highlighting a lesson in worldly wisdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_measures_of_wheat.htm">The Measures of Wheat</a></b><br>A significant quantity of wheat, indicating the substantial nature of the debt and the steward's boldness in reducing it.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_context_of_the_parable.htm">The Context of the Parable</a></b><br>This parable is part of Jesus' teaching on the use of wealth and the importance of being faithful stewards of what God has entrusted to us.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_and_accountability.htm">Stewardship and Accountability</a></b><br>We are called to be faithful stewards of the resources God has given us, recognizing that we will be held accountable for how we manage them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_in_resource_management.htm">Wisdom in Resource Management</a></b><br>The parable encourages believers to use wisdom and foresight in managing earthly resources, with an eye toward eternal outcomes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generosity_and_forgiveness.htm">Generosity and Forgiveness</a></b><br>The steward's reduction of debts can inspire us to practice generosity and forgiveness, reflecting God's grace in our financial dealings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Our actions and decisions regarding wealth should be guided by an eternal perspective, prioritizing spiritual over material wealth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/learning_from_the_world.htm">Learning from the World</a></b><br>Jesus uses a worldly example to teach a spiritual truth, reminding us that we can learn valuable lessons from observing the world around us.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_16_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 16:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_16_7_Wise_financial_stewardship.htm">How does Luke 16:7 illustrate wise stewardship in financial matters today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_honesty_from_Luke_16_7.htm">What lessons on honesty can we derive from Luke 16:7?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Luke_16_7_to_Proverbs_on_integrity.htm">How does Luke 16:7 connect with Proverbs' teachings on integrity?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Use_manager_s_savvy_in_spiritual_life.htm">How can we apply the manager's shrewdness in our spiritual lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Luke_16_7_Future_accountability_lesson.htm">What does Luke 16:7 teach about preparing for future accountability before God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_16_7_Forgiveness_debt_insights.htm">What does Luke 16:7 reveal about the nature of forgiveness and debt in biblical times?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Luke_16_7_Rethink_stewardship_responsibility.htm">How does Luke 16:7 challenge our understanding of stewardship and responsibility?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_helps_explain_Luke_16_7.htm">What historical context is necessary to fully understand the message of Luke 16:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_16.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_the_steward_secure_his_future.htm">How does the unjust steward secure his future?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'word_won't_return_void'_mean.htm">How can wise budgeting reflect biblical stewardship principles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/were_women_told_about_jesus'_body.htm">Were the women informed about Jesus' body's fate?
