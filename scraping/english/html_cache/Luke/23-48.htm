The crowd likely included a mix of Jesus' followers, curious onlookers, and those who had called for His crucifixion. This gathering fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/22-17.htm">Psalm 22:17</a>, where the suffering servant is surrounded by a crowd. The crucifixion took place outside Jerusalem, at Golgotha, a site chosen for its visibility to passersby.<p><b>saw what had happened</b><br>The events surrounding Jesus' death were extraordinary, including darkness over the land (<a href="/luke/23-44.htm">Luke 23:44-45</a>) and the tearing of the temple veil (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>). These signs would have been interpreted by many as divine acts, causing them to reconsider their understanding of Jesus' identity. The centurion's declaration in <a href="/luke/23-47.htm">Luke 23:47</a>, acknowledging Jesus as righteous, further underscores the impact of these events.<p><b>they returned home</b><br>The act of returning home signifies the end of the public event.
