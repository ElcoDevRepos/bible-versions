In the context of <a href="/luke/20.htm">Luke 20</a>, Jesus is responding to the Sadducees, who did not believe in the resurrection. They presented a hypothetical scenario involving a woman who married seven brothers in succession, each of whom died. The phrase "last of all" signifies the finality of the situation, emphasizing the completeness of the woman's experience with each brother. This reflects the Sadducees' attempt to challenge the concept of resurrection by presenting an extreme case.<p><b>the woman died.</b><br>The death of the woman marks the end of the hypothetical scenario. In Jewish culture, a woman's identity and security were often tied to her husband, and her death signifies the end of her earthly ties. This scenario is used by the Sadducees to question the logistics of resurrection, as they ask whose wife she would be in the resurrection. Theologically, this phrase sets the stage for Jesus to teach about the nature of life after death, emphasizing that earthly relationships and institutions do not bind the resurrected life. Jesus' response highlights the transformative nature of the resurrection, where earthly concerns are transcended. This connects to other scriptures, such as <a href="/matthew/22-30.htm">Matthew 22:30</a>, where Jesus explains that in the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage, but will be like the angels in heaven.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sadducees.htm">The Sadducees</a></b><br>A Jewish sect known for their denial of the resurrection, who posed a question to Jesus to challenge His teachings on the resurrection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>A hypothetical figure in the Sadducees' question, who was married to seven brothers in succession, each of whom died.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seven_brothers.htm">The Seven Brothers</a></b><br>Part of the Sadducees' scenario, each brother married the woman according to the Levirate marriage law, and each died without leaving children.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure responding to the Sadducees' question, providing teaching on the resurrection and eternal life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The location where this interaction took place, during Jesus' final week before His crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_resurrection.htm">Understanding the Resurrection</a></b><br>Jesus' response to the Sadducees highlights the reality and nature of the resurrection, emphasizing that life after death is fundamentally different from earthly life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_limitations_of_human_understanding.htm">The Limitations of Human Understanding</a></b><br>The Sadducees' question reveals a limited understanding of God's power and the nature of eternal life.
