In the cultural context of the time, bowing or prostrating oneself was a common way to show respect and gratitude, especially towards someone of higher status. This action signifies the man's recognition of Jesus' divine authority and power. Similar acts of worship and reverence are seen in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>, where John falls at the feet of the glorified Christ.<p><b>in thanksgiving to Him</b><br>The expression of thanksgiving is central to this passage, highlighting the importance of gratitude in the believer's life. This man's thankfulness is not just for the physical healing he received but also for the spiritual insight and blessing that came with recognizing Jesus' role in his healing. Thanksgiving is a recurring theme in the Bible, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>, which encourages believers to give thanks in all circumstances. This act of gratitude sets the Samaritan apart from the other nine lepers who were healed but did not return to give thanks.<p><b>and he was a Samaritan</b><br>The mention of the man's Samaritan identity is significant, as Samaritans were generally despised by the Jews due to historical and religious differences. Samaritans were considered heretics and were often marginalized. This detail emphasizes the inclusivity of Jesus' ministry and the breaking down of ethnic and religious barriers. It also highlights the theme of the outsider recognizing Jesus' true identity and responding in faith, as seen in other Gospel accounts like the parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25-37</a>) and the encounter with the Samaritan woman at the well (<a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1-42</a>).

Abraham did the same when God spoke to him (<a href="/genesis/17-3.htm">Genesis 17:3</a>).<p>&#8226; It signals worship&#8212;placing oneself utterly low while elevating the Lord (<a href="/revelation/4-10.htm">Revelation 4:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; It also reflects immediate obedience; the leper doesn&#8217;t wait to reach the temple before responding.

As the narrative is peculiar to his record, we may reasonably believe that it was one of the facts with which he became acquainted in the course of his personal inquiries in Galilee and Samaria. It is significant, in this case, that the barrier had been already broken down for a time by the common pressure of calamity, but no enduring sense of fellowship had as yet taken its place. The nine would seem to have separated themselves from the Samaritan as soon as they were cleansed. Men want more than the "misery" which our common proverb associates with "strange" companions, before they learn the lesson of brotherhood in its fulness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he was a Samaritan</span>. Apparently nine of these lepers were Jews, and only one a Samaritan. This man would not have been allowed to associate with Jews but for the miserable disease with which he was afflicted, and which obliterated all distinction of race and caste. It is the same now at Jerusalem; in the leper-houses, termed "Abodes of the Unfortunate," Jews and Mohammedans will live together. Under no other circumstances will these hostile peoples do this. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/17-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He fell</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#960;&#949;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(epesen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4098.htm">Strong's 4098: </a> </span><span class="str2">A reduplicated and contracted form of peto; probably akin to petomai through the idea of alighting; to fall.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">facedown</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#972;&#963;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(pros&#333;pon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4383.htm">Strong's 4383: </a> </span><span class="str2">From pros and ops; the front, i.e. The countenance, aspect, appearance, surface; by implication, presence, person.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(para)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3844.htm">Strong's 3844: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gen: from; dat: beside, in the presence of; acc: alongside of. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus&#8217;]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
