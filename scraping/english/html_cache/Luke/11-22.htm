In the context of <a href="/luke/11.htm">Luke 11</a>, Jesus is addressing the power struggle between the kingdom of God and the forces of evil. The "stronger" one represents Jesus Himself, who has the authority to defeat Satan. This echoes the prophecy in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the seed of the woman will crush the serpent's head, symbolizing Christ's ultimate victory over sin and evil. The imagery of a stronger force overcoming a strong man is also seen in <a href="/isaiah/49-24.htm">Isaiah 49:24-25</a>, where God promises to rescue the captives from the mighty.<p><b>he takes away the armor in which the man trusted</b><br>The armor signifies the defenses and strategies that the evil forces rely on to maintain control. In a broader spiritual sense, this can represent the false securities and deceptions that people trust in apart from God. <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11-17</a> describes the armor of God, contrasting the divine protection believers have with the inadequate defenses of the enemy. The removal of armor indicates a complete disarmament, as seen in <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>, where Christ disarms the powers and authorities, making a public spectacle of them.<p><b>and then he divides up his plunder</b><br>This phrase suggests the redistribution of what was once under the control of the enemy. In a spiritual context, it signifies the liberation and restoration of those who were once captive to sin. The imagery of dividing plunder is reminiscent of the Old Testament victories where the spoils of war were distributed among the victors, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/30-26.htm">1 Samuel 30:26</a>. This also points to the Messianic prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>, where the Servant of the Lord will divide the spoils with the strong, symbolizing the triumph and reward of Christ's sacrificial work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_strong_man.htm">The Strong Man</a></b><br>Represents Satan or any evil force that holds power over individuals or situations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/someone_stronger.htm">Someone Stronger</a></b><br>Symbolizes Jesus Christ, who has the ultimate authority and power to overcome evil.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/armor.htm">Armor</a></b><br>The defenses or strategies that the strong man relies on to maintain control.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/plunder.htm">Plunder</a></b><br>The souls or possessions that are under the control of the strong man.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_attack.htm">The Attack</a></b><br>The confrontation between Jesus and the forces of evil, illustrating the spiritual battle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/christ's_supremacy.htm">Christ's Supremacy</a></b><br>Jesus is the "someone stronger" who has the power to overcome any evil force.
