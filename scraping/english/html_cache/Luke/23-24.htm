His role was to maintain order and enforce Roman law. Despite finding no fault in Jesus (<a href="/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4, 14</a>-15), Pilate ultimately chose to sentence Him, highlighting the political pressure he faced. This decision reflects the tension between Roman authority and Jewish leadership, as well as Pilate's struggle to balance justice with maintaining peace.<p><b>that their demand</b><br>The "demand" refers to the insistence of the Jewish leaders and the crowd to crucify Jesus (<a href="/luke/23-21.htm">Luke 23:21-23</a>). This demand was fueled by religious leaders who saw Jesus as a threat to their authority and the status quo. The crowd's call for crucifixion was a result of manipulation and incitement by these leaders, demonstrating the power of mob mentality and the influence of religious authorities in that era.<p><b>be met.</b><br>Pilate's decision to meet their demand underscores the fulfillment of prophecy and divine plan. <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7-8</a> speaks of the suffering servant who would be led to slaughter, and Jesus' crucifixion fulfills this prophecy. This act also typifies Jesus as the sacrificial Lamb, aligning with the Passover lamb in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, symbolizing deliverance and atonement for sin. Despite the injustice, this moment is pivotal in God's redemptive plan for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pilate.htm">Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who presided over the trial of Jesus.

<a href="/john/19-12.htm">John 19:12</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;So&#8221; shows the tragic pivot from hesitation to capitulation&#8212;fulfilling God&#8217;s foretold plan (<a href="/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pilate</b><p>&#8226; As Rome&#8217;s governor, Pilate held legal authority (<a href="/john/18-31.htm">John 18:31</a>), yet three times he affirmed Jesus&#8217; innocence (<a href="/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4, 14, 22</a>).<p>&#8226; His decision exposes the weakness of worldly power when confronted with popular demand (<a href="/matthew/27-24.htm">Matthew 27:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Although Pilate acted, the Lord remained sovereign, steering events toward the cross foretold in <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7-8</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Sentenced</b><p>&#8226; The verb underscores an official, final verdict: Jesus is handed over to be crucified (<a href="/john/19-16.htm">John 19:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Pilate&#8217;s judgment came despite clear evidence of no crime&#8212;highlighting humanity&#8217;s rejection of the righteous One (<a href="/acts/3-13.htm">Acts 3:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226;

St. Luke's account is here the briefest of the four, St. John's by far the fullest. Here we read nothing of the outrages of Pilate's troops, the purple robe, and the crown of thorns. The omissions are significant, in conjunction with that which is peculiar to him, as pointing to the sources of his information. Those who were present at Herod's court were not likely to know fully what was passing in the Praetorium.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Pilate gave sentence that it</span> <span class="cmt_word">should be as they required.</span> This sums up the result of the last charge of the Sanhedrin. Pilate's selfish fears for himself overpowered all sense of reverence, awe, and justice. There was no further discussion.
