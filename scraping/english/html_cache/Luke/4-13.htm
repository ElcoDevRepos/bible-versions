The temptations are detailed earlier in <a href="/luke/4.htm">Luke 4</a>, where Satan challenges Jesus to turn stones into bread, to worship him in exchange for the kingdoms of the world, and to test God by jumping from the temple. These temptations correspond to the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, as outlined in 1 <a href="/john/2-16.htm">John 2:16</a>. The number three often signifies completeness in biblical terms, suggesting that Jesus faced a full spectrum of temptations. This event echoes the temptation of Adam and Eve in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, but unlike the first Adam, Jesus, the second Adam, remains sinless and victorious.<p><b>he left Him</b><br>This part of the verse shows that the devil's temptations were not continuous but had a definitive end at this point. The departure of Satan signifies Jesus' triumph over the immediate trials. This victory is significant as it sets the stage for Jesus' public ministry, demonstrating His authority and sinlessness. The departure also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the seed of the woman would crush the serpent's head, symbolizing Jesus' ultimate victory over sin and Satan.<p><b>until an opportune time</b><br>This phrase suggests that the devil's departure was temporary and that he would return at a more favorable moment. This foreshadows future encounters with demonic forces and opposition throughout Jesus' ministry, culminating in the events leading to His crucifixion. The "opportune time" can be seen in moments like Peter's denial (<a href="/luke/22-31.htm">Luke 22:31-34</a>) and Judas' betrayal (<a href="/luke/22-3.htm">Luke 22:3-6</a>), where Satan's influence is evident. This ongoing spiritual battle highlights the persistent nature of temptation and the need for vigilance and reliance on God's strength, as emphasized in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God who has just undergone a period of intense temptation by the devil in the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_devil.htm">The Devil</a></b><br>The adversary who tempts Jesus, seeking to derail His mission and obedience to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting for Jesus' temptation, symbolizing a place of testing and spiritual struggle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/temptation.htm">Temptation</a></b><br>The event where Jesus is tested by the devil, highlighting His humanity and His divine mission.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/opportune_time.htm">Opportune Time</a></b><br>A future moment when the devil plans to return, indicating that spiritual warfare is ongoing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_temptation.htm">The Reality of Temptation</a></b><br>Temptation is a real and persistent challenge for believers, just as it was for Jesus.

The words of the Greek original translated "all the temptation" would be more accurately rendered by "every kind of temptation." The three great temptations, related by two of the evangelists in detail, are very varied and comprehensive in character, and appeal to most of the human passions and desires; but from the words with which St. Luke began his recital, "being forty days tempted of the devil," it is clear that Jesus was incessantly tempted the whole time by hellish whispers and suggestions, perhaps of the same kind, though with varied details, as the three we have recorded for us. Besides the uses of the temptation mystery in the development of the humanity of the blessed Son of God, the great scene has its deep lessons for all sorts and conditions of men in all times. Some eminent expositors would seem to wish to limit the area of the teaching of the temptation, and to regard it as mainly an experience preserved for the guidance of the disciples of the Master. They - so say these scholars - were, from this scene in the life of the great Teacher, to learn never to use their miraculous power for their personal advantage (first temptation); never to associate with wicked men for the attainment of good ends (second temptation); never to perform a miracle in an ostentatious spirit (third temptation). All this was doubtless contained in the Lord's story of his awful experience, and the lesson was never forgotten by the twelve and their own immediate followers. But the instruction was not meant to be confined to the little circle of his own; it was, like the whole of the gospel teaching, intended for all sorts and conditions of men. The common everyday lesson which every child may read in this story of his Master's trial, is that from the plain appointed path of duty, which very often too is the path of suffering, no persuasion however skillfully worded, no sophistry however plausible, must be sufficient to turn him<span class="cmt_word">. He departed from him for a season</span>; more accurately, <span class="accented">till a convenient season</span>. It is evident that all through the two years and a half of the public ministry, which succeeded the events just recorded, Jesus was exposed to the various trials and temptations to which suffering mortal flesh is exposed. So Bonaventura, in his 'Life of Christ,' says, "Many other were the occasions on which he endured temptation." Still there is no doubt but that the "convenient season" here pointedly alluded to referred to that other great epoch of temptation just before the cross, when our Lord prayed in the agony of the garden at the close of his earthly work. There the tempter tried if great suffering was not able to conquer that Sinless One. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/4-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
