The term "Mighty One" is often used in the Old Testament to describe God, emphasizing His power and strength (<a href="/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>, <a href="/psalms/50.htm">Psalm 50:1</a>). It reflects the Jewish understanding of God as a warrior and protector, who delivers His people from their enemies. This title also connects to the messianic expectations of a powerful deliverer.<p><b>has done great things for me.</b><br>Mary is expressing personal gratitude for the miraculous work God has done in her life, specifically the conception of Jesus. This echoes the language of the Psalms, where God's mighty acts are often recounted (<a href="/psalms/126-3.htm">Psalm 126:3</a>). The phrase highlights God's intervention in human history and His faithfulness to His promises. It also parallels the experiences of other biblical figures like Hannah, who praised God for His mighty deeds (<a href="/1_samuel/2.htm">1 Samuel 2:1-10</a>).<p><b>Holy is His name.</b><br>This phrase underscores the holiness and otherness of God. In Jewish tradition, God's name is revered and considered sacred, reflecting His purity and moral perfection (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). The holiness of God's name is a recurring theme in the Bible, emphasizing His distinct nature and the call for His people to be holy (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>, <a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>). This statement also serves as a reminder of the reverence due to God and His divine nature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>- The mother of Jesus, who is speaking in this verse.

And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.</span> In this strophe, the second division of the hymn of praise, she glorifies three of the principal Divine attributes - God's power, his holiness, and his mercy. His power or might, alluding to the words of the angel (verse 85), "The power of the Highest shall overshadow thee." Surely in all the records of the Lord's works since the world's creation, his might had been never shown as it was now about to be manifest in her. His holiness had been displayed to her in the way in which the mighty acts of ineffable love had been carried out. His mercy: this attribute of God came home with intense power to the heart of the Jewish girl, into which God's protecting Spirit was shining with so clear a light. She saw something of the great redemption mystery which was then in so strange a way developing itself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/1-49.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
