In the context of <a href="/luke/14.htm">Luke 14</a>, Jesus is teaching about the cost of discipleship, using parables to illustrate the importance of considering the commitment required to follow Him.<p><b>&#8216;This man</b><br>The reference to "this man" is a hypothetical individual in the parable. In the broader context, it represents anyone who undertakes a significant task without proper planning or commitment. This can be seen as a metaphor for those who wish to follow Christ without fully understanding or accepting the sacrifices involved.<p><b>could not finish</b><br>The inability to finish highlights the importance of perseverance and foresight. Biblically, this can be connected to the idea of enduring faith, as seen in passages like <a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1-2</a>, which encourages believers to run the race with endurance. It underscores the necessity of counting the cost before embarking on a spiritual journey.<p><b>what he started to build.&#8217;</b><br>Building is a common biblical metaphor for spiritual growth and the establishment of God's kingdom. In the historical context, construction projects required careful planning and resources, much like the spiritual life requires dedication and commitment. This phrase can be linked to <a href="/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10-15</a>, where Paul speaks of building on the foundation of Christ with care, ensuring that one's work will withstand the test of time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of the parable, teaching about the cost of discipleship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_builder.htm">The Builder</a></b><br>A hypothetical person in Jesus' parable who begins a construction project without calculating the cost.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The audience to whom Jesus is speaking, including His disciples and others following Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tower.htm">The Tower</a></b><br>The structure that the builder intends to construct, symbolizing any significant undertaking or commitment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mockers.htm">The Mockers</a></b><br>Those who ridicule the builder for failing to complete the project, representing societal judgment and the consequences of unpreparedness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/counting_the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">Counting the Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>Jesus uses this parable to illustrate the importance of understanding the commitment required to follow Him.

The phrase &#8220;which of you&#8221; moves the story from hypothetical to personal.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently calls each person to self-examination: &#8220;Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The focus stays on one individual so we understand that no one can rely on group enthusiasm; commitment to Christ is always personal (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>could not finish</b><p>&#8226; The warning is failure, not merely difficulty. The man ran out of resources and resolve before the work was done.<p>&#8226; Jesus highlights the disgrace of quitting: &#8220;Otherwise, if he lays the foundation and is unable to finish, everyone who sees it will ridicule him&#8221; (<a href="/luke/14-29.htm">Luke 14:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture urges endurance:<p>&#8211; &#8220;You were running well. Who has hindered you&#8230;?&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>).<p>&#8211; Paul models the opposite: &#8220;I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>).<p>&#8211; Jesus Himself warns, &#8220;No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God&#8221; (<a href="/luke/9-62.htm">Luke 9:62</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what he started</b><p>&#8226; Beginning a life of discipleship is more than a momentary decision; it is an ongoing walk.<p>&#8226; Initial enthusiasm without perseverance proves empty.

Jesus uses the scene to press home the necessity of counting the true cost of discipleship.
