Many Jews anticipated a political and military Messiah who would liberate them from Roman oppression and restore the kingdom of Israel to its former glory. This hope is rooted in Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>, which speak of a coming ruler from the line of David. The disciples' disappointment indicates their misunderstanding of the nature of Jesus' mission, which was spiritual redemption rather than political liberation. This expectation of redemption is also seen in the actions of figures like Simeon in <a href="/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25-32</a>, who awaited the "consolation of Israel."<p><b>And besides all this,</b><br>This phrase suggests a culmination of events and emotions. The disciples are recounting the recent happenings that have dashed their hopes. It indicates a sense of finality and resignation, as if to say that all their expectations have been proven wrong. This reflects the deep despair and confusion among Jesus' followers after His crucifixion, as they struggled to reconcile their hopes with the reality of His death.<p><b>it is the third day since these things took place.</b><br>The mention of the "third day" is significant in the context of Jesus' resurrection. Jesus had foretold His resurrection on the third day in passages such as <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a> and <a href="/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>. The third day is also symbolic in Jewish tradition, often associated with divine intervention and new beginnings, as seen in <a href="/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a>. The disciples' reference to the third day highlights their awareness of Jesus' predictions, yet their lack of understanding or belief in the resurrection. This sets the stage for the revelation of the risen Christ, emphasizing the fulfillment of prophecy and the transformative power of the resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cleopas_and_the_other_disciple.htm">Cleopas and the Other Disciple</a></b><br>These two disciples were traveling to Emmaus and were discussing the recent events concerning Jesus' crucifixion and the reports of His resurrection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Although initially unrecognized by the disciples, Jesus joins them on their journey and engages in conversation about the recent events in Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/emmaus.htm">Emmaus</a></b><br>A village about seven miles from Jerusalem, where the disciples were heading when they encountered Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Jesus was crucified and where the resurrection was first reported.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_third_day.htm">The Third Day</a></b><br>This refers to the time frame since Jesus' crucifixion, significant in Jewish eschatological expectation and prophecy fulfillment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_redemption.htm">Hope in Redemption</a></b><br>The disciples' hope for redemption was not misplaced but misunderstood.
