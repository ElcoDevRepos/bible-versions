The "wisdom of God" is often personified in Scripture, reflecting God's perfect understanding and plan. This echoes Old Testament wisdom literature, such as Proverbs, where wisdom is depicted as a guiding force. It also aligns with <a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>, where Christ is described as the wisdom of God, suggesting a Christological interpretation.<p><b>&#8216;I will send them prophets and apostles;</b><br>This statement highlights God's initiative in sending messengers to His people. Prophets were central figures in the Old Testament, serving as God's mouthpieces, calling Israel to repentance and foretelling future events. Apostles, in the New Testament context, were those sent by Christ to spread the Gospel. This reflects the continuity of God's revelation from the Old to the New Testament, showing His persistent effort to reach humanity.<p><b>some of them they will kill</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the historical reality of persecution faced by God's messengers. Many prophets, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah, faced severe opposition, and some were martyred. In the New Testament, apostles like James and Stephen were killed for their faith. This persecution fulfills Jesus' earlier warnings to His disciples about the cost of discipleship (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16-23</a>).<p><b>and others they will persecute.&#8217;</b><br>Persecution of God's messengers is a recurring theme throughout biblical history. This includes not only physical harm but also social ostracism and legal challenges. The early church, as recorded in Acts, faced significant persecution, which served to spread the Gospel further. This phrase underscores the resistance of the world to God's truth, a theme that resonates with Jesus' teachings in <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a> about the world's hatred for His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wisdom_of_god.htm">The Wisdom of God</a></b><br>This phrase refers to God's divine plan and foreknowledge.

There are, however, some remarkable variations, each of which suggests some questions of interest. (1) The words here appear at first sight as if they were a quotation from a book recognised as of divine authority, and not a few critics have supposed that there was such a book, bearing the title of "The Wisdom of God," either when our Lord spoke, or when St. Luke wrote. On the other hand there is no trace of the existence of a book with that name; and if it had been prominent enough to be quoted, as it seems to be quoted here, it could scarcely have failed to have left its impress elsewhere. On the whole, then, it seems best to look on the words as a solemn utterance which our Lord's human soul had received as an oracle from God, and which was therefore proclaimed by Him as coming from His Wisdom. His words that "Wisdom is justified of her children" (<a href="/matthew/11-19.htm" title="The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a drunkard, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.">Matthew 11:19</a>), present, it is obvious, another example of the same way of speaking of the divine purpose. (2) For "the prophets, and wise men, and scribes" of St. Matthew, we have here "prophets and apostles." The combination points to a Christian, not a pre-Christian, terminology, and is the first example of the union of the two terms that afterwards became normal. (See Note on <a href="/luke/10-1.htm" title="After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, where he himself would come.">Luke 10:1</a>.) It goes some way, it may be remarked, to confirm the view suggested in that Note, that two distinct bodies, known respectively as "Prophets" and "Apostles," had already been appointed, and that as the Twelve answered to the latter, so did the Seventy to the former.<p><span class= "bld">Some of them shall they slay and persecute.</span>--Note, as perhaps characteristic of St. Luke, the absence of the specific forms of persecution, "crucifying" and "scourging in the synagogues."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 49.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets.</span> "'Therefore" - in other words, 'Because of the determined, irreconcilable hatred of you Pharisees, and the people whom you guide, to all that is noble and true and real; because, in spite of your seeming piety, you are fast rooted in impiety' - '<span class="accented">Therefore</span> said the wisdom of God, I will send.'" The expression, "wisdom of God," has been a difficulty to commentators. The words have been referred <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to a quotation of the Lord's from a lost apocryphal book of that name; but we have no instance of Jesus ever quoting from an apocryphal book, known or unknown. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> St. Luke is here quoting from the similar passage in St. Matthew's Gospel, which, when he was compiling his Gospel, lay before him, and alludes to the earlier memoir as "The Wisdom of God." Against this we have no proof that St. Luke ever saw St. Matthew's Gospel, but a strong probability exists to the contrary; besides which, the expression is never used by an apostolic writer in such a sense. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> A reference is here intended to the Book of Proverbs, which in the early Church was known by the title of "The Wisdom of God," and the passage referred to is <a href="/luke/1-20.htm">Luke 1:20</a> and 31. Putting aside all these, it seems best to consider the expression simply as a solemn utterance of the Lord, in which he identifies himself with the "Wisdom of God." And this certainly is borne out by a comparison with the report of St. Matthew of a similar announcement made by Jesus on another occasion (<a href="/matthew/23-34.htm">Matthew 23:34</a>). There we read that the Master said, "Behold, I send unto you prophets," etc. The I is emphatic, and betrays the Divine self-consciousness of Jesus. For a moment the poor Rabbi of Galilee is forgotten, and in his lofty indignation, in his profound sorrow over the stubborn heart of Israel, on both the occasions in which he is reported to have spoken these words of awful prophecy, the Redeemer identifies Himself with <span class="accented">God.</span> St. Matthew, "Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets," etc.; St. Luke, "Therefore also said <span class="accented">the Wisdom of God</span>, I will send them prophets," etc. The form of the prediction and the original thought were both, no doubt, derived by Jesus from the solemn passage in <a href="/2_chronicles/24-19.htm">2 Chronicles 24:19</a>, "Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the Lord;... but they would not give ear," etc. This was followed immediately by the account of the preaching of Zechariah (the instance chosen here by the Lord, ver. 51), and how the faithful witness was stoned by the people in the court of the house of the Lord (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20, 21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute.</span> The title "apostle" is joined here with the well-known title of "prophet." The earthly reward that these <span class="accented">his</span> servants, the apostles, will meet with at the hands of the people of Israel will be the same as that meted out to those old martyr-prophets, viz. persecution and death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/11-49.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Because of this,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(dia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
