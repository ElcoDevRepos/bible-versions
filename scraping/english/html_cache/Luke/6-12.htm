It follows a series of teachings and miracles, including the healing of a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath, which had provoked the Pharisees. This period is marked by growing opposition from religious leaders, highlighting the tension and urgency in Jesus' ministry.<p><b>Jesus went out to the mountain</b><br>Mountains in biblical narratives often serve as places of divine revelation and communion with God. Examples include Moses receiving the Law on Mount Sinai and Elijah encountering God on Mount Horeb. Jesus' choice to go to a mountain underscores the significance of the moment and His desire for solitude and communion with the Father.<p><b>to pray</b><br>Prayer is a central aspect of Jesus' life and ministry, demonstrating His dependence on and relationship with the Father. This act of prayer before significant events, such as choosing the twelve apostles, emphasizes the importance of seeking God's guidance. It also serves as a model for believers to prioritize prayer in decision-making.<p><b>and He spent the night in prayer to God</b><br>Spending the entire night in prayer indicates the intensity and earnestness of Jesus' communion with the Father. It reflects His dedication and the weight of the decisions He was about to make. This all-night prayer session is unique in the Gospels, highlighting the critical nature of the upcoming selection of the apostles. It also connects to other instances where Jesus prays intensely, such as in the Garden of Gethsemane, showing His consistent reliance on the Father throughout His ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God, who models a life of prayer and communion with the Father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mountain.htm">The Mountain</a></b><br>A place of solitude and elevation, often used in Scripture as a setting for significant spiritual encounters and revelations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prayer.htm">Prayer</a></b><br>The act of communicating with God, which Jesus prioritizes, demonstrating its importance in His ministry and life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The recipient of Jesus' prayers, highlighting the relationship between the Father and the Son.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/night.htm">Night</a></b><br>The time Jesus chose for extended prayer, indicating dedication and the importance of uninterrupted communion with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_priority_of_prayer.htm">The Priority of Prayer</a></b><br>Jesus' example shows that prayer should be a priority in our lives, even amidst busy schedules and important tasks.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_solitude.htm">Seeking Solitude</a></b><br>Finding a quiet place to pray can help us focus and deepen our relationship with God, following Jesus' example of retreating to the mountain.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_prayer.htm">Perseverance in Prayer</a></b><br>Jesus prayed throughout the night, teaching us the value of perseverance and dedication in our prayer life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/communion_with_the_father.htm">Communion with the Father</a></b><br>Prayer is not just about requests but about communion and relationship with God, as demonstrated by Jesus.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_ministry.htm">Preparation for Ministry</a></b><br>Jesus prayed before choosing His disciples, showing that prayer is essential for making significant decisions and preparing for ministry.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_6_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 6:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Emulate_Jesus_prayer_in_life.htm">How can we emulate Jesus' example of prayer in Luke 6:12 in our lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Jesus_pray_all_night_before_choosing.htm">Why is it significant that Jesus prayed all night before choosing His apostles?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Luke_6_12_Solitude_s_role_in_prayer.htm">What does Luke 6:12 teach us about the importance of solitude in prayer?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Jesus_prayer_in_Luke_6_12_and_Bible_links.htm">How does Jesus' prayer life in Luke 6:12 connect with other biblical teachings on prayer?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Prayer_s_impact_on_decisions_in_Luke_6_12.htm">How can dedicating time to prayer impact our decision-making as seen in Luke 6:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_pray_all_night_in_Luke_6_12.htm">Why did Jesus choose to pray all night in Luke 6:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Prayer_s_role_in_Luke_6_12_for_Christians.htm">What significance does prayer hold in Luke 6:12 for Christian life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Luke_6_12_Solitude_s_role_in_prayer_2.htm">How does Luke 6:12 emphasize the importance of solitude in prayer?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_6.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_choose_judas_as_a_disciple.htm">Why did Jesus select Judas Iscariot as a disciple?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_a_prayer_vigil.htm">What defines a prayer vigil?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_is_christian_mindfulness_in_the_bible.htm">What does the Bible say about Christian mindfulness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/who_was_jesus'_tenth_disciple.htm">Who was the tenth disciple of Jesus in the list of twelve?

These he purposed to train up as the authorized exponents of his doctrine, and as the future leaders of his Church. Things had assumed a new aspect during the last few months. Jerusalem and the hierarchy, supported by the great teachers of that form of Judaism which for so long a period had swayed the hearts of the people, had, although not yet openly, declared against the views and teaching of Jesus. His acts - but far more his words - had gathered round him, especially in Galilee, in the north and central districts of Palestine, a large and rapidly increasing following. It was necessary that some steps should be taken at once to introduce among the people who had received his words gladly, some kind of organization; hence the formal choice of the twelve, who from henceforth stood nearest to him.
