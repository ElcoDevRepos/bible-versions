In the cultural context of first-century Judaism, maintaining one's honor and status was crucial. The lawyer's question follows Jesus' affirmation of the greatest commandments, which include loving one's neighbor. His attempt to justify himself suggests a self-righteous attitude, common among the Pharisees and experts in the law, who often sought to test Jesus (<a href="/luke/11-53.htm">Luke 11:53-54</a>). This reflects the human tendency to seek self-justification rather than relying on God's grace, a theme echoed in <a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>, where Paul states that no one will be justified by the works of the law.<p><b>he asked Jesus</b><br>The act of questioning Jesus was a common practice among the religious leaders of the time, often used to challenge His authority or trap Him in His words (<a href="/matthew/22-15.htm">Matthew 22:15</a>). This interaction is part of a larger narrative where Jesus is frequently confronted by those who are skeptical of His teachings. The lawyer's question is not merely for information but is a test of Jesus' interpretation of the law, which was a central concern for the Jewish leaders. Jesus often used such questions as opportunities to teach deeper spiritual truths, as seen in His parables and responses throughout the Gospels.<p><b>&#8220;And who is my neighbor?&#8221;</b><br>This question reflects a common debate among Jewish scholars of the time regarding the scope of the commandment to love one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>). Many Jews interpreted "neighbor" to mean fellow Israelites or those within their religious community. By asking this, the lawyer seeks to limit the scope of his obligation, a tendency to define moral duties in minimal terms. Jesus' response, the Parable of the Good Samaritan, expands the definition of "neighbor" to include all people, regardless of race or religion, challenging the prevailing cultural and religious boundaries. This teaching aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's love and mercy extending to all humanity, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a> and <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lawyer.htm">The Lawyer</a></b><br>A Jewish expert in the Law who questions Jesus to test Him and justify himself.

It is characteristic that no doubt seems to cross his mind as to his love of God. There he felt that he was safe. But there were misgivings as to the second commandment, and, as if feeling that there had been a tone of rebuke in our Lord's answer, he vindicates himself by asking the question, "Who is my neighbour?" No one, he thinks, could accuse him of neglecting his duties to those who lived in the same village, attended the same synagogue, who were Pharisees like himself, or even Israelites.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And who is my neighbour?</span> The self-righteous, but probably rigidly conscientious, Jewish scholar, looking into the clear, truthful eyes of the Galilaean Master he had been taught to hate as the enemy of his own narrow, lightless creed, was struck, perhaps for the first time, with the moral beauty of the words of his own Law.
