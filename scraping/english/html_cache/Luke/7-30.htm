They held significant influence in Jewish society and were often seen as the spiritual leaders of the people. The "experts in the law," also known as scribes, were scholars who interpreted and taught the Jewish law. Their role was crucial in maintaining the religious and legal standards of the time. Both groups were often in opposition to Jesus, as they felt threatened by His teachings and authority, which challenged their interpretations and practices.<p><b>rejected God&#8217;s purpose for themselves</b><br>This phrase indicates a deliberate refusal to accept the divine plan. God's purpose, in this context, refers to the call to repentance and the coming of the Kingdom of God, as heralded by John the Baptist and fulfilled in Jesus Christ. The rejection by the Pharisees and experts in the law highlights their spiritual blindness and resistance to change. This rejection is a recurring theme in the Gospels, where religious leaders often oppose Jesus' message. It also reflects the broader biblical narrative of Israel's history, where God's chosen people frequently turned away from His purposes.<p><b>because they had not been baptized by John</b><br>John the Baptist's baptism was a baptism of repentance, preparing the way for the Messiah. By refusing this baptism, the Pharisees and experts in the law were rejecting the call to repentance and the acknowledgment of their need for spiritual renewal. Baptism by John was a public declaration of one's commitment to God's coming kingdom, and their refusal signified a rejection of both John's message and the one he pointed to&#8212;Jesus. This act of non-compliance set them apart from the common people who accepted John's baptism and, by extension, Jesus' message. This refusal is also a fulfillment of the prophecy that the Messiah would be a stumbling block to those who were self-righteous and unwilling to humble themselves.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions.
