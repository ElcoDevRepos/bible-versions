It implies a moment of realization or confrontation. In the context of <a href="/luke/13.htm">Luke 13</a>, Jesus is speaking about the final judgment and the separation between those who are truly His followers and those who are not. This moment of realization is significant in biblical eschatology, where individuals come to understand their standing before God.<p><b>&#8216;We ate and drank with you&#8217;</b><br>Eating and drinking together in the ancient Near Eastern culture was a sign of fellowship and acceptance. This phrase suggests a superficial relationship with Jesus, where individuals participated in communal activities but lacked a deeper, personal commitment. In the Gospels, Jesus often shared meals with various groups, including sinners and tax collectors (e.g., <a href="/luke/5-29.htm">Luke 5:29-32</a>), highlighting His openness to all. However, this phrase warns against assuming that mere association with Jesus or participation in religious activities equates to true discipleship.<p><b>and you taught in our streets.&#8217;</b><br>Jesus' teaching in the streets signifies His public ministry and accessibility to the people. He often taught in open spaces, such as streets and synagogues, making His message available to all (e.g., <a href="/luke/4-14.htm">Luke 4:14-15</a>). This phrase underscores the widespread exposure to Jesus' teachings, yet it also highlights the tragedy of hearing His words without genuine acceptance or transformation. The reference to "our streets" indicates a familiarity with Jesus' presence and message, yet it serves as a caution against complacency and the assumption that proximity to the truth guarantees salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the crowd, warning them about the importance of genuine faith and repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The people Jesus is speaking to, who represent those who assume familiarity with Jesus is enough for salvation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_streets.htm">The Streets</a></b><br>Symbolic of the public places where Jesus taught, representing the accessibility of His teachings to all.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_banquet.htm">The Banquet</a></b><br>An implied event, symbolizing the Kingdom of God and the final judgment where entry is determined by true relationship with Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/familiarity_vs._relationship.htm">Familiarity vs. Relationship</a></b><br>Knowing about Jesus or being familiar with His teachings is not the same as having a personal relationship with Him.

Their words reveal surprise and panic&#8212;they assumed they were inside. <a href="/matthew/7-22.htm">Matthew 7:22-23</a> echoes the same scene, stressing that mere religious activity cannot replace genuine repentance and faith. The verse underscores the accuracy of Scripture&#8217;s warnings: everyone will answer personally to the Lord (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;you will say&#8221; highlights accountability. No one will be able to dispute the Lord&#8217;s verdict (<a href="/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19</a>).<p>&#8226; It also shows that final judgment is fixed; excuses will come too late (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We ate and drank with you</b><p>These speakers remind Jesus of shared meals&#8212;moments of apparent closeness. In the Gospels, multitudes literally ate with Him (<a href="/luke/9-10.htm">Luke 9:10-17</a>), yet many walked away when His teaching demanded surrender (<a href="/john/6-66.htm">John 6:66</a>). Dining in His presence never saved them; faith expressed in obedience does (<a href="/john/6-29.htm">John 6:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Physical proximity to spiritual blessings is not the same as possessing them. Israel &#8220;all ate the same spiritual food&#8221; yet fell in the wilderness (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-3.htm">1 Corinthians 10:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Modern parallels: growing up in church, taking Communion, or attending Christian events&#8212;none guarantee salvation without personal trust in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you taught in our streets.</b><p>They heard Jesus teach right where they lived. Luke records Him moving through villages, announcing the kingdom (<a href="/luke/8-1.htm">Luke 8:1</a>). Hearing truth, however, demands response (<a href="/luke/6-46.htm">Luke 6:46</a>). <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a> warns against being hearers only, deceiving ourselves.<p>&#8226; Teaching in &#8220;our streets&#8221; implies familiarity; yet familiarity can breed complacency. The soil that merely receives seed without root still perishes (<a href="/matthew/13-20.htm">Matthew 13:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; True disciples not only listen but do what He says (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). The Lord&#8217;s public preaching leaves every listener without excuse (<a href="/john/12-48.htm">John 12:48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/13-26.htm">Luke 13:26</a> exposes the danger of relying on outward association with Jesus. Shared meals and neighborhood sermons cannot substitute for repentance and a living, obedient faith. Scripture&#8217;s literal promise stands: when the door is shut, only those who truly know Christ will be welcomed in. Let each heart move beyond proximity to full surrender, trusting the One whose word is entirely accurate and eternally true.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">We have eaten and drunk . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">we ate and drank</span> . . ., and <span class= "ital">Thou didst teach.</span> The words differ slightly from those in <a href="/matthew/7-22.htm" title="Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name? and in your name have cast out devils? and in your name done many wonderful works?">Matthew 7:22</a>, which put higher claims into the mouths of the speakers, "Did we not prophecy in Thy name . . .?" They are, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the representatives of those who hold office in the Church of God, yet have not truly submitted themselves to the guidance of the Divine Teacher. Here the words clearly point to actual companionship, to the hopes that men were building on the fact that they had once sat at meat, in the house of Publican or Pharisee, with the Prophet whom they acknowledged as the Christ. In its wider application it, of course, includes all who in any sense eat and drink with Him now in visible fellowship with His Church, and who rest their hopes of eternal life on that outward communion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26, 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.

It was part of the reply to the question respecting the "fewness of the saved." The inquirer wished to know the opinion of the great Teacher on the exclusive right of Israel to salvation in the world to come, and this statement, describing salvation as something independent of all questions as to race, was the Master's reply. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/13-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
