In the cultural context of ancient Israel, shepherding was a familiar occupation. Jesus often used parables involving shepherds to connect with His listeners, as seen in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, where He refers to Himself as the Good Shepherd.<p><b>if he has a hundred sheep</b><br>A flock of a hundred sheep was a typical size for a small to medium-sized flock in ancient Palestine. This number signifies completeness and abundance. The shepherd's responsibility was to care for each sheep, reflecting God's care for His people, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>, "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want."<p><b>and loses one of them</b><br>Sheep are known for their tendency to wander, making them vulnerable to getting lost. This reflects the human condition of straying from God, as described in <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>, "All we like sheep have gone astray." The lost sheep symbolizes sinners who have wandered away from God's path.<p><b>does not leave the ninety-nine in the pasture</b><br>The shepherd's decision to leave the ninety-nine demonstrates the value placed on each individual sheep. This action highlights God's personal concern for every sinner. The pasture represents a place of safety and provision, indicating that the ninety-nine are secure while the shepherd seeks the lost one.<p><b>and go after the one that is lost</b><br>The shepherd's pursuit of the lost sheep illustrates God's relentless love and grace. This mirrors Jesus' mission to seek and save the lost, as stated in <a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>. The act of going after the lost sheep emphasizes the proactive nature of God's love.<p><b>until he finds it</b><br>The shepherd's perseverance underscores the certainty of God's redemptive plan. This reflects the assurance of salvation for those who are found, as seen in <a href="/john/6-39.htm">John 6:39</a>, where Jesus declares that He will lose none of those given to Him. The phrase assures believers of God's unwavering commitment to their salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The speaker of the parable, teaching about God's love and the value of each individual.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherd.htm">Shepherd</a></b><br>Represents God or Jesus, who cares deeply for each of His followers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheep.htm">Sheep</a></b><br>Symbolizes individuals, particularly those who have strayed from the faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pasture.htm">Pasture</a></b><br>The place where the ninety-nine sheep remain, representing the safety and community of the faithful.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/lost_sheep.htm">Lost Sheep</a></b><br>Represents those who have wandered away from God and are in need of being found and restored.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_pursuing_love.htm">God's Pursuing Love</a></b><br>God actively seeks out those who are lost, demonstrating His relentless love and grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_the_individual.htm">Value of the Individual</a></b><br>Every person is precious to God, and He rejoices over the return of even one lost soul.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_restoration.htm">Community and Restoration</a></b><br>The church should reflect God's heart by seeking to restore those who have strayed, emphasizing forgiveness and reconciliation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_reflection.htm">Personal Reflection</a></b><br>Believers should examine their own lives to ensure they are not straying and remain within the safety of God's pasture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/evangelistic_mission.htm">Evangelistic Mission</a></b><br>Christians are called to participate in God's mission by reaching out to those who are lost and sharing the message of salvation.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_15_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 15:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Luke_15_4_show_God_s_pursuit.htm">How does Luke 15:4 illustrate God's pursuit of the lost?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Shepherd_s_action_shows_God_s_love.htm">What does the shepherd's action in Luke 15:4 teach about God's love?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Emulate_shepherd_s_dedication_daily.htm">How can we emulate the shepherd's dedication in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Which_scriptures_show_God_saving_the_lost.htm">What other scriptures emphasize God's desire to seek and save the lost?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Luke_15_4_on_evangelism.htm">How does understanding Luke 15:4 impact your approach to evangelism?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_15_4_God_s_nature_human_bond.htm">What does Luke 15:4 reveal about God's nature and His relationship with humanity?

It gains, however, fresh force and interest if we remember that it followed on the great parable of the Good Shepherd in <a href="/context/john/10-1.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.">John 10:1-16</a>, and on the compassion for the lost sheep of which we read in <a href="/matthew/9-36.htm" title="But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.">Matthew 9:36</a>. The thought was, if we may use the language which rises to our lips, a dominant idea in the mind of Him who spoke. The primary application of that idea is clearly to be found in the immediate occasion of the parable, in the love which bids the Son of Man to concentrate His thoughts and energy and prayers on some one soul among those publicans and sinners who were thus gathered together; but it is, at least, a legitimate extension of it to think of it as embracing also His whole redemptive work as the Son of God, leaving the "ninety and nine," the hosts of unfallen angels and archangels, or, it may be, unfallen beings more like ourselves in other worlds than ours, and coming to the rescue of the collective humanity which had fallen and wandered from the fold.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/15-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;What</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
