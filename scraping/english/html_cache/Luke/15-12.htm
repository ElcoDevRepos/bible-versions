Traditionally, the eldest son held a place of honor and responsibility, often receiving a double portion of the inheritance (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>). The younger son's approach indicates a break from expected familial roles and responsibilities, highlighting his impatience and desire for independence.<p><b>&#8216;Father, give me my share of the estate.&#8217;</b><br>This request is significant because it implies a wish for the father's death, as inheritances were typically distributed after the father's passing. The demand for an early inheritance reflects a heart of rebellion and self-centeredness, paralleling humanity's tendency to seek autonomy from God. Theologically, this can be seen as a representation of sin, where individuals prioritize their desires over their relationship with the Father.<p><b>So he divided his property between them.</b><br>The father's response is unexpected; he grants the request without protest. This act of dividing the property demonstrates the father's grace and willingness to allow his son the freedom to choose, even if it leads to poor decisions. It reflects God's respect for human free will, allowing individuals to make choices, even when they lead away from Him. This division of property also sets the stage for the unfolding narrative of redemption and reconciliation, mirroring God's readiness to restore those who return to Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_younger_son.htm">The Younger Son</a></b><br>Represents a person who is impulsive and desires immediate gratification.

The verse lays the groundwork for the parable&#8217;s gospel arc: human rebellion meets divine freedom, human folly meets divine forbearance, and an inheritance squandered becomes the stage for overwhelming grace (<a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4&#8211;5</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">The younger of them said to his father.</span>--In its bearing on the individual life, the younger son represents the temper that is eager for independence, self-asserting, energetic; the elder that which is contemplative, devout, ceremonial, quiescent. As the latter pre-eminently characterises, as noticed above, the sons of Shem as distinguished from those of Japheth, the Semitic as distinct from the Aryan race, the younger son represents primarily the Jew who has yielded to non-Jewish tendencies; and on the wider scale of interpretation, stands for the whole Gentile world. The contrast between the Esau and Jacob types of character is reproduced (<a href="/genesis/25-27.htm" title="And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.">Genesis 25:27</a>), only here the elder brother answers to Jacob and the younger to Esau, the variation indicating that the former is with all its short-comings the natural heir of the double portion of the first-born in the spiritual inheritance of God's kingdom. Israel remains within comparatively narrow limits of thought and habitation. Japheth is "enlarged" (<a href="/genesis/9-27.htm" title="God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.">Genesis 9:27</a>) and goes forth with all his marvellous gifts of speech and thought, and fancy and invention.<p><span class= "bld">Divided unto them his living.</span>--In the normal scale of distribution, the elder son would have as his portion two-thirds of the personal, and possibly also of the real, property, the younger the remainder. In the framework of the story, the father and the elder son become, as it were, tenants in common (<a href="/luke/15-31.htm" title="And he said to him, Son, you are ever with me, and all that I have is yours.">Luke 15:31</a>), the former still retaining the general direction of affairs. The state of things so described represents roughly the life of Israel under its theocracy, acknowledging God as its true King and Father.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living. And not many days after the younger son gathered all together</span>. The subject of the story this time is not derived from humble life. The family pictured is evidently one belonging to the wealthy class. There was money to be distributed; there were estates to be cultivated; means existed to defray the cost of feasting on a large scale; mention, too, is made incidentally of costly clothing and even of gems. Like other of the Lord's parable-teachings, the framework of the story was most likely founded upon fact. The family of the father and the two sons no doubt had been personally known to the Galilaean Teacher. This imperious demand of the younger seems strange to us. Such a division, however, in the lifetime of the father was not uncommon in the East. So Abraham in his lifetime bestowed the main body of his possessions on Isaac, having previously allotted portions to his other sons. There was, however, no Jewish law which required any such bestowal of property in the parent's lifetime. It was a free gift on the part of the father. But to the young son it was a hapless boon. <p><span class="accented">"God answers sharp and sudden on some prayers;<br />And flings the thing we have asked in our face,<br />A gauntlet - with a gift in it."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">E. B. Browning.</span>) <span class="cmt_word">And took his journey into a far country</span>. The youth, who probably in the Master's experience had suggested this part of the story, after receiving his share of money, started with unformed purposes of pleasure, perhaps of trade. The man, who was a Jew, left his home for one of the great world's marts, such as Carthage or Alexandria, Antioch or Rome. <span class="cmt_word">And there wasted his substance with riotous living.</span> This is an extreme case. Few probably of the publicans and sinners whose hearts the Lord touched so deeply, and who are examples of the great class in every age to whom his gospel appeals so lovingly, had sinned so deeply as the young man of the story. Indecent haste to be free from the orderly quiet home-life, ingratitude, utter forgetfulness of all duty, the wildest profligacy, - these were the sins of the prodigal. It has been well remarked that the line runs out widely to embrace such a profligate, that every sinner may be encouraged to return to God and live. There is a grave reticence in sparing all details of the wicked life - a veil which the elder son with pitiless hand would snatch away (ver. 30). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/15-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
