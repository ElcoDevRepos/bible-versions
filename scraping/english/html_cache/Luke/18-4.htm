In the context of the parable of the persistent widow, the judge's initial refusal highlights the theme of perseverance in prayer. The judge's reluctance can be seen as a test of the widow's determination, mirroring the trials believers may face in their spiritual lives. This delay also serves to contrast the character of the unjust judge with the nature of God, who is just and attentive to the cries of His people. The concept of waiting is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>, which encourages believers to wait on the Lord.<p><b>but later he said to himself</b><br>This internal dialogue reveals a moment of self-reflection or reasoning. The judge's change of heart is not due to external pressure but rather an internal decision. This can be compared to the process of conviction or realization that leads to a change in behavior. In biblical narratives, self-reflection often precedes a significant decision or action, as seen in the story of the prodigal son in <a href="/luke/15-17.htm">Luke 15:17</a>, where he comes to his senses and decides to return to his father.<p><b>&#8216;Though I neither fear God</b><br>The judge's admission of not fearing God underscores his lack of piety and moral compass. In the cultural and historical context of the time, fear of God was a fundamental aspect of Jewish faith and justice. The fear of God is often associated with wisdom and righteousness, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>. The judge's lack of fear contrasts with the biblical ideal of a just ruler, who is expected to uphold God's laws and principles.<p><b>nor respect men</b><br>This phrase highlights the judge's disregard for human dignity and justice. In the cultural context, respect for others was a key component of social and legal systems. The judge's attitude reflects a self-centered and corrupt character, which is antithetical to the biblical call to love one's neighbor and act justly, as emphasized in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>. This lack of respect further contrasts with the character of God, who is portrayed as compassionate and just throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unjust_judge.htm">The Unjust Judge</a></b><br>A character in Jesus' parable who neither fears God nor respects people.

His refusal showcases:<p>&#8226; The reality of unjust authority figures who wield power without compassion (<a href="/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; The perseverance God often calls His people to when answers seem delayed (<a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>; <a href="/romans/12-12.htm">Romans 12:12</a>).<p>By recording the delay, Jesus stresses that unanswered petitions are not evidence of divine disinterest but invitations to persistent faith (<a href="/luke/11-5.htm">Luke 11:5-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but later</b><p>Time passes, and the judge&#8217;s stance shifts.
