In the context of the parable, the nobleman represents Jesus, and the subjects symbolize those who reject His kingship. This mirrors the historical rejection of Jesus by many of the Jewish leaders and people during His earthly ministry (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>). The hatred can be seen as a fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as "despised and rejected by men."<p><b>and sent a delegation after him</b><br>Sending a delegation indicates a formal and organized opposition. In the historical context, this reflects the actions of the Jewish leaders who opposed Jesus and sought to undermine His authority. This can also be seen in the broader context of the Roman Empire, where subjects might send delegations to appeal decisions or rulers they opposed. Theologically, it represents the persistent human resistance to divine authority.<p><b>to say, &#8216;We do not want this man to rule over us.&#8217;</b><br>This statement is a direct rejection of the nobleman's (Jesus') authority and kingship. It echoes the sentiments of the crowd during Jesus' trial, where they declared, "We have no king but Caesar" (<a href="/john/19-15.htm">John 19:15</a>). This rejection is a fulfillment of <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2-3</a>, where the nations conspire against the Lord and His Anointed.

They organise a formal protest, paralleling how Israel&#8217;s leaders appealed to Rome against Jesus (<a href="/john/19-12.htm">John 19:12-15</a>).<p>&#8226; In <a href="/1_samuel/8-4.htm">1 Samuel 8:4-7</a> the elders of Israel similarly &#8220;gathered together&#8221; to demand a king &#8220;like all the nations,&#8221; rejecting God&#8217;s direct rule. The pattern repeats: when the Lord offers righteous authority, fallen humanity seeks an alternative.<p>&#8226; The delegation going &#8220;after him&#8221; underscores that rejection continues even after Christ&#8217;s ascension; the world keeps lobbying against His claims (<a href="/acts/4-17.htm">Acts 4:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to say</b><p>&#8226; Words matter in Scripture. The delegation&#8217;s message isn&#8217;t vague grumbling but a clear, willful declaration&#8212;mirroring the Sanhedrin&#8217;s formal charges (<a href="/mark/14-55.htm">Mark 14:55-64</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a> reminds us, &#8220;Death and life are in the power of the tongue,&#8221; and here the tongue is used to resist life Himself.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;We do not want this man to rule over us.&#8217;</b><p>&#8226; The statement lays bare the heart of sin: a refusal of Christ&#8217;s lordship. <a href="/romans/8-7.htm">Romans 8:7</a> describes the mindset: &#8220;The mind of the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God&#8217;s law.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By calling Him &#8220;this man,&#8221; they reduce the nobleman to mere humanity, denying His rightful kingship&#8212;just as the crowds called Jesus &#8220;this fellow&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The rebellion is futile; the nobleman will still return as king (<a href="/luke/19-15.htm">Luke 19:15</a>). <a href="/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a> affirms, &#8220;God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.&#8221; Submission is not optional; it is reality we either embrace in faith or face in judgment (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/19-14.htm">Luke 19:14</a> exposes the human heart&#8217;s default stance toward God&#8217;s rightful rule: hatred that turns into organized, vocal rebellion. In the parable Jesus forecasts His own rejection, yet He also signals that such defiance cannot overturn His kingship. The verse calls believers to recognize Christ&#8217;s absolute authority, reject the spirit of the rebellious delegation, and joyfully submit to the King who will surely return.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him.</span>--Here, also, recent history supplied a feature in the parable. This was precisely what the Jews had done in the case of Archelaus, both at the time referred to in the Note on <a href="/luke/19-12.htm" title="He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.">Luke 19:12</a>, and later on, when their complaints were brought before the Emperor, and led to his deposition and banishment to Gaul. That which answers to it in the inner meaning of the parable is the unwillingness of the Jews--or, taking a wider view of the interpretation, of mankind at large--to accept the law of Christ or acknowledge His sovereignty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But his citizens hated him</span>. Again history supplies the framework. This was what the Jews had done in the case of Archelaus. They had sent a hostile deputation to complain of their future king before the emperor's court at Rome. In the parable, in these "citizens who hated him" a thinly veiled picture is given of those Jews who utterly rejected the mission of Jesus, and by whose designs the Crucifixion was brought about. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/19-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
