In biblical context, God's favor often rests on those who are lowly or marginalized, as seen in the stories of David and Gideon. The term "looked with favor" suggests divine grace and election, reminiscent of God's choice of Israel as His people. The "humble state" refers to Mary's socioeconomic status and her humility before God. This reflects the biblical theme that God exalts the humble and opposes the proud (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). The term "servant" underscores Mary's role as a willing participant in God's plan, echoing the servanthood of key biblical figures like Moses and the prophetic "Servant of the Lord" in Isaiah.<p><b>From now on all generations will call me blessed.</b><br>This phrase indicates the perpetual honor that Mary will receive throughout history. The term "all generations" suggests a universal and timeless recognition, aligning with the biblical principle that God's works are remembered across ages (<a href="/psalms/145-4.htm">Psalm 145:4</a>). The word "blessed" signifies a state of happiness and favor, often associated with those who are part of God's redemptive plan. This connects to the Beatitudes in <a href="/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5</a>, where Jesus describes the blessedness of those who embody kingdom values. Mary's blessedness is not due to her own merit but because of her unique role in bearing the Messiah, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, which speaks of a virgin bearing a son called Immanuel. This phrase also prefigures the honor given to those who are faithful to God's calling, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>'s "hall of faith."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>The mother of Jesus, who is speaking in this verse.

Mary qualifies on both counts&#8212;she bore the Word and believed it (<a href="/luke/1-45.htm">Luke 1:45</a>).<p>- Believers honor Mary without adoring her; the spotlight stays on the Lord who blessed her (<a href="/luke/1-49.htm">Luke 1:49</a>).<p>- Every Christmas carol, creed, and testimony that mentions her fulfills this prophecy, proving Scripture&#8217;s reliability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/1-48.htm">Luke 1:48</a> presents a four-fold testimony: God actively notices, He chooses the humble, He launches a work that spans every generation, and He causes His people to recognize His blessings.
