The context is a discussion among the disciples about who would be the greatest in the Kingdom, revealing their misunderstanding of Jesus' mission and values.<p><b>Whoever welcomes this little child in My name</b><br>In the cultural context of the time, children were considered low in social status and without power. By using a child as an example, Jesus emphasizes humility and the importance of serving those who are often overlooked. Welcoming a child "in My name" suggests acting with the authority and character of Jesus, highlighting the importance of intention and heart posture in service.<p><b>welcomes Me</b><br>This phrase underscores the identification of Jesus with the lowly and humble. It reflects the biblical principle that serving others, especially those who cannot repay, is akin to serving Christ Himself. This teaching is consistent with <a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>, where Jesus says that whatever is done for the least of His brothers is done for Him.<p><b>and whoever welcomes Me welcomes the One who sent Me</b><br>Here, Jesus connects His mission directly to God the Father, affirming His divine authority and unity with God. This reflects the Johannine theme found in <a href="/john/12-44.htm">John 12:44-45</a>, where Jesus states that believing in Him is believing in the One who sent Him. It emphasizes the Trinitarian relationship and the representation of God through Jesus.<p><b>For whoever is the least among all of you</b><br>This phrase challenges the disciples' notions of greatness and status. In the Greco-Roman world, social hierarchy was significant, and being "least" was undesirable. Jesus subverts this by suggesting that true greatness in God's Kingdom is found in humility and servitude.<p><b>he is the greatest</b><br>This paradoxical statement is a hallmark of Jesus' teaching, where the values of the Kingdom often invert worldly values. It echoes the Beatitudes in <a href="/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5</a>, where the meek and poor in spirit are blessed. This teaching encourages believers to pursue humility and service, reflecting the character of Christ, who came not to be served but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, teaching His disciples about humility and greatness in the kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>- Jesus' followers who are being taught a lesson on humility and service.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_child.htm">The Child</a></b><br>- Represents innocence, humility, and the least in society, used by Jesus as an example to convey His message.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_one_who_sent_me.htm">The One who sent Me</a></b><br>- Refers to God the Father, emphasizing the divine authority and mission of Jesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_god.htm">The Kingdom of God</a></b><br>- The broader context of Jesus' teaching, focusing on the values and principles of God's reign.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_as_greatness.htm">Humility as Greatness</a></b><br>True greatness in the kingdom of God is measured by humility and service, not by worldly standards of power and status.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/welcoming_the_least.htm">Welcoming the Least</a></b><br>Embracing and serving those who are considered the least in society is akin to welcoming Christ Himself.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/childlike_faith.htm">Childlike Faith</a></b><br>Believers are called to exhibit childlike faith and trust in God, characterized by innocence and dependence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_christ's_character.htm">Reflecting Christ's Character</a></b><br>As followers of Christ, we are to reflect His character by valuing humility and service over self-promotion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_authority_and_mission.htm">Divine Authority and Mission</a></b><br>Recognizing Jesus' divine mission and authority compels us to align our values with His teachings on humility and service.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_9_48_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 9:48?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_9_48_s_view_on_true_greatness.htm">How does Luke 9:48 redefine greatness in the kingdom of God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_least_among_you_teach_humility.htm">What does "least among you" teach about humility and leadership?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_receives_this_child_daily.htm">How can we apply "receives this child" in our daily interactions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Other_Scriptures_on_serving_for_greatness.htm">Which other Scriptures emphasize serving others as a path to greatness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_embody_humility_in_community_church.htm">How can we embody being "least" in our community and church?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Luke_9_48_Rethink_greatness_humility.htm">How does Luke 9:48 challenge our understanding of greatness and humility in society?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_least_among_you_in_Luke_9_48.htm">What does "the least among you all" mean in the context of Luke 9:48?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Luke_9_48_Leadership_redefined_biblically.htm">How does Luke 9:48 redefine leadership and authority from a biblical perspective?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_luke_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Luke 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'lord_of_the_harvest'_mean.htm">Mary, did you know your son would change the world?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what's_the_essence_of_faith_and_unity.htm">Will a little child lead them?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_does_luke_10_25-37_view_samaritans.htm">Luke 10:25-37 -

The general lesson here - and it is one that has gone to the heart more or less of <span class="accented">all</span> professing Christians - is that all the followers of Jesus should practise humility before, and show tenderness to, the weak. It is one of the great sayings of the Master which has stirred that practical charity which has ever been one of the great characteristic features of Christianity. But while the general lesson is clear, the particular reminder still claims attention. Singular and touching was the affection of Jesus for children. Several marked instances of this are noted in the Gospels.
