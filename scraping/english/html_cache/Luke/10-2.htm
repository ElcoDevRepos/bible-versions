It is a moment of instruction and preparation as He sends them out on a mission. The context is Jesus preparing the seventy-two disciples for their mission, emphasizing the importance of their role in spreading the Gospel. This reflects the broader mission of the Church to evangelize and disciple nations.<p><b>The harvest is plentiful</b><br>The "harvest" symbolizes the multitude of people ready to receive the Gospel. In an agrarian society, harvest time was crucial and required many laborers. Spiritually, it signifies the readiness of people's hearts to accept the message of salvation. This imagery is consistent with Old Testament references to harvest as a time of gathering and judgment (e.g., <a href="/joel/3-13.htm">Joel 3:13</a>).<p><b>But the workers are few</b><br>This highlights the shortage of those willing or prepared to spread the Gospel. Historically, the early Church faced persecution and challenges, making the task of evangelism daunting. The scarcity of workers underscores the need for more disciples to engage in the mission field, a call that remains relevant today.<p><b>Ask the Lord of the harvest</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the necessity of prayer in the mission of evangelism. It acknowledges God's sovereignty over the mission field and the need for divine intervention. The "Lord of the harvest" is a title that affirms God's authority and control over the spiritual harvest, aligning with His role as the ultimate judge and gatherer of souls.<p><b>Therefore, to send out workers</b><br>The call to "send out" workers implies a proactive and intentional effort to recruit and deploy individuals for ministry. This reflects the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) where Jesus commands His followers to go and make disciples. It suggests a sense of urgency and purpose in fulfilling God's mission.<p><b>Into His harvest</b><br>The harvest belongs to God, indicating that the mission is ultimately His work. This phrase reassures believers that they are participating in God's divine plan. It also implies that the success of the mission is dependent on God's provision and guidance, reinforcing the need for reliance on Him in all evangelistic efforts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is instructing His disciples on the need for more workers in the spiritual harvest.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, tasked with spreading the Gospel and preparing for the Kingdom of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_harvest.htm">The Harvest</a></b><br>A metaphor for the people who are ready to receive the Gospel.

Every believer is invited to join this prayer and be ready to become part of God&#8217;s answer, trusting that He has already prepared hearts and will provide all that is needed for the gathering of His harvest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">The harvest truly is great.</span>--See Note on <a href="/matthew/9-37.htm" title="Then said he to his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few;">Matthew 9:37</a>. The verses that follow contain, as might have been expected from the analogous circumstances, much in common with those spoken on the mission of the Twelve. We have here, as in the sermons on the Mount and on the Plain, an example of our Lord's repeating the expression of the same thoughts in nearly the same language.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest</span>. This and many of the sayings reported on this occasion had been said apparently before, when the twelve had been sent out on a similar mission. It seems almost certain that, on several occasions, the Lord repeated the same expressions containing great truths, with scarcely any variation in language. The harvest simile was evidently a favourite one of the Master. "The field is the world" he told them in the parable of the sower.
