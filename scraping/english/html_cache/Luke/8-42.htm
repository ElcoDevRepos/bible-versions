The mention of her age, "about twelve," is noteworthy as it marks the transition from childhood to womanhood in Jewish tradition, a time when a girl would be considered ready for marriage. This age also symbolizes the beginning of new life, contrasting with her impending death. The urgency of the situation is heightened by the fact that she is dying, emphasizing the desperation and faith of Jairus in seeking Jesus' help. This narrative sets the stage for a miracle that demonstrates Jesus' power over life and death, foreshadowing His own resurrection.<p><b>As Jesus went with him,</b><br>Jesus' willingness to go with Jairus highlights His compassion and readiness to respond to those in need, regardless of their social status. Jairus, being a synagogue leader, represents the Jewish religious establishment, which often opposed Jesus. Yet, Jesus does not hesitate to accompany him, showing that His mission transcends social and religious boundaries. This act of going with Jairus also illustrates Jesus' role as the Good Shepherd, who is attentive to the cries of His flock.<p><b>the crowds pressed around Him,</b><br>The pressing crowds indicate Jesus' growing popularity and the widespread recognition of His authority and power. This scene reflects the intense interest and hope that people placed in Jesus, seeking healing and teaching. The crowd's presence also serves as a narrative device to heighten the tension and urgency of the situation, as it complicates Jesus' journey to Jairus' house. The pressing crowds can be seen as a metaphor for the world's demands on Jesus, yet He remains focused on His mission. This moment foreshadows the challenges Jesus will face in His ministry, where He must navigate the expectations and needs of the people while fulfilling His divine purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jairus.htm">Jairus</a></b><br>A synagogue leader who approaches Jesus with a desperate plea for his dying daughter.
