In the context of <a href="/luke/11.htm">Luke 11</a>, Jesus is addressing the Pharisees, who were known for their strict adherence to the law but often neglected the weightier matters of justice and mercy. The concept of "alms" traditionally refers to charitable giving, but here it is metaphorically applied to the inner qualities of the heart. This aligns with the teachings found in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God looks at the heart rather than outward appearances. The call to give from within suggests a transformation that begins internally, reflecting the new covenant promise of a heart changed by the Spirit (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>).<p><b>and behold, everything will be clean for you</b><br>This statement underscores the biblical principle that true cleanliness or purity is a matter of the heart. In Jewish culture, ceremonial cleanliness was a significant aspect of religious life, with numerous laws governing what was considered clean or unclean. Jesus challenges this by asserting that inner purity leads to true cleanliness. This teaching is consistent with passages like <a href="/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>, where Jesus criticizes the Pharisees for cleaning the outside of the cup while neglecting the inside. The promise of being "clean" for those who give from within points to the transformative power of genuine repentance and faith, which aligns with the broader biblical narrative of redemption and sanctification through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, addressing the Pharisees and religious leaders, challenging their understanding of purity and righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions, often criticized by Jesus for their hypocrisy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/almsgiving.htm">Almsgiving</a></b><br>The act of giving to the poor, which in this context, Jesus uses metaphorically to refer to giving from the heart.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/inner_purity_over_outward_rituals.htm">Inner Purity Over Outward Rituals</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes the importance of inner purity and sincerity over mere outward religious rituals.

Throughout <a href="/bsb/luke/11.htm">Luke 11</a> He has exposed the Pharisees for polishing &#8220;the outside of the cup&#8221; while leaving the inside filthy (<a href="/luke/11-39.htm">Luke 11:39&#8211;40</a>). With the conjunction &#8220;But,&#8221; He contrasts hollow ritual with genuine devotion. Scripture repeatedly sets these two paths side by side&#8212;think of <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, where Samuel asks, &#8220;Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the LORD?&#8221;. The Lord desires heart reality over external show.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>give as alms</b><p>Almsgiving was a celebrated act of piety in first-century Judaism, yet Jesus redirects it. He is not condemning charitable gifts (<a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>; <a href="/acts/10-2.htm">Acts 10:2</a>) but redefining what truly counts as charity. In <a href="/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1&#8211;4</a> He warns that public giving can become a performance; here He invites a generosity that flows from a cleansed heart. The command reaches beyond money&#8212;&#8220;alms&#8221; become a metaphor for any self-giving act offered to God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the things that are within you</b><p>This phrase targets the inner life&#8212;motives, attitudes, affections. <a href="/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a> declares, &#8220;Surely You desire truth in the inmost being&#8221;. Jesus wants us to surrender the hidden chambers that no one else sees. When we yield pride, bitterness, and self-righteousness, we are presenting the most valuable &#8220;offering&#8221; we possess (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). Such inward surrender spills outward in genuine acts of mercy (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and behold</b><p>&#8220;Behold&#8221; invites careful attention to the promised outcome. Whenever Scripture uses this word, it signals something worth pausing over (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>). Jesus wants His listeners to marvel at the transformation that follows authentic, inside-out generosity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>everything will be clean for you</b><p>The promise is comprehensive: when the heart is yielded, &#8220;everything&#8221; becomes clean. This echoes <a href="/titus/1-15.htm">Titus 1:15</a>, &#8220;To the pure, all things are pure&#8221;. Cleansing here is both moral and relational&#8212;right standing before God and right practice before people. It does not negate the need for Christ&#8217;s atoning blood (<a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>); rather, it affirms that inward surrender is evidence that one has been truly washed. Outward rituals cannot purify a corrupt heart (<a href="/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25&#8211;26</a>), but an inwardly transformed person will naturally live a life God counts as clean.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/11-41.htm">Luke 11:41</a> teaches that true purity starts in the heart. Jesus calls us to give Him our hidden motives and affections as the real &#8220;alms.&#8221; When we surrender the inside, authentic generosity and practical holiness flow outside, and God pronounces every aspect of life clean.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">But rather give alms of such things as ye have.</span>--This, too, is peculiar to St. Luke. In the underlying principle of its teaching it sweeps away the whole fabric of the law of ceremonial purity, as the words of St. <a href="/context/matthew/15-10.htm" title="And he called the multitude, and said to them, Hear, and understand:">Matthew 15:10-20</a> had, on different grounds, done before. The distinction between the two phases of the truth is that here greater stress is laid on the active purifying power of the love of which alms, if not given for the sake of man's praise, is the natural expression. That which defiles is selfishness; that which purifies is the unselfishness of love.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you</span>. The translation here should run, <span class="accented">but rather give the things that are in them as alms</span>, etc. The thought of the <span class="accented">contents</span> of these cups and dishes - a thought which came out, as we have seen, so prominently in St. Matthew - here is evidently in the Lord's mind. "Ah!" he seems to say, "what you Pharisees and your schools of formalism indeed want is the knowledge of that great law of love" (the law Jesus was ever teaching in such parables, for instance, as that of the good Samaritan). "I will tell you how really to purify, in the eyes of God, these cups and dishes of yours. <span class="accented">Share their contents with your poorer neighbors."</span> "Let them do one single loving, unselfish act, not for the sake of the action itself, not for any merit inherent in it; but out of pure good will towards others, and their whole inward condition would be different" (Bishop Basil Jones, in the 'Speaker's Commentary'). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/11-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#955;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(pl&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4133.htm">Strong's 4133: </a> </span><span class="str2">However, nevertheless, but, except that, yet.
