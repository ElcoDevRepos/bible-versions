The synagogue was a central place for Jewish worship and community life, where the Torah was read and expounded. Jesus often taught in synagogues, demonstrating His role as a teacher and fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>, which He had just read in the synagogue (<a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-21</a>). His authority in teaching and performing miracles was a sign of His messianic identity.<p><b>He went to the home of Simon</b><br>Simon, also known as Peter, was one of Jesus' first disciples. This visit to Simon's home in Capernaum highlights the close relationship between Jesus and His disciples. Capernaum was a significant location in Jesus' ministry, serving as His base of operations in Galilee. Archaeological evidence suggests that Capernaum was a prosperous fishing village, and the remains of what is believed to be Peter's house have been discovered, indicating the historical reliability of the Gospel accounts.<p><b>whose mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever</b><br>The mention of Simon's mother-in-law indicates that Simon was married, providing insight into the personal lives of the disciples. In the cultural context, a high fever was a serious condition, often seen as life-threatening. The detail of her illness underscores the human need for Jesus' healing power and compassion. This account also highlights the role of women in the Gospel narratives, as Jesus' ministry often included acts of kindness and healing towards women.<p><b>So they appealed to Jesus on her behalf</b><br>This phrase shows the faith and intercession of those present, likely including Simon and other family members. Their appeal to Jesus demonstrates their belief in His ability to heal and their trust in His compassion. Intercession is a recurring theme in Scripture, where individuals seek God's intervention for others, as seen in the prayers of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22-33</a>) and Moses (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>).

The sequence matters.<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; authority in teaching and deliverance carries straight into everyday life&#8212;no gap between public worship and private living (cf. <a href="/mark/1-21.htm">Mark 1:21-28</a>).<p>&#8226; The literal departure underscores movement: truth proclaimed in the synagogue is now about to be embodied in compassionate action at home.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a> reminds us that Jesus &#8220;went about doing good and healing all,&#8221; matching Luke&#8217;s portrait of unbroken ministry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He went to the home of Simon</b><p>&#8220;He went to the home of Simon.&#8221; This is Simon Peter, already following Jesus (<a href="/john/1-40.htm">John 1:40-42</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus chooses a disciple&#8217;s ordinary dwelling as His next stop (<a href="/mark/1-29.htm">Mark 1:29</a>).

And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her. This abrupt mention of Peter (Simon) for the first time, without any explanatory notice, tells us that when St. Luke wrote his Gospel Peter was well known and honored in all the Churches. The Lord's choice of one who was already married, the subsequent favor showed to him, the high position evidently accorded to him in the Church of the first days, is a perpetual protest against the exaggerated asceticism which later was so earnestly taught in ecclesiastical Christianity. The epithet "great," applied to the fever, was a well-known technical term; it was used by Galen of fevers. There are several expressions in this Gospel which remind us that the author was a trained physician. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/4-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Jesus] left</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8048;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Anastas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_450.htm">Strong's 450: </a> </span><span class="str2">To raise up, set up; I rise from among (the) dead; I arise, appear.
