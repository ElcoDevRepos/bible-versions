In the parable context, these enemies are those who refuse to accept the nobleman's rule. Biblically, this can be seen as a reference to those who reject God's sovereignty, paralleling the rejection of Jesus by many during His earthly ministry (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>).<p><b>who were unwilling for me to rule over them</b><br>This highlights the willful rebellion and rejection of authority. Historically, this reflects the Jewish leaders and people who did not accept Jesus as the Messiah. It also speaks to the broader human condition of resisting divine authority, echoing the rebellion seen in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3).<p><b>bring them here</b><br>This command indicates a gathering for judgment. In biblical terms, it reflects the gathering of nations for judgment at the end of the age (<a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>). It underscores the inevitability of divine judgment for those who reject Christ's rule.<p><b>and slay them in front of me</b><br>This phrase is a stark depiction of judgment. It symbolizes the ultimate consequence of rejecting Christ, which is spiritual death and separation from God. The imagery is reminiscent of Old Testament judgments where enemies of God faced destruction (e.g., the Canaanites in Joshua). It serves as a sobering reminder of the seriousness of rejecting God's offer of salvation through Jesus Christ.<p><b>&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The closing quotation marks indicate the end of the parable's direct speech, emphasizing the finality and authority of the speaker's words.

The nobleman stands for Christ, the journey for His ascension, the return for His second coming, and the enemies for every heart that refuses His lordship. Scripture presents this outcome as certain, just, and final. The passage therefore calls each listener to embrace the King now, living in faithful allegiance rather than defiant resistance, confident that His justice and mercy are perfectly balanced in the gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">But those mine enemies.</span>--This feature of the parable is peculiar to St. Luke's report. Like the earlier portions of the outer framework of the story, it had an historical groundwork in the conduct of Archelaus on his return from Rome (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, ii.</span> 7, ? 3). Spiritually, it represents, in bold figures drawn from the acts of tyrant kings, the ultimate victory of the Christ over the unbelieving and rebellious. (Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm" title="For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.">1Corinthians 15:25</a>.) They who will not have Him to reign over them will learn that He does reign, and having shut Love out, will themselves be shut out from Love.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me</span>. An obvious reference to the Lord's dealings with the chosen people, and an unmistakable reference to the awful ruin and disaster which was so soon to overwhelm the city and temple and the whole nationality. But behind this temporal reference there looms in the background the vast shadow of a terrible eternal doom reserved for the enemies of the Redeemer. Godet has a beautiful and suggestive note on the signification of the ten and five cities, the reward of the faithful toiler here. "They," the "cities," "represent mortal beings in a lower state of development, but whom the glorified faithful are commissioned to raise to their Divine destination." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/19-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#955;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(pl&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4133.htm">Strong's 4133: </a> </span><span class="str2">However, nevertheless, but, except that, yet.
