The return signifies Christ's second coming. The concept of procuring kingship echoes the historical context of rulers in the Roman Empire who traveled to Rome to receive official authority. This mirrors Jesus' ascension and His eventual return with full authority as King of Kings, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>.<p><b>he summoned the servants</b><br>The summoning of the servants indicates a time of accountability and judgment.

It underscores the biblical theme of bearing fruit, as seen in <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5-8</a>, where Jesus speaks of the importance of abiding in Him to bear much fruit.
