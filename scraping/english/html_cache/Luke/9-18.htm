The private nature of this prayer indicates a moment of intimacy and reflection, possibly preparing for the significant revelation to follow. Jesus often withdrew to solitary places to pray (<a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>), underscoring the importance of personal communion with God.<p><b>and the disciples were with Him</b><br>The presence of the disciples suggests that they were witnesses to Jesus' prayer life, learning from His example. This setting also indicates a moment of teaching and revelation, as Jesus often used such times to instruct His closest followers. The disciples' proximity to Jesus during His prayer underscores their role as His chosen companions and future leaders of the Church.<p><b>He questioned them:</b><br>Jesus often used questions as a teaching method, prompting His disciples to think deeply and reflect on their understanding. This approach encourages personal reflection and growth in faith. The question that follows is pivotal, as it addresses the core of Jesus' identity and mission.<p><b>&#8220;Who do the crowds say I am?&#8221;</b><br>This question addresses the public perception of Jesus, reflecting the varied opinions and expectations of the Messiah among the people. At this time, many saw Jesus as a prophet or a teacher, but there was confusion about His true identity. This question sets the stage for the more personal and profound question that follows, concerning the disciples' own understanding of who Jesus is.

We cannot get beyond a conjectural explanation of these phenomena, but it is possible that, as a matter of fact, he simply did not learn these facts in the course of his inquiries, and therefore did not insert them. As far as it goes, the fact suggests the inference that he had not seen the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Mark in the form in which we now have them. On the narrative that follows (<a href="/context/luke/9-18.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?">Luke 9:18-27</a>), see Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/16-13.htm" title="When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?">Matthew 16:13-28</a>; <a href="/mark/8-27.htm" title="And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, Whom do men say that I am?">Mark 8:27</a>; <a href="/mark/9-1.htm" title="And he said to them, Truly I say to you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.">Mark 9:1</a>.<p><span class= "bld">As he was alone praying.</span>--There is, as before (see <span class= "ital">Introduction,</span> and Notes on <a href="/luke/3-21.htm" title="Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,">Luke 3:21</a>; <a href="/luke/5-16.htm" title="And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.">Luke 5:16</a>; <a href="/luke/6-12.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.">Luke 6:12</a>), something characteristic in the stress which St. Luke lays on the fact.

Since the miracle of feeding the five thousand at Bethsaida Julias, Jesus had preached at Capernaum the famous sermon on the "Bread of life" (reported in <a href="/john/6.htm">John 6</a>.); he had wandered to the north-east as far as the maritime cities of Tyro and Sidon; had returned again to the Decapolis region for a brief sojourn; and then once more had turned his footsteps north; and it was in the extreme confines of the Holy Land, in the neighbourhood of Caesarea Philippi, and close to the great fountain, the source of the sacred Jordan, at the foot of the southern ridge of Hermon, where he put the momentous question here chronicled, to his listening disciples. Much had happened since the five thousand were fed. The defection which the Master had foreseen when he commenced his parable-teaching with the sad story of the "sower," had begun. After the great Capernaum sermon (<a href="/john/6.htm">John 6</a>.), many had fallen away from him; the enthusiasm for his words was rapidly waning; the end was already in sight. "Well," he asks his own, "what are men saying about me?
