In biblical context, the "master of the house" represents God or Christ, who has authority over the kingdom of heaven. The act of shutting the door symbolizes the end of the period of grace and the finality of judgment. This imagery is reminiscent of the parable of the ten virgins (<a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>), where the door is shut to those who were unprepared. It emphasizes the urgency of being ready and the consequences of spiritual negligence.<p><b>you will stand outside knocking and saying, &#8216;Lord, open the door for us.&#8217;</b><br>The people standing outside represent those who have not entered into a true relationship with Christ. The act of knocking and pleading indicates a realization of missed opportunity and a desire for entrance after it is too late. This reflects the cultural practice of seeking hospitality, where knocking was a request for entry. The plea "Lord, open the door for us" shows a recognition of Christ's authority but also highlights a superficial relationship, as they are not recognized by the master. This connects to <a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>, where Jesus speaks of those who call Him "Lord" but do not do the will of the Father.<p><b>But he will reply, &#8216;I do not know where you are from.&#8217;</b><br>The master's response underscores the importance of a genuine relationship with Christ. The phrase "I do not know where you are from" indicates a lack of personal connection or recognition. In biblical terms, to be known by God is to be in a covenant relationship with Him. This echoes the warning in <a href="/matthew/7-23.htm">Matthew 7:23</a>, where Jesus says, "I never knew you; depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness." It serves as a sobering reminder that mere association with religious activities or acknowledgment of Christ is insufficient without true faith and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master_of_the_house.htm">The Master of the House</a></b><br>Represents God or Jesus, who has the authority to open or shut the door to His kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house.htm">The House</a></b><br>Symbolizes the kingdom of God or eternal life, a place of safety and belonging.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_door.htm">The Door</a></b><br>Represents the opportunity for salvation and entry into the kingdom of God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_outside_knocking.htm">Those Outside Knocking</a></b><br>Symbolize individuals who have not entered into a relationship with God before it is too late.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_reply_of_the_master.htm">The Reply of the Master</a></b><br>Indicates a final judgment or decision, emphasizing the importance of knowing God personally.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/urgency_of_salvation.htm">Urgency of Salvation</a></b><br>The opportunity to enter the kingdom of God is limited.

At that instant the door to His kingdom closes irrevocably. No amount of belated pleading will substitute for present-tense repentance and faith. Knowing about Jesus is not the same as being known by Him. The passage urges readiness now, while the door of grace stands open, for when the Master rises and shuts it, eternity&#8217;s verdict is sealed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">When once the master of the house . . .</span>--The passage contains elements that are common at once to <a href="/context/matthew/7-22.htm" title="Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name? and in your name have cast out devils? and in your name done many wonderful works?">Matthew 7:22-23</a>; <a href="/context/matthew/25-10.htm" title="And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.">Matthew 25:10-12</a>, where see Notes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and Co knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are</span>. The great Teacher here slightly changes the imagery. The narrow door no longer is the centre of the picture; one, called the "master of the house," becomes the principal figure. The door now shut may still be, most probably is, the narrow fort or hill-city entrance, and the one called the master is the governor of the Place of Arms, into which the door or gate led. It is now too late even for the earnest striver to enter in. Sunset probably - the shades of night, had the Divine Painter furnished the imagery - would have been the signal for the final closing of the door of the fortress. Death is the period when the door of salvation is shut to the children of men. It has been asked - To what time does the Master refer in the words" when once"? It cannot be the epoch of the ruin of Jerusalem and the breaking up of the Jewish nationality, for then there was nothing in the attitude of the doomed people to answer to the standing without, to the knocking at the door, and to the imploring cries, "Lord, Lord, open unto us," portrayed here. It cannot be the second coming of the Lord; surely then his people will not call on him in vain. It refers, without doubt, to the day of judgment, when the dread award will be pronounced upon the unbelieving, the selfish, and the evil-liver. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/13-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#966;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(aph&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_575.htm">Strong's 575: </a> </span><span class="str2">From, away from.
