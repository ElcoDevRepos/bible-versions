In Jewish culture, such events were communal, involving relatives and neighbors. The "they" refers to those present, emphasizing the collective nature of decision-making in Jewish families at the time.<p><b>&#8220;There is no one among your relatives</b><br>Naming a child after a relative was a common Jewish tradition, reflecting the importance of family lineage and heritage. This practice was a way to honor ancestors and maintain family identity.

The name means "Yahweh is gracious," indicating a divine purpose and blessing. This choice of name, given by divine instruction through the angel Gabriel (<a href="/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13</a>), signifies a break from tradition, highlighting the unique role John would play in God's plan.
