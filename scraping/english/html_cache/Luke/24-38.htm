The context is post-resurrection, where the disciples are grappling with the reality of Jesus' resurrection. The term "troubled" reflects a deep emotional disturbance, which is understandable given the recent traumatic events of Jesus' crucifixion. This question echoes Jesus' earlier teachings about peace and trust in God (<a href="/john/14.htm">John 14:1</a>), reminding the disciples of His promises and the fulfillment of prophecy.<p><b>Jesus asked,</b><br>This highlights Jesus' personal engagement with His disciples. Despite His glorified state, He remains relational and concerned with their well-being. The use of questions by Jesus is a common teaching method in the Gospels, encouraging reflection and deeper understanding. It also demonstrates His patience and willingness to guide them through their confusion and fear.<p><b>and why do doubts arise in your hearts?</b><br>Here, Jesus addresses the internal struggle of belief versus doubt. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of thought and emotion. The disciples' doubts are significant because they had witnessed Jesus' miracles and teachings firsthand. This moment is a call to faith, urging them to trust in the resurrection as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies (Isaiah 53, <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>).

The risen Christ now calls them back to that peace.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a> reminds that perfect peace is anchored in a steadfast mind, not shifting circumstances.<p>&#8226; The gentle question exposes their turmoil without condemnation, inviting them to receive the same peace He still offers: &#8220;Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Casting all anxiety on Him (<a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>) remains the antidote to inner agitation, then and now.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and why do doubts arise in your hearts?</b><p>The second half of the sentence probes their inner reasoning.<p>&#8226; Doubt had been an ongoing struggle among the disciples&#8212;some worshiped the risen Lord &#8220;but some doubted&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-17.htm">Matthew 28:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus addresses not mere intellectual curiosity but heart-level skepticism that resists believing what God has already spoken (<a href="/luke/24-25.htm">Luke 24:25</a>; cf. <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>).<p>&#8226; He immediately offers concrete evidence&#8212;His hands, His feet, and a shared meal (<a href="/luke/24-39.htm">Luke 24:39-43</a>)&#8212;demonstrating that faith is never blind; it rests on real, historical acts of God.<p>&#8226; Thomas&#8217;s later encounter (<a href="/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27-29</a>) echoes this pattern: questions answered, doubts displaced by worship.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6</a> warns that unresolved wavering makes a person &#8220;like a wave of the sea,&#8221; yet <a href="/hebrews/11-1.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a> defines faith as confident assurance built on God&#8217;s character and deeds.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>In <a href="/luke/24-38.htm">Luke 24:38</a>, the risen Jesus compassionately uncovers fear and doubt, then replaces them with peace and assurance grounded in His bodily resurrection.

He, too, had known what it was to be "troubled in spirit" (<a href="/john/11-33.htm" title="When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.">John 11:33</a>; <a href="/john/12-27.htm" title="Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?

Now they had a trouble of a different kind, and still, as before with the two who were on their way to Emmaus, He seeks to calm and sustain them. He knows even the unuttered thoughts and questionings that are rising in their hearts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled t and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</span> He had just given them. his peace. He proceeds further to allay their fears. Before showing them his pierced hands and feet and side, before eating in their presence, he addresses these comforting words to them: "See," he seems to say, "I give you my peace: why are ye troubled? why do you allow perplexing, harassing thoughts to arise in your hearts? The past is forgiven and forgotten." "I come not," as Stier beautifully sugests, "as a wrathful Judge to reckon with you for your unbelief and unfaithfulness. I bring to you (and all the world) from my sepulchre something very different from up-braidings." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Why</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Ti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
