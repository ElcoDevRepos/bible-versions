Despite their unique experiences with angelic announcements and miraculous events surrounding Jesus' birth, they still struggled to grasp the full scope of His divine mission. This reflects a common theme in the Gospels where even those closest to Jesus often misunderstand His purpose and teachings. It underscores the mystery of the Incarnation and the gradual revelation of Jesus' identity and mission.<p><b>the statement</b><br>The "statement" refers to Jesus' earlier declaration in the temple, where He expressed His need to be in His Father's house. This statement is significant as it reveals Jesus' awareness of His divine sonship and mission at a young age. It also foreshadows His later teachings about His relationship with the Father, which would become a central theme in His ministry. The use of "statement" suggests a profound truth that requires spiritual insight to fully comprehend.<p><b>He was making to them</b><br>Jesus' communication was directed specifically to Mary and Joseph, indicating a personal and intimate revelation. This interaction in the temple is one of the few glimpses into Jesus' childhood and His growing understanding of His identity and mission. It also highlights the unique role of Mary and Joseph as His earthly parents, tasked with raising the Son of God. The phrase suggests that Jesus was beginning to articulate His divine purpose, which would later be fully revealed through His public ministry, death, and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>At this point in the Gospel of Luke, Jesus is a young boy, approximately twelve years old, who has just been found in the temple by His parents after being missing for three days.

Twelve years, however, of the life of childhood after the outward pattern of that of other children, may have dulled the impressions that had then been made; and even if they, in part, understood the words as referring to the marvel of His birth, they were still in the dark as to what He meant by being "about His Father's business." As it was, though it was the first flash of a greatness more than human, it was but momentary. It faded into "the light of common day," and life went on in its quiet and simple fashion as before. It is clear, at any rate, that the writer of the Gospel was not conscious of any inconsistency between the later and the earlier narratives of the childhood of the Christ.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/2-50.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(autoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
