Fear of God is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with reverence and awe (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). However, in this context, the fear is more about dread and apprehension, which can lead to inaction. The servant's fear contrasts with the biblical encouragement to trust in God's goodness and faithfulness (<a href="/psalms/56-3.htm">Psalm 56:3-4</a>).<p><b>because you are a harsh man</b><br>The servant describes the master as harsh, indicating a perception of strictness and severity. This perception may reflect a misunderstanding of the master's true character, as the parable ultimately reveals the master's expectation of faithfulness and diligence. The term "harsh" can be compared to descriptions of God as a just judge (<a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11</a>), emphasizing accountability and righteousness.<p><b>You withdraw what you did not deposit</b><br>This phrase suggests the master's authority and expectation of productivity. It highlights the principle of stewardship, where individuals are entrusted with resources and are expected to manage them wisely. The idea of withdrawing what was not deposited can be seen as a metaphor for God's sovereign right to expect returns on what He has entrusted to His people (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>).<p><b>and reap what you did not sow.</b><br>Reaping what one did not sow underscores the expectation of growth and fruitfulness from the resources given. This concept is echoed in other biblical passages, such as the parable of the sower (<a href="/matthew/13-3.htm">Matthew 13:3-9</a>), where the emphasis is on the yield from the seeds sown. It also reflects the principle of divine justice, where God rewards or judges based on the fruitfulness of one's life (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>). The imagery of sowing and reaping is often used to illustrate spiritual truths about responsibility and the consequences of one's actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>In the parable of the ten minas, this servant represents those who are entrusted with resources or responsibilities by God but fail to use them wisely due to fear or misunderstanding of God's character.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>The master in the parable symbolizes God or Christ, who entrusts His servants with gifts and expects them to be used for His kingdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_parable_of_the_ten_minas.htm">The Parable of the Ten Minas</a></b><br>This parable, told by Jesus, is set in the context of His journey to Jerusalem and serves as a teaching on stewardship and accountability.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Jesus was heading, symbolizing the culmination of His earthly ministry and the place of His crucifixion and resurrection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_god.htm">The Kingdom of God</a></b><br>The overarching theme of the parable, emphasizing the responsibility of believers to advance God's kingdom with the resources given to them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_character.htm">Understanding God's Character</a></b><br>Misunderstanding God's nature can lead to fear and inaction.

Fear that paralyzes rather than motivates stands in sharp contrast to &#8220;perfect love&#8221; that &#8220;casts out fear&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>) and the Spirit of power, love, and self-control given to believers (<a href="/2_timothy/1-7.htm">2 Timothy 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture never excuses disobedience on the ground of fear; instead it calls us to reverent fear that leads to obedience (<a href="/luke/12-5.htm">Luke 12:5</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-20.htm">Exodus 20:20</a>), not the cringing dread that buries God-given opportunities (<a href="/matthew/25-25.htm">Matthew 25:25</a>).<p>&#8226; By confessing fear, the servant unwittingly condemns himself, because genuine fear of the Master would have led him to at least &#8220;put My money on deposit&#8221; (v. 23).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because you are a harsh man</b><p>&#8226; The accusation is a slander against the Master. Throughout Scripture God reveals Himself as &#8220;compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>), yet also perfectly just (<a href="/romans/11-22.htm">Romans 11:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The servant&#8217;s distorted view mirrors the hardened heart of Israel&#8217;s leadership who saw Jesus as a threat rather than a gracious King (<a href="/luke/20-14.htm">Luke 20:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; By labeling the Master &#8220;harsh,&#8221; the servant shifts blame for his own laziness, echoing Adam&#8217;s deflection in <a href="/genesis/3-12.htm">Genesis 3:12</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You withdraw what you did not deposit</b><p>&#8226; The charge suggests that the Master profits unjustly, yet <a href="/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10-12</a> affirms that everything already belongs to God; He can rightly claim any return.<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/41-11.htm">Job 41:11</a> and <a href="/romans/11-35.htm">Romans 11:35</a> remind us that no one can give to God first or place Him in debt. Whatever return He &#8220;withdraws&#8221; is His rightful due.<p>&#8226; The servant ignores the grace shown in being entrusted with the mina in the first place (<a href="/luke/19-13.htm">Luke 19:13</a>); stewardship is privilege, not exploitation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and reap what you did not sow</b><p>&#8226; God often allows His servants to share in work others began (<a href="/john/4-37.htm">John 4:37-38</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6-9</a>). The harvest always belongs to Him.<p>&#8226; The statement is true in one sense: the Master does reap where He hasn&#8217;t personally sown, because He delegates sowing to His people. What the servant calls &#8220;harsh&#8221; is actually a picture of divine partnership.<p>&#8226; <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a> warns, &#8220;God is not mocked. Whatever a man sows, he will reap.&#8221; The servant sowed nothing and therefore forfeited reward, yet still faces judgment for unbelief and misrepresentation of the Master&#8217;s character (<a href="/luke/19-22.htm">Luke 19:22-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/19-21.htm">Luke 19:21</a> exposes the unfaithful servant&#8217;s heart. Paralyzed by a self-made dread and a warped view of the Master, he refuses the privilege of stewardship and then blames the Master for his own inactivity. The verse warns that a wrong perception of God&#8212;seeing Him as harsh rather than graciously just&#8212;leads to fruitlessness and ultimate loss, while affirming that the Lord has every right to expect a return on the resources, opportunities, and gospel truth He entrusts to His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">I feared thee, because thou art an austere man.</span>--The Greek adjective (from which the English is derived) is not used elsewhere in the New Testament.
