In the context of <a href="/luke/19.htm">Luke 19</a>, Jesus is speaking to Zacchaeus, a tax collector who has just expressed his intention to make restitution for his wrongdoings. This personal engagement reflects Jesus' mission to seek and save the lost, as seen throughout the Gospels.<p><b>Today salvation has come to this house</b><br>The use of "today" emphasizes the immediacy and present reality of salvation. It signifies a pivotal moment of transformation for Zacchaeus and his household. The concept of "house" in Jewish culture often extends beyond the physical dwelling to include the family and household members, indicating that Zacchaeus' decision impacts all under his influence. This echoes the theme of household salvation seen in <a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31</a>, where belief in Jesus leads to salvation for the entire household.<p><b>because this man too is a son of Abraham</b><br>By calling Zacchaeus a "son of Abraham," Jesus affirms his inclusion in the covenant community of Israel, despite his status as a tax collector, often viewed as a traitor and sinner. This statement underscores the theme of spiritual lineage over mere ethnic descent, aligning with Paul's teaching in <a href="/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a> that those who have faith are the true children of Abraham. It also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through him, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who brings salvation to humanity.

In one sense salvation had come in the personal presence of the Saviour, but we must remember all that the word implied--deliverance, not from the penalty only, but from the habit and the power of sin. This had come, and the words and acts of Zacchaeus showed the fruits. And it comes to him because "he also is a child of Abraham."
