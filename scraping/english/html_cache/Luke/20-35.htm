In biblical context, worthiness is often associated with faith and righteousness (<a href="/matthew/22-14.htm">Matthew 22:14</a>, <a href="/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>). The concept of being "considered worthy" aligns with the parable of the wedding banquet (<a href="/matthew/22.htm">Matthew 22:1-14</a>), where only those who respond appropriately to God's invitation are allowed to enter.<p><b>to share in the age to come</b><br>The "age to come" refers to the eschatological future, a time of fulfillment of God's promises. This is a common theme in Jewish eschatology, where the present age is contrasted with the future age of God's kingdom (<a href="/hebrews/6-5.htm">Hebrews 6:5</a>). The age to come is characterized by the reign of God, peace, and righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17-25</a>).<p><b>and in the resurrection from the dead</b><br>The resurrection is a core Christian doctrine, affirming life after death and the ultimate victory over sin and death (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>). This belief is rooted in Jewish thought, as seen in <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, and is fulfilled in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who is the "firstfruits" of those who have fallen asleep (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>).<p><b>will neither marry nor be given in marriage</b><br>This phrase indicates a change in social structures in the age to come. Marriage, a fundamental institution in earthly life, will not be necessary in the resurrection. This reflects a transformation of relationships, where earthly ties are transcended by a direct relationship with God (<a href="/matthew/22-30.htm">Matthew 22:30</a>).
