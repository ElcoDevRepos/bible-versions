The disciples, despite their proximity to Christ, were not immune to the desire for status and recognition. This incident occurs during the Last Supper, a time of significant spiritual importance, underscoring the contrast between Jesus' impending sacrifice and the disciples' worldly concerns. The setting in Jerusalem, a city with a rich history of religious significance, adds to the gravity of the moment. This dispute is reminiscent of earlier arguments among the disciples (<a href="/mark/9-33.htm">Mark 9:33-34</a>), showing a recurring theme of misunderstanding Jesus' teachings on servanthood.<p><b>as to which of them should be considered the greatest</b><br>This phrase reflects the cultural context of honor and status prevalent in the first-century Jewish society. The disciples' concern with greatness is contrary to Jesus' teachings on humility and service (<a href="/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26-28</a>). Jesus often used children as examples of the humility required to enter the Kingdom of Heaven (<a href="/matthew/18.htm">Matthew 18:1-4</a>). The disciples' argument reveals their expectation of a political Messiah who would establish an earthly kingdom, where positions of power would be distributed. This misunderstanding is corrected by Jesus, who emphasizes that true greatness in His kingdom is measured by one's willingness to serve others, foreshadowing His own ultimate act of service on the cross.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The twelve chosen followers of Jesus who were present at the Last Supper.

The noun which he uses for "strife" does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament, but the corresponding adjective meets us in the "contentious" of <a href="/1_corinthians/11-16.htm" title="But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.">1Corinthians 11:16</a>. The dispute was apparently the sequel of many previous debates of the same kind, as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="/luke/9-46.htm" title="Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.">Luke 9:46</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-1.htm" title="At the same time came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?">Matthew 18:1</a>; <a href="/mark/9-34.htm" title="But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.">Mark 9:34</a>; and the prayer of the two sons of Zebedee (<a href="/matthew/20-23.htm" title="And he said to them, You shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not my to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.">Matthew 20:23</a>; <a href="/mark/10-37.htm" title="They said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on your right hand, and the other on your left hand, in your glory.">Mark 10:37</a>). What had just passed probably led to its revival. Who was greatest? Was it Peter, to whom had been promised the keys of the kingdom, or John, who reclined on the Master's bosom, or Andrew, who had been first-called? Even the disciples who were in the second group of the Twelve, might have cherished the hope that those who had been thus rebuked for their ambition or their want of faith had left a place vacant to which they might now hopefully aspire.<span class= "bld"> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-30.</span> - <span class="accented">The jealousy, among the disciples.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.</span> The Lord's words in these verses are peculiar to St. Luke. The strife among the disciples which suggested the Lord's corrective sayings was evidently no mere dispute as to precedence in their places at the supper, but some question as to their respective positions in the coming kingdom of which their Master had said so much in the course of his later instructions. It is closely connected with the "feet-washing" related at length by St. John (<a href="/john/13-4.htm">John 13:4-17</a>). This has been well described as a parable in action, exhibited to illustrate forcibly the novel and sublime truth which he was teaching them, the world-teachers of the future, that in self sacrifice consisted the secret of true greatness. In the kingdom of heaven this would be found to be conspicuously the case. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/22-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">A dispute</span><br /><span class="grk">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#954;&#943;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(philoneikia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5379.htm">Strong's 5379: </a> </span><span class="str2">Love of dispute, contention.
