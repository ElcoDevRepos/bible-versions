In the cultural context of first-century Judea, news was often spread orally, and gatherings in communal spaces like the marketplace or synagogue would facilitate such dissemination. The shepherds, considered lowly and humble, were unlikely messengers, which adds to the amazement of the listeners. This reflects the biblical theme of God using the humble to convey His message, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>.<p><b>were amazed</b><br>The amazement of the people can be understood as a mix of wonder and disbelief. In the biblical narrative, amazement often accompanies divine revelation or miraculous events, such as the reaction of the people to Jesus' teachings and miracles (<a href="/mark/1-22.htm">Mark 1:22</a>, <a href="/luke/4-32.htm">Luke 4:32</a>). This amazement signifies the breaking in of the divine into the ordinary, challenging the listeners' expectations and understanding of God's work.<p><b>at what the shepherds said to them</b><br>The shepherds relayed the angelic announcement of Jesus' birth, which was a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>). The shepherds' testimony is significant because it aligns with the biblical theme of witness, where God often uses unexpected individuals to bear witness to His acts (e.g., the Samaritan woman in <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4</a>). The shepherds' role also prefigures the spread of the Gospel, where ordinary believers are called to share the good news of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherds.htm">Shepherds</a></b><br>These humble individuals were the first to receive the angelic announcement of Jesus' birth.

The report traveled beyond the stable, reaching neighbors, extended family, and anyone gathered that night (<a href="/luke/2-17.htm">Luke 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often notes how God&#8217;s news spreads quickly: consider how fear and wonder &#8220;came upon all who lived around them&#8221; at John&#8217;s birth (<a href="/luke/1-65.htm">Luke 1:65</a>), or how news of Jesus later &#8220;spread through all Judea&#8221; after He raised the widow&#8217;s son (<a href="/luke/7-17.htm">Luke 7:17</a>).<p>&#8226; God ensures witnesses so His acts are not hidden (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>); here, the shepherds become the first evangelists of the newborn Messiah.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were amazed</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Amazed&#8221; captures genuine astonishment&#8212;not mild interest&#8212;but a deep, soul-stirring wonder (<a href="/luke/4-36.htm">Luke 4:36</a>, <a href="/luke/5-26.htm">Luke 5:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Such amazement is the appropriate human response when God breaks into ordinary life, just as the disciples later marvel when Jesus stills the storm (<a href="/luke/8-25.htm">Luke 8:25</a>).<p>&#8226; The amazement affirms that the message resonated as true and carried divine authority (<a href="/mark/1-22.htm">Mark 1:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at what the shepherds said to them</b><p>&#8226; Shepherds, socially humble yet divinely chosen, convey exactly what the angels announced (<a href="/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Their testimony highlights God&#8217;s pattern of using unlikely messengers&#8212;similar to Naaman&#8217;s servant girl (<a href="/2_kings/5-2.htm">2 Kings 5:2-3</a>) and the Samaritan woman who told her town, &#8220;Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did&#8221;

Faithful gospel witness is simple: relay the message received, trust the Spirit to stir hearts (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/2-18.htm">Luke 2:18</a> records the immediate, widespread wonder produced when ordinary shepherds shared extraordinary news: God&#8217;s promised Messiah had come. Everyone who heard their report sensed the divine in-breaking and marveled.
