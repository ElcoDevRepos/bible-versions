This phrase indicates a direct response from the master, highlighting the personal accountability each servant has before him. The context of a master-servant relationship was common in the ancient Near East, reflecting the authority and responsibility dynamics familiar to Jesus' audience.<p><b>You wicked servant</b><br>The term "wicked" denotes moral failure and disobedience. In biblical terms, wickedness often involves a rejection of God's ways and commands. This servant's actions are contrasted with the faithful servants who invested their minas wisely. The use of "wicked" underscores the seriousness of failing to fulfill one's responsibilities in God's kingdom.<p><b>I will judge you by your own words</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the principle of self-condemnation. The servant's own admission and understanding of the master's character are used against him. This reflects a broader biblical theme where individuals are judged according to their knowledge and actions (<a href="/matthew/12-37.htm">Matthew 12:37</a>). It highlights the importance of integrity and accountability.<p><b>So you knew that I am a harsh man</b><br>The servant's perception of the master as "harsh" suggests a misunderstanding or mischaracterization of the master's true nature. In the parable, this reflects how some perceive God as unjust or demanding, which can lead to fear and inaction. The master&#8217;s response challenges this perception, urging a correct understanding of God's character.<p><b>withdrawing what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow?</b><br>This phrase uses agricultural imagery, common in Jesus' teachings, to illustrate the master's expectations of productivity and stewardship. The servant's claim of the master reaping where he did not sow is ironic, as it highlights the servant's failure to act even with this understanding. Biblically, God expects His followers to be fruitful and multiply their gifts (<a href="/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8</a>), and this servant's inaction is a failure to meet that expectation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>Represents God or Jesus in the parable, who entrusts His servants with resources and expects them to be fruitful.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Symbolizes believers or followers of Christ, who are given responsibilities and are expected to act faithfully.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_parable_of_the_minas.htm">The Parable of the Minas</a></b><br>A account told by Jesus to illustrate the Kingdom of God and the accountability of His followers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Jesus was heading, emphasizing the context of His impending crucifixion and the urgency of His message.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_other_servants.htm">The Other Servants</a></b><br>Represent different responses to the master's trust, highlighting the varied faithfulness among believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability_to_god.htm">Accountability to God</a></b><br>We are accountable to God for how we use the resources and opportunities He provides.

A nobleman entrusts resources to servants, symbolizing the Lord entrusting gifts, opportunities, and gospel truth to His people (cf. <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-15</a>).<p>- The &#8220;master&#8221; pictures Christ returning to settle accounts (<a href="/revelation/22-12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>). His reply shows that the coming evaluation is personal and direct&#8212;no servant is ignored, and no excuse is overlooked (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You wicked servant</b><p>- &#8220;Wicked&#8221; here means morally culpable, not merely inept. Neglect of duty is sin, because it refuses the rightful claims of the Master (<a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>).<p>- The idle servant contrasts sharply with faithful servants earlier in the parable who gained more minas (<a href="/luke/19-16.htm">Luke 19:16-19</a>). The issue is not the amount earned, but the heart that honors or dishonors the Master (<a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will judge you by your own words</b><p>- God&#8217;s judgment is perfectly just; He uses the servant&#8217;s very confession as evidence (<a href="/psalms/18-25.htm">Psalm 18:25-26</a>).<p>- Jesus taught that &#8220;by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-37.htm">Matthew 12:37</a>). Our statements reveal our true beliefs, and those beliefs shape our actions&#8212;or our inaction.<p>- The servant&#8217;s excuses become the standard by which he is measured, leaving him without defense (<a href="/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So you knew that I am a harsh man</b><p>- The servant claims the master is &#8220;harsh,&#8221; yet this depiction is contradicted by the master&#8217;s earlier generosity&#8212;he freely distributed minas (<a href="/luke/19-13.htm">Luke 19:13</a>).<p>- Many today likewise mischaracterize God to justify indifference. Yet Scripture affirms His kindness alongside His severity (<a href="/romans/11-22.htm">Romans 11:22</a>).<p>- The master does not concede the accusation; he exposes its hypocrisy. If the servant truly believed the master was exacting, he would have acted accordingly (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Withdrawing what I did not deposit</b><p>- The phrase underscores the master&#8217;s rightful expectation of increase. God expects His gifts to bear fruit (<a href="/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8</a>).<p>- In business terms, even bankers could have produced interest (<a href="/luke/19-23.htm">Luke 19:23</a>). Spiritually, He looks for gospel multiplication&#8212;saved souls, edified believers, acts of mercy (<a href="/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>).<p>- The servant&#8217;s unused mina reflects buried potential and wasted stewardship (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-1.htm">2 Corinthians 6:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And reaping what I did not sow?</b><p>- The master presses the servant&#8217;s logic: If the servant believed the master gathered where he had not sown, common sense would prompt diligent labor to meet that expectation (<a href="/proverbs/10-4.htm">Proverbs 10:4-5</a>).<p>- God &#8220;reaps&#8221; through His servants; He supplies seed yet expects harvest (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>). Our responsibility is faithful labor, while He gives the increase (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6-9</a>).<p>- The question ends with a sting of irony: the servant&#8217;s professed fear becomes the very ground of his condemnation (<a href="/luke/19-24.htm">Luke 19:24-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jesus&#8217; words spotlight a servant who excuses inactivity by slandering his master. The Lord turns the servant&#8217;s own assertions into the basis for judgment, revealing that passivity toward God&#8217;s entrusted resources is wickedness, not prudence. Faithful disciples honor Christ&#8217;s generosity, labor with what He provides, and anticipate His return with joyful accountability, knowing &#8220;each will receive his praise from God&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee.</span>--See Note on <a href="/matthew/25-26.htm" title="His lord answered and said to him, You wicked and slothful servant, you knew that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strewed:">Matthew 25:26</a>.
