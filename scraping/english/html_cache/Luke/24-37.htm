They had just experienced the traumatic events of Jesus' crucifixion and were still processing reports of His resurrection. In Jewish culture, the concept of resurrection was not fully understood, and the sudden appearance of Jesus in their midst would have been shocking. This reaction is consistent with other biblical accounts where divine or supernatural encounters initially provoke fear, such as the shepherds' reaction to the angels in <a href="/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9</a>.<p><b>thinking they had seen a spirit</b><br>The disciples' assumption that they had seen a spirit reflects common first-century Jewish beliefs about the afterlife and spirits. At that time, there was a prevalent belief in ghosts or spirits of the dead, which is evident in other biblical passages like <a href="/matthew/14-26.htm">Matthew 14:26</a>, where the disciples thought Jesus walking on water was a ghost. This misunderstanding highlights their struggle to comprehend the physical resurrection of Jesus, a cornerstone of Christian faith. The resurrection was not merely spiritual but physical, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>, which speak of the Messiah's victory over death.

When Isaiah beheld the Lord, he cried, &#8220;Woe to me!&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>). When Ezekiel saw the glory, he fell facedown (<a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>).<p>&#8211; Fear also exposed their lingering unbelief. Earlier, Jesus had repeatedly foretold His resurrection (<a href="/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>; 18:33). Their terror shows how slowly truth can migrate from mind to heart.<p>&#8211; Yet Christ did not scold them first; He offered peace (<a href="/luke/24-36.htm">Luke 24:36</a>) and proof (<a href="/luke/24-39.htm">Luke 24:39-40</a>). His gentle response models how the Lord meets frail faith with reassurance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>thinking they had seen a spirit</b><p>&#8211; First-century Jews acknowledged a spiritual realm of angels and spirits (<a href="/acts/23-8.htm">Acts 23:8</a>). Lacking a category for bodily resurrection in everyday experience, they defaulted to &#8220;ghost.&#8221;<p>&#8211; Jesus answered their misconception by displaying tangible, physical evidence:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Touch Me and see; a spirit does not have flesh and bones&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>).<p>&#8226; He ate broiled fish in their presence (<a href="/luke/24-41.htm">Luke 24:41-43</a>).<p>&#8211; By inviting touch and sharing a meal, the Lord affirmed His literal, bodily resurrection, fulfilling <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>.<p>&#8211; Their initial misinterpretation actually strengthens our confidence: eyewitnesses did not invent a resurrection they expected; they testified to what overturned their assumptions (<a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/24-37.htm">Luke 24:37</a> captures the raw honesty of the disciples&#8217; first reaction to the risen Christ&#8212;startled surprise, fearful awe, and a mistaken conclusion. Their human frailty magnifies the certainty of Jesus&#8217; bodily resurrection, for the Lord patiently replaced panic with peace and conjecture with concrete evidence. The verse therefore underscores both the reliability of the eyewitness accounts and the gracious condescension of the Savior who turns fear into unshakable faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">Supposed that they had seen a spirit.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">supposed that they were looking on</span> . . .

They spoke one to another of the Master; they discussed the empty sepulchre, the angelic vision, the recital by Peter of his interview with the Risen, and were listening to the details of the quiet Emmaus meeting, all hoping for something more; but this sudden, mysterious appearance of their crucified Master in their midst was not, after all, what they had looked for. <span class="accented">It terrified them. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And supposed that they had seen a spirit</span>. How else could they explain his presence in their midst, when the doors were shut? The evangelists make no attempt to explain his sudden appearance. <span class="accented">He was simply there</span> as they spoke of him. It is clear that his presence could be accounted for in no ordinary, natural way. His disciples felt that; hence their supposition that they were looking on a spirit. We can, with our present limited knowledge, form no adequate conception of this resurrection-body of the Lord. It was a reality, no phantasm or appearance; of that the scene about to be described gives us ample evidence. Still, it is clear that his resurrection-body was not bound by the present conditions of material existence of which we are conscious.
