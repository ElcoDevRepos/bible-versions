The Greek word used for "strictly warned" implies a stern command, emphasizing the importance of the disciples' obedience. This warning follows Peter's confession of Jesus as the Messiah, a pivotal moment in the Gospel narrative. Jesus often used strong language to ensure His disciples understood the gravity of His teachings and the timing of His mission. This reflects the Messianic secret theme in the Gospels, where Jesus frequently instructed His followers to keep His identity concealed until the appropriate time.<p><b>not to tell this</b><br>The instruction "not to tell this" refers to the revelation of Jesus as the Messiah. At this point in His ministry, Jesus was cautious about public declarations of His identity. The Jewish expectation of the Messiah was largely political and militaristic, anticipating a leader who would overthrow Roman rule. Jesus' mission, however, was spiritual and redemptive, focusing on the salvation of humanity through His death and resurrection. Premature disclosure could have led to misunderstandings and hindered His mission. This aligns with other instances where Jesus instructed people to remain silent about His miracles or identity, such as in <a href="/mark/1-44.htm">Mark 1:44</a> and <a href="/mark/8-30.htm">Mark 8:30</a>.<p><b>to anyone</b><br>The phrase "to anyone" underscores the universality of the command. Jesus wanted to prevent any misinterpretation or premature action that could arise from a widespread proclamation of His Messiahship. This instruction was not limited to a specific group but was meant to be a general directive to ensure that His mission unfolded according to divine timing. The broader context of <a href="/luke/9.htm">Luke 9</a> includes Jesus preparing His disciples for His impending suffering and death, which was contrary to popular Messianic expectations. By controlling the spread of information, Jesus ensured that His path to the cross remained unobstructed, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which spoke of the suffering servant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Messiah who is instructing His disciples with a specific command.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' warning, they are followers of Christ who are being prepared for their future mission.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_the_warning.htm">The Event of the Warning</a></b><br>This occurs after Peter's confession of Jesus as the Christ, marking a pivotal moment in the disciples' understanding of Jesus' identity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_divine_timing.htm">The Importance of Divine Timing</a></b><br>Jesus' command to keep His identity secret highlights the importance of God's timing in revealing His plans.

Similar intensity appears when He &#8220;sternly warned&#8221; healed lepers (<a href="/mark/1-43.htm">Mark 1:43</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus is not hesitant or uncertain; His warning underscores the importance of obedience. &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The gravity here underlines that premature proclamation could hinder the Father&#8217;s redemptive plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>them</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Them&#8221; refers to the Twelve, just identified by name earlier (<a href="/luke/9-1.htm">Luke 9:1</a>). They had received power and authority, yet still needed guidance.<p>&#8226; Even the most privileged disciples must submit to Christ&#8217;s timing (<a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>). This warning calibrates their zeal with divine wisdom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>not to tell</b><p>&#8226; Silence until the right moment protects both mission and hearers. When Jesus heals the deaf man, He again commands secrecy (<a href="/mark/7-36.htm">Mark 7:36</a>).<p>&#8226; Announcing His Messiahship too soon could inflame political expectations, prompting crowds to seize Him as a worldly king (<a href="/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The command also shields the unfolding path to the cross, &#8220;for His hour had not yet come&#8221; (<a href="/john/7-30.htm">John 7:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>this</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;This&#8221; refers to the revelation that He is &#8220;the Christ of God&#8221; and, by extension, His forthcoming suffering and resurrection (<a href="/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The full gospel requires both identity and mission. Until the cross and empty tomb, the disciples hold a partial picture (<a href="/john/12-16.htm">John 12:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to anyone</b><p>&#8226; The prohibition is comprehensive&#8212;no audience, no exceptions&#8212;for now.<p>&#8226; After the resurrection the command flips: &#8220;Go into all the world and preach the gospel&#8221; (<a href="/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast highlights the shift from concealment to proclamation once the saving work is finished (<a href="/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32&#8211;36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jesus, fully aware of the Father&#8217;s perfect timetable, issues a firm directive to His disciples: keep silent about His Messiahship until the appointed hour. The warning safeguards the divine plan, prevents political misunderstanding, and readies the disciples for a later, Spirit-empowered witness. Obedience to Christ&#8217;s timing remains as vital today as it was beside Caesarea Philippi.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing</span>. It would have <span class="accented">been</span> no hard task for the disciples to have gone about with an expression of their earnest conviction that the great Prophet was indeed the long looked-for King Messiah, and thus to have raised the excitable crowds to any wild pitch of enthusiasm.
