This act of consent marks a pivotal moment in the Passion narrative. Judas's decision is often seen as a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of betrayal by a close friend. Theologically, Judas's consent is a demonstration of human free will and the mystery of iniquity, as he chooses to align with the religious leaders against Jesus. This moment also highlights the spiritual battle between good and evil, as Satan enters Judas (<a href="/luke/22-3.htm">Luke 22:3</a>), influencing his decision.<p><b>and began to look for an opportunity</b><br>Judas actively sought a chance to betray Jesus, indicating premeditation and intent. This search for an opportunity suggests a calculated approach, as Judas needed to find a time when Jesus was away from the protective presence of the crowds. The religious leaders were wary of arresting Jesus publicly due to His popularity and the potential for public unrest (<a href="/luke/22-2.htm">Luke 22:2</a>). Judas's actions reflect the cunning and deceit often associated with betrayal, reminiscent of the serpent's subtlety in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.<p><b>to betray Jesus to them</b><br>The betrayal of Jesus is central to the Passion narrative, leading to His arrest, trial, and crucifixion. Judas's betrayal is a stark contrast to the loyalty expected of a disciple. This act is a fulfillment of <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a>, where the prophet speaks of thirty pieces of silver, the price for which Judas agreed to betray Jesus (<a href="/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a>). Theologically, Judas's betrayal is part of God's sovereign plan for redemption, as Jesus's death and resurrection are necessary for the salvation of humanity.<p><b>in the absence of a crowd</b><br>Judas sought to betray Jesus when He was isolated, away from the protective presence of the masses who followed Him. This detail underscores the fear of the religious leaders regarding Jesus's influence and the potential for public disorder. The absence of a crowd ensured a quieter arrest, minimizing the risk of a riot. This setting aligns with the events in the Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus is ultimately arrested at night, away from the public eye (<a href="/luke/22-47.htm">Luke 22:47-53</a>). The secrecy of the betrayal highlights the darkness of the act, both literally and metaphorically, as it occurs under the cover of night.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of the twelve disciples of Jesus, who agreed to betray Him.
