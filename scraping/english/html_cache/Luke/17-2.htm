A millstone, a large stone used for grinding grain, was extremely heavy, symbolizing a burden too great to bear. In ancient times, the imagery of a millstone around the neck was a vivid picture of certain death by drowning. This metaphor underscores the seriousness of causing spiritual harm to others, particularly those who are vulnerable in their faith.<p><b>and to be thrown into the sea</b><br>The sea often represents chaos and judgment in biblical literature. Being thrown into the sea with a millstone would mean an inevitable and irreversible fate. This imagery is used to convey the gravity of the offense and the certainty of divine justice. The sea, in Jewish thought, was also a place of fear and uncertainty, further highlighting the dire consequences of leading others astray.<p><b>than to cause one of these little ones to stumble</b><br>"Little ones" refers to those who are young in faith or vulnerable, not necessarily children. The term "stumble" indicates causing someone to sin or lose faith. This warning is a call to protect and nurture the faith of others, especially those who are impressionable. The phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of caring for the weak and the innocent, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a> and <a href="/mark/9-42.htm">Mark 9:42</a>, where similar warnings are given. The protection of the "little ones" is a reflection of God's heart for the humble and the lowly, aligning with the teachings of Jesus on humility and service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, offering a stern warning about causing others to sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/little_ones.htm">Little Ones</a></b><br>Refers to believers, particularly those who are young in faith or vulnerable.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/millstone.htm">Millstone</a></b><br>A large, heavy stone used for grinding grain, symbolizing a severe consequence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sea.htm">Sea</a></b><br>Represents a place of judgment or destruction in this context.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/stumbling.htm">Stumbling</a></b><br>A metaphor for leading someone into sin or causing them to fall away from faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Jesus uses strong imagery to convey the gravity of leading others into sin.
