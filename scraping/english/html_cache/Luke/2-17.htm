This event fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, which foretold that the ruler of Israel would come from Bethlehem. The shepherds' visit signifies the humble circumstances of Jesus' birth, aligning with the theme of God choosing the lowly and humble to reveal His glory. The shepherds' role as witnesses is significant, as shepherds were often marginalized in society, yet they were chosen to be the first evangelists of the Messiah's birth.<p><b>they spread the message</b><br>The shepherds' response to their encounter with Jesus was to share the news. This reflects the biblical principle of witnessing, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where believers are called to be witnesses to the ends of the earth. The shepherds' actions demonstrate the transformative power of encountering Christ, prompting them to share the good news. This act of spreading the message is a precursor to the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>they had received about Him</b><br>The message the shepherds received was from the angel, who announced the birth of a Savior, Christ the Lord (<a href="/luke/2-11.htm">Luke 2:11</a>). This message is central to the Gospel, emphasizing Jesus' role as Savior and Lord. The shepherds' proclamation of this message highlights the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah, such as <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, which speaks of a child born to us who will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.

They actually laid eyes on the newborn Savior, just as the angel promised (<a href="/luke/2-15.htm">Luke 2:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often links firsthand encounter with genuine faith&#8212;think of Thomas in <a href="/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27-29</a> and John&#8217;s testimony in <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1-2</a>. The Bible insists that faith is grounded in real events, not myth (<a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Seeing Jesus in the manger fulfilled centuries-old prophecy (<a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>; <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>). God keeps His word, and the shepherds became witnesses to that faithfulness.<p>&#8226; Their sight moved them from passive observers to active participants in God&#8217;s unfolding plan, echoing the pattern later seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> where those who behold the risen Christ become His witnesses &#8220;to the ends of the earth.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they spread the message</b><p>&#8226; Encounter naturally led to proclamation. Like the Samaritan woman who ran back to town after meeting Jesus (<a href="/john/4-28.htm">John 4:28-30</a>), the shepherds could not keep silent.<p>&#8226; Luke highlights an immediate, joyful, and public sharing&#8212;no training seminar required. It models what believers do when they truly grasp who Jesus is (<a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Spreading the news honored the angelic command to &#8220;fear not&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10</a>). Bold speech replaced trembling hearts, showing how perfect love drives out fear (<a href="/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Their audience was &#8220;all who heard&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-18.htm">Luke 2:18</a>), illustrating that the gospel is for everyone, not just religious elites (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they had received about Him</b><p>&#8226; The message wasn&#8217;t their own invention; it was exactly what heaven had delivered: &#8220;A Savior has been born to you; He is Christ the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-11.htm">Luke 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Faithful witnesses pass on what they&#8217;ve received (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3</a>), guarding the truth from distortion. The shepherds model that integrity.<p>&#8226; Content matters: Jesus is Savior (delivers from sin), Christ (the anointed Messiah), and Lord (divine authority), fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>.<p>&#8226; By relaying heaven&#8217;s words verbatim, the shepherds joined the prophetic chorus announcing God&#8217;s redemptive plan (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/2-17.htm">Luke 2:17</a> shows how a simple, firsthand encounter with the incarnate Christ turns ordinary people into joyful heralds. The shepherds saw, believed, and immediately told others exactly what God had told them: the long-promised Savior had arrived. Their example encourages every believer to treasure personal experience with Jesus and to share the unaltered, hope-filled message of His birth, salvation, and lordship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">They made known abroad</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--The fact must be borne in mind, as tending to the agitation which reached its height on the arrival of the Magi in Jerusalem. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/2-3.htm" title="When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.">Matthew 2:3</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this Child</span>. Thus these men, at the bottom of the social scale in Israel, were chosen as the first preachers of the new-born King. Gradually the strange story got noised abroad in the city. The vision of Zacharias, the story of Mary, the two strange births, the marvellous experience of the shepherds. Following upon all this was the arrival of the Magi, and their inquiries after a new-born Messiah, whom they had been directed by no earthly voices to seek after in the neighborhood of Jerusalem. It was then that the jealous fears of Herod were in good earnest aroused, and the result was that he gave immediate directions for the massacre of the innocents in Bethlehem, of which St. Matthew writes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/2-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[After]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they had seen [the Child],</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7984;&#948;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(idontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they spread</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#957;&#974;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(egn&#333;risan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1107.htm">Strong's 1107: </a> </span><span class="str2">To make known, declare, know, discover.
