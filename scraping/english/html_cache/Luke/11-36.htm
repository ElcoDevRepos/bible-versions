In biblical context, light often symbolizes truth, holiness, and the presence of God (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). The idea of being "full of light" suggests a life fully aligned with God's will, free from sin and moral corruption. The imagery of light is also used in <a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>, where believers are called to be the light of the world, indicating a life that reflects God's character and truth.<p><b>with no part of it in darkness</b><br>Darkness in Scripture frequently represents sin, ignorance, and separation from God (1 <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5-7</a>). The call to have no part in darkness is a call to complete sanctification and moral integrity. Historically, the Jewish understanding of light and darkness was deeply rooted in the dichotomy between good and evil, as seen in the Dead Sea Scrolls' "War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness." This phrase challenges believers to examine their lives for any hidden sin or compromise.<p><b>you will be radiant</b><br>Radiance here implies a visible manifestation of inner spiritual health and vitality. This concept is reminiscent of Moses' face shining after being in God's presence (<a href="/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-35</a>). It suggests that a life fully devoted to God will naturally reflect His glory and attract others to Him. The radiance is not self-generated but is a result of being in close relationship with God, much like the moon reflects the light of the sun.<p><b>as though a lamp were shining on you.</b><br>This imagery of a lamp is consistent with Jesus' teachings on being a light to the world (<a href="/matthew/5-15.htm">Matthew 5:15</a>). In the cultural context of the time, lamps were essential for illumination in homes, symbolizing guidance and revelation. The lamp shining on a person suggests divine favor and enlightenment, akin to the lampstand in the Tabernacle that symbolized God's presence among His people (<a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31-40</a>). This phrase encourages believers to live in such a way that God's truth and love are evident in their lives, providing guidance and hope to others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, Jesus is teaching about spiritual perception and the importance of inner purity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, Jesus is addressing His followers, teaching them about the nature of spiritual light and darkness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Jesus often taught in the presence of a crowd, which included both His disciples and others who were curious or skeptical about His teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_illumination.htm">Spiritual Illumination</a></b><br>Just as physical light illuminates a room, spiritual light illuminates our lives.

Darkness symbolizes sin, deception, and unbelief (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus is calling for an undivided heart (<a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>: &#8220;Purify your hearts, you double-minded&#8221;).

Allowing Him to shine means ongoing fellowship&#8212;remaining in His Word (<a href="/john/15-7.htm">John 15:7</a>) and walking by the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-25.htm">Galatians 5:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/11-36.htm">Luke 11:36</a> is an invitation to wholehearted discipleship.

"If thy whole body be full of light, it shall be full of light all over." The apparent truism is, however, the most expressive utterance of a truth. If the "whole body"--life in all its various manifestations--is illumined by the divine light; if the character is in its measure perfect, as that of the Father is perfect, who is Light, and in whom is no darkness at all (<a href="/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.">1John 1:5</a>); if passion, prejudice, ignorance are no longer there--then that character is . . ." We expect to hear something else as a climax of praise, but there is no higher word possible; the whole character is "full of light," illumined, flooded by the eternal Light.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thy whole body therefore be full</span> <span class="cmt_word">of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.</span> The Lord here completes his allegory, still preserving the same images, with a sketch of the condition of a holy and humble man of heart, who with a "<span class="accented">single eye</span>," that is, honestly, trustfully, lovingly, has looked upon the sign and believed. Godet's comment on this hard and mystic saying of the Blessed is very beautiful: "<span class="accented">When</span>, through the fact of the clearness of thine eye, thy whole body shall be penetrated with light, without there being in thee the least trace of darkness, then the phenomenon which will be wrought in thee will resemble what takes place on thy body when it is placed in the rays of a luminous focus. Jesus means that from the inward part of a perfectly sanctified man there rays forth a splendor which glorifies the external man, as when he is shone upon from without. It is glory as the result of holiness. The phenomenon described here by Jesus is no other than that which was realized in himself on the occasion of his transfiguration, and which he now applies to all believers." There is little doubt that this teaching had been spoken by the Master on one, if not on more than one, previous occasion. In St. Matthew's report, in almost identical language (<a href="/matthew/5-15.htm">Matthew 5:15</a> and Matthew 6:22), the immediate application was different, and the reference of the lamp put in a prominent place was not to the Resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/11-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
