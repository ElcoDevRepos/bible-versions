The crowd often gathered around Jesus, seeking wisdom, healing, or miracles. The presence of a crowd indicates the popularity and authority of Jesus' teachings. In Jewish culture, rabbis were often approached for legal and ethical guidance, reflecting the respect and authority Jesus held among the people.<p><b>&#8220;Teacher,</b><br>The term "Teacher" (Rabbi) is a respectful address, acknowledging Jesus' role as a spiritual and moral authority. It reflects the Jewish tradition of seeking guidance from learned individuals. This title is used frequently in the Gospels, indicating Jesus' recognized position as a teacher of the law and wisdom.<p><b>tell my brother</b><br>This request implies a family dispute, likely involving two brothers. Inheritance issues were common in Jewish society, often leading to familial conflict. The petitioner seeks Jesus' intervention, suggesting a belief in His authority to resolve such matters. This reflects the cultural expectation for a respected teacher to mediate disputes.<p><b>to divide the inheritance with me.&#8221;</b><br>Under Jewish law, the firstborn son received a double portion of the inheritance (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>). The request for division suggests a perceived injustice or dissatisfaction with the traditional allocation. This reflects the socio-economic realities of the time, where inheritance was a significant source of wealth and security. Jesus' response to this request, which follows in the subsequent verses, emphasizes the dangers of greed and the importance of focusing on spiritual rather than material wealth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is approached by someone in the crowd.

His polite request masks covetousness, prompting Jesus to warn against all greed. The verse reminds believers that even legitimate grievances must be submitted to Christ&#8217;s higher call: seek first the kingdom, guard the heart, and measure life by eternal riches rather than earthly inheritance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">And one of the company.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">one of the multitude.</span> The request implied a recognition of our Lord's character as a scribe or Rabbi, but it was for the purpose of asking Him to assume that office in its purely secular aspect. As interpreters of the Law, the scribes were appealed to as advocates and arbitrators in questions of property or marriage. The precise nature of the case is not stated here, but the words of the petitioner suggest that he was a younger son, who, on his father's death, claimed from his elder brother more than the share which, according to the usual practice of a double portion for the first-born (<a href="/2_kings/2-9.htm" title="And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for you, before I be taken away from you. And Elisha said, I pray you, let a double portion of your spirit be on me.">2Kings 2:9</a>), of right belonged to him, and expected apparently a full moiety.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me</span>. Apparently there was a pause here in the Lord's teaching. The Master was about to enter on a new subject, and at this juncture one of the crowd, waiting for such a break in the Master's discourse, came forward with a question. It was purely connected with his own selfish interests, He seems to have been a younger brother, discontented with the distribution of the family property, of which, most likely, in accordance with the usual Jewish practice, a double portion had been taken by the elder brother. This was likely enough the point which he submitted to the Lord. Such a reference to a scribe and rabbi of eminence was then not uncommon. Jesus, however, here, as on other occasions (see <a href="/john/8-3.htm">John 8:3-11</a>), firmly refuses to interfere in secular matters. His work was of another and higher kind. The word he addresses to the questioner has in it a tinge of rebuke. The utter selfish worldliness of the man, who, after hearing the solemn and impressive words just spoken, <span class="accented">could</span> intrude such a question, comes strongly into view. Was not this poor unimpressionable Jew, so wrapped up in his own paltry concerns that he had no thought or care for loftier things, perhaps a specimen of most of the material upon whom the Lord had to work? Is he an unknown figure in our day and time? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/12-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Someone</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
