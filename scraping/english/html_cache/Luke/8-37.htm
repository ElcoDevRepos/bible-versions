This area was predominantly Gentile, which is significant in understanding the cultural and religious dynamics at play. The people here were not Jews, and their reaction to Jesus might reflect their unfamiliarity with Jewish messianic expectations and the power of God as revealed through Jesus.<p><b>asked Jesus to depart from them</b><br>The request for Jesus to leave is a striking response to His miraculous power. This follows the event where Jesus cast demons out of a man and into a herd of pigs, which then drowned in the sea. The loss of the pigs, a significant economic asset, likely contributed to their fear and desire for Jesus to leave. This reaction can be contrasted with other instances where people sought Jesus for healing and teaching, highlighting the varied responses to His ministry.<p><b>because great fear had taken hold of them</b><br>The fear experienced by the Gerasenes can be understood in several ways. It may have been a fear of the supernatural power Jesus displayed, a fear of further economic loss, or a fear of the unknown. In biblical terms, fear often accompanies the presence of the divine, as seen in other scriptural accounts where individuals encounter God's power. This fear, however, led to rejection rather than reverence or repentance.<p><b>So He got into the boat and started back</b><br>Jesus' departure signifies His respect for human choice and the boundaries set by the people. Despite His authority and mission, He does not impose Himself where He is not welcomed. This action also foreshadows the broader rejection Jesus would face, culminating in His crucifixion. The return to the other side of the Sea of Galilee marks a transition in His ministry, as He continues to spread His message to those willing to receive it.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus has just performed a miraculous exorcism, casting demons out of a man and into a herd of pigs.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_the_gerasenes.htm">The People of the Gerasenes</a></b><br>Residents of the region who witnessed the aftermath of Jesus' miracle and were overcome with fear, prompting them to ask Jesus to leave.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gerasenes_region.htm">The Gerasenes Region</a></b><br>A Gentile area on the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee, known for its mixed population and cultural influences.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_demoniac.htm">The Demoniac</a></b><br>A man previously possessed by demons, who was healed by Jesus.

They were probably for the most part owners of similar herds of swine, perhaps sharers in nameless sins, all specially hateful to the Rabbi Jesus, whom they no doubt knew well by repute. But he was, they saw, something more than a poor wandering moral Teacher; he possessed strange and awful powers: had they not had terribler experience of them? Which of them in that law-breaking, dissolute neighbourhood might not he the next victim whose unclean possessions were to be swept away? So they would have none of him: let him, as quickly as possible depart from their coasts. They felt they could not keep both the Saviour and their swine, and of the two they preferred their swine! <span class="accented">And returned back again.</span> The chance, as far as the Gadarene district was concerned, was gone for ever. Jesus probably returned thither no more. Within forty years this district was the scene of one of the terrible calamities of the great Roman war. The sack of Gadara, and the desolation and ruin which was the hapless lot of this once wealthy but evil-living district, is one of the many melancholy chapters of the hopeless Jewish revolt, (see Josephus, *Bell. Jud.,' 3:07. 1; 4:7. 4). A modern traveller, Dr. Thomson, remarks, singularly enough, that the old district of Gadara at the present day is infested with wild, fierce hogs: "Everywhere," he writes, "the land is ploughed up by wild hogs in search of roots on which they live" ('The Land and the Book,' 2. ch. 25). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/8-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7941;&#960;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hapan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_537.htm">Strong's 537: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, altogether.
