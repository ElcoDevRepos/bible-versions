The "Law" includes the first five books of the Bible, traditionally attributed to Moses, while the "Prophets" encompass the historical and prophetic books. This era lasted until John the Baptist, who is considered the last of the Old Testament prophets. John&#8217;s role was to prepare the way for Jesus, marking a transition from the old covenant to the new. His ministry signaled the end of the prophetic anticipation of the Messiah and the beginning of the fulfillment of those prophecies.<p><b>Since that time, the gospel of the kingdom of God is being preached,</b><br>With the arrival of John the Baptist and subsequently Jesus, the message shifted from the Law and the Prophets to the gospel of the kingdom of God. This gospel, or "good news," centers on the arrival of God's kingdom through Jesus Christ. It emphasizes repentance, faith, and the coming of God's reign on earth. Jesus' ministry was characterized by preaching this gospel, performing miracles, and teaching about the kingdom. This marked a new era in God's redemptive plan, where the focus was on the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets through Christ (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>and everyone is forcing his way into it.</b><br>This phrase suggests the intense desire and effort people were making to enter the kingdom of God. The imagery of "forcing" implies a sense of urgency and determination. In the cultural context, this could reflect the fervent response to Jesus' message, as people from all walks of life sought to be part of this new kingdom. It also highlights the contrast between the religious leaders, who often resisted Jesus, and the common people, who eagerly embraced His teachings. This urgency is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/matthew/11-12.htm">Matthew 11:12</a>, where the kingdom of heaven is described as being taken by force, indicating the passionate pursuit of those who recognize its value.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law_and_the_prophets.htm">The Law and the Prophets</a></b><br>Refers to the Old Testament scriptures, which were the foundation of Jewish religious life and practice before the coming of John the Baptist.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>The last prophet of the Old Testament era, who prepared the way for Jesus Christ by calling people to repentance and baptizing them in the Jordan River.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gospel_of_the_kingdom_of_god.htm">The Gospel of the Kingdom of God</a></b><br>The good news of salvation and the reign of God, inaugurated by Jesus Christ, which is now being preached to all people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/everyone_forcing_his_way_into_it.htm">Everyone Forcing His Way Into It</a></b><br>This phrase suggests the eagerness and urgency with which people are responding to the message of the kingdom, possibly indicating a struggle or determination to enter.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/transition_from_law_to_grace.htm">Transition from Law to Grace</a></b><br>Understand the significance of the transition from the Old Covenant, represented by the Law and the Prophets, to the New Covenant, marked by the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_john_the_baptist.htm">Role of John the Baptist</a></b><br>Recognize John the Baptist's pivotal role in God's redemptive plan as the forerunner to Christ, bridging the Old and New Testaments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/urgency_of_the_gospel.htm">Urgency of the Gospel</a></b><br>Reflect on the urgency and determination required to enter the kingdom of God, as depicted by the phrase "everyone is forcing his way into it."<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_response_to_the_gospel.htm">Personal Response to the Gospel</a></b><br>Consider your own response to the gospel message.

The phrase &#8220;until John&#8221; does not diminish the Law&#8217;s continuing moral authority (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17-18</a>) but marks the end of its preparatory, anticipatory role.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Since that time, the gospel of the kingdom of God is being preached</b><p>&#8226; With John&#8217;s announcement, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), the promised King arrives, and the focus shifts from promise to fulfillment (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus Himself launches the new proclamation: &#8220;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>; <a href="/mark/1-14.htm">Mark 1:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;gospel of the kingdom&#8221; is the good news that God&#8217;s reign is breaking in through Christ&#8212;offering forgiveness, new birth, and future glory (<a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>; 8:12).<p>&#8226; After His resurrection, Jesus entrusts this message to His witnesses &#8220;to the ends of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>), showing its ongoing relevance for every generation (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and everyone is forcing his way into it</b><p>&#8226; The phrase pictures the crowds pressing eagerly toward Jesus (<a href="/luke/5-1.htm">Luke 5:1</a>; 14:25).

A clear thread, however, runs through the whole piece between the two parables. Probably, however, here, as in many parts of the Gospel, we only have just a bare sketch, or <span class="accented">precis</span>, of what the Lord said; hence its fragmentary character. Here (in the sixteenth verse), the Master went on speaking to the Pharisees who derided him (ver. 14). "Up to the period of John the Baptist," said the Master, "the old state of things may be said to have continued in force. With him began a new era; no longer were the old privileges to be confined to Israel exclusively; gradually the kingdom of God was to be enlarged, the old wall of separation was to be taken down. See, every man is pressing into it; the new state of things has already begun; you see it in the crowds of publicans, sinners, Samaritans, and others pressing round me when I speak of the kingdom of God." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/16-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
