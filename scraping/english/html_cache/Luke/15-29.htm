The elder son represents the Pharisees and religious leaders who were critical of Jesus' association with sinners. This interaction reflects the broader theme of self-righteousness and entitlement, contrasting with the father's grace and forgiveness.<p><b>Look, all these years I have served you</b><br>The elder son emphasizes his long-term service and loyalty, which he perceives as meritorious. This reflects the cultural value placed on duty and obedience within a family structure in ancient Jewish society. The elder son&#8217;s perspective is transactional, viewing his relationship with his father as one based on works rather than love or grace.<p><b>and never disobeyed a commandment of yours</b><br>This claim of perfect obedience mirrors the Pharisaic emphasis on strict adherence to the Law. It echoes the rich young ruler's assertion in <a href="/luke/18-21.htm">Luke 18:21</a>, "All these I have kept since I was a boy." The elder son&#8217;s self-assessment reveals a misunderstanding of the father's heart, focusing on legalism rather than relational intimacy.<p><b>Yet you never gave me even a young goat</b><br>The elder son&#8217;s grievance highlights perceived injustice and lack of reward for his faithfulness. In biblical times, a young goat was considered a modest feast, indicating his desire for recognition and celebration. This contrasts with the father's lavish celebration for the prodigal son, illustrating the theme of grace over merit.<p><b>so I could celebrate with my friends</b><br>The desire to celebrate with friends suggests a longing for communal recognition and approval. It underscores the elder son's isolation and lack of understanding of his father's joy in the return of the lost.

The obedience had all along been servile, prompted by fear and hope, even as the slave's obedience is. The language put into the mouth of the elder son is clearly meant to represent the habitual thoughts of the Pharisees. They are taken, as it were, after our Lord's manner, as seen in the previous parables, at their own valuation of themselves. They are conscious of no transgressions; but in that very unconsciousness lies the secret of the absence of any sense of joy in being forgiven, of any power to sympathise with the joy of others, even of any satisfaction in the service in which they pride themselves. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/context/luke/7-47.htm" title="Why I say to you, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.">Luke 7:47-50</a>.) They are scandalised at the gladness which others feel when a penitent returns to God. It seems like an insult and wrong to themselves. Their life has been one of uniform obedience; they have performed their religious duties. Why is so much stir made about those who have fallen as they never fell?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29-32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lo, these many years do I serve thee</span>. Bengel quaintly comments here, "Serous erat." This was the true nature of this later Jewish service of the Eternal. To them the eternal God was simply a Master. They were <span class="accented">slaves</span> who had a hard and difficult task to perform, and for which they looked for a definite payment. <span class="cmt_word">Neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment.</span> We have here reproduced the spirit, almost the very words, of the well-known answer of the young man in the gospel story, who was no doubt a promising scion of the Pharisee party: "All these things have I kept from my youth up." The same thought was in the mind, too, of him who thus prayed in the temple: "God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are," etc. (<a href="/luke/18-11.htm">Luke 18:11, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yet thou never gavest me a kid... All that I have is thine</span>. Thy brother has the shoes, the ring, the robe, the banquet; thou the <span class="accented">inheritance</span>, for all that I have is thine. Why grudge to thy brother an hour of the gladness which has been thine these many years? <span class="cmt_word">As soon as this thy son was come,... For this thy brother was dead.</span> The angry elder son will not even acknowledge the prodigal as <span class="accented">his</span> brother; with bitter scorn and some disrespect he speaks of him to his father as "thy son." The father throughout the scene is never incensed. He pleads rather than reproaches, and to this insolence he simply retorts, "Thy brother was dead to us, but now - <span class="cmt_word">It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad</span>." What was the end of this strange scene? The last words, breathing forgiveness and joy, leave a sweet sense of hope upon the reader that all would yet be well in that divided household, and that the brothers, friends again, would clasp hands before the loving father's eyes. But when Jesus told the parable to the crowds, the story was not yet played out. It depended on the Pharisees and rulers how the scene was to end. What happened at Jerusalem a <span class="accented">few weeks later</span>, when the Passion-drama was acted, and some <span class="accented">forty years later</span>, when the city was sacked, tells <span class="accented">us</span> something of what subsequently happened to the elder son of the Lord's parable. But the end has yet to come. We shall yet see the brothers, Jew and Gentile, clasp hands in loving friendship before the father, when the long-lost elder son comes home. There will be joy then indeed in the presence of the angels of God. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/15-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he answered</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(apokritheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
