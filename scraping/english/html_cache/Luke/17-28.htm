The days of Lot were marked by moral decay and rampant sin, particularly in the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. This comparison highlights the suddenness of divine judgment and the obliviousness of the people to their impending doom. The reference to Lot serves as a warning to be vigilant and prepared for the coming of the Son of Man, as the people in Lot's time were unaware of the judgment about to befall them.<p><b>People were eating and drinking,</b><br>This phrase indicates normal daily activities, suggesting that life was proceeding as usual without any awareness of impending disaster. Eating and drinking are basic human activities, symbolizing the routine and complacency of the people. This mirrors the situation before the flood in Noah's time, as described in <a href="/matthew/24-38.htm">Matthew 24:38</a>, where people were similarly unaware of the coming judgment. The focus is on the ordinary nature of life and the lack of spiritual awareness.<p><b>buying and selling,</b><br>Buying and selling represent economic activities and the pursuit of material wealth. This suggests a preoccupation with worldly affairs and a neglect of spiritual matters. The people of Sodom were engaged in commerce and trade, indicating a thriving society that was nonetheless morally bankrupt. This serves as a reminder of the dangers of materialism and the importance of prioritizing spiritual readiness over earthly concerns.<p><b>planting and building.</b><br>Planting and building signify long-term planning and investment in the future. These activities suggest a sense of security and permanence, yet they were ultimately futile in the face of divine judgment. The people of Sodom were focused on their earthly endeavors, unaware that their time was short. This echoes the parable of the rich fool in <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>, who stored up earthly treasures but was not rich toward God. The emphasis is on the transient nature of earthly pursuits and the need to be prepared for the Lord's return.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot.htm">Lot</a></b><br>A righteous man living in Sodom, Lot is a key figure in the account of <a href="/bsb/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>.

Nothing sinful is implied about a meal itself, but the complacency behind it is deadly. <a href="/matthew/24-38.htm">Matthew 24:38-39</a> portrays people &#8220;eating and drinking&#8221; in Noah&#8217;s day, oblivious to the ark&#8217;s warning. <a href="/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a> condemns those who say, &#8220;Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!&#8221; Their focus on appetite blinded them to approaching judgment, just as many will ignore the clear signs before Christ&#8217;s return.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Buying and selling</b><p>Commerce flourished in Sodom, giving an illusion of stability.
