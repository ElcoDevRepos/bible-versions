The "certain moneylender" represents God, who is owed a debt of righteousness. The concept of debt in the ancient world was serious, often leading to slavery or imprisonment if unpaid. This reflects the gravity of sin and the need for divine forgiveness. The parable is set within a cultural context where lending and borrowing were common, and debt was a familiar concept to Jesus' audience. This introduction sets the stage for illustrating the magnitude of God's grace and forgiveness.<p><b>One owed him five hundred denarii,</b><br>A denarius was a day's wage for a laborer, making five hundred denarii a substantial debt, equivalent to over a year and a half of work. This large debt represents a significant burden, symbolizing those who are deeply aware of their sinfulness and need for forgiveness. The use of specific amounts highlights the varying degrees of awareness and acknowledgment of sin among individuals. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of sin's weight and the human inability to repay God through personal effort, emphasizing the need for grace.<p><b>and the other fifty.</b><br>The second debtor owes fifty denarii, a much smaller amount, representing those who may not perceive their sin as severely or who may be less aware of their need for forgiveness. This contrast between the two debtors illustrates the varying degrees of sin and guilt perceived by individuals. It also underscores the idea that regardless of the perceived size of one's debt (sin), forgiveness is necessary for all. This aligns with other scriptural teachings that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>), and that forgiveness is available to all through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_debtors.htm">Two Debtors</a></b><br>These individuals represent people with varying degrees of sin or debt.

The parable&#8217;s contrasting amounts are not about mathematics but about perception: the one who sees the enormity of his guilt will love God most when forgiven. Those who consider their debt &#8220;small&#8221; risk missing the depth of divine mercy and responding with cold, minimal gratitude.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41, 42) <span class= "bld">There was a certain creditor . . .</span>--The parable has some points of resemblance to that of the Two Debtors in <a href="/matthew/18-23.htm" title="Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened to a certain king, which would take account of his servants.">Matthew 18:23</a>. Here, however, the debts, though different, are not separated by so wide an interval as are the ten thousand talents and the hundred pence. The debts are both within the range of common human experience. The "pence "are, of course, the Roman <span class= "ital">denarii,</span> worth about sevenpence-halfpenny each. The application of the parable treats the woman as a greater debtor than the Pharisee. She had committed greater sins. Each was equally powerless to pay the debt--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to make atonement for his or her sins. Whatever hope either had lay in the fact that pardon was offered to both as a matter of free gift and bounty.<p><span class= "bld">Frankly.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">freely-i.e.,</span> gratuitously, as an act of bounty.

And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave</span> <span class="cmt_word">them both.</span> The illustration was from the everyday life of the people. This lending and borrowing was ever a prominent feature in the common life of the Jews. Pointed warnings against greed and covetousness, and the habit of usury, and the love of perpetual trafficking, we find in all the Old Testament books, notably in Deuteronomy, and then centuries later in the Proverbs, besides repeated instances in the prophetic writings and historical books. The character of the Jews in this respect has never changed from the days of their nomad life - from the times of their slavery under the Pharaohs to our own day. In this particular instance the two debtors were of the common folk, the sums in question being comparatively small; but in both cases the debtors could never hope to pay their creditors. They were alike hopelessly insolvent, both helplessly bankrupt. The larger sum, considering' the relative value of money, has been computed only to have represented about &pound;50 of our currency. And the two received from their creditor a free, generous acquittance of the debt which would have hopelessly ruined them. In the mind of Jesus the larger debt pictured the terrible catalogue of sins which the penitent woman acknowledged she had committed; the smaller, the few transgressions which even the Pharisee confessed to having been guilty cf. They were both sinners before God, both equally insolvent in his eyes; whether the debt was much or little was to the almighty Creditor a matter of comparative, indifference - he frankly forgave them both (better, "freely," the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> signifies "forgave of his generous bounty"). The Revisers simply translate "he forgave," but something more is needed to reproduce the beautiful word in the original. "Frankly," in the sense of "freely," is used by Shakespeare - <p><span class="accented">"I do beseech your grace...<br />... now to forgive me frankly."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Henry VIII.,' act 2. sc. 1.</span>) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/7-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Two [men]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#973;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(Dyo)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1417.htm">Strong's 1417: </a> </span><span class="str2">Two.
