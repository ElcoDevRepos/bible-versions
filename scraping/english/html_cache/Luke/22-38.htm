The mention of "two swords" indicates a literal understanding of Jesus' words, which may have been intended metaphorically to prepare them for the spiritual battles ahead. The disciples' readiness to show the swords reflects their misunderstanding of Jesus' mission, which was not to establish an earthly kingdom through violence. The presence of swords among the disciples also highlights the tension and danger of the times, as they were in Jerusalem during the Passover, a period of heightened political and religious activity. The swords symbolize the disciples' attempt to rely on human means for protection, contrasting with Jesus' teaching on reliance on God.<p><b>&#8220;That is enough,&#8221; He answered.</b><br>Jesus' response, "That is enough," can be interpreted as a rebuke or a dismissal of the disciples' literal interpretation. It suggests that Jesus was not advocating for armed resistance but was instead emphasizing the sufficiency of spiritual preparedness. This phrase may also indicate Jesus' awareness of the impending events, where physical weapons would be of no use. The statement aligns with Jesus' teachings on peace and non-violence, as seen in His earlier instructions to turn the other cheek and love one's enemies. Additionally, this response foreshadows the events in the Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus rebukes Peter for using a sword to defend Him, further underscoring the message that His kingdom is not of this world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is preparing His disciples for the events that will soon unfold, including His arrest and crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are present with Him during this conversation.

Earlier Jesus sent them out without supplies and they lacked nothing (<a href="/luke/22-35.htm">Luke 22:35</a>); now He signals a different season&#8212;one of hostility and danger.<p>- The shift from peaceful itinerant ministry to impending arrest is literal and real. Jesus is preparing them for a very concrete change in circumstances (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Look, Lord, here are two swords.&#8221;</b><p>- They produce exactly what they have on hand&#8212;two short blades, likely used for protection or daily tasks.<p>&#8226; This is not a militia stockpile; it is minimal and almost comically small compared with the armed cohort that will arrive (<a href="/john/18-3.htm">John 18:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Their words reveal both obedience and misunderstanding. They assume Jesus wants physical weapons, yet He is primarily highlighting the fulfillment of prophecy and the need for sober readiness.<p>- Cross echoes:<p>&#8226; Peter will soon swing one of these swords in Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-51.htm">Matthew 26:51</a>; <a href="/john/18-10.htm">John 18:10</a>), proving the disciples took the instruction literally.<p>&#8226; Jesus will then rebuke the violence, showing He never intended armed resistance as the kingdom&#8217;s strategy (<a href="/matthew/26-52.htm">Matthew 26:52</a>; <a href="/john/18-11.htm">John 18:11</a>).<p>- The presence of the swords still matters: it sets the stage for Jesus to be &#8220;numbered with the transgressors&#8221; as a lawbreaker in the eyes of the authorities, fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a> in real time.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;That is enough,&#8221; He answered.</b><p>- Jesus&#8217; reply ends the discussion, not because two swords are militarily sufficient, but because the point has been made.<p>&#8226; He has affirmed literal preparation for a coming trial, yet also signaled that violence is not the way (<a href="/luke/22-49.htm">Luke 22:49&#8211;51</a>).<p>&#8226; His words curb any further sword-collecting or bravado; they shift the focus back to God&#8217;s redemptive plan unfolding within hours.<p>- Practical takeaways:<p>&#8226; Readiness: believers must recognize changing seasons and prepare wisely (<a href="/proverbs/27-12.htm">Proverbs 27:12</a>), yet never abandon trust in God&#8217;s sovereign purposes (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Restraint: even when self-defense is allowed, the gospel advances chiefly through sacrificial love, not the edge of the blade (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-3.htm">2 Corinthians 10:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Fulfillment: every detail, right down to &#8220;two swords,&#8221; serves God&#8217;s larger plan; Scripture is precise, reliable, and literally true (<a href="/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/22-38.htm">Luke 22:38</a> shows the disciples offering two literal swords in response to Jesus&#8217; call for preparedness. Jesus affirms their presence yet quickly limits the discussion, making clear that prophecy&#8212;not armed revolt&#8212;drives the coming events. The verse underscores wise readiness, firm trust in Scripture&#8217;s exact fulfillment, and the kingdom&#8217;s ultimate advance through Christ&#8217;s sacrificial path rather than human force.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">Behold, here are two swords.</span>--Peter, we find, had one (<a href="/john/18-10.htm" title="Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.">John 18:10</a>); we can only conjecture who had the other. Possibly, Andrew; possibly, one of "the sons of thunder."<p><span class= "bld">It is enough.</span>--Here again there is a touch of grave irony. The "two swords" were enough, and more than enough, for Him who did not mean them to use the swords at all. The word for "enough" may be noted as used far more often by St. Luke than in the other Gospels. The mystical interpretation which sees in the two swords the symbol of the spiritual and temporal authority committed to St. Peter, and to the Pope as his successor, stands on a level with that which finds the relations of the Church and the State foreshadowed in the "two great lights" of <a href="/genesis/1-16.htm" title="And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.">Genesis 1:16</a>. Both are simply the dreams of a diseased fancy, and find their fit home at last in the limbo of vanities.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.</span> As so often, the disciples took their Master's words with curious literalness, and, as a reply, produced two swords, as if these two poor weapons <span class="accented">could</span> help them in the coming times of sore need. If they were to stand firm in the long trial-season which lay before them, they must surely provide themselves with very different weapons to these; their arms in the campaign of the future must be forged in no earthly workshop. But our Lord sadly declined then to enter into further explanation. His meaning would be all clear to them soon, so he closed the dialogue with the words, "It is enough." This verse was curiously perverted in the famous Bull of Pope Boniface VIII., "Unam sanctam," to prove his possession of both secular and spiritual power: "Dicentibus apostolis, <span class="accented">ecce gladii duo</span>, in Ecclesia scilicet, quum apostoli loquereutur, non respondit Dominus <span class="accented">nimis esse</span>, sed <span class="accented">satis</span>...
