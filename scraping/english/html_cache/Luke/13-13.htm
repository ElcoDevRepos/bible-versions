This physical touch signifies compassion and personal connection. In Jewish culture, laying on of hands was also a way to confer authority or blessing, as seen in the Old Testament with the ordination of priests (<a href="/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14-17</a>). Jesus' touch here demonstrates His authority over illness and His willingness to engage personally with those in need. This act is consistent with other healing miracles, such as when Jesus healed the blind man (<a href="/mark/8-23.htm">Mark 8:23-25</a>) and the leper (<a href="/matthew/8-3.htm">Matthew 8:3</a>).<p><b>and immediately she straightened up</b><br>The immediacy of the healing underscores the divine power of Jesus. Unlike other healings that might require time or process, this miracle happens instantaneously, highlighting Jesus' authority over physical ailments. This immediate transformation is a testament to the fulfillment of messianic prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which speak of the Messiah bringing restoration and healing. The woman's straightening up symbolizes liberation from bondage, both physically and spiritually, reflecting the broader theme of Jesus' mission to set captives free (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>).<p><b>and began to glorify God</b><br>The woman's response to her healing is one of worship and gratitude, which is a common reaction to Jesus' miracles throughout the Gospels. This glorification of God aligns with the purpose of Jesus' works, which is to reveal the glory of God and lead people to faith. Her praise is a public acknowledgment of God's power and mercy, serving as a witness to those present. This response is echoed in other healing accounts, such as the healing of the ten lepers, where the one who returned to thank Jesus was commended for his faith (<a href="/luke/17-15.htm">Luke 17:15-19</a>). The act of glorifying God is central to the life of a believer, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>, which calls believers to do everything for the glory of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is performing a healing miracle.
