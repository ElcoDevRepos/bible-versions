In the cultural context of the time, a son living with his father was a sign of familial loyalty and unity. This reflects the biblical theme of God's promise to never leave nor forsake His people, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a> and <a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>. The father's assurance to the son can be seen as a type of God's assurance to believers of His unwavering presence and support.<p><b>&#8216;the father said,&#8217;</b><br>The father in this parable represents God, who speaks with authority and compassion. In the biblical narrative, God often communicates directly with His people, as seen in the Old Testament with figures like Abraham and Moses. The father's words are a reminder of God's personal and relational nature, emphasizing His desire to communicate and engage with His children.<p><b>&#8216;and all that is mine is yours.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase signifies the inheritance and blessings available to those who remain faithful to God. In the historical context, the firstborn son would typically receive a double portion of the inheritance, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>. However, the father's statement here suggests that the faithful son has access to all the father's resources, symbolizing the spiritual riches available to believers in Christ. This echoes the New Testament teaching that believers are co-heirs with Christ (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>), sharing in the spiritual blessings and promises of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Represents God, characterized by his love, patience, and generosity.

The father reminds the elder brother that he belongs, even while his heart is resentful (cf. <a href="/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1</a>; <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>).<p>- It pictures God&#8217;s gracious acknowledgment of every covenant child, including those who struggle with self-righteousness (<a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-17.htm">Malachi 3:17</a>).<p>- By starting with identity, the father gently corrects without rejection&#8212;mirroring the Lord&#8217;s discipline that confirms, not cancels, sonship (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you are always with me,</b><p>- Presence is emphasized before possessions. The elder brother has enjoyed unbroken fellowship with the father all along (<a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>; <a href="/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>).<p>- Unlike the younger son who wandered, the elder brother never experienced physical separation, yet he failed to treasure daily nearness.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s nearness is the believer&#8217;s constant privilege (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-8.htm">Deuteronomy 31:8</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Familiarity can dull gratitude; the verse calls us to rediscover joy in abiding with the Father (<a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>- The statement also refutes the elder brother&#8217;s fear of being overlooked. The father&#8217;s steady companionship proves that service in the field was never unnoticed (<a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all that is mine is yours.</b><p>- Legally, the elder brother already held the double portion as firstborn (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>), foreshadowing believers who are &#8220;heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>).<p>- The father&#8217;s resources&#8212;love, honor, authority, celebration&#8212;were fully available but untapped.<p>&#8226; Spiritual riches belong to every child of God now (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Jealousy evaporates when we grasp that the Father&#8217;s supply is inexhaustible (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p>- The sentence also underscores grace: the father does not divide blessing on merit but on relationship. This counters the elder brother&#8217;s works-based mindset (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/15-31.htm">Luke 15:31</a> reassures every faithful yet joy-starved servant that identity (&#8220;Son&#8221;), intimacy (&#8220;always with me&#8221;), and inheritance (&#8220;all that is mine&#8221;) are already secured. The verse invites us to shift from performance anxiety to grateful enjoyment of the Father&#8217;s presence and plenty, celebrating His generous heart toward all His children.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">Son, thou art ever with me.</span>--As applied <span class= "ital">to</span> the Pharisees in its primary bearing, or to others like the Pharisees in its secondary, it appears at first sight as if the words were spoken from their own point of view, their own self-appreciation, and were therefore ironical. We need not, however, so take them. The words were literally true of the Pharisees, of Israel as a nation, of all who reproduce the Pharisee temper. All outward gifts that God could bestow, the covenants and the law, and the promises, outward ordinances of worship, and the instruction of wise men and scribes--these had all been given to Israel, as like blessings are offered now to all members of the visible Church of Christ, the great family of God.
