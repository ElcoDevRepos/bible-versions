Luke, the author, is known for his attention to detail and historical accuracy. The phrase suggests that Luke conducted a comprehensive investigation, likely involving interviews with eyewitnesses and examination of existing written accounts. This aligns with the historical context of the time, where oral tradition and eyewitness testimony were crucial for preserving events. The phrase "from the beginning" implies that Luke sought to understand the full scope of Jesus' life and ministry, starting from the earliest events, possibly including the birth narratives and John the Baptist's role.<p><b>it seemed good also to me</b><br>This reflects Luke's personal conviction and sense of responsibility in undertaking the task of writing the Gospel. The phrase suggests a divine prompting or guidance, as seen in other scriptural instances where individuals are moved to act according to God's will. It indicates that Luke felt compelled to contribute his own account, adding to the existing body of work with his unique perspective and findings.<p><b>to write an orderly account</b><br>Luke's intention to write an "orderly account" highlights his desire for clarity and coherence. This approach is consistent with his background as a physician, where precision and organization are valued. The orderly nature of the account suggests a chronological or thematic structure, aimed at providing a clear understanding of the events. This is significant in the context of the early church, where accurate teaching about Jesus' life and ministry was essential for doctrinal integrity and the spread of the Gospel.<p><b>for you, most excellent Theophilus,</b><br>Theophilus, whose name means "lover of God" or "friend of God," is addressed with the honorific "most excellent," indicating a person of high status or rank, possibly a Roman official or a wealthy patron. This reflects the cultural context of the time, where patrons often supported writers and scholars. Theophilus may have been a recent convert or someone seeking a deeper understanding of the Christian faith. Luke's dedication to Theophilus suggests a personal relationship and a desire to provide him with a reliable account of Jesus' life and teachings, reinforcing the credibility and purpose of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/luke.htm">Luke</a></b><br>The author of the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles.

The word therefore signals a thoughtful response to that reality&#8212;he is adding clarity, not competing for attention.<p>&#8226; By introducing his Gospel with therefore, Luke affirms continuity with God&#8217;s unfolding revelation. Just as the prophets built on what came before (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>), Luke writes in harmony with all Scripture.<p>&#8226; This transitional word also underscores that revelation is progressive yet unified. From Genesis to Revelation, God&#8217;s message moves forward with purpose (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>; <a href="/acts/13-32.htm">Acts 13:32-33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Having carefully investigated everything from the beginning</b><p>&#8226; Luke did not rely on rumor. He &#8220;carefully investigated,&#8221; echoing <a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>, which warns against speaking before hearing all the facts.<p>&#8226; His investigation reached &#8220;from the beginning,&#8221; pointing to the birth narratives of John the Baptist and Jesus. By tracing events back to their roots, Luke mirrors the thoroughness found in <a href="/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, where God gives the origins of all things.<p>&#8226; Eyewitness testimony was central (<a href="/luke/1-2.htm">Luke 1:2</a>). Peter later affirms this approach: &#8220;For we were eyewitnesses of His majesty&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It seemed good also to me</b><p>&#8226; Luke&#8217;s personal resolve is evident, yet his decision is guided by the Holy Spirit. All Scripture is &#8220;breathed out by God&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>), so Luke&#8217;s choice is Spirit-prompted, not merely human preference.<p>&#8226; The phrase shows humble participation in God&#8217;s plan. Like Nehemiah, who said, &#8220;So I prayed to the God of heaven, and I said to the king&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/2-4.htm">Nehemiah 2:4-5</a>), Luke acts only after prayerful reflection.<p>&#8226; His willingness demonstrates stewardship of truth (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To write an orderly account for you</b><p>&#8226; Orderly signals arrangement and clarity. Paul instructs, &#8220;Let all things be done decently and in order&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>). Luke follows that counsel, presenting a logical flow from promise to fulfillment.<p>&#8226; An orderly account strengthens faith. John writes, &#8220;These are written so that you may believe&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>). Chronology and detail help believers see God&#8217;s hand in history.<p>&#8226; Such writing equips the church to defend the faith (<a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>) because truth presented coherently is hard to dismiss.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Most excellent Theophilus</b><p>&#8226; The title most excellent suggests Theophilus was a real person of rank, much like &#8220;most excellent Felix&#8221; and &#8220;most excellent Festus&#8221; (<a href="/acts/23-26.htm">Acts 23:26</a>; 26:25).<p>&#8226; Luke addresses him personally, showing that God&#8217;s Word speaks to individuals as well as crowds (<a href="/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29-31</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming Theophilus, Luke reminds every reader that Scripture&#8217;s message is for us personally (<a href="/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>), not an abstract treatise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3</a> reveals a Spirit-guided author who, recognizing prior efforts, deliberately compiles a thoroughly researched, logically arranged, and personally addressed Gospel.

It goes further back than the actual beginning of the movement itself.<p><span class= "bld">In order.</span>--The word implies a distinct aim at chronological arrangement, but it does not necessarily follow, where the order in St. Luke varies from that of the other Gospels, that it is therefore the true order. In such matters the writer, who was avowedly a compiler, might well be at some disadvantage as compared with others.<p><span class= "bld">Most excellent Theophilus.</span>--The adjective is the same as that used of Felix by Tertullus (<a href="/acts/24-3.htm" title="We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.">Acts 24:3</a>), and implies at least high social position, if not official rank. The name, which means "Friend of God," might well be taken by a Christian convert at his baptism. Nothing more can be known of the person so addressed beyond the fact that he was probably a Gentile convert who had already been partially instructed in the facts of the Gospel history.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first</span>; more accurately rendered, having followed up (or, investigated) step by step all things from their source. St. Luke, without depreciating the accounts of the life and work of Jesus then current in the Church, here sets out his reasons for undertaking a fresh compilation. His Gospel would differ from the early Gospels: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> By going back much further than they did. It is doubtful if these primitive Gospels began earlier than with the ministry of John and the baptism of Jesus. St. Mark's Gospel - which, perhaps, represents one of the earliest forms of the apostles' preaching and teaching, - does not go further back than those events. St. Luke gave Theophilus, among other early details, a history of the incarnation and the infancy of the Blessed One. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> By presenting the whole story in a consecutive form. Hitherto, apparently, "apostolic tradition probably had a more or less fragmentary character; the apostles not relating every time the whole of the facts, but only those which best answered to the circumstances in which they were preaching. This is expressly said of St. Peter, on the testimony of Papias, or of the old presbyter on whom he relied: <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x31;&#x46;&#x43;&#x30;&#x3b;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> ('He chose each time the facts appropriate to the needs of his hearers'). Important omissions would easily result from this mode of telling the great story" (Godet). <span class="cmt_word">Most excellent Theophilus</span>. The term rendered "most excellent" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) denotes that the friend of Luke for whom nominally his Gospel was written was a man of high rank in the Roman world of that day. Nothing is known of his history. He was most likely, from Luke's connection with Antioch, a noble of that great and wealthy city, and may fairly be taken as a representative of that cultured thoughtful class for whom in a measure St. Luke especially wrote.
