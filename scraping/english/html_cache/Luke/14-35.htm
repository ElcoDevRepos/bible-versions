In the ancient world, salt was a valuable commodity, used for preserving food and enhancing flavor. When salt became contaminated or lost its saltiness, it was no longer effective for its intended purposes. In a spiritual context, this can be seen as a warning to believers about losing their distinctiveness and effectiveness in the world. The soil and manure pile represent places where salt could have been beneficial, either for enhancing growth or aiding in decomposition, but once it loses its properties, it serves no purpose. This reflects the broader biblical theme of fruitfulness and the expectation that believers should positively impact the world around them (<a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>).<p><b>and it is thrown out</b><br>The act of throwing out the unsalty salt signifies rejection and judgment. In the cultural context of Jesus' time, anything that was no longer useful was discarded. This serves as a metaphor for the spiritual life, where a lack of genuine faith and fruitfulness leads to being cast aside. This imagery is consistent with other biblical teachings on judgment, such as the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-30.htm">Matthew 25:30</a>) and the vine and branches (<a href="/john/15-6.htm">John 15:6</a>), where unproductive elements are removed and discarded. It underscores the seriousness of maintaining one's spiritual vitality and purpose.<p><b>He who has ears to hear, let him hear.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase is a call to attentive listening and understanding. It is a common expression used by Jesus to emphasize the importance of truly grasping the spiritual truths He is teaching. It suggests that not everyone will understand or accept His message, but those who are spiritually receptive will comprehend and apply it. This call to hear is echoed throughout the Gospels and Revelation (e.g., <a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>, <a href="/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>), highlighting the necessity of discernment and responsiveness to God's word. It serves as an invitation to reflect deeply on the teachings of Jesus and to respond with faith and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, Jesus uses this metaphor to teach about the cost of discipleship and the importance of being effective in one's faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples/audience.htm">Disciples/Audience</a></b><br>Jesus is addressing His disciples and the crowd following Him, emphasizing the need for true commitment and the consequences of failing to live out one's faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/salt.htm">Salt</a></b><br>Used metaphorically to represent the believer's influence and effectiveness in the world.

When salt keeps its distinct flavor it enriches and preserves; when it loses that quality, even good earth gains nothing from it (cf. <a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>; <a href="/mark/9-50.htm">Mark 9:50</a>).<p>&#8226; Disciples are meant to penetrate the world with holy influence. If we compromise and blend in, we cease to bless the &#8220;soil&#8221; of society&#8212;our work, families, neighborhoods (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Literal soils of first-century Israel sometimes received small amounts of mineral salts to aid fertilization.

Salt that loses its savor pictures a believer who refuses wholehearted allegiance. Such a life blesses neither fertile ground nor garbage heap and is destined for rejection. The passage urges each follower of Christ to remain distinct, useful, and obedient&#8212;retaining our &#8220;flavor&#8221; through steadfast devotion so that the world may taste and see that the Lord is good.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill.</span>--The illustration, differing as it does from that in <a href="/matthew/5-13.htm" title="You are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his flavor, with which shall it be salted? it is thereafter good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.">Matthew 5:13</a> and <a href="/mark/9-50.htm" title="Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltiness, with which will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.">Mark 9:50</a>, proves the independence of the saying as here recorded. A new use of salt, distinct from that of preserving food, or its symbolic meaning in sacrifice, is brought before us, and becomes the ground-work of a new parable. The use is obviously a lower and humbler one than the others. The salt serves, mingling with the dung-hill, to manure and prepare the ground for the reception of the seed. Bear this in mind, and the interpretation of the parable, connected, as it thus is, with that of the Fig-tree (see Note on <a href="/luke/13-8.htm" title="And he answering said to him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:">Luke 13:8</a>), is obvious. A corrupt church cannot even exercise an influence for good over the secular life of the nation which it represents. The religious man whose religion has become an hypocrisy cannot even be a good citizen, or help others forward in the duties of their active life by teaching or example. The church and the individual man are alike fit only to be "cast out"--to become, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a by-word and proverb of reproach. Our Lord's sense, if we may so speak, of the depth and fulness of the meaning of His words, is shown by His emphatic reproduction of the words that had accompanied His first parable, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/14-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">It is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
