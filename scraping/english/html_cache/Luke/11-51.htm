Abel's blood symbolizes the beginning of innocent bloodshed and the conflict between righteousness and sin. His story sets a precedent for the persecution of the righteous, a theme that runs throughout the Bible.<p><b>to the blood of Zechariah</b><br>Zechariah, son of Jehoiada the priest, was stoned to death in the temple court for his prophetic rebuke against the people&#8217;s disobedience (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20-22</a>). His death marks the end of the historical record of martyrdom in the Hebrew Scriptures, from Genesis to Chronicles, which is the order of the Jewish canon. This reference encapsulates the history of Israel's rejection of God's messengers.<p><b>who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary</b><br>This phrase highlights the sacredness of the location where Zechariah was murdered, emphasizing the severity of the crime. The altar and sanctuary were central to Jewish worship, and committing murder there was a grave desecration.

It reflects the biblical principle of corporate responsibility and the idea that the sins of the fathers can have consequences for their descendants (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). Jesus' words foreshadow the impending judgment on Jerusalem, which would culminate in the destruction of the temple in AD 70.

The murder took place in the very shadow of God&#8217;s earthly dwelling, showcasing the depth of rebellion.<p>&#8226; In the traditional Hebrew arrangement of Scripture, Genesis is the first book and 2 Chronicles the last. By pairing Abel with Zechariah, Jesus covers the full sweep of Old Testament history&#8212;every innocent life lost in between (<a href="/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>).<p>&#8226; He treats Zechariah&#8217;s death as literal, recent history to His audience, driving home that the nation&#8217;s leaders have always silenced God&#8217;s messengers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Yes, I tell you, all of it will be charged to this generation</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;For this reason, the wisdom of God said, &#8216;I will send them prophets and apostles; some of them they will kill and persecute,&#8217; so that the blood of all the prophets&#8230;may be charged to this generation&#8221; (<a href="/luke/11-49.htm">Luke 11:49-50</a>).<p>&#8226; The immediate generation before Jesus bears unique responsibility because:<p>&#8211; They have the accumulated witness of the entire Old Testament.<p>&#8211; They are about to reject and crucify the very Son of God (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Divine judgment arrived within that generation&#8217;s lifetime when Jerusalem and the temple were destroyed in AD 70, fulfilling texts like <a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41-44 and 21</a>:20-24.<p>&#8226; Yet individual hearts could still find mercy through repentance and faith&#8212;seen at Pentecost when thousands believed (<a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37-41</a>). The indictment is corporate, but salvation remains personal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jesus&#8217; words stretch from the first righteous blood spilled (Abel) to the last martyr recorded in Israel&#8217;s Scriptures (Zechariah). By framing history this way, He declares that God has tracked every injustice&#8212;and that the cumulative guilt will reach its tipping point in the generation that rejects the Messiah Himself. The statement is both a sobering warning of judgment and an implicit call to hear, repent, and honor the God who faithfully sends His servants.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(51) <span class= "bld">From the blood of Abel. . . .</span>--See Note on <a href="/matthew/23-35.htm" title="That on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom you slew between the temple and the altar.">Matthew 23:35</a>. We note the absence here of the description "Zacharias, son of Barachias," which causes so much perplexity in St. Matthew's report. So far as it goes, the omission favours the view that the additional words were inserted by the reporter of our Lord's discourse there, or by some early transcriber.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, which perished between the altar and the temple</span>. The reason, probably, why these two are selected out of the long red list of the noble army, must be sought for in the special position which the recital of these two deaths occupies in the Jewish canon of Scripture; the death of Abel being related in Genesis, the first book of the canon, that of Zacharias in the Second Book of Chronicles, which occupies the last place in the sacred volume (is the Jewish canon). They were simply two martyrdoms of illustrious men at the beginning and at the close of the long many-coloured story of the chosen race. There is no doubt that the Zacharias here alluded to was Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada the high priest - a prophet and preacher of righteousness, who at the commandment of the king was stoned in the court of the house of the Lord. This is related in <a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20-22</a>, in the same passage which was evidently in the Lord's mind when he pronounced the awful woe upon the generation then living. This martyrdom of Zacharias was to his Jewish listeners a very familiar and painful memory. It evidently ranked among the most terrible crimes committed by their fathers, and was the subject of some wild strange legends in the Talmud. The martyr's blood would not dry up; it was still bubbling when Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldeans took the temple. No sacrifices availed to stop the awful flow. Tradition assigns one of the four great sepulchral monuments at the foot of Olivet, alluded to above, to the murdered Zacharias. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/11-51.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">from</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(apo)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_575.htm">Strong's 575: </a> </span><span class="str2">From, away from.
