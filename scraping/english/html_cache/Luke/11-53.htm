He was often on the move, teaching and performing miracles in various locations throughout Judea and Galilee. The context here follows a series of teachings and rebukes directed at the Pharisees and experts in the law. Jesus' itinerant ministry reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah bringing light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>).<p><b>the scribes and Pharisees began to oppose Him bitterly</b><br>The scribes and Pharisees were religious leaders who held significant influence over Jewish society. Their opposition to Jesus was rooted in His challenges to their authority and interpretations of the law. This hostility is a recurring theme in the Gospels, highlighting the growing tension between Jesus and the religious establishment. Their bitterness can be seen as a fulfillment of <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, where the rulers take counsel against the Lord and His Anointed.<p><b>and to ply Him with questions about many things</b><br>The tactic of questioning was a common method used by the Pharisees and scribes to trap Jesus in His words and discredit Him. This reflects the cultural and historical context of rabbinic debate, where questioning was a tool for both learning and challenging. However, their questions were not genuine inquiries but attempts to find fault. This mirrors the testing of Jesus in the wilderness by Satan (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>), where questions were used to tempt and challenge His authority and mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching and confronting the religious leaders of His time.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/scribes.htm">Scribes</a></b><br>Jewish scholars and teachers of the Law, often associated with the Pharisees, who were responsible for interpreting and teaching the Scriptures.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious and political group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

Rather than pause to defend Himself, He simply moved forward&#8212;underscoring His unwavering mission (<a href="/luke/4-43.htm">Luke 4:43</a>). Every step He took was deliberate, fulfilling the Father&#8217;s timetable (<a href="/john/7-30.htm">John 7:30</a>). In <a href="/matthew/12-15.htm">Matthew 12:15</a> Jesus withdraws from a region when opposition intensifies, showing that movement often marks both protection and progress. Here, &#8220;going on&#8221; reminds us that faithful ministry keeps advancing despite hostility, mirroring <a href="/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41-42</a> where the apostles continue teaching daily, undeterred by threats.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the scribes and Pharisees began to oppose Him bitterly</b><p>The phrase records a decisive turning point: their criticism hardens into aggressive antagonism. Earlier skepticism (<a href="/luke/5-21.htm">Luke 5:21</a>; 6:7) escalates into explicit enmity (<a href="/mark/3-6.htm">Mark 3:6</a>). Bitter opposition fulfills prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>&#8212;&#8220;The kings of the earth take their stand&#8230;against the LORD and against His Anointed.&#8221; That same animus surfaces again in <a href="/john/11-53.htm">John 11:53</a>, when the council resolves to kill Jesus, and in <a href="/luke/19-47.htm">Luke 19:47</a>, where the leaders persist in plotting. Their bitterness wasn&#8217;t intellectual discomfort; it was spiritual rebellion, as Jesus identifies in <a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>&#8212;&#8220;You belong to your father, the devil.&#8221; The literal accuracy of Scripture lays bare their motive: resisting divine authority, not merely debating theology.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and to ply Him with questions about many things</b><p>Their questioning wasn&#8217;t genuine seeking; it was a strategy to trap Jesus in His words (<a href="/luke/11-54.htm">Luke 11:54</a>). Similar plots appear in <a href="/luke/20-20.htm">Luke 20:20-26</a>, where spies feign sincerity over taxes, and in <a href="/matthew/22-23.htm">Matthew 22:23-40</a>, where Sadducees and Pharisees test Him on resurrection and law. This relentless interrogation fulfills <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, revealing hearts far from God though lips honor Him. Yet each question becomes an opportunity for truth to shine&#8212;Jesus exposes hypocrisy, clarifies doctrine, and calls for repentance (<a href="/john/18-20.htm">John 18:20-21</a>). For disciples today, His calm responses model <a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>: always be ready to give an answer, yet without hostility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/11-53.htm">Luke 11:53</a> records a pivotal clash: as Jesus presses on with His divine mission, entrenched religious leaders escalate from silent disapproval to overt hostility, using rapid-fire questions as weapons. Their bitterness confirms prophetic expectation of opposition to the Messiah, yet their schemes only provide further stages for His truth. The verse challenges believers to keep moving forward in obedience, expect resistance, and trust that God&#8217;s purpose stands firm even when questions are hurled in malice rather than in faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(53) <span class= "bld">And as he said these things unto them.</span>--The better MSS. give, "When He had gone forth from thence . . . ," as though Jesus had left the house after uttering the "woe" of <a href="/luke/11-52.htm" title="Woe to you, lawyers! for you have taken away the key of knowledge: you entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in you hindered.">Luke 11:52</a>, and was followed by the crowd of angry and embittered disputants.<p><span class= "bld">To provoke him to speak.</span>--The Greek verb has literally the sense of "causing to speak impromptu, without thought," and is happily enough rendered by the English text.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 53.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as he said these things unto them</span>.

A crowd of angry men, composed of scribes and lawyers and friends of the Pharisee party, appear to have followed the Galilaean Teacher, whose words just spoken had publicly shown the estimation in which he held the great schools of religious thought which then in great measure guided public Jewish opinion. From henceforth there could be only one end to the unequal combat.
