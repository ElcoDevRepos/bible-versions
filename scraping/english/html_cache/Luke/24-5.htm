Bowing their faces to the ground is a common biblical response to divine or angelic presence, indicating reverence and fear (<a href="/genesis/18-2.htm">Genesis 18:2</a>, <a href="/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>). The women&#8217;s terror reflects the awe and fear often associated with angelic appearances (<a href="/daniel/10-9.htm">Daniel 10:9-10</a>, <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>). This moment underscores the holiness of the event and the divine nature of the message they are about to receive.<p><b>the two men asked them</b><br>The "two men" are identified as angels in other Gospel accounts (<a href="/matthew/28-5.htm">Matthew 28:5</a>, <a href="/john/20-12.htm">John 20:12</a>). Angels often appear in pairs in Scripture, serving as messengers of God (<a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>, <a href="/acts/1-10.htm">Acts 1:10</a>). Their presence at the tomb signifies the importance of the resurrection event and the divine authority behind the message they deliver. The angels' role is to provide clarity and understanding to the women, who are witnesses to the resurrection.<p><b>&#8220;Why do you look for the living among the dead?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the women&#8217;s expectations and understanding. It highlights the contrast between life and death, emphasizing that Jesus, who was crucified, is now alive. The question points to the fulfillment of Jesus' own predictions about His resurrection (<a href="/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>, <a href="/luke/18-33.htm">Luke 18:33</a>). It also serves as a theological statement about the nature of Jesus as the Living One, who has conquered death (<a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>). This moment marks a pivotal shift from mourning to the realization of the resurrection, a cornerstone of Christian faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_women.htm">The Women</a></b><br>These are the women who came to the tomb of Jesus early on the first day of the week.

In our lives, we must allow the truth of the resurrection to transform our fears into faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_the_living_christ.htm">Seeking the Living Christ</a></b><br>The question posed by the angels challenges us to seek Jesus in the right places.

Here, the angels invite the women to rethink their assumptions about death and life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why do you look for the living</b><p>- The question reframes the entire scene: Jesus is not merely missing; He is alive.<p>- Resurrection had been foretold by Jesus Himself (<a href="/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>; 18:33) and in prophetic <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, &#8220;You will not abandon My soul to Sheol.&#8221;<p>- The angels emphasize that searching for a living Savior with burial spices reflects outdated expectations, similar to the disciples&#8217; confusion on the stormy sea (<a href="/mark/4-38.htm">Mark 4:38&#8211;40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>among the dead?</b><p>- The empty tomb is tangible evidence that death could not hold the Son of God (<a href="/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a>).<p>- Looking for life in realms of death never satisfies; it is like Israel turning to broken cisterns (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>).<p>- The call is to shift focus from graves to glory, from mourning to mission (<a href="/matthew/28-10.htm">Matthew 28:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The angels gently correct and comfort the women: stop searching for the crucified in a cemetery and start believing in the risen Lord.

The Lord whom they came to honour as dead was in very deed "living," was emphatically "He that liveth," alive for evermore (<a href="/revelation/1-18.htm" title="I am he that lives, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for ever more, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.">Revelation 1:18</a>). The primary meaning of the words is, of course, limited to this; but like the parallel, "let the dead bury their dead" (see Note on <a href="/matthew/8-22.htm" title="But Jesus said to him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.">Matthew 8:22</a>), they suggest manifold applications. It is in vain that we seek "Him that liveth" in dead works, dead formulae, dead or dying institutions. The eternal life that is in Christ is not to be found by looking into the graves of the past in the world's history, or in those of our individual life. In both cases it is better to rise, as on the "stepping-stones of our dead selves," to "higher things."<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/24-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the women]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Feminine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
