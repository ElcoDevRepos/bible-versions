The mention of "eight days" is significant as it connects to the Jewish tradition of the eighth day being a time of new beginnings, such as circumcision (<a href="/genesis/17-12.htm">Genesis 17:12</a>). This period also highlights the importance of the Transfiguration event that follows, marking a pivotal moment in Jesus' ministry.<p><b>He took with Him Peter, John, and James</b><br>Peter, John, and James were part of Jesus' inner circle, often witnessing significant events (<a href="/mark/5-37.htm">Mark 5:37</a>, <a href="/matthew/26-37.htm">Matthew 26:37</a>).

The specific mountain is not named, but tradition often identifies it as Mount Tabor or Mount Hermon. The act of going up a mountain to pray emphasizes Jesus' consistent practice of seeking solitude for communion with the Father (<a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>).

St. Luke's way of reckoning, "about an eight days," where the other two Gospels give "after six days," is interesting, as throwing light on the mode of reckoning which sees three days in the interval between our Lord's death and resurrection. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/27-63.htm" title="Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.">Matthew 27:63</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28-36.</span> <span class="accented">- The Transfiguration.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray</span>. Some eight days after this question asked in the neighbourhood of Caesarea Philippi, and its reply, and the sermon to the people on the subject of "No cross, no crown," which immediately followed, our Lord summoned the three leading disciples and took them up into a mountain to pray. They had spent the last few days apparently in quiet converse together. SS. Matthew and Mark speak only of six days. St. Luke gives the period in round numbers, counting portions of the first and last days as whole days. We may well imagine that this was a period of intense depression in the little company of Jesus. Their Master's popularity was fast waning among the people. His powerful enemies seemed gathering closer and closer round the Teacher whom they were determined to crush. The late utterances of Jesus, too, whether spoken to them alone, or publicly to the people, all foreshadowed a time of danger and suffering in the immediate future for him and for them - a time which, as far as he was concerned, would close with a violent death. To raise the fainting spirits of his own, to inspire them with greater confidence in himself, seems to have been the <span class="accented">immediate</span> purpose of that grand vision of glory known as the Transfiguration. It is true that to only three was vouchsafed the vision, and silence was enjoined on these, but the three were the leading spirits of the twelve. If Peter, James, and John were brave, earnest, and hopeful, there was little doubt that their tone of mind would be quickly reflected in their companions. Tradition, based on the fairly early authority of Cyril of Jerusalem, and of Jerome (fourth century), speaks of the mountain as Tabor, but the solitude evidently necessary for the manifestation would have been sought for in vain on Mount Tabor, a hill which rises abruptly from the Plain of Esdraelon, not very far from Nazareth to the south-east, for the summit of Tabor at that time was crowned with a fortress. The mount,in most probably was one of the lower peaks of Hermon, at no great distance from the fountain source of the Jordan and Caesarea Philippi, in which district we know Jesus and his companions had been teaching only a few days before. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/9-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">About</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8033;&#963;&#949;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;sei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5616.htm">Strong's 5616: </a> </span><span class="str2">As if, as it were, like; with numbers: about.
