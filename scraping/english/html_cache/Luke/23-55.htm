These women, including Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, had traveled with Jesus and supported His ministry (<a href="/luke/8.htm">Luke 8:1-3</a>). Their presence underscores the important role women played in Jesus' life and ministry, often providing for Him and His disciples out of their own means. The mention of Galilee connects to Jesus' early ministry, where He performed many miracles and teachings, establishing a strong following. This geographical reference also emphasizes the distance they traveled, showing their commitment to Jesus even in His death.<p><b>and they saw the tomb</b><br>The act of seeing the tomb is significant as it establishes these women as eyewitnesses to Jesus' burial. This detail is crucial for the authenticity of the resurrection account, as they could later testify to the empty tomb. The tomb, likely a rock-hewn cave, was a common burial practice for the wealthy in first-century Judea, aligning with the account of Joseph of Arimathea, a wealthy man, providing his own tomb for Jesus (<a href="/matthew/27-57.htm">Matthew 27:57-60</a>). This fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being with a rich man in His death.<p><b>and how His body was placed</b><br>This phrase indicates the careful observation by the women of the burial process, which was done hastily due to the approaching Sabbath. The body was wrapped in linen, as was customary, and placed in the tomb. Their witnessing of how Jesus' body was placed is important for the resurrection narrative, as it confirms that Jesus was indeed dead and properly buried. This detail also sets the stage for their return after the Sabbath to anoint the body with spices, a practice of honoring the deceased, which they were unable to complete due to the timing of His death and the Sabbath (<a href="/luke/24.htm">Luke 24:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_women_from_galilee.htm">The Women from Galilee</a></b><br>These were the faithful women who had followed Jesus during His ministry.

And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments.</span> The real process of embalming, the women who were of the company of Jesus - the Maries, Salome, and others - proposed to undertake as soon as the sabbath was passed, that is, on the first day of the coming week - the Sunday. How little even his nearest and dearest friends dreamed of a resurrection of the body! It seems probable that they expected, at least some of them, a glorious reappearance of Jesus, <span class="accented">but when, but how</span>, they had evidently formed no definite conception. None, however, seemed to have thought of the bodily resurrection which took place on the first day of the week- on that Sunday morning. St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/27-62.htm">Matthew 27:62-66</a>) relates how, after the entombment, the chief priests and Pharisees went to Pilate and asked that the sepulchre might, "until the third day," be made sure; and how the Roman governor bade them take such precautions as seemed good to them. These - his bitter opponents - were more clearsighted than his friends. They had some dim fears of <span class="accented">something</span> which might still follow, while his disciples, in their hopeless sorrow, thought nil was over. And rested the sabbath day according to the commandment<span class="cmt_word">.</span> "It was the last sabbath of the old covenant.
