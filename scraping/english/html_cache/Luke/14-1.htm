It is a sign of the covenant between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-16.htm">Exodus 31:16-17</a>). Jesus often performed miracles on the Sabbath, challenging the Pharisees' legalistic interpretations (<a href="/mark/3.htm">Mark 3:1-6</a>). His actions on the Sabbath highlight His authority as Lord of the Sabbath (<a href="/matthew/12-8.htm">Matthew 12:8</a>).<p><b>Jesus went to eat</b><br>Sharing a meal in Jewish culture was a sign of fellowship and acceptance. Meals were often used by Jesus as opportunities for teaching and revealing the Kingdom of God (<a href="/luke/5-29.htm">Luke 5:29-32</a>).

Their close observation reflects their suspicion and desire to find fault. This scrutiny underscores the tension between Jesus and the religious leaders, who were threatened by His teachings and growing influence.

Still on the same journey; the Lord was approaching gradually nearer Jerusalem. The house into which he entered this sabbath belonged to one who was a leading member of the Pharisee party, probably an influential rabbi, a man of great wealth, or a member of the Sanhedrim "To eat bread on the sabbath day," as a guest, was a usual practice; such entertainments on the sabbath day were very usual; they were often luxurious and costly. The only rule observed was that all the viands provided were cold,, everything having been cooked on a previous day. Augustine alludes to these sabbath feasts as including at times singing and dancing. <span class="cmt_word">They watched him</span>. This explains the reason of the invitation to the great Teacher, on the part of a leading Pharisee, after the Master's bitter denunciation of the party (see <a href="/luke/11-39.htm">Luke 11:39-52</a>).
