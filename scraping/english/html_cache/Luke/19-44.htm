The leveling to the ground signifies complete devastation, leaving no structure intact. This prophecy highlights the severity of judgment due to the people's rejection of Jesus as the Messiah.<p><b>you and the children within your walls.</b><br>The destruction would not only affect the physical structures but also the inhabitants, including the children. This emphasizes the totality of the calamity and the loss of life. The mention of "children" underscores the tragedy and the generational impact of the judgment. It reflects the historical reality of the siege where many lives were lost, and families were torn apart.<p><b>They will not leave one stone on another,</b><br>This phrase indicates the thoroughness of the destruction. Historically, this was fulfilled when the Romans dismantled the Temple, leaving it in ruins. The phrase echoes the prophecy in <a href="/matthew/24-2.htm">Matthew 24:2</a>, where Jesus foretells the destruction of the Temple. It symbolizes the end of the old covenant system and the judgment upon the nation for its unbelief.<p><b>because you did not recognize the time of your visitation from God.&#8221;</b><br>The "visitation from God" refers to the coming of Jesus Christ, who visited His people offering salvation and peace. The failure to recognize this visitation signifies the spiritual blindness and hard-heartedness of the people, particularly the religious leaders. This phrase connects to other instances in Scripture where God visits His people, such as in <a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21:1</a> and <a href="/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>, often bringing deliverance or judgment.

It is not only walls but inhabitants who suffer when divine protection is rejected. <a href="/luke/23-28.htm">Luke 23:28-29</a> shows Jesus weeping over mothers whose children would face the siege&#8217;s starvation. <a href="/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11-12</a> paints a similar picture from Babylon&#8217;s conquest, illustrating that willful disobedience endangers families (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-41.htm">Deuteronomy 28:41</a>).

Jesus echoes the same line on the Mount of Olives (<a href="/matthew/24-2.htm">Matthew 24:2</a>; <a href="/mark/13-2.htm">Mark 13:2</a>). Roman soldiers pried apart the temple stones to retrieve melted gold, literally fulfilling the prophecy. First Kings 9:7-9 shows that even sacred structures are expendable when they become substitutes for obedience. Earthly institutions crumble; only trust in the Lord stands (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because you did not recognize the time of your visitation from God.</b><p>Here is the root issue: spiritual blindness toward God&#8217;s gracious arrival in Christ (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>). <a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a> promised the Lord would &#8220;suddenly come to His temple,&#8221; and Zechariah celebrated that &#8220;God has visited His people&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68, 78</a>). Yet leaders rejected that visitation (<a href="/acts/3-13.htm">Acts 3:13-15</a>). Ignoring grace invites judgment (<a href="/hebrews/2-3.htm">Hebrews 2:3</a>); the same choice faces every generation (<a href="/john/12-48.htm">John 12:48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/luke/19-44.htm">Luke 19:44</a> is a precise, literal forecast of Jerusalem&#8217;s destruction. Romans leveled the city, countless inhabitants perished, and the temple was dismantled stone by stone&#8212;exactly as Jesus said. The catastrophe flowed from the city&#8217;s failure to welcome its Messiah. The passage urges us to embrace God&#8217;s present visitation in Christ, confident that every promise&#8212;of mercy or of judgment&#8212;will come to pass just as surely as His words over Jerusalem did.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(44) <span class= "bld">And shall lay thee even with the ground.</span>--See Note on <a href="/matthew/24-2.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, See you not all these things? truly I say to you, There shall not be left here one stone on another, that shall not be thrown down.">Matthew 24:2</a>. What is there said of the Temple, is here repeated of the city as a whole, and describes a general demolition of everything that could be demolished. So Josephus (<span class= "ital">Wars,</span> viii. 1, ? 1) describes the work as being done so effectively that, with the exception of one or two towers and part of the walls, the fortifications were so laid even with the ground that there was nothing left to make those that came thither believe that that part of the city had been inhabited.<p><span class= "bld">The time of thy visitation.</span>--The phrase is not found in any other Gospel. The idea of "visitation" presents two aspects, one of pardon (<a href="/luke/1-68.htm" title="Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he has visited and redeemed his people,">Luke 1:68</a>; <a href="/luke/1-78.htm" title="Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high has visited us,">Luke 1:78</a>; <a href="/luke/7-16.htm" title="And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God has visited his people.">Luke 7:16</a>), the other of chastisement (<a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1Peter 2:12</a>). In both, however, the act of "visiting" implied looking after, caring for, and so a purpose of mercy. Modern usage--especially, perhaps, the common legal phrase of a man's dying by the "visitation of God," of sickness being "His visitation"--has given undue prominence to the latter thought. Here it appears to include both. The Christ had visited it first with a message of peace. Then came the discipline of suffering, and Jerusalem knew not how to make a right use of either. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/19-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They will level you to the ground&#8212;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#948;&#945;&#966;&#953;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#943;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(edaphiousin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Future Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1474.htm">Strong's 1474: </a> </span><span class="str2">To dash to the ground, level with the ground.
