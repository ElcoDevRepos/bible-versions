In the context of <a href="/luke/20.htm">Luke 20</a>, Jesus is responding to the Sadducees, who denied the resurrection. The assurance of no longer dying highlights the permanence of the resurrection, contrasting with earthly life, which is temporary. This concept is echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-42.htm">1 Corinthians 15:42-44</a>, where Paul describes the resurrection body as imperishable. The idea of eternal life is a central theme in Christian eschatology, emphasizing the victory over death through Christ's resurrection (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54-57</a>).<p><b>because they are like the angels</b><br>Here, Jesus compares the resurrected to angels, indicating a transformation in nature. Angels, as spiritual beings, do not experience death, and this likeness suggests a new mode of existence beyond earthly limitations. This comparison also implies a life of service and worship, as angels are often depicted in scripture (<a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>). The cultural context of the time included various beliefs about angels, but Jesus clarifies that the resurrected life transcends human understanding, aligning with divine purposes.<p><b>And since they are sons of the resurrection</b><br>Being "sons of the resurrection" signifies a new identity and status. This phrase indicates a direct relationship with the resurrection, implying that those who partake in it are transformed and given a new life. This concept is linked to <a href="/romans/6-5.htm">Romans 6:5</a>, where believers are united with Christ in His resurrection. The term "sons" suggests inheritance and belonging, reinforcing the idea of being part of God's family and sharing in the promises of eternal life.<p><b>they are sons of God</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the intimate relationship between the resurrected and God. Being "sons of God" denotes a special status, reflecting the adoption into God's family through faith in Christ (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-7</a>). This identity is not just a future hope but a present reality for believers, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/3.htm">John 3:1-2</a>. The cultural context of sonship in biblical times involved inheritance rights and familial bonds, underscoring the privileges and responsibilities of being God's children. This connection to God is made possible through Jesus, the ultimate Son of God, who paves the way for believers to share in this divine relationship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, addressing the Sadducees who questioned Him about the resurrection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sadducees.htm">Sadducees</a></b><br>A Jewish sect that denied the resurrection, questioning Jesus to trap Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Spiritual beings who serve God, mentioned here as a comparison to the resurrected state.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/children_of_the_resurrection.htm">Children of the Resurrection</a></b><br>Refers to those who will be resurrected to eternal life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/children_of_god.htm">Children of God</a></b><br>Those who are part of God's family through faith and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_life_assurance.htm">Eternal Life Assurance</a></b><br>Believers have the assurance of eternal life, as they will be like the angels, immortal and glorified.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_christ.htm">Identity in Christ</a></b><br>Our identity as "children of God" is secured through the resurrection, emphasizing our belonging to God's family.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_resurrection.htm">Hope in Resurrection</a></b><br>The promise of resurrection provides hope and encouragement to live faithfully in the present.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_promise.htm">Transformation Promise</a></b><br>The transformation into a glorified state should motivate believers to pursue holiness and godliness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/victory_over_death.htm">Victory Over Death</a></b><br>Understanding that death is not the end but a transition to eternal life should alleviate the fear of death.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Luke_20_36_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Luke 20:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Luke_20_36_on_eternal_resurrection_bodies.htm">How does Luke 20:36 affirm the eternal nature of believers' resurrection bodies?

The implied thought is that death and marriage are correlative facts in God's government of the world, the one filling up the gaps which are caused by the other.
