This positioning allowed the woman to approach Jesus from behind. Her weeping signifies deep remorse and repentance, a common theme in biblical narratives where tears are associated with genuine contrition (<a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>). The act of standing behind Jesus also indicates humility and reverence, as she does not presume to face Him directly.<p><b>she began to wet His feet with her tears</b><br>The tears of the woman are a powerful symbol of her repentance and devotion. In biblical times, feet were considered the dirtiest part of the body due to the dusty roads, and washing someone's feet was a task reserved for the lowest servants. Her tears, therefore, represent a profound act of humility and service. This act echoes the cleansing power of repentance and forgiveness, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, where sins are washed away.<p><b>and wipe them with her hair</b><br>In the cultural and historical context, a woman letting down her hair in public was considered inappropriate and even shameful. By using her hair to wipe Jesus' feet, the woman demonstrates a willingness to sacrifice her dignity and social standing in an act of worship and love. This parallels the idea of total surrender to God, as seen in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where believers are called to offer their bodies as living sacrifices.<p><b>Then she kissed His feet</b><br>Kissing the feet was a sign of deep respect and submission, often reserved for royalty or persons of high status. This act signifies her recognition of Jesus' authority and divinity. In the biblical narrative, kissing is also a sign of affection and reconciliation, as seen in the parable of the prodigal son (<a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>). Her actions foreshadow the reconciliation and peace that Jesus brings through His ministry.<p><b>and anointed them with the perfume</b><br>Anointing with perfume was a practice reserved for special occasions and honored guests, often symbolizing consecration and blessing. The use of expensive perfume indicates the woman's willingness to give her best to Jesus, reminiscent of the offerings made to God in the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/30-22.htm">Exodus 30:22-33</a>). This act prefigures Jesus' own anointing for burial (<a href="/mark/14-8.htm">Mark 14:8</a>), highlighting His role as the anointed one, the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>Known as a sinner in the city, she demonstrates profound repentance and love for Jesus by her actions.

She offers her glory, her resources, and her very self to the only One who can forgive. Jesus later declares, &#8220;Your faith has saved you; go in peace&#8221; (<a href="/luke/7-50.htm">Luke 7:50</a>). The verse invites believers to respond with the same humble, costly, and loving devotion to the Lord who graciously receives repentant sinners.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">And stood at his feet behind him.</span>--The common usage of the East left the court-yard of the house open while such a feast as that described was going on, and there was nothing to hinder one who had not been invited from coming even into the guest-chamber. It is possible, indeed, that the feast may have been intentionally open to all comers. Our Lord's position has to be remembered as we read the narrative.<p><span class= "bld">To wash his feet with tears.</span>--Many different emotions may have mingled in the woman's soul. Shame, penitence, gratitude, joy, love, all find the same natural relief. The word for "wash" should be noted as implying a "shower" of tears. It may be noted that while the tenses for this and the "wiping" imply a momentary act, those that follow for the kissing and anointing involve the idea of continuance. The act, the sobs, the fragrance of the ointment, of course attracted notice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment</span>. It had been, no doubt, with her a settled purpose for days, this presenting herself to the pitiful Master. She had been one of his listeners, without doubt, for some time previously, and that morning probably she made up her mind to approach him. He was a great public Teacher, and his movements would be well known in the city. She heard he was to be present at a feast in the house of the rich Pharisee Simon. It would be easier, she thought, to get close to him there than in the crowd in the marketplace or in the synagogue; so taking with her a flask of perfumed ointment, she passed into the courtyard with others, and so made her way unnoticed into the guest-chamber. As she stood behind him, and the sweet words of forgiveness and reconciliation, the pleading invitation to all heavy-laden, sin-burdened ones to come to him for peace, which she in the past days bad listened to so eagerly, came into her mind, unbidden tears rose into her eyes and fell on the Master's feet as he lay on his couch; and, after the manner of slaves with their masters, she wiped the tear-wet feet with her long hair, which she evidently loosed for this loving purpose, and then quietly poured the fragrant ointment on the feet where her tears had fallen. It was the perfume of the ointment which called the host's attention to this scene of sorrow and heartfelt penitence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/7-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[As]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">she stood</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#964;&#8118;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(stasa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2476.htm">Strong's 2476: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary stao stah'-o; to stand, used in various applications.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">behind Him</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8000;&#960;&#943;&#963;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(opis&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3694.htm">Strong's 3694: </a> </span><span class="str2">Behind, after; back, backwards.
