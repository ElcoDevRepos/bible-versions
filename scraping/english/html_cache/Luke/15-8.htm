The number ten often symbolizes completeness in biblical numerology, suggesting the importance of each coin. The coins could also represent a part of a headdress worn by married women, indicating her marital status and financial security.<p><b>and loses one of them</b><br>The loss of one coin, while seemingly small, represents a significant portion of her wealth.

We are justified, however, in assuming that the special features of each were meant to have a special meaning, and that we have therefore more than a mere ornamental variation of imagery. Looking to these points of difference we note (1) the use of the silver coin (the <span class= "ital">drachma</span>) as a symbol of the human soul. Here the reason of the choice lies on the surface. The coin is what it is because it has on it the king's image and superscription. Man is precious because he too has the image and superscription of the great King, the spiritual attributes of Thought and Will, by which he resembles God, stamped upon him. (2) There is, perhaps, a special significance in the fact that the coin is lost <span class= "ital">in</span> the house, while the sheep strays <span class= "ital">from</span> the fold. What seems implied here is the possibility that a soul that is precious in the sight of God may be lost even within the society, Israel or the Church of Christ, which is for the time being the visible house of God. (3) It is a woman who seeks, and not a man, and the change, at least, reminds us of the woman in the parable of the Leaven. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/13-33.htm" title="Another parable spoke he to them; The kingdom of heaven is like to leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.">Matthew 13:33</a>.) It is hardly an adequate explanation in either case, though it may be true in itself, that the variation was made to interest a different class of hearers, the women who were listening, who had no experience in going after the sheep that was lost. We must at least see in it the lesson that what we call feminine virtues and graces are needed for the deliverance of souls that have fallen--patience, and diligence, and minute observation--not less than what we think of as the more manly qualities of courage, and enterprise, and endurance. Lastly, in the "woman" of the parable we may venture to see that which answers in part to the ideal representation of Wisdom in the book of Proverbs (Luke 8, 9), in part to the Church as answering in its collective unity to the ideal of womanhood, as Christ Himself does to the ideal of manhood (<a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm" title="For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the savior of the body.">Ephesians 5:23</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Doth not light a candle, and. . . . seek diligently . . .?</span>--The symbolic meaning of each act lies almost on the surface. To "light the candle" can be nothing else than to put forth the full power of truth and holiness. To "sweep the house" can be nothing else than to use all available means for discovering the possible good that lies hidden or seemingly lost. In the later actual life of the Church, faithful preaching of the word answers to the one, faithful organisation of charity to the other. The rest of the parable is simply an identical reproduction, <span class= "ital">mutatis mutandis,</span> of the conclusion of the former.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Either what woman having' ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?</span> Another and very homely picture is painted in this parable. This time the chief figure is a woman, a dweller in a poor Syrian village, to whom the loss of a coin of small value out of her little store is a serious matter. In the story of the lost sheep the point of the parable turns upon the suffering and the sin of man, under the image of a lost sheep searched for and restored by the Divine pity. Here, in the second parable-story, the ruined soul is represented as a lost coin, and we learn from it that God positively misses each lost soul, and longs for its restoration to its true sphere and place in the heaven life and work for which it was created. In other words, in the first parable the lost soul is viewed from man's standpoint; in the second, from God's. If, then, a soul be missed, the result will be, not only missing for itself, but something lost for God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/15-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Or</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7978;</span> <span class="translit">(&#274;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2228.htm">Strong's 2228: </a> </span><span class="str2">Or, than.
