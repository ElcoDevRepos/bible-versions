Jesus often used parables to teach profound truths, and this method allowed Him to convey complex spiritual lessons in relatable terms. The use of parables was a common teaching technique in Jewish culture, allowing listeners to engage with the story and derive personal insights.<p><b>A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho</b><br>The journey from Jerusalem to Jericho was a descent of about 17 miles through rugged and treacherous terrain, known for its danger due to the presence of robbers. Jerusalem, situated on a hill, was a place of spiritual significance, while Jericho was a city of commerce. This path was notorious for its peril, making it a fitting setting for a story about vulnerability and compassion.<p><b>when he fell into the hands of robbers</b><br>Robbery was a common threat on this road, as the isolated and rocky landscape provided ample hiding places for bandits. The mention of robbers highlights the ever-present danger and the reality of evil in the world. This scenario sets the stage for the themes of mercy and neighborly love that Jesus will explore in the parable.<p><b>They stripped him, beat him, and went away</b><br>The robbers' actions were brutal and dehumanizing, leaving the man vulnerable and exposed. Stripping him of his clothes not only took away his possessions but also his dignity. This act of violence underscores the severity of the man's plight and the urgent need for compassion and assistance from others.<p><b>leaving him half dead</b><br>The phrase "half dead" indicates the man's critical condition, emphasizing his helplessness and the urgency of his need for aid. This state of being "half dead" can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual death, highlighting the need for salvation and the role of Christ as the ultimate healer and savior. The man's condition invites the listener to consider who will act as a true neighbor and show mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The teacher and accountteller, using parables to convey deep spiritual truths.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/a_man.htm">A Man</a></b><br>Represents a traveler, possibly a Jew, who becomes a victim of violence and neglect.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>A significant city in Jewish culture, often representing spiritual and religious life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jericho.htm">Jericho</a></b><br>A city located near Jerusalem, known for its historical and biblical significance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/robbers.htm">Robbers</a></b><br>Symbolize evil and sin, illustrating the dangers and moral decay present in the world.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_evil_and_suffering.htm">The Reality of Evil and Suffering</a></b><br>The parable begins with a stark depiction of violence and suffering, reminding us of the fallen state of the world and the presence of sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_journey_of_life.htm">The Journey of Life</a></b><br>The road from Jerusalem to Jericho can symbolize our spiritual journey, filled with potential dangers and trials that test our faith and character.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_over_indifference.htm">Compassion Over Indifference</a></b><br>The actions of the robbers contrast with the expected response of compassion.

Listeners immediately picture the treacherous 17-mile route, known for danger&#8212;a fitting stage for a lesson on compassion.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the phrase reminds us that sin and suffering occur in real locations among real people; God&#8217;s commandments apply on dusty roads as much as in temple courts (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>).<p>&#8226; By leaving the traveler unnamed and unidentified, Jesus removes ethnic or social labels, emphasizing the universal dignity of every image-bearer (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when he fell into the hands of robbers</b><p>&#8226; Violence and injustice are tragic realities in a fallen world (<a href="/genesis/6-11.htm">Genesis 6:11</a>).

Jesus uses this real-world scenario to confront abstract religiosity and reveal that genuine love engages broken people at their point of need. The verse exposes humanity&#8217;s vulnerability, sin&#8217;s cruelty, and the urgent demand for compassionate action, preparing the listener for the Samaritan&#8217;s gracious intervention and, ultimately, for Christ&#8217;s own saving work on our behalf.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/luke/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">A certain man went down.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">was going down.</span> We enter here upon the first of a series of parables, which differ from those in St. Matthew in having more the character of actual human histories, illustrating a truth, rather than mere similitudes ("parables" in the usual sense of the word) composed for the purpose of illustration. There is obviously no reason why we should not believe them to have been (as in one case the mention of a proper name seems to imply, Lazarus, in <a href="/luke/16-20.htm" title="And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,">Luke 16:20</a>) statements of facts that had actually happened, and which had come under our Lord's observation as He travelled on His work of preaching the gospel of the Kingdom.<p><span class= "bld">From Jerusalem to Jericho.</span>--The journey was one of about twenty-one miles, for the most part through a rocky and desert country, with caves that were then haunted by bands of robbers, as they have been, more or less, in later times by predatory Arabs. In Jerome's time it was known as the "red" or the "bloody" way, in consequence of the frequency of such crimes.<p><span class= "bld">Fell among thieves.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">robbers,</span> as elsewhere.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus answering said</span>. For reply the Master told him and the listening by-standers the parable-story we know so well as the "good Samaritan" - the parable, which has been "the consolation of the wanderer and the sufferer, of the outcast and the heretic, in every age and country" (Stanley). The story was one of those parables especially loved by Luke (and Paul), in which instruction is conveyed, not by types, but by example. It was very probably a simple recital of a fact which had happened, and at some period in the Lord's life had come under his own observation. The local scenery, the characters of the story, would all lead to the supposition that the parable was spoken in or near Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead</span>. We are not told who the traveller was, Jew or Gentile; not a word about his rank, descent, or religion; simply that he was a man, a human being. It seems, however, from the whole tone of the story, most probable that the wounded traveller was a Jew. The way he was travelling was the road leading down from Jerusalem to Jericho, a distance of twenty-one miles - not the only way, but the most direct. It was a rugged, rocky pass, well adapted for the purposes of thieves and desperadoes, and was known, owing to the many dark deeds of which it had been the scene, as "The Way of Blood." The Lord's words tell the story. The traveller, likely enough a Jew pedlar, bad fallen among thieves, who had robbed him, and then had left their victim - dying or dead, what cared they? lying in the pass. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/luke/10-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took up [this question]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8025;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#945;&#946;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Hypolab&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5274.htm">Strong's 5274: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I take up, (b) I welcome, entertain, (c) I answer, (d) I suppose, imagine. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
