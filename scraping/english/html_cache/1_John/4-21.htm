The use of "commandment" suggests a non-negotiable directive, reflecting the authoritative nature of God's instructions. This echoes Jesus' teachings in the Gospels, particularly in <a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>, where He gives a new commandment to love one another. The apostle John, who is traditionally believed to be the author of this epistle, was a direct witness to Jesus' ministry, adding weight to his assertion of this commandment's divine source.<p><b>Whoever loves God:</b><br>This part of the verse establishes the foundational relationship between the believer and God. Love for God is a central theme throughout Scripture, seen in the Shema of <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which commands love for God with all one's heart, soul, and strength. The love for God is not merely emotional but involves obedience and commitment to His will. In the cultural context of the early church, love for God was a distinguishing mark of the Christian community, setting them apart from pagan practices and beliefs.<p><b>must love his brother as well:</b><br>The necessity of loving one's brother is a recurring theme in John's writings, underscoring the inseparable link between love for God and love for others. This reflects the teaching of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>, where He states the second greatest commandment is to love your neighbor as yourself. The term "brother" here can be understood as fellow believers, emphasizing the importance of unity and love within the Christian community. Historically, the early church faced internal and external challenges, making mutual love essential for maintaining fellowship and witness. This commandment also aligns with the broader biblical narrative of reconciliation and community, as seen in the early church's practices in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine source of love, who commands believers to love one another.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers/brothers.htm">Believers/Brothers</a></b><br>Refers to fellow Christians, emphasizing the community of faith and mutual love among its members.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_commandment_of_love.htm">The Commandment of Love</a></b><br>The commandment to love is not optional for believers; it is a direct command from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/love_as_evidence_of_faith.htm">Love as Evidence of Faith</a></b><br>Loving others is a tangible evidence of one's love for God and a true mark of Christian faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_christian_love.htm">The Nature of Christian Love</a></b><br>Christian love is sacrificial, selfless, and unconditional, reflecting the love of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/overcoming_barriers_to_love.htm">Overcoming Barriers to Love</a></b><br>Believers are called to overcome personal grievances, prejudices, and differences to love their brothers and sisters in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/love_in_action.htm">Love in Action</a></b><br>Love must be demonstrated through actions, such as serving others, showing kindness, and meeting the needs of fellow believers.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_John_4_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 John 4:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_practically_love_his_brother.htm">How can we practically "love his brother" as commanded in 1 John 4:21?

Sight may hinder as well as help; it is hard to love what is squalid and hideous. In such cases let us remember the Divine command; let us remember the Divinity which even the most debased humanity contains. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/4-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">we have</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(echomen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
