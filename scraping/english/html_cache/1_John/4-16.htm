The Greek word for "know" (&#947;&#953;&#957;&#974;&#963;&#954;&#969;) implies a deep, personal understanding, while "believe" (&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#973;&#969;) suggests trust and faith. This dual aspect of knowing and believing reflects the Christian journey of faith, where believers are called to both understand and trust in God's love. The love of God is a central theme throughout Scripture, seen in passages like <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a> and <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>, where God's love is demonstrated through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Historically, the early church faced persecution, and this assurance of God's love provided comfort and strength.<p><b>God is love;</b><br>This profound statement encapsulates the essence of God's nature. It is not merely that God loves, but that He is love itself. This aligns with other attributes of God, such as holiness and justice, showing that His actions are always rooted in love. The concept of God as love is unique to the Christian faith and is foundational to understanding the Trinity, where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit exist in a perfect relationship of love. This truth is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>, which describes the characteristics of love, and in the life of Jesus, who perfectly embodied God's love.<p><b>whoever abides in love abides in God,</b><br>The term "abides" (&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;) suggests a continual, enduring relationship. To abide in love means to live in a state of love, reflecting God's nature in one's life. This is a call to action for believers, encouraging them to remain steadfast in love, as seen in <a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-10</a>, where Jesus speaks of abiding in Him as the vine. The cultural context of the early church, with its emphasis on community and mutual support, highlights the importance of love as a defining characteristic of Christian fellowship.<p><b>and God in him.</b><br>This mutual indwelling signifies a profound spiritual union between the believer and God. It reflects the promise of the Holy Spirit dwelling within believers, as mentioned in <a href="/john/14-17.htm">John 14:17</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>. This indwelling is both a privilege and a responsibility, as it calls believers to live in a manner worthy of God's presence. The historical context of the early church, with its challenges and need for divine guidance, underscores the importance of this intimate relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love in his writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, described as the embodiment of love.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>The recipients of John's letter, encouraged to abide in love as a reflection of their relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_nature.htm">Understanding God's Nature</a></b><br>Recognize that God's very essence is love, and this should shape our understanding of His actions and character.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/experiencing_god's_love.htm">Experiencing God's Love</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of both knowing and believing in the love God has for us, which is foundational to our faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/abiding_in_love.htm">Abiding in Love</a></b><br>Encourage believers to remain in love, which is evidence of their relationship with God and a reflection of His presence in their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_god's_love.htm">Reflecting God's Love</a></b><br>Challenge believers to demonstrate God's love in their interactions with others, as a testimony of their faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/love_as_a_measure_of_faith.htm">Love as a Measure of Faith</a></b><br>Use love as a measure of spiritual maturity and authenticity in one's relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_John_4_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 John 4:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_practically_abide_in_love.htm">How can we practically "abide in love" as described in 1 John 4:16?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_God_is_love_reveal.htm">What does "God is love" reveal about His nature and character?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_1_John_4_16_John_3_16_on_love.htm">How does 1 John 4:16 connect with John 3:16's message of love?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_show_God_s_love_daily_4.htm">In what ways can we demonstrate God's love in our daily interactions?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_love_deepen_bonds_with_God_others.htm">How does abiding in love strengthen our relationship with God and others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_John_4_16_How_is_God_defined_as_love.htm">How does 1 John 4:16 define the nature of God as love?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Implications_of_God_is_love_in_theology.htm">What implications does "God is love" have for Christian theology?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/1_John_4_16_s_impact_on_love_views.htm">How does 1 John 4:16 challenge our understanding of love in human relationships?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_john_4.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 John 4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/does_god_love_those_in_hell.htm">Does God love those in hell?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_god_synonymous_with_love.htm">Is God synonymous with love?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_love_fleeting_worldly_desires.htm">Why love the world and its fleeting desires?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_does_suffering_fit_a_benevolent_god's_plan.htm">In 2 Corinthians 1:3&#8211;4, Paul describes suffering as part of God&#8217;s plan for comfort&#8212;how does this align with the concept of a benevolent deity allowing widespread suffering?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does 1 John 4:16 Mean</div><b>And we have come to know and believe the love that God has for us</b><p>- John is speaking as an eyewitness (<a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1-3</a>) who has personally experienced Christ&#8217;s love.<p>- &#8220;Know&#8221; speaks of direct encounter; &#8220;believe&#8221; speaks of confident trust.

Experience and faith are intimately connected; and sometimes the one precedes, sometimes the other (<a href="/john/6-69.htm">John 6:69</a>). As in verse 9 <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> should be rendered in us, not "to us" or "toward us;" and here also the interpretation, "in our case," is certainly possible, and perhaps safer. But the meaning may be that the object of our knowledge and faith is that portion of his own love which God has <span class="accented">in us.</span> It is "in us," and is exercised towards him and our brethren, but in reality it is his - it is himself abiding <span class="accented">in us.</span> In either case love is the object of our faith. Thus love is not only the true note of the Church (<a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>), it is also the Church's creed.
