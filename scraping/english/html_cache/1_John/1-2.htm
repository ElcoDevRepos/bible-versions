In the context of 1 John, "life" refers to the divine, eternal life that is found in Christ. The revelation of this life is central to the Christian message, as it was made known through the incarnation of Jesus. This aligns with the prologue of the Gospel of John (<a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>), where life is described as being in Christ and as the light of men. The revelation of life through Jesus is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>, which speaks of a great light shining on those living in darkness.<p><b>we have seen it and testified to it,</b><br>The apostle John emphasizes the eyewitness nature of his testimony. This is crucial for establishing the credibility of the message, as John and the other apostles were direct witnesses to Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. The use of "we" indicates the collective witness of the apostolic community. This testimony is not based on hearsay but on personal experience, which is a key theme in 1 John (1 <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>). The act of testifying is also a fulfillment of Jesus' command to His disciples to be His witnesses (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><b>and we proclaim to you the eternal life</b><br>The proclamation of eternal life is central to the apostolic mission. Eternal life, in this context, is not just a future promise but a present reality for believers, rooted in a relationship with Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). The apostles' role was to make this life known to others, continuing the mission of Jesus. This proclamation is an invitation to enter into fellowship with God, as seen in the broader context of 1 <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>.<p><b>that was with the Father</b><br>This phrase highlights the pre-existence of Christ, affirming His divine nature. The eternal life that was with the Father points to the intimate relationship between Jesus and God, as seen in <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-2</a>, where the Word was with God in the beginning. This underscores the Trinitarian understanding of God, where Jesus is distinct yet one with the Father. The pre-existence of Christ is a foundational doctrine that affirms His deity and eternal nature.<p><b>and was revealed to us.</b><br>The revelation to "us" refers to the apostles and, by extension, to all believers who receive the apostolic message. This revelation is not just intellectual but experiential, as the apostles encountered the living Christ. The concept of revelation is central to the Christian faith, as it is through God's self-disclosure that humanity comes to know Him. This revelation is made possible through the incarnation, where the invisible God becomes visible in Jesus (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>). The purpose of this revelation is to bring people into fellowship with God, as emphasized throughout 1 John.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' closest disciples, who witnessed Jesus' life, death, and resurrection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Referred to as "the life" and "eternal life," whose incarnation and revelation are central to this verse.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>God the Father, with whom Jesus, the eternal life, was from the beginning.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The recipients of John's letter, who are being reminded of the foundational truths of the Christian faith.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/revelation_of_life.htm">Revelation of Life</a></b><br>The event of Jesus' incarnation, where the divine life was made manifest to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_revelation_of_life.htm">The Revelation of Life</a></b><br>Jesus is the ultimate revelation of God's life and truth.

The apostle wants his readers to know that the fullness of divine life stepped into human history, making God&#8217;s character visible and tangible (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>). Just as light dispels darkness, Christ&#8217;s arrival reveals what true, eternal life looks like (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<p>&#8226; John&#8217;s emphasis echoes Jesus&#8217; own words: &#8220;I am the way and the truth and the life&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The use of &#8220;revealed&#8221; reminds us that salvation is entirely God-initiated; we did not discover Christ&#8212;He unveiled Himself to us (<a href="/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We have seen it</b><p>John insists on firsthand experience. He and the other apostles physically saw and walked with Jesus (<a href="/luke/24-39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>). Their eyewitness status undergirds everything they teach (<a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Christianity rests on real events, not myths (<a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the apostles actually saw the risen Lord, believers can have unshakable confidence that eternal life is found in Him alone (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And testify to it</b><p>Seeing led to witnessing. The word &#8220;testify&#8221; is courtroom language, underscoring sworn, truthful proclamation (<a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>). John&#8217;s goal isn&#8217;t self-promotion but faithful reporting of what God has done.<p>&#8226; Their testimony fulfills Jesus&#8217; promise: &#8220;You also must testify, because you have been with Me from the beginning&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-27.htm">John 15:27</a>).<p>&#8226; This apostolic witness forms the foundation for the church&#8217;s faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We proclaim to you the eternal life</b><p>John moves from witness to proclamation so that his readers might share the life he enjoys (<a href="/1_john/1-3.htm">1 John 1:3</a>). &#8220;Eternal life&#8221; refers not merely to endless existence but to a present, intimate relationship with the Father and the Son (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The gospel is meant to be shared; withholding it would betray its purpose (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; By proclaiming, John invites believers into fellowship and joy (<a href="/1_john/1-4.htm">1 John 1:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That was with the Father</b><p>Before the incarnation, the Son existed eternally &#8220;with the Father&#8221; (<a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>).

What was once hidden in eternity has now broken into time, into our world, for our salvation (<a href="/2_timothy/1-10.htm">2 Timothy 1:10</a>).<p>&#8226; This revelation is ongoing through the Spirit, who testifies about Christ in every generation (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers today stand in the same line of recipients as the first apostles, called to receive and relay the message (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_john/1-2.htm">1 John 1:2</a> declares that eternal, divine life is not a distant idea but the living Person of Jesus Christ.

Because the Son existed with the Father before time and has now been revealed, we can trust that embracing Him brings us into unending fellowship with God&#8212;both now and forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - Parenthetical. The main thought of verses 1 and 3 is, "We declare to you a Being both eternal and yet seen and known by us." That of verse 2 is, "This Being, in his character of the Life, became visible, and in him are centered all the relations between God and man." Quite in St. John's style, verse 2 takes up and develops a portion of verse 1, using its last word as the basis of a new departure (comp. <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> gives the same fact as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> from another point of view). <span class="cmt_word">Became flesh</span> is the fact in itself; the incarnation of the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>.
