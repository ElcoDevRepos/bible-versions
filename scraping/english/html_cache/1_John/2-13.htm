"Him who is from the beginning" points to Jesus Christ, emphasizing His eternal nature and divinity, as seen in <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-2</a>. The term "fathers" suggests a spiritual maturity and wisdom gained through a long relationship with Christ. This echoes the Jewish tradition of elders being revered for their wisdom and experience. The phrase underscores the importance of knowing Christ intimately, a theme consistent throughout John's writings.<p><b>I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.</b><br>The "young men" are likely younger believers who are spiritually strong and active in their faith. The phrase "overcome the evil one" indicates victory over Satan, reflecting the spiritual warfare theme found in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>. This victory is possible through faith in Christ, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/5-4.htm">John 5:4-5</a>. The use of "young men" suggests vigor and strength, both physically and spiritually, highlighting their role in the church as defenders of the faith. This reflects the cultural context of young men being warriors and protectors in ancient societies.<p><b>I have written to you, children, because you know the Father.</b><br>"Children" refers to all believers, emphasizing their relationship with God as their Father. This familial language is consistent with John's emphasis on believers being part of God's family, as seen in <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>. The phrase "you know the Father" highlights the intimate and personal relationship believers have with God, a central theme in the New Testament. This reflects the cultural context of the time, where family relationships were foundational to identity and community. The use of "children" also suggests innocence and dependence, reminding believers of their need for God's guidance and care.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/fathers.htm">Fathers</a></b><br>This term refers to mature believers in the faith, those who have a deep, abiding knowledge of God.

young men walk in Christ-won victory over Satan; children rest in the intimate assurance of the Father&#8217;s love. Together they reveal the full spectrum of Christian growth, all rooted in the unchanging, conquering, and loving character of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because ye know</span> (literally, <span class="accented">have come to know</span>, as in verses 3, 4) him that is from the beginning <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>.

A more perfect knowledge of Jesus as the Eternal Word, and no mere aeon or emanation from the Deity, is the special prerogative of the aged Christian; and such are fit recipients of the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of the apostle. No less fit, but for a different reason, are the younger among his readers. To fight is the lot of the young soldier; and a victorious warfare against Satan is the distinction of youthful Christians. They have got the better of that evil one in whose power the whole world lies (<a href="/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-18.htm">1 John 5:18, 19</a>; <a href="/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>; <a href="/john/14-30.htm">John 14:30</a>; <a href="/john/16-11.htm">John 16:11</a>). Not that the warfare is over, but that it is henceforth warfare with a defeated enemy. Hence they also have a right to share in the apostolic message. I wrote (or, <span class="accented">have written</span>) to you, children, because ye know (or, <span class="accented">have come to know</span>) the Father. The reading <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span> must be preferred to <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;</span>, on overwhelming evidence, both external and internal. The second triplet begins here, and this sentence should have been given to verse 14. It is difficult to determine what is meant by the change from <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> occurs once with <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (verse 1), and six times without <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in the Epistle, and once in the Gospel (<a href="/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>), the probable source of this form of address. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> occurs in verse 18 (see note) and <a href="/john/21-5.htm">John 21:5</a>, and nowhere else in the New Testament as a form of address. Probably both words are applied to the whole of St. John's readers. Some would limit <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to actual children; but in that case we should expect a different order - children, young men, fathers; or fathers, young men, children.
