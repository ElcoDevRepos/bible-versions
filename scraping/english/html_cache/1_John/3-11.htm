This message of love is not a new commandment but one that has been foundational since the inception of the Christian faith. It echoes the teachings of Jesus, particularly in <a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>, where He commands His disciples to love one another as He has loved them. The use of "from the beginning" also connects to the prologue of 1 John, where the author speaks of what was from the beginning, highlighting the eternal nature of the Word of life. This phrase underscores the unchanging nature of God's command and the importance of adhering to the original teachings of Christ.<p><b>We should love one another:</b><br>This command to love one another is central to Christian ethics and is rooted in the teachings of Jesus. It reflects the second greatest commandment as stated in <a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>, "Love your neighbor as yourself." The love referred to here is agape love, which is selfless, sacrificial, and unconditional. This type of love is a hallmark of true Christian discipleship and is a reflection of God's love for humanity. The call to love one another is also a practical outworking of the faith, as seen in <a href="/james/2-14.htm">James 2:14-17</a>, where faith without works is dead. The early Christian community was known for its love and care for one another, which served as a powerful witness to the surrounding culture. This command challenges believers to transcend cultural, social, and personal barriers to demonstrate the love of Christ in tangible ways.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_communities.htm">Early Christian Communities</a></b><br>The recipients of John's letter, likely facing internal and external challenges, including false teachings and divisions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to the message of love, as His life and teachings exemplify the love believers are called to emulate.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cain_and_abel.htm">Cain and Abel</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are referenced in the surrounding context (1 <a href="/john/3-12.htm">John 3:12</a>) as an example of the opposite of love.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beginning.htm">The Beginning</a></b><br>Refers to the foundational teachings of Christianity, rooted in the life and message of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_primacy_of_love.htm">The Primacy of Love</a></b><br>Love is not just an emotion but a commandment that is central to the Christian faith.
