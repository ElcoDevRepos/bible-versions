The term "brother" refers to fellow believers, highlighting the familial bond among Christians. This concept is rooted in Jesus' commandment to love one another (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>). The early church, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>, exemplified this love through communal living and mutual support. The Greek word for love here is "agape," which denotes selfless, sacrificial love, reflecting the love of Christ.<p><b>remains in the light</b><br>"Light" symbolizes truth, purity, and the presence of God. In biblical literature, light often contrasts with darkness, representing sin and ignorance. <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a> states, "The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it," indicating the triumph of Christ's truth over sin. To "remain in the light" suggests living in accordance with God's truth and commandments, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, where God's word is described as a lamp and light for guidance.<p><b>and there is no cause of stumbling in him</b><br>The term "stumbling" refers to sin or actions that lead others into sin. In <a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a>, Jesus warns against causing others to stumble, especially those with childlike faith. This phrase implies that love prevents actions that could lead oneself or others away from faith. The absence of stumbling indicates spiritual maturity and integrity, aligning with the teachings of <a href="/romans/14-13.htm">Romans 14:13</a>, which advises believers not to put obstacles in each other's way.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth in his writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_community.htm">Early Christian Community</a></b><br>The audience of John's letter, likely composed of believers facing challenges from false teachings and needing encouragement to remain faithful to the teachings of Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to the message of love and light, as the embodiment of God's love and the true light of the world.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals who were spreading incorrect doctrines, causing division and confusion within the early church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_light.htm">The Light</a></b><br>A metaphor for truth, righteousness, and the presence of God, often contrasted with darkness, which represents sin and falsehood.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_love.htm">The Importance of Love</a></b><br>Loving others is not optional for Christians;

As I have loved you&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>).<p>- John later clarifies, &#8220;We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love our brothers&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>). Genuine salvation always shows up in tangible care for fellow believers.<p>- Paul underscores the same priority: without love, even great gifts are &#8220;nothing&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1-3</a>).<p>- The verse begins with &#8220;Whoever,&#8221; opening the door to every believer; loving the family of God is not optional or elite&#8212;it is the everyday evidence of new birth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>remains in the light</b><p>- God &#8220;is light; in Him there is no darkness at all&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>). To remain&#8212;or abide&#8212;in the light means ongoing fellowship with Him.<p>- Jesus said, &#8220;I am the Light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in darkness&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). Following Christ keeps us in the bright center of His presence.<p>- When we love our brothers, we stay where God Himself is. The psalmist described light as guiding&#8212;&#8220;Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>). Living in that light guards our steps.<p>- John ties doctrine and practice together: true belief produces true love, which keeps us in true light.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and there is no cause of stumbling in him</b><p>- &#8220;Stumbling&#8221; pictures both tripping ourselves and tripping others. Love removes the obstacles that hatred or indifference would place in the path.<p>- Jesus used similar language: &#8220;If anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him&#8221; (<a href="/john/11-10.htm">John 11:10</a>). In Christ&#8217;s light, the hazards become visible.<p>- Love fulfills the law and does &#8220;no wrong to its neighbor&#8221; (<a href="/romans/13-10.htm">Romans 13:10</a>), so the loving believer neither leads another into sin nor is easily trapped himself.<p>- Paul warned about knowledge without love becoming a &#8220;stumbling block&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-9.htm">1 Corinthians 8:9</a>). John gives the positive flip side: love clears the way.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Love for fellow believers proves the reality of our faith, keeps us continually in God&#8217;s light, and clears the path of pitfalls for ourselves and others. In the daily practice of Spirit-empowered love, <a href="/1_john/2-10.htm">1 John 2:10</a> assures us that we are walking where Jesus walks&#8212;bright, safe, and sure-footed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Whereas he who loves his brother has not only entered the region or' light, but has <span class="accented">made it his home:</span> he abideth in the light. It is difficult to determine whether the "occasion of stumbling" <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is in reference to himself or to others. The context here and <a href="/john/11-9.htm">John 11:9, 10</a> are in favour of the former. It is a man's own salvation that is under consideration here, not his influence over others: and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> seems exactly parallel. To have no light in one is to be in danger of stumbling; to have light in one is to have no occasion of stumbling (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3</a>, which is very parallel). But elsewhere in the New Testament <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> means a stumbling-block or snare in <span class="accented">another's</span> way, not in one's <span class="accented">own</span> way; and this makes sense here. There is yet a third explanation. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span> may mean "in it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "in the <span class="accented">light</span> there is no occasion of stumbling." This makes a good antithesis to the close of verse 11, "knoweth not whither he goeth." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/2-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Whoever</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
