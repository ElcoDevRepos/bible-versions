The apostles, including John, were firsthand witnesses to the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This aligns with <a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>, where Peter and John assert their commitment to speaking about what they have seen and heard. The emphasis on eyewitness testimony was crucial in the early church to establish the credibility and authenticity of the Gospel message. The use of "proclaim" indicates a public declaration, underscoring the importance of sharing the Gospel openly.<p><b>so that you also may have fellowship with us</b><br>The purpose of the proclamation is to invite others into fellowship, not just with the apostles but with the broader community of believers. This fellowship, or "koinonia," is a deep, spiritual partnership and communion among believers, reflecting the unity of the body of Christ as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>. The early church was characterized by this communal life, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>, where believers shared everything in common and devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship.<p><b>And this fellowship of ours is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ</b><br>The fellowship extends beyond human relationships to include a divine relationship with God the Father and Jesus Christ. This highlights the Trinitarian nature of Christian fellowship, where believers are united with God through Christ. <a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21-23</a> reflects Jesus' prayer for believers to be one with Him and the Father, emphasizing the spiritual unity that transcends earthly relationships. The mention of both the Father and the Son underscores the deity of Christ and the essential Christian doctrine of the Trinity.

To what does it refer? Not to this Epistle, which does not contain the writer's experience of the Word of life manifested to mankind, but to his Gospel, which the Epistle is to accompany. The parallel between the two writings must often be noted, especially between the Epistle and <a href="/john/17.htm">John 17</a>. Compare this verse with <a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>. St. John's aim in writing his Gospel is that the great High Priest's prayer may be fulfilled - that believers may be one in that communion of which the unity between the Father and the Son is the pattern and the basis; may "be joined together in the same body, the same belief, the same knowledge, the same sins, the same hopes, the same destinies" (Jelf). Communion with Christians is shown to mean a great deal - no less than communion with the Father and with the Son. Note the double <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span> St. John's writings teem with indications of the unity and yet distinctness between the Father and the Son. Communion with the one, so far from absorbing and canceling communion with the other, implies it as a separate bliss.
