It reflects the intimate relationship between God and His children, where requests made in alignment with His will are granted. This promise is contingent upon the believer's alignment with God's desires, as seen in <a href="/john/15-7.htm">John 15:7</a>, where abiding in Christ and His words is key to receiving what is asked. The concept of asking and receiving is rooted in the understanding of God as a loving Father who delights in giving good gifts to His children (<a href="/matthew/7-11.htm">Matthew 7:11</a>).<p><b>because we keep His commandments</b><br>Obedience to God's commandments is a central theme in the Johannine epistles. This phrase underscores the connection between obedience and answered prayer. Keeping God's commandments is not merely about following rules but is an expression of love and commitment to God (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). The commandments referred to here are not burdensome but are fulfilled in love for God and neighbor (1 <a href="/john/5-3.htm">John 5:3</a>, <a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>). This obedience is a reflection of the believer's transformed life in Christ.<p><b>and do what is pleasing in His sight.</b><br>This phrase highlights the importance of living a life that is pleasing to God, which goes beyond mere rule-following to encompass the attitudes and intentions of the heart. Pleasing God involves a holistic approach to life, where actions, thoughts, and motives align with His will. <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a> states that without faith it is impossible to please God, indicating that faith is foundational to a life that pleases Him. The idea of living to please God is also echoed in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1-2</a>, where believers are urged to offer themselves as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his emphasis on love and obedience in his writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_community.htm">Early Christian Community</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, likely facing challenges in maintaining faith and love amidst false teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The one from whom believers receive what they ask, emphasizing His role as a loving Father who responds to His children.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/commandments.htm">Commandments</a></b><br>Refers to the teachings and instructions given by God, particularly those emphasized by Jesus, such as love for God and neighbor.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prayer.htm">Prayer</a></b><br>The act of asking and receiving from God, central to the believer's relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_prayer.htm">Obedience and Prayer</a></b><br>Our prayers are effective when they are coupled with a life of obedience to God's commandments.
