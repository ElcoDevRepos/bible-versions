The "Son" refers to Jesus, the Son of God, highlighting the unique relationship between Jesus and God the Father. The concept of "having" the Son implies a personal relationship and acceptance of Jesus as Lord and Savior. This is consistent with the teachings of the New Testament, where eternal life is often linked to faith in Jesus (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The term "life" here is not merely physical existence but eternal life, a quality of life that begins now and continues forever with God. This reflects the Johannine theme of life, which is a gift from God through Christ (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<p><b>whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.</b><br>This phrase presents a stark contrast and serves as a warning. It underscores the exclusivity of salvation through Jesus Christ, a theme prevalent in the New Testament (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>). The absence of the Son equates to the absence of eternal life, reinforcing the idea that eternal life is inseparable from a relationship with Jesus. This dichotomy is consistent with the broader biblical narrative that presents two paths: one leading to life and the other to death (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>). The phrase also reflects the early Christian understanding of Jesus as the sole mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The repetition of "life" emphasizes its importance and the urgency of the decision to accept or reject Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ (the Son of God)</a></b><br>Central figure in Christianity, whose life, death, and resurrection are the foundation of Christian faith.

The order of the Greek is noteworthy - in the first half of the verse the emphasis is on "hath," in the second on "life."
