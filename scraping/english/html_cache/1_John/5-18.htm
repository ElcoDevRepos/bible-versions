In the context of 1 John, being "born of God" refers to a spiritual regeneration through faith in Jesus Christ. This transformation results in a new nature that resists habitual sin. The Greek term used here suggests a continuous action, indicating that a true believer does not persist in a lifestyle of sin. This aligns with Paul's teachings in <a href="/romans/6.htm">Romans 6:1-2</a>, where he argues that those who have died to sin should not live in it any longer. The concept of being "born of God" also connects to Jesus' conversation with Nicodemus in <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-7</a>, where He speaks of being born again to see the kingdom of God.<p><b>the One who was born of God protects him,</b><br>This phrase refers to Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, who provides protection for believers. The protection mentioned here is spiritual, safeguarding the believer's soul and eternal destiny. This echoes Jesus' prayer in <a href="/john/17-12.htm">John 17:12</a>, where He speaks of keeping His disciples safe. The imagery of protection is also found in <a href="/psalms/121-7.htm">Psalm 121:7</a>, which assures that the Lord will keep believers from all harm. Theologically, this protection is understood as part of the believer's assurance of salvation, a theme prevalent in the New Testament.<p><b>and the evil one cannot touch him.</b><br>The "evil one" is a reference to Satan, the adversary of God and His people. The assurance that Satan cannot "touch" the believer suggests a limitation on his power over those who are in Christ. This is consistent with the promise in <a href="/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a>, which states that if believers resist the devil, he will flee from them. The term "touch" implies a harmful grasp or influence, indicating that while Satan may tempt or accuse, he cannot ultimately harm the believer's standing before God. This protection is a result of the believer's union with Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>, where the armor of God is described as a means of standing firm against the devil's schemes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Christ and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers/born_of_god.htm">Believers/Born of God</a></b><br>Refers to Christians who have been spiritually reborn through faith in Jesus Christ, indicating a transformation in their nature and behavior.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_one_who_was_born_of_god.htm">The One who was born of God</a></b><br>This phrase is understood to refer to Jesus Christ, emphasizing His divine nature and role as protector of believers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_evil_one.htm">The Evil One</a></b><br>A reference to Satan, the adversary of God and His people, who seeks to lead believers into sin and away from God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin.htm">Sin</a></b><br>The act of disobedience against God's commands, which believers are called to resist through the power of the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_through_new_birth.htm">Transformation through New Birth</a></b><br>Being "born of God" signifies a fundamental change in identity and behavior.

Each begins with "We know."<p>(18) <span class= "bld">Sinneth not.</span>--There is no reason to supply "unto death." (Comp. the Note on <a href="/1_john/3-9.htm" title="Whoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.">1John 3:9</a>.) St. John means strongly to insist, in this the solemn close of his Letter, that the true ideal Christian frame is the absence of wilful sin. Stumbles there may be, even such as need the prayers of friends, but intentional lawlessness there cannot be. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-21.</span> - With three solemn asseverations and one equally solemn charge the Epistle is brought to a close. "Can we be certain of any principles in ethics? St. John declares that we can. He says that he has not been making probable guesses about the grounds of human actions, the relations of man to God, the nature of God himself. These are firings that he <span class="accented">knows.</span> Nay, he is not content with claiming this knowledge himself. He uses the plural pronoun; he declares that his disciples, his little children, <span class="accented">know</span> that which he knows" (Maurice). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We know;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, as in <a href="/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2, 14</a>, and <a href="/john/21-24.htm">John 21:24</a>, which should be compared with this passage. These expressions of Christian certitude explain the undialectical character of St. John's Epistles as compared with those of St. Paul. What need to argue and prove when both he and his readers already knew and believed? We must have <span class="accented">"begotten"</span> in both clauses, as in the Revised Version, not <span class="accented">"born"</span> in one and <span class="accented">"begotten"</span> in the other, as in the Authorized Version. In the Greek there is a change of tense <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, but no change of verb. The whole should run, "We know that whosoever is <span class="cmt_word">begotten</span> of God sinneth not, but <span class="cmt_word">the Begotten</span> of God keepeth <span class="cmt_word">him</span>." For the perfect participle, comp. <a href="/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-1.htm">1 John 5:1, 4</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-6.htm">1 John 3:6, 8</a>: it expresses him who has come to be, and still continues to be, a son of God. The aorist participle occurs nowhere else in St. John: it expresses him who, without relation to time past or present, is the Son of God. The reading <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> is preferable to <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">conservat eum</span>, not <span class="accented">conserver seipsum</span>, which Calvin adopts. The eternal Son of the Father preserves the frail children of the Father from the common foe, so that <span class="cmt_word">the evil one</span> toucheth them not. The verb for "touch <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is the same as in "Touch me not" (<a href="/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>). In both cases "touch" is somewhat too weak a rendering; the meaning is rather, "lay hold of," "hold fast." The Magdalene wished, not merely to touch, but to hold the Lord fast, so as to have his bodily presence continually. And here the meaning is that, though the evil one may attack the children of God, yet he cannot get them into his power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/5-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">We know</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#7988;&#948;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Oidamen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">anyone</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#8118;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
