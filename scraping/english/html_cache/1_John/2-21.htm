This suggests a community well-versed in Christian doctrine, likely familiar with the teachings of Jesus and the apostles. The early church faced challenges from false teachings, such as Gnosticism, which claimed secret knowledge. John's reassurance indicates that his readers are grounded in the truth of the Gospel, contrasting with those who might be swayed by heretical ideas. This echoes Jesus' words in <a href="/john/8-32.htm">John 8:32</a>, "You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free," emphasizing the liberating power of genuine knowledge of Christ.<p><b>but because you have it</b><br>John's affirmation that his readers possess the truth highlights the importance of spiritual discernment. This possession of truth is not merely intellectual but experiential, rooted in a relationship with Christ. The truth here is synonymous with the message of Jesus, who declared Himself "the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The early church's emphasis on apostolic teaching ensured that believers were equipped to recognize and reject falsehoods. This phrase underscores the confidence John has in their spiritual maturity and the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit, who guides believers into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>).<p><b>and because no lie comes from the truth</b><br>This statement underscores the absolute nature of truth in Christian theology. Truth and falsehood are mutually exclusive; one cannot originate from the other. This dichotomy is central to the biblical worldview, where God is the source of all truth, and Satan is described as the "father of lies" (<a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>). The early church was vigilant against false teachings that distorted the Gospel. John's assertion serves as a reminder that any teaching contrary to the apostolic message is inherently false. This principle is foundational for maintaining doctrinal purity and is echoed in Paul's exhortation to the Galatians to reject any gospel contrary to what they received (<a href="/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Christ and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_recipients.htm">The Recipients</a></b><br>Believers in the early Christian community, likely facing challenges from false teachings and needing reassurance in their faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals spreading deceptive doctrines, possibly Gnosticism, which denied fundamental truths about Jesus Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The broader context in which these letters were circulated, a time of growth and doctrinal formation for Christianity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_truth.htm">The Truth</a></b><br>Central to John's message, representing the authentic teachings of Jesus Christ and the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_knowing_the_truth.htm">The Importance of Knowing the Truth</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to be grounded in the truth of the Gospel.

Anything contradicting Christ is a lie.<p>&#8226; <a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a> affirms that God &#8220;cannot lie,&#8221; grounding the believer&#8217;s confidence that what God has revealed is wholly trustworthy.<p>&#8226; Lies originate from the devil, &#8220;a liar and the father of lies&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>). By contrast, &#8220;every good and perfect gift is from above&#8230; with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Because truth is inherently pure, it exposes and rejects error; this equips the church to spot antichrists (<a href="/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>John writes not to fill a knowledge gap but to strengthen believers already walking in God&#8217;s truth. Their possession of that truth equips them to discern and reject every falsehood, for truth and lies cannot mingle. What the Spirit has implanted, Scripture affirms: God&#8217;s Word is entirely trustworthy, Jesus is its embodiment, and no deception can arise from Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - The first <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> belongs to <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, not to <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span>: I wrote to you, not because ye know not, etc. It does not mean "I omitted to write to you because ye know not." Whatever meaning we give to the aorists in verses 13, 14 need not be retained here. There is here no abrupt change from present to aorist. Moreover, verse 26 limits this <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span> to the present section. What in verse 20 is spoken of as "all things" (assuming <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> to be right) is here spoken of as "the truth." St. John writes to well-instructed Christians, to adults in the faith. It is precisely because they "know the truth" that he addresses them, especially to warn them against antichrists. We are in doubt whether <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, depends upon <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span> ("and because")or upon <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("and that"). The former is better; it introduces a second reason for his writing. Some take <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, in all three places as "that" after <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span>: "I did not write to you and say that ye know not the truth, but that ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth." Every lie is fundamentally and <span class="accented">ab origine</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> separate from the truth; and hence his readers will easily recognize lies and liars, for they know the truth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/2-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I have not written</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#968;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(egrapsa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1125.htm">Strong's 1125: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary verb; to 'grave', especially to write; figuratively, to describe.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
