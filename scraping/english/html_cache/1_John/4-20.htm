In the biblical context, love for God is not merely a verbal declaration but is demonstrated through actions and obedience (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). The Shema, a central declaration of faith in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, emphasizes loving God with all one's heart, soul, and strength, which implies a holistic commitment that transcends mere words.<p><b>but hates his brother,</b><br>The term "brother" here refers to fellow believers, emphasizing the familial bond within the Christian community. Hatred is antithetical to the teachings of Jesus, who commanded love for one another (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>). In the cultural context of the early church, divisions and conflicts were common, and this admonition serves as a corrective to such behavior. The Greek word for hate, "miseo," implies a strong aversion or detest, which is incompatible with Christian love.<p><b>he is a liar.</b><br>This statement is a direct and uncompromising assessment of the inconsistency between professing love for God while harboring hatred. The term "liar" is used elsewhere in 1 John (1:6, 2:4) to describe those who claim fellowship with God but walk in darkness. It underscores the importance of integrity and truthfulness in the believer's life, reflecting the nature of God, who is truth (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p><b>For anyone who does not love his brother,</b><br>This phrase reiterates the necessity of love within the Christian community. The early church faced challenges of unity, as seen in the disputes between Jewish and Gentile believers (Acts 15). Love is the fulfillment of the law (<a href="/romans/13-8.htm">Romans 13:8-10</a>) and is essential for maintaining the unity and witness of the church.<p><b>whom he has seen,</b><br>The tangible presence of fellow believers makes the command to love them more immediate and practical. In the historical context, the early Christians lived in close-knit communities where daily interactions were common. This visibility makes the failure to love more evident and inexcusable.<p><b>cannot love God,</b><br>This phrase presents a logical and spiritual impossibility. The love of God is inherently linked to love for others, as God is love (1 <a href="/john/4-8.htm">John 4:8</a>). The inability to love those who are seen reflects a deficiency in one's relationship with God. This connection is echoed in Jesus' teaching that the greatest commandments are to love God and love one's neighbor (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-39</a>).<p><b>whom he has not seen.</b><br>The unseen nature of God requires faith (<a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>), and love for God is expressed through obedience and love for others (1 <a href="/john/5-2.htm">John 5:2-3</a>). The historical context of the early church, which faced persecution and trials, necessitated a strong, visible demonstration of love as a testimony to their faith in the unseen God. This principle is a call to genuine, active love that reflects the character of God, who first loved us (1 <a href="/john/4-19.htm">John 4:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth in his writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The audience of John's letter, consisting of early Christians who were facing challenges such as false teachings and divisions within the community.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, representing the ultimate source of love and the one whom believers claim to love.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_brother.htm">The Brother</a></b><br>Refers to fellow believers or, more broadly, to others within the community of faith whom one is called to love.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_concept_of_love.htm">The Concept of Love</a></b><br>A recurring theme in John's writings, emphasizing the importance of genuine love as evidence of one's relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_inseparability_of_love_for_god_and_others.htm">The Inseparability of Love for God and Others</a></b><br>True love for God is evidenced by love for others.

Love for God begins with a sincere heart (<a href="/mark/12-30.htm">Mark 12:30</a>) but immediately moves toward obedient living (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But hates his brother</b><p>&#8220;Brother&#8221; points first to fellow believers (<a href="/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>) and, by extension, to every neighbor God places in our path (<a href="/luke/10-36.htm">Luke 10:36-37</a>).

Such a person &#8220;lies and does not practice the truth&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6</a>). The devil &#8220;is a liar and the father of lies&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>), so persisting in hatred aligns the heart with darkness, not with Christ.

What is this love of which the apostle has been speaking? Is it the love of' God or of our fellow-men? Both; love of our brethren is organically bound up with love of God. To love God and hate one's brother is impossible. Sight, though not necessary to affection, aids it; and it is therefore easier to love men than God. If a man fails in the easier, will he succeed in the harder? Moreover, to hate one's brother is to hate God. "Whoso rejecteth you rejecteth me, and whoso rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent me."
