It indicates a close, familial relationship between John and his readers, who are likely a mix of new believers and those who are spiritually immature. This phrase also echoes Jesus' own use of "little children" in passages like <a href="/matthew/18-3.htm">Matthew 18:3</a>, emphasizing humility and dependence on God. The use of "writing" suggests the importance of the written word in preserving apostolic teaching and combating false doctrines, a significant concern in the early church.<p><b>because your sins have been forgiven</b><br>The forgiveness of sins is a central tenet of Christian faith, rooted in the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This assurance of forgiveness is foundational for believers, providing peace and reconciliation with God. The concept of forgiveness is deeply embedded in the Old Testament, with the sacrificial system pointing forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>). The perfect tense used here indicates a completed action with ongoing effects, underscoring the permanence and sufficiency of Christ's atonement.<p><b>through His name</b><br>The phrase "through His name" highlights the authority and power inherent in the name of Jesus. In biblical times, a name was more than a label; it represented the essence and authority of a person. <a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a> affirms that salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. This underscores the exclusivity of Christ as the mediator between God and humanity. The name of Jesus is central to Christian prayer, worship, and identity, reflecting His divine nature and redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/little_children.htm">Little Children</a></b><br>A term of endearment used by John to address believers, indicating a familial relationship and spiritual immaturity or dependence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/forgiveness_of_sins.htm">Forgiveness of Sins</a></b><br>The central theme of this verse, highlighting the redemptive work of Jesus Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_name.htm">His Name</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, emphasizing the authority and power inherent in His name for the forgiveness of sins.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_forgiveness.htm">Understanding Forgiveness</a></b><br>Recognize that forgiveness is a gift from God, granted through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

He cannot bear even to seem to suggest that his "dear little children" are shrouded in the gloomy horrors of moral darkness, haunted by the faithful memories of their sins, and enticed hither and thither by the malevolent spirits of evil. He will warn them with the most tender and pitiful affection against the wicked one, the world, the flesh, the follies and vanities of the human heart; but first he will show them frankly what he thinks of them, what he hopes of them, the trust he places in them, the grounds which he takes for granted in writing to them.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">I write unto you, little children.</span>--The arrangement of these triplets should be prefaced by saying that the last "I write," in <a href="/1_john/2-13.htm" title="I write to you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning.
