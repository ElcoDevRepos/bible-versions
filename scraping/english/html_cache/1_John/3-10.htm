The concept of being "children of God" versus "children of the devil" is rooted in the broader biblical narrative of spiritual warfare and moral dualism. In <a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>, Jesus refers to some as being of their "father the devil," emphasizing the moral and spiritual lineage that is not aligned with God. The distinction here is not based on ethnicity or social status but on spiritual allegiance and moral conduct. This echoes the Genesis account of the seed of the woman versus the seed of the serpent (<a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>), highlighting the ongoing conflict between good and evil.<p><b>Anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God:</b><br>Righteousness in the biblical context refers to living in accordance with God's will and commandments. The practice of righteousness is a recurring theme in the New Testament, particularly in the writings of Paul and John. In <a href="/romans/6-13.htm">Romans 6:13</a>, Paul exhorts believers to present themselves as instruments of righteousness. The emphasis on "practice" suggests a continual, habitual lifestyle rather than isolated acts. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount, where He calls His followers to a higher standard of living (Matthew 5-7). The absence of such practice indicates a lack of genuine relationship with God.<p><b>nor is anyone who does not love his brother:</b><br>Love is a central tenet of Christian ethics, and the command to love one's brother is deeply rooted in both the Old and New Testaments. <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a> commands, "Love your neighbor as yourself," which Jesus reiterates as the second greatest commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>). In the context of 1 John, "brother" likely refers to fellow believers, emphasizing the importance of love within the Christian community. This love is not merely emotional but is demonstrated through actions and truth (1 <a href="/john/3-18.htm">John 3:18</a>). The absence of love for one's brother is a sign of spiritual deficiency and is incompatible with being a child of God, as God Himself is love (1 <a href="/john/4-8.htm">John 4:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/children_of_god.htm">Children of God</a></b><br>Refers to those who have accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior and live according to His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/children_of_the_devil.htm">Children of the Devil</a></b><br>Refers to those who reject God's truth and live in sin, following the ways of the world.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/righteousness.htm">Righteousness</a></b><br>The quality of being morally right or justifiable, which in the Christian context, is living in accordance with God's will.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/brotherly_love.htm">Brotherly Love</a></b><br>A central theme in John's writings, emphasizing the importance of loving fellow believers as a reflection of God's love.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/distinguishing_marks_of_believers.htm">Distinguishing Marks of Believers</a></b><br>True believers are identified by their practice of righteousness and love for others.

Faith that stays hidden is not biblical faith; it shows itself. Jesus said, &#8220;By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you love one another&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>). Likewise, &#8220;You will recognize them by their fruit&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16</a>). In other words:<p>&#8226; The gospel creates a visible change.<p>&#8226; That change is clear enough to &#8220;distinguish&#8221; believers from unbelievers.<p>&#8226; Assurance grows as these outward marks line up with God&#8217;s Word (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the children of the devil</b><p>Scripture acknowledges only two spiritual families. Jesus told hostile listeners, &#8220;You belong to your father, the devil&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>). Paul writes, &#8220;The whole world lies in the power of the evil one&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/5-19.htm">1 John 5:19</a>). The contrast is stark:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s children walk in light; the devil&#8217;s children linger in darkness (<a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s children submit; the devil&#8217;s children rebel (<a href="/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s children bear fruit; the devil&#8217;s children produce works of the flesh (<a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-23</a>).<p>John&#8217;s wording is not name-calling; it is spiritual reality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God</b><p>&#8220;Practice&#8221; signals pattern, not perfection. We stumble (<a href="/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8-9</a>) yet pursue obedience. John has already said, &#8220;Everyone who practices righteousness has been born of Him&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/2-29.htm">1 John 2:29</a>). Here he states the negative: if righteousness is absent, new birth is absent.<p>Consider:<p>&#8226; Salvation is by grace alone (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>), yet grace produces &#8220;good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>).<p>&#8226; James echoes John: &#8220;Faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead&#8221; (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Righteous living includes honesty, purity, generosity, humility&#8212;evidence that Christ lives in us (<a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>).<p>Habitual sin without repentance reveals an unchanged heart (<a href="/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>nor is anyone who does not love his brother</b><p>Love is the family resemblance believers must bear. John says, &#8220;We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love our brothers&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>). Jesus calls it His &#8220;new commandment&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>).

True children of God can be recognized by two family traits: ongoing righteousness and active brotherly love. Absence of these traits exposes an unregenerate heart aligned with the devil. The verse is not about earning salvation but about displaying the life that salvation produces. God&#8217;s grace changes both conduct and relationships, marking His people out for a watching world to see.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - The question whether "in this" <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span> refers to what precedes or to what follows is here unimportant, for both are similar in meaning; and "in this" may refer to both. "By their fruits ye shall know them." The children of God do righteousness, and not sin; the children of the devil do sin, and not righteousness. Of course, moral parentage is meant in both cases. Nothing here lends any countenance to the view that the writer is a dualist and inculcates two principles of existence - God and the devil. All, whether good or bad, are God's creatures (<a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>); but while all are his children by creation, some become his children spiritually also, while others become the children of Satan. St. John's "teaching about the devil is not at all agreeable to those who dwell exclusively on the sunny aspects of the world and of life, and would shut their eyes to what is dark and terrible. They like to hear of a Being who is all-gracious and loving; the vision of one who is the enemy of all that is gracious and loving shocks them - they wish to suppose that it belongs to the world's infancy, and that it disappears as we know more" (Maurice). The expression, "the children of the devil," must not be confounded with the Hebraistic expressions, "children of perdition, children of darkness," <span class="accented">"children</span> of light, son of death," "son of perdition," etc. As so often, St. John not only restates the case in a new form, but adds a new thought to it - he that loveth not his brother. This forms the link with the next section (verses 13-24), on brotherly love. Of all failures in doing righteousness this is the most conspicuous - failing to love one's brother. And who is my brother? The answer is the same as to the question, "And who is my neighbour?" Mankind at large. The meaning cannot be limited to the children of God.

Of course, if the Christian must love all men, <span class="accented">a fortiori</span> he must love Christians. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/3-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">By</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
