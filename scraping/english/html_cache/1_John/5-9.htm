The Jewish law required two or three witnesses to confirm a matter (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). This phrase acknowledges the validity of human testimony but sets the stage for a comparison with divine testimony. The early church faced challenges from false teachers, making the reliability of testimony crucial. This phrase suggests that if we trust human witnesses, how much more should we trust God&#8217;s testimony.<p><b>the testimony of God is greater</b><br>God's testimony surpasses human testimony in authority and truthfulness. Throughout Scripture, God&#8217;s words and actions are depicted as infallible and trustworthy (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). The divine testimony is not subject to human error or deceit. This statement emphasizes the superiority of God&#8217;s revelation, particularly in the context of Jesus Christ&#8217;s identity and mission. The greater testimony of God is seen in the fulfillment of prophecies and the resurrection of Jesus, which serve as divine validation of His Son.<p><b>For this is the testimony that God has given about His Son</b><br>The testimony refers to God&#8217;s declaration and affirmation of Jesus as His Son. This is seen at Jesus&#8217; baptism and transfiguration, where God&#8217;s voice from heaven confirms Jesus&#8217; divine sonship (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17, 17</a>:5). The testimony includes the works and miracles of Jesus, His teachings, and ultimately His resurrection, which is the cornerstone of Christian faith (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14</a>).
