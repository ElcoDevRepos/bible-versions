"Water" is often interpreted as His baptism in the Jordan River, marking the beginning of His public ministry (<a href="/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>). "Blood" signifies His crucifixion, the culmination of His redemptive work (<a href="/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a>). These two events are pivotal in the life of Jesus, symbolizing His obedience to the Father and His sacrificial death for humanity's sins. The dual mention emphasizes the completeness of His mission, fulfilling both the requirements of righteousness and atonement.<p><b>Jesus Christ&#8212;not by water alone, but by water and blood</b><br>This clarification underscores that Jesus' mission was not limited to His baptism, which alone would not suffice for salvation. The inclusion of "blood" highlights the necessity of His sacrificial death, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies and typologies of the sacrificial system (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). The dual emphasis refutes early heresies, such as Docetism, which denied the physical reality of Jesus' suffering and death. It affirms the full humanity and divinity of Christ, essential for His role as the mediator between God and man (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><b>And it is the Spirit who testifies to this</b><br>The Holy Spirit's role is to bear witness to the truth of Jesus' identity and work. This testimony is consistent with the Spirit's function throughout Scripture, guiding believers into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>). The Spirit's witness is internal, confirming the believer's faith, and external, through the inspired Scriptures and the proclamation of the Gospel. The Spirit's testimony is reliable and authoritative, providing assurance of the truth of Christ's redemptive work.<p><b>because the Spirit is the truth</b><br>This statement affirms the Spirit's nature as the embodiment of truth, aligning with Jesus' declaration that He is "the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The Spirit's testimony is trustworthy because it originates from the very essence of God, who cannot lie (<a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>). This truth is foundational for the believer's faith, providing certainty in the message of salvation and the person of Jesus Christ. The Spirit's role as the truth also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's faithfulness and the reliability of His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, believed to be the Son of God and the Savior of humanity.

Accepting all three witnesses anchors faith, assures salvation, and fuels confident living in the truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-12.</span> - The section takes a new turn; the test of the Christian life furnished by the witness of the life itself. This witness is that of the Spirit (verse 6), identical with that of God (verse 9), and possessed by every believer (verse 10). Few passages of Scripture have produced such a mass of widely divergent interpretation. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This</span> (Son of God) <span class="cmt_word">is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ.</span> This may be regarded as one of the main propositions of the Epistle - that the eternal Son of God is identical with the historic Person, Jesus. Of the water and the blood widely differing interpretations have been given. It would be tedious and unprofitable to enumerate them. Our estimate of <a href="/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a>, "the most perplexing incident in the Gospel," will probably influence our interpretation of this "the most perplexing passage in the Epistle." Not that we have here any direct reference to the piercing of Christ's side, and its results. Yet both passages teach similar spiritual truths, viz. the ideas which underlie the two sacraments, and teach them by reference to facts in the life and death of Jesus Christ. But the facts are not the same in each case. It is difficult to believe that this passage contains any definite and immediate allusion to <a href="/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a>. Why in that case the marked change of order, "water and blood" instead of "blood and water"? And if it be thought that this is explained by saying that the one is "the ideal, mystical, sacramental, subjective order," the ether "the historical and objective order," and that "the first is appropriately adopted in the Epistle, the second in the Gospel," we are not at the end of our difficulties. If St. John is here referring to the effusions from Christ's dead body, what can be the meaning of "not in water only, but in water and blood"? It was the water, not the blood, that was specially astonishing. And "in" in this case seems a strange expression to use. We should have expected rather, "not shedding blood only, but blood and water." Moreover, how can blood and water flowing from the Lord's body be spoken of his "coming through water and blood"? The simplest interpretation is that which refers <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span> to the baptism of water to which he himself submitted, and which he enjoined upon his disciples, and <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> to the baptism of blood to which he himself submitted, and which raised the baptism of water from a sign into a sacrament. John came baptizing in water only <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="/john/1-31.htm">John 1:31, 33</a>). Jesus came baptizing in water and blood, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in water which washed away sin through the efficacy of his blood. This interpretation explains the marked change of preposition. Jesus effected his work <span class="accented">through</span> the baptisms of water and blood; and it is by baptism in these elements that he comes to his followers. Moreover, this interpretation harmonizes with the polemical purpose of the Epistle, viz. to confute the errors of Cerinthus. Cerinthus taught that the Divine Logos or Christ descended upon Jesus at the baptism, and departed again when Jesus was arrested; so that a mere man was born of Mary, and a mere man suffered on the cross. St. John assures us that there was no such severance. The Divine Son Jesus Christ came not by water only at his baptism, but by blood also at his death. Besides these two abiding witnesses, there is yet a third still more convincing. <span class="cmt_word">And there is the Spirit that beareth witness</span> (to the Divinity of Christ); <span class="cmt_word">because the Spirit is the truth.</span> There can be no higher testimony than that of the truth itself (<a href="/john/14-17.htm">John 14:17</a>; <a href="/john/15-26.htm">John 15:26</a>; <a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>). It is surprising that any one should propose to translate, "The Spirit is that which is witnessing <span class="accented">that</span> the Spirit is the truth." What has this to do with the context? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/5-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#972;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(houtos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
