John, as an elder and eyewitness to Jesus Christ, writes with authority to the early Christian community. His letters are pastoral, aiming to guide and protect believers. The phrase "these things" refers to the preceding teachings and warnings in the letter, emphasizing the importance of abiding in Christ and the truth of the Gospel. This echoes the apostolic tradition of writing to address specific issues within the church, similar to Paul's epistles.<p><b>about those who are trying to deceive you</b><br>John warns against false teachers and antichrists who were prevalent in the early church. These deceivers were likely promoting Gnostic beliefs, which denied the incarnation of Christ and distorted the Gospel message. The cultural context of the time was rife with various philosophical and religious ideas, making the early Christian community vulnerable to such deception. This warning is consistent with other New Testament passages, such as Paul's warnings in <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a> and Peter's in <a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1-3</a>, about false teachers. The call to discernment and adherence to apostolic teaching is a recurring theme, underscoring the importance of truth in the life of a believer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, John was one of Jesus' closest disciples.

His earlier statement, &#8220;We write these things so that our joy may be complete&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-4.htm">1 John 1:4</a>), shows that writing is not casual correspondence; it is divinely commissioned instruction meant to anchor believers in truth, just as his Gospel was written &#8220;so that you may believe&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>).
