This reflects the intimate relationship between the early Christian leaders and their communities. The use of "beloved" is consistent with John's emphasis on love throughout his writings, including the Gospel of John and his epistles.<p><b>I am not writing to you a new commandment,</b><br>John emphasizes continuity with the teachings that the recipients have already received. This suggests that the commandment he refers to is foundational to the Christian faith and not a novel idea. The concept of commandments is deeply rooted in Jewish tradition, where the Law (Torah) was central. John is likely drawing on this tradition to affirm the consistency of God's message.<p><b>but an old one,</b><br>The "old" commandment refers to teachings that have been part of the Christian message from the beginning. This could be a reference to the command to love one another, which Jesus emphasized during His ministry (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>). The idea of an "old" commandment also connects to the continuity of God's revelation from the Old Testament to the New Testament.<p><b>which you have had from the beginning.</b><br>The phrase "from the beginning" can be understood in two ways: the beginning of the readers' Christian experience or the beginning of Jesus' ministry. It underscores the idea that the commandment is not a recent addition but has been integral to the faith since its inception. This continuity is important for establishing the authority and authenticity of the message.<p><b>This commandment is the message you have heard.</b><br>The "message you have heard" indicates that the commandment is not only old but also well-known and taught within the community. This suggests that the commandment is central to the Gospel message and has been consistently communicated by the apostles. The emphasis on hearing aligns with the oral tradition of teaching in the early church, where the spoken word was a primary means of transmitting the faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, likely a community of believers in Asia Minor, facing challenges of false teachings and needing encouragement in their faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_commandment.htm">The Commandment</a></b><br>Refers to the commandment of love, which is central to the teachings of Jesus and foundational to Christian ethics.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_timelessness_of_love.htm">The Timelessness of Love</a></b><br>The commandment to love is not new; it is a timeless truth that has been foundational since the beginning of God's relationship with humanity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consistency_in_christian_living.htm">Consistency in Christian Living</a></b><br>Believers are called to live out the commandment of love consistently, as it is the core of Christian ethics and witness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_tradition.htm">The Role of Tradition</a></b><br>The "old commandment" signifies the importance of holding onto the truths that have been passed down through generations of believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/love_as_a_measure_of_faith.htm">Love as a Measure of Faith</a></b><br>Our adherence to the commandment of love is a reflection of our faith and relationship with God, serving as a measure of our spiritual maturity.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_John_2_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 John 2:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_John_2_7_on_God_s_enduring_commands.htm">How does 1 John 2:7 emphasize the continuity of God's commandments?

Addresses of this kind commonly introduce a fresh division of the subject, main or subordinate. Thus <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> (<a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1, 7</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> (<a href="/1_john/3-13.htm">1 John 3:13</a>). Sometimes, however, they introduce an earnest conclusion (<a href="/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-21.htm">1 John 3:21</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-21.htm">1 John 5:21</a>). In <a href="/1_john/4-11.htm">1 John 4:11</a> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> introduces a conclusion which serves as a fresh starting-point. Not a fresh commandment do I write to you, but an old commandment. Where it can be conveniently done, it is worth while distinguishing <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "fresh," as opposed to "worn out," "obsolete," from <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "new," as opposed to "old, aged." "New wine must be put into <span class="accented">fresh</span> skins" (<a href="/mark/2-22.htm">Mark 2:22</a>). Are two commandments meant - one to cultivate brotherly love, the other to walk as Christ walked? Or is there only one, which from different points of view may be regarded as either new or old? Commentators are divided; but the latter seems better. Then what is the commandment which is at once new and old? The whole gospel, or the command to love one another? <a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a> and John 15:2 will incline us to the latter view. The command was old, for" Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>) was part of the Mosaic Law. But the <span class="accented">standard</span> was new: "Even as I loved you;" "Even as he also walked;" and the <span class="accented">motive</span> was new: because "God so loved us" (<a href="/1_john/4-11.htm">1 John 4:11</a>). Brotherly love, enforced by such an example, and based on such a fact, was a new command as compared with the cold injunction of the Law. <span class="cmt_word">From the beginning</span> may have either of two senses: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from of old, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, long before the Gospel; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from the beginning of your career as Christians. This new and yet old command sums up the practical side of the gospel which had been preached to them from the first.
