It indicates a tone of care and authority, similar to a father guiding his children. The term "little children" is often used in the New Testament to denote believers who are part of God's family (<a href="/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19, 1</a> <a href="/john/3-7.htm">John 3:7</a>). It emphasizes the intimate and nurturing relationship between John and the early Christian community.<p><b>I am writing these things to you so that you will not sin</b><br>John's purpose in writing is to encourage believers to live holy lives. The phrase underscores the importance of striving for righteousness and avoiding sin. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching that believers are called to be holy as God is holy (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). The context of 1 John includes warnings against false teachings and moral laxity, urging believers to adhere to the truth and live in obedience to God's commandments.<p><b>But if anyone does sin</b><br>Acknowledging human fallibility, John provides reassurance for those who fall into sin. This phrase highlights the reality of the Christian life, where believers, though striving for holiness, may still stumble. It reflects the biblical understanding of human nature and the ongoing struggle against sin (<a href="/romans/7-15.htm">Romans 7:15-25</a>). The conditional "if" suggests that sin is not inevitable but possible, and it points to the need for vigilance and reliance on God's grace.<p><b>we have an advocate before the Father</b><br>The term "advocate" (Greek: parakletos) refers to one who comes alongside to help, similar to a legal representative or counselor. In the context of 1 John, Jesus is portrayed as the intercessor who pleads on behalf of believers before God the Father. This advocacy is rooted in Jesus' sacrificial work and ongoing intercession (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). The imagery of a courtroom underscores the seriousness of sin and the necessity of divine intervention for forgiveness.<p><b>Jesus Christ, the Righteous One</b><br>This title emphasizes the sinless nature and moral perfection of Jesus. As the "Righteous One," Jesus is uniquely qualified to be the advocate for sinners, having fulfilled all righteousness (<a href="/matthew/3-15.htm">Matthew 3:15</a>). His righteousness is imputed to believers, allowing them to stand justified before God (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). The title also connects to Old Testament prophecies about the coming Messiah, who would be righteous and bring justice (<a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Referred to as "the Righteous One" and our advocate before the Father, highlighting His role in intercession and His sinless nature.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>God the Father, to whom Jesus Christ acts as an advocate on behalf of believers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_recipients.htm">The Recipients ("My little children")</a></b><br>The early Christian community, whom John addresses with affection and pastoral concern, indicating a close and caring relationship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin.htm">Sin</a></b><br>The moral failing or transgression against God's law, which John acknowledges as a reality but also provides a solution through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_john's_writing.htm">The Purpose of John's Writing</a></b><br>John writes to encourage believers to avoid sin, emphasizing the importance of striving for holiness in daily life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_sin_and_grace.htm">The Reality of Sin and Grace</a></b><br>Acknowledge the reality of sin in the believer's life, but also the provision of grace through Jesus Christ, who advocates on our behalf.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_jesus_as_advocate.htm">The Role of Jesus as Advocate</a></b><br>Jesus' advocacy is a continuous and active role, providing believers with confidence in their relationship with God despite their imperfections.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_righteous_living.htm">The Call to Righteous Living</a></b><br>While grace is available, believers are called to pursue righteousness, reflecting the character of Jesus, the Righteous One.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/assurance_in_christ.htm">Assurance in Christ</a></b><br>Believers can have assurance of their standing before God, not based on their own righteousness, but on the righteousness of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_John_2_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 John 2:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_John_2_1_Avoid_sin_daily_how.htm">How does 1 John 2:1 encourage us to avoid sin in daily life?

It is the doctrine of Reconciliation and Redemption. St. John does not wish them to contemplate with complacency the probability of sinning; but to remember gratefully, in spite of falls, that the Author and Restorer of Light has provided a remedy both for the offence before God, and for its effect on themselves. First comes the principle that we must not sin; second, the admission that we do sin; third, the consolation for actual sin when it is in spite of sincere zeal for sanctification.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">My little children.</span>--Six times in the letter occurs this diminutive of tender and caressing love: <a href="/1_john/2-12.htm" title="I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.">1John 2:12</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1John 2:28</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-18.htm" title="My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.">1John 3:18</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-4.htm" title="You are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.">1John 4:4</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-21.htm" title="Little children, keep yourselves from idols.
