In the Old Testament, God is described as dwelling in unapproachable light (<a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>) and as a spirit (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>). The statement underscores the idea that God, in His full essence, is beyond human perception. Moses, for instance, was only allowed to see God's back (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20-23</a>), highlighting the divine holiness and the limitations of human understanding. This invisibility of God points to the necessity of faith and the revelation of God through Jesus Christ, who is the image of the invisible God (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>).<p><b>but if we love one another,</b><br>The call to love one another is a central theme in the teachings of Jesus and the apostles. This love is agape, a selfless, sacrificial love that reflects God's own love for humanity. In the cultural context of the early church, this command was radical, as it transcended social, ethnic, and religious boundaries. The early Christian communities were known for their love and care for one another, which served as a powerful witness to the surrounding society (<a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>). This love is not merely an emotion but an active choice to seek the good of others.<p><b>God remains in us,</b><br>The indwelling of God is a profound mystery and a promise of the New Covenant. In the Old Testament, God's presence was often associated with the temple or the tabernacle, but through Christ, believers become the temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>). This indwelling signifies a personal and communal relationship with God, made possible through the atoning work of Jesus. It is a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/ezekiel/36-27.htm">Ezekiel 36:27</a>, where God promises to put His Spirit within His people. This presence empowers believers to live out the commandments of God, including the command to love.<p><b>and His love is perfected in us.</b><br>The perfection of God's love in believers indicates a process of maturation and completion. This does not imply flawlessness but rather the fulfillment of God's purpose in us. As believers grow in love, they reflect more of God's character and intentions for humanity. This process is akin to sanctification, where the Holy Spirit works within to conform believers to the image of Christ (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>). The perfecting of love is also a testimony to the world of God's transformative power, as seen in the unity and love within the body of Christ (<a href="/john/17-23.htm">John 17:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, whose unseen nature is highlighted, yet whose presence is manifested through love.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>The recipients of this letter, encouraged to love one another as evidence of God's presence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The community to which John writes, facing challenges of false teachings and needing reassurance of God's love.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Though not mentioned directly in this verse, He is the ultimate revelation of God and the model of divine love.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_unseen_god.htm">The Unseen God</a></b><br>Recognize that while God is invisible, His presence is made known through the love we show to one another.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/manifestation_of_god's_presence.htm">Manifestation of God's Presence</a></b><br>Understand that loving others is a tangible way to experience and demonstrate God's abiding presence in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/perfection_of_love.htm">Perfection of Love</a></b><br>Reflect on how God's love is perfected in us through our actions and relationships, growing more complete as we love others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_of_believers.htm">Community of Believers</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of the Christian community in revealing God's love, as we are called to love one another.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_love.htm">Practical Love</a></b><br>Encourage practical expressions of love in daily life as a testimony of God's work within us.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_John_4_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 John 4:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_show_God_s_love_if_unseen.htm">How can we demonstrate God's love if "no one has ever seen God"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_God_s_love_dwell_within_us.htm">What does it mean for God to "abide in us" through love?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_do_1_John_4_12_and_John_1_18_relate.htm">How does 1 John 4:12 connect with John 1:18 about seeing God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_perfect_God_s_love_daily.htm">In what ways can we perfect God's love in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_love_show_God_s_presence_in_us.htm">How does loving others reflect God's presence within us according to 1 John 4:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_John_4_12_God_s_presence_in_believers.htm">How does 1 John 4:12 define the nature of God's presence among believers?

Why does St. John introduce this statement here? Not, of course, as implying that to love an invisible Being is impossible; but that the only security for genuine and lasting love in such a case is to love that which visibly represents him.

Nor yet vaguely, "the relation of love between us and God;" but, as in <a href="/1_john/2-5.htm">1 John 2:5</a>, our love for him.
