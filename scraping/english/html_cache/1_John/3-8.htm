In biblical context, sin is seen as rebellion against God, and those who live in sin align themselves with the devil, who is the originator of sin. This echoes Jesus' words in <a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>, where He describes the devil as a liar and the father of lies. The concept of being "of the devil" suggests a spiritual lineage or influence, contrasting with being "of God" or "born of God" as seen in 1 <a href="/john/3-9.htm">John 3:9</a>.<p><b>because the devil has been sinning from the very start</b><br>This phrase refers to the devil's role as the instigator of sin, tracing back to the fall of Lucifer as described in <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-15</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/28-12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-17</a>. The devil's rebellion against God marks the beginning of sin in the universe. In the Garden of Eden, the devil, in the form of a serpent, tempted Eve, leading to the fall of humanity (Genesis 3). This historical context underscores the devil's continuous opposition to God's will and his role in perpetuating sin throughout history.<p><b>This is why the Son of God was revealed</b><br>The revelation of the Son of God refers to the incarnation of Jesus Christ, who came to earth to fulfill God's redemptive plan. This aligns with prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a> and <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, which foretold the coming of a Savior. The New Testament frequently emphasizes Jesus' mission to save humanity from sin, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a> and <a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>. The term "revealed" suggests a divine unveiling or manifestation of God's plan through Christ.<p><b>to destroy the works of the devil</b><br>The purpose of Christ's coming is to dismantle the power and influence of the devil. This includes breaking the hold of sin over humanity and offering salvation through His death and resurrection. <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a> describes how Jesus disarmed the powers and authorities, triumphing over them by the cross. The "works of the devil" encompass sin, death, and deception, all of which Jesus came to overcome. This victory is a central theme in Christian theology, highlighting the transformative power of Christ's sacrifice and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_devil.htm">The Devil</a></b><br>A fallen angel who opposes God and is the embodiment of sin and evil.
