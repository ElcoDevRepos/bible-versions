In the biblical context, love is often tied to obedience and faithfulness. This aligns with the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, where love for God is expressed through wholehearted devotion. The love of God is also reflected in the New Testament teachings of Jesus, who stated that the greatest commandment is to love God with all one's heart, soul, and mind (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>).<p><b>that we keep His commandments</b><br>Keeping God's commandments is a central theme throughout Scripture, highlighting the importance of obedience as a response to God's love and grace. In the Old Testament, the Israelites were given the Law as a covenantal guide for living in relationship with God (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus affirmed the continuity of the moral law, emphasizing that love for Him is shown through obedience to His commands (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). This phrase underscores the belief that true faith is evidenced by a life that seeks to align with God's will.<p><b>And His commandments are not burdensome</b><br>This statement reflects the transformative power of God's grace, which enables believers to follow His commandments with joy rather than as a heavy obligation. In contrast to the Pharisaic legalism criticized by Jesus (<a href="/matthew/23-4.htm">Matthew 23:4</a>), the commandments of God are designed for the well-being and flourishing of His people. The Apostle Paul echoes this sentiment in <a href="/romans/7-22.htm">Romans 7:22</a>, where he delights in God's law. The indwelling of the Holy Spirit empowers believers to live out God's commands, making them a source of freedom rather than a burden (<a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth in his writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_communities.htm">Early Christian Communities</a></b><br>The recipients of John's letter, likely composed of various house churches in Asia Minor, facing challenges such as false teachings and the need for assurance in their faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, whose love is expressed through the giving of commandments that are meant to guide believers in their walk with Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_love.htm">Understanding God's Love</a></b><br>God's love is not just an emotion but is demonstrated through His commandments, which are designed for our well-being and spiritual growth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_as_an_expression_of_love.htm">Obedience as an Expression of Love</a></b><br>True love for God is shown through our willingness to obey His commandments, reflecting a heart aligned with His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_god's_commandments.htm">The Nature of God's Commandments</a></b><br>God's commandments are not meant to be a heavy burden but are given to lead us into a life of freedom and joy in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/empowerment_through_the_holy_spirit.htm">Empowerment through the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Believers are empowered by the Holy Spirit to live out God's commandments, making obedience a joyful and possible endeavor.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/contrast_with_legalism.htm">Contrast with Legalism</a></b><br>Unlike legalistic adherence to rules, obedience to God's commandments is rooted in a loving relationship with Him, transforming duty into delight.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_John_5_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 John 5:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Show_love_for_God_by_daily_obedience.htm">How can we demonstrate love for God by keeping His commandments daily?

Love toward God is concrete and measurable, not a vague feeling. It shows itself in action. Jesus said, &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). Throughout Scripture, love is consistently tied to obedience&#8212;see <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a> followed by 6:6-9, and <a href="/1_john/2-5.htm">1 John 2:5</a> where &#8220;whoever keeps His word, truly in him the love of God has been perfected.&#8221; Genuine love for God never stops at sentiment; it moves the heart, mind, and will to align with Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that we keep His commandments</b><p>&#8220;Keep&#8221; is the language of watchful guarding and faithful practice. In daily life this means:<p>&#8226;&#8195;Prioritizing God&#8217;s Word&#8212;letting passages like <a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a> shape decisions.<p>&#8226;&#8195;Submitting every area (thoughts, relationships, finances, speech) to clear directives such as <a href="/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a> and <a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>.<p>&#8226;&#8195;Persisting&#8212;even when culture pushes back (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p>Keeping commands is not optional for believers; it is the normal expression of the new birth (<a href="/1_john/5-1.htm">1 John 5:1-2</a>). Far from legalism, it is life in fellowship with Christ, who perfectly obeyed the Father (<a href="/john/15-10.htm">John 15:10</a>) and now empowers us by His Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And His commandments are not burdensome</b><p>The same God who issues commands supplies grace to fulfill them. Jesus invites, &#8220;My yoke is easy and My burden is light&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-30.htm">Matthew 11:30</a>). Why are they &#8220;not burdensome&#8221;?<p>&#8226;&#8195;We have a new heart (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>) that desires righteousness.<p>&#8226;&#8195;Obedience flows from love, and love delights in pleasing the beloved (<a href="/psalms/40-8.htm">Psalm 40:8</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8195;The Spirit enables what human strength cannot (<a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8195;The commands lead to freedom, not restriction (<a href="/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>).<p>Any heaviness comes from fleshly resistance, not from the commands themselves. When we walk in step with God, obedience is the path of joy and rest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_john/5-3.htm">1 John 5:3</a> teaches that real love for God is demonstrated by ongoing, willing obedience to His Word, and such obedience is a joy rather than a weight because God&#8217;s Spirit and promises make it so.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Reason for the preceding statement. "For the love of God consists in this (<a href="/1_john/4-17.htm">1 John 4:17</a>), that we keep his commandments: and these are not grievous." These are the words, not merely of an inspired apostle, but of an aged man, with a wide experience of life and its difficulties. "Difficult" is a relative term, depending upon the relation between the thing to be done and the powers of the doer of it. The Christian, whose will is united with the will of God, will not find obedience to that will a task. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/5-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#940;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
