The apostles, including John, were chosen by Jesus Christ and empowered by the Holy Spirit to spread the Gospel. This echoes Jesus' words in <a href="/john/15-19.htm">John 15:19</a>, where He distinguishes His followers from the world. The phrase also reflects the concept of spiritual rebirth found in <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-8</a>, where believers are born of God and thus belong to Him.<p><b>Whoever knows God listens to us;</b><br>This statement underscores the relationship between knowing God and accepting apostolic teaching. In the cultural context of the early church, the apostles were the primary source of Christian doctrine. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>, where He describes His sheep as those who hear His voice. The phrase implies that true knowledge of God results in a willingness to accept and adhere to the teachings of His appointed messengers.<p><b>whoever is not from God does not listen to us.</b><br>Here, a clear distinction is made between those who belong to God and those who do not. This reflects the spiritual discernment necessary to recognize true teaching. In <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, Paul explains that the natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God. This phrase also serves as a warning against false teachers and prophets, a prevalent issue in the early church, as seen in <a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>.<p><b>That is how we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deception.</b><br>This concluding phrase provides a criterion for discerning truth from falsehood. The "Spirit of truth" refers to the Holy Spirit, who guides believers into all truth, as promised by Jesus in <a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>. The "spirit of deception" represents false teachings and the influence of the antichrist, as mentioned earlier in 1 <a href="/john/4-3.htm">John 4:3</a>.
