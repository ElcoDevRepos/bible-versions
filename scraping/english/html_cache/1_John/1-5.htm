The message originates from Jesus Christ Himself, underscoring its divine authority. The apostles were chosen to be the primary witnesses of Christ's life, death, and resurrection, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>. The transmission of this message is a fulfillment of the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where the apostles are tasked with spreading the teachings of Jesus. The use of "announce" indicates the public proclamation of this truth, which is central to the mission of the early church.<p><b>God is light,</b><br>The metaphor of light is rich in biblical symbolism. Light represents purity, holiness, and truth. In the Old Testament, light is often associated with God's presence and guidance, as seen in <a href="/psalms/27.htm">Psalm 27:1</a> and <a href="/isaiah/60-19.htm">Isaiah 60:19</a>. The concept of God as light is also a direct contrast to the darkness of sin and evil. In the New Testament, Jesus refers to Himself as the "light of the world" (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), indicating His role in revealing God's truth and providing spiritual illumination. This phrase underscores the nature of God as inherently good and morally perfect.<p><b>and in Him there is no darkness at all.</b><br>Darkness symbolizes sin, evil, and ignorance. The complete absence of darkness in God highlights His absolute holiness and the impossibility of sin coexisting with Him. This is consistent with the biblical theme that God is unchanging and wholly righteous (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). The phrase also serves as a call to believers to walk in the light, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8</a>, where Christians are urged to live as "children of light." The stark contrast between light and darkness in this passage serves as a moral and spiritual guide for the Christian life, encouraging believers to reject sin and embrace the truth of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Christ and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, described as "Light," symbolizing purity, holiness, and truth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The recipients of John's letter, who were facing challenges from false teachings and needed reassurance of the truth of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_nature_as_light.htm">God's Nature as Light</a></b><br>God's essence is pure, holy, and without any trace of evil or deceit.

The reading <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="/1_john/2-25.htm">1 John 2:25</a>, and frequent in the New Testament) must be rejected here and in <a href="/1_john/3-11.htm">1 John 3:11</a> in favour of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (which occurs nowhere else in the New Testament), on overwhelming evidence. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in the New Testament means "promise," which would be almost meaningless here. The change from <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> (verses 2, 3) to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is noteworthy: the one is "declare," the other "announce." The message received from Christ, the apostle announces or <span class="accented">reports</span> (<span class="accented">renunciat</span>) to his readers. He does not <span class="accented">name</span> Christ <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; he is so full of the thought of Christ that he omits to name him (cf. <a href="/john/20-7.htm">John 20:7, 9, 15</a>). <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> is used of <span class="accented">authoritative</span> announcements; of priests and Levites in the LXX; of the Messiah (<a href="/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>); of the Spirit (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13, 14, 15</a>); of the apostles (<a href="/acts/20-20.htm">Acts 20:20, 27</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>). St. John speaks with authority. <span class="cmt_word">God is light;</span> not <span class="accented">the</span> Light, nor a light, but light; that is his <span class="accented">nature.</span> This sums up the Divine essence on its intellectual side, as "God is love" on its moral side. In neither case has the predicate the article: <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>. Light and love are not attributes of God, but himself. The connexion between this message and the introduction is not at first obvious. But St. John writes with his Gospel before him, and the prologue to that supplies the link. There, as here, three ideas follow in order: <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>. There, as here, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> immediately suggests its opposite, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. It is on the revelation of the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, and the consequent struggle between <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, that the Gospel is based. And this revelation is the highest: men alone are competent to receive or reject it. Other organisms exhibit the creative power as life: none but men can recognize it as light. And to know the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as light is to know the Father as light; for the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is the Revelation of the Father's nature. That God is, in his very nature, light, is an announcement peculiar to St. John. Others tell us that he is the Father of lights (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>), the Possessor of light (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), dwelling in light (<a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>); but not that he is light. To the heathen God is a God of darkness, an unknown Being; a Power to be blindly propitiated, not a Person to be known and loved. To the philosopher he is an abstraction, an idea, not directly cognizable by man. To the Jews he is a God who hideth himself; not light, but a consuming fire. To the Christian alone he is revealed as light, absolutely free from everything impure, material, obscure, and gloomy. Light was the first product of the Divine creative energy, the earnest and condition of order, beauty, life, growth, and joy. Of all phenomena it best represents the elements of all perfection. "This word 'light' is at once the simplest and the fullest and the deepest which can be used in human discourse. It is addressed to every man who has eyes and who has ever looked on the sun." It tells not only "of a Goodness and Truth without flaw; it tells of a Goodness and Truth that are always seeking to spread themselves, to send forth rays that shall penetrate everywhere, and scatter the darkness which opposes them" (Maurice). In like manner, darkness sums up the elements of evil - foulness, secrecy, repulsiveness, and gloom. In all but the lowest forms of existence it inevitably produces decay and death. Everything of the kind is excluded from the nature of God. And hence St. John, in his characteristic manner, immediately emphasizes the great announcement with an equivalent negative statement: <span class="cmt_word">Darkness in him there is not any at all</span> (comp. verse 8; <a href="/1_john/2-4.htm">1 John 2:4, 23, 27</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-6.htm">1 John 3:6</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-2.htm">1 John 4:2, 3, 6-8</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12</a>). He does not say, "in his presence," but "in him." Darkness exists, physical, intellectual, moral, and spiritual; there is abundance of obscurity, error, depravity, sin, and its consequence, death. But not a shade of these is "in him." The Divine Light is subject to no spots, no eclipse, no twilight, no night; as a Source of light it cannot in any degree fail. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/1-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">this</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8021;&#964;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(haut&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
