In the context of 1 John, fellowship implies a deep, intimate connection with God, akin to the relationship between the Father and the Son. The concept of fellowship is rooted in the Greek word "koinonia," which signifies partnership and shared life. Biblically, true fellowship with God is characterized by walking in His light and truth, as seen in <a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>, where abiding in Christ is essential for spiritual fruitfulness.<p><b>yet walk in the darkness</b><br>Walking in darkness symbolizes living in sin and moral error, contrary to God's nature, which is light (1 <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>). In biblical terms, darkness often represents ignorance, evil, and separation from God (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-21</a>). The cultural context of the time emphasized the stark contrast between light and darkness, a common theme in Jewish and early Christian teachings. Walking in darkness suggests a lifestyle inconsistent with the teachings of Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8-11</a>, where believers are called to live as children of light.<p><b>we lie</b><br>This phrase indicates a deliberate falsehood or self-deception. Claiming fellowship with God while living in sin is a contradiction, as God is holy and cannot be associated with darkness (<a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>). The historical context of the early church involved confronting false teachings and hypocrisy, as seen in the warnings against false prophets and teachers in <a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1-3</a>. The apostle John emphasizes the importance of truthfulness in one's relationship with God.<p><b>and do not practice the truth</b><br>Practicing the truth involves living according to God's commandments and teachings. The Greek word for "practice" implies continuous action, suggesting that truth must be a consistent part of a believer's life. This aligns with <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, which urges believers to be doers of the word, not merely hearers. The truth is central to the Christian faith, as Jesus declared Himself to be "the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).

When a person speaks this claim, others rightly expect to see a family resemblance (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Yet walk in the darkness</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Walk&#8221; in the New Testament refers to habitual conduct. Darkness stands for sin, ignorance, and opposition to God (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus contrasts true discipleship with darkness: &#8220;I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in the darkness&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul echoes the same call: &#8220;For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Continuing patterns of unrighteousness&#8212;malice, impurity, deceit&#8212;expose a life still aligned with the realm Christ came to overthrow (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We lie</b><p>&#8226; John does not soften the verdict.

Aligning with falsehood places a person on dangerous spiritual ground.<p>&#8226; God detests lying lips (<a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>), and the early church learned this sober truth through Ananias: &#8220;You have not lied to men, but to God!&#8221; (<a href="/acts/5-3.htm">Acts 5:3&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And do not practice the truth</b><p>&#8226; Truth in Scripture is not only believed, it is practiced. &#8220;Be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p>&#8226; A life ruled by truth is visible: &#8220;Whoever practices the truth comes into the Light&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-21.htm">John 3:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Walking in truth is the mark that delights God: &#8220;I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth&#8221; (<a href="/3_john/1-4.htm">3 John 1:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus links love and obedience inseparably: &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). Only those who live out what they profess demonstrate genuine fellowship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6</a> warns that verbal claims to a relationship with God are empty when separated from a lifestyle reflecting His light.

To have communion with him who is Light, and be continually exhibiting a life of darkness, is impossible. The Carpocratians and other Gnostics, who taught that to the enlightened all action is indifferent, because neither purity nor filth can change the nature of pure gold, are perhaps here aimed at (Mansel, 'Gnostic Heresies,' pages 117-121). <span class="cmt_word">We lie, and do not the truth.</span> As in verse 5, St. John enforces a statement by denying the opposite.
