The concept of passing from death to life is rooted in the spiritual rebirth described in <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-7</a>, where Jesus speaks to Nicodemus about being "born again." This transformation is not merely a future hope but a present reality for believers, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2.htm">Ephesians 2:1-5</a>, where Paul describes believers as being made alive with Christ. The imagery of death to life also echoes the resurrection of Jesus, symbolizing the believer's participation in His victory over sin and death.<p><b>because we love our brothers</b><br>Love for fellow believers is a hallmark of genuine faith and a key theme in John's writings. This love is not just an emotion but an active, selfless commitment to the well-being of others, as demonstrated by Jesus in <a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>, where He commands His disciples to love one another as He has loved them. The early Christian community, as described in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>, exemplified this love through their communal living and sharing. This love serves as evidence of the believer's new life in Christ and is a fulfillment of the commandment to love one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>).<p><b>The one who does not love remains in death</b><br>This phrase underscores the seriousness of failing to love others, equating it with spiritual death. In 1 <a href="/john/4-8.htm">John 4:8</a>, John states that "God is love," implying that those who do not love are disconnected from God's nature. The absence of love indicates a lack of transformation and a continued state of spiritual death, as described in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>, where the wages of sin is death. This warning serves as a call to self-examination for believers, urging them to reflect on their relationships and ensure that their lives reflect the love of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth in his writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_community.htm">Early Christian Community</a></b><br>The recipients of John's letter, likely a group of believers facing challenges from false teachings and needing reassurance of their faith and identity in Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to the message of love and life, as His life, death, and resurrection are the foundation for the transition from death to life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/evidence_of_spiritual_life.htm">Evidence of Spiritual Life</a></b><br>Love for fellow believers is a tangible sign of having passed from spiritual death to life.

The love of the brethren is the cause, not of the passing over, but of our knowing it. It proves that we have passed. And this test every one can apply to himself; "Do I, or do I not, find the love of the brethren within me?" A Christian can no more live without love than a plant can live without growth. He that loveth not abideth in death: he has not made the passage over. There is no accusative after "loveth," <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> being a gloss.
