This concept is rooted in Old Testament practices where prophets, priests, and kings were anointed with oil as a sign of being set apart for God's service (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). In the New Testament, the Holy Spirit is the fulfillment of this anointing, signifying God's presence and empowerment within believers (<a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>). The phrase "remains in you" emphasizes the permanence of the Holy Spirit's indwelling, aligning with Jesus' promise in <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a> that the Spirit will be with believers forever.<p><b>and you do not need anyone to teach you</b><br>This does not dismiss the role of teachers within the church, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-12</a>, but highlights the sufficiency of the Holy Spirit in guiding believers into truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>). The context of 1 John addresses false teachings and antichrists (1 <a href="/john/2-18.htm">John 2:18-19</a>), reassuring believers that the Spirit provides discernment and understanding, protecting them from deception.<p><b>But just as His true and genuine anointing teaches you about all things</b><br>The "true and genuine anointing" underscores the authenticity and reliability of the Holy Spirit's guidance. This echoes Jesus' promise in <a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a> that the Holy Spirit will teach and remind believers of all He has said. The phrase "all things" suggests comprehensive guidance, not limited to spiritual matters but encompassing all aspects of life, aligning with the wisdom literature's emphasis on God's guidance (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><b>so remain in Him as you have been taught</b><br>"Remain in Him" is a call to abide in Christ, a theme prevalent in John's writings (<a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-7</a>). This abiding relationship is characterized by obedience, love, and faithfulness, ensuring spiritual growth and protection against false teachings. The phrase "as you have been taught" points to the apostolic teaching received by the early church, rooted in the teachings of Jesus and the apostles (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>), serving as a foundation for faith and practice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Christ and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_recipients_of_1_john.htm">The Recipients of 1 John</a></b><br>Early Christians, likely in Asia Minor, facing challenges from false teachings and needing reassurance of their faith and understanding of the truth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals who were spreading incorrect doctrines, particularly those denying the incarnation of Christ, which John addresses throughout his epistle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_anointing.htm">The Anointing</a></b><br>Refers to the Holy Spirit, given to believers, who guides them into all truth and confirms their understanding of the gospel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, who indwells believers, providing guidance, teaching, and assurance of their faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit is our primary teacher, guiding us into all truth and helping us discern false teachings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/confidence_in_the_anointing.htm">Confidence in the Anointing</a></b><br>Believers can have confidence in the anointing they have received, knowing it is genuine and sufficient for understanding spiritual truths.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_against_false_teachings.htm">Discernment Against False Teachings</a></b><br>With the Holy Spirit's guidance, believers can discern and reject false teachings that contradict the core truths of the gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/abiding_in_christ.htm">Abiding in Christ</a></b><br>Remaining in Christ involves continually relying on the Holy Spirit's teaching and living in accordance with the truth we have received.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_teaching.htm">Community and Teaching</a></b><br>While the Holy Spirit is our ultimate teacher, the community of believers and sound biblical teaching are still valuable for growth and accountability.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_John_2_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 John 2:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_Holy_Spirit_s_anointing.htm">How does 1 John 2:27 describe the role of the Holy Spirit's anointing?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Implication_of_self-sufficiency_for_believers.htm">What does "you do not need anyone to teach you" imply for believers?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_do_we_stay_in_Him_per_1_John_2_27.htm">How can we ensure we "remain in Him" as instructed in 1 John 2:27?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Compare_1_John_2_27_John_14_26.htm">Compare the anointing in 1 John 2:27 with John 14:26.

The emphatic <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> again marks the emphatic contrast between St. John's readers and the antichrists. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> means "from Christ" (verse 20). The indicative <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> states what <span class="accented">ought</span> to be true of them, and is a delicate equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> (verse 24). The anointing of Christ <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> abides with them as a permanent gift, and renders further apostolic teaching unnecessary. It is quite a mistake to suppose that the superfluous teaching refers to the antichrists. The ideal to which the Christian must aspire is the being led into all truth by the Spirit; he will need no human teachers then (see the remarkable parallel to this in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, and the quotation of it in <a href="/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10, 11</a>). The construction in the middle of the verse is amphibolous. We may take <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;</span> either as the apodosis of <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3c2;</span> ("as his anointing teacheth you... so it is true") or as a continuation of the protasis, which is resumed by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span> ("as his anointing teacheth you... and is true... and even as"). Thereafter is better. The emphatic "and is no lie" is thoroughly Johannine (see on verse 23). The conclusion of the verse is doubtful also. The reading <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is certainly preferable to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>; but <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> may be indicative like <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> in the first clause, or imperative like <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> in the next verse. The latter is more probable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/2-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[as for] you,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hymeis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
