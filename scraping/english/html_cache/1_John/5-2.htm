The "children of God" refers to those who have been born again through faith in Jesus Christ. The concept of being children of God is rooted in passages like <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>, which speaks of those who receive Christ being given the right to become children of God. The assurance of love is not based on feelings but on observable actions and obedience to God's commands. This reflects the communal aspect of the early church, where love for one another was a defining characteristic (<a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>).<p><b>when we love God</b><br>Loving God is the foundational commandment in both the Old and New Testaments. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a> commands, "Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength." Jesus reiterates this as the greatest commandment in <a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-38</a>. The love for God is not merely emotional but involves a commitment to His will and purposes. In the historical context of the early church, this love was often tested by persecution and societal pressures, yet it remained the core of Christian identity and practice.<p><b>and keep His commandments.</b><br>Obedience to God's commandments is a tangible expression of love for Him. This echoes Jesus' words in <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>, "If you love Me, you will keep My commandments." The commandments refer not only to the moral laws found in the Old Testament but also to the teachings of Jesus and the apostles. In the cultural context of the time, keeping God's commandments set believers apart from the surrounding pagan practices and demonstrated their allegiance to Christ. This obedience is not legalistic but is empowered by the Holy Spirit, who enables believers to live according to God's will (<a href="/romans/8-4.htm">Romans 8:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/children_of_god.htm">Children of God</a></b><br>Refers to believers in Christ who are born of God, emphasizing the familial relationship among Christians.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, whose commandments are to be kept as an expression of love.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/commandments.htm">Commandments</a></b><br>The laws and teachings given by God, which are to be followed by believers as a demonstration of their love for Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/love_and_obedience_are_inseparable.htm">Love and Obedience are Inseparable</a></b><br>True love for God is demonstrated through obedience to His commandments.

He is not leaving believers to guess about their standing; he offers a clear test. Similar phrases appear earlier: &#8220;By this we will know that we belong to the truth&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-19.htm">1 John 3:19</a>) and Jesus&#8217; own promise, &#8220;By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you love one another&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>). The pattern is consistent: genuine faith produces observable evidence. Paul echoes this call to self-examination in <a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>. The Spirit uses such markers to settle our hearts and silence doubt.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that we love the children of God</b><p>The focus narrows to our brothers and sisters in Christ. John has already said, &#8220;We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love our brothers&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>). Love for fellow believers is not optional; it is family DNA. If someone claims to love God yet harbors hostility toward a sibling in Christ, &#8220;he is a liar&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/4-20.htm">1 John 4:20&#8211;21</a>). Jesus grounded the same truth: &#8220;This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-12.htm">John 15:12</a>). Real affection, practical care, and sacrificial service toward God&#8217;s family verify the reality of salvation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when we love God</b><p>How do we know our love for the church is authentic? It must flow from a deeper fountain&#8212;love for God Himself. The first and greatest commandment still stands: &#8220;You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; see also <a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>). When the vertical relationship is healthy, the horizontal naturally follows. Jesus said, &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>). Our affection for Him motivates every other act of love.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and keep His commandments</b><p>Love is never mere sentiment. John completes the test: love for God expresses itself in obedience. Jesus made the link unmistakable: &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). John repeats it: &#8220;By this we can be sure that we have come to know Him: if we keep His commandments&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3&#8211;5</a>). Obedience is not earning salvation; it is evidence of it. James adds that faith without works &#8220;is dead&#8221; (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p>Practical checkpoints:<p>&#8226; Does my love for believers cost me time, resources, or comfort?<p>&#8226; Is my devotion to God deepening through worship, Scripture, and prayer?<p>&#8226; Are there clear steps of obedience I am taking because His Word says so, not because they are convenient?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_john/5-2.htm">1 John 5:2</a> teaches that genuine assurance springs from a threefold cord: love for God, obedience to His commands, and sacrificial love for His children. These elements are inseparable; each validates the other. When they are present and growing, we can confidently &#8220;know&#8221; that the life and love of God truly reside in us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - Another mark by which we can test our love towards the brethren.
