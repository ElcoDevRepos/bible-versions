This belief is not merely intellectual assent but involves trust and reliance on Jesus as Savior and Lord. The "testimony within him" refers to the internal witness of the Holy Spirit, affirming the truth of the Gospel (<a href="/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16</a>). This internal testimony is a fulfillment of the promise of the New Covenant, where God writes His laws on the hearts of believers (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>). The concept of testimony is rooted in Jewish legal practices, where two or three witnesses were required to establish truth (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). Here, the believer's internal witness aligns with the external testimony of Scripture and the historical reality of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection.<p><b>whoever does not believe God has made Him out to be a liar,</b><br>This phrase underscores the seriousness of unbelief. To reject the testimony of God concerning His Son is to accuse God of falsehood. This is a grave sin, as it challenges the very nature of God, who is truth (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The language here echoes the Old Testament, where disbelief in God's promises was equated with rebellion (<a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>). In the cultural context of the first century, calling someone a liar was a severe accusation, often leading to social and legal consequences. Thus, the rejection of God's testimony is not a trivial matter but a fundamental denial of His character and revelation.<p><b>because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given about His Son.</b><br>The testimony God has given about His Son includes the prophetic writings of the Old Testament, the witness of John the Baptist (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29-34</a>), the miracles and teachings of Jesus (<a href="/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>), and the apostolic witness (<a href="/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32</a>). This testimony is comprehensive, involving both divine revelation and historical events. The phrase highlights the continuity of God's redemptive plan, fulfilled in Jesus Christ. The refusal to believe this testimony is a rejection of the entire biblical narrative, from the promises made to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>) to their fulfillment in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>). This disbelief is not merely a personal choice but a rejection of the divine narrative that spans history and culminates in the person and work of Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Referred to as the "Son of God" in this verse, central to the testimony that believers hold within themselves.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The one who provides the testimony about His Son, Jesus Christ, and whose truth is either accepted or rejected by individuals.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>Those who accept the testimony of God about Jesus and have this truth within them.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/non-believers.htm">Non-believers</a></b><br>Those who reject God's testimony, effectively calling God a liar by their unbelief.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_belief.htm">The Importance of Belief</a></b><br>Belief in Jesus as the Son of God is foundational to the Christian faith.

The former is obscure in meaning; the latter, though probably correct as an interpretation, is inaccurate as a translation, for the better reading is <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>. But <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> may be reflexive. The believer in the Incarnation has the Divine testimony in his heart, and it abides with him as an additional source of evidence, supplementing and confirming the external evidence. In its daily experience, the soul finds ever fresh proof that the declaration, "This is my beloved Son," is true. But even without this internal corroboration, the external evidence suffices, and he who rejects it makes God a liar; for it is God who presents the evidence, and presents it as sufficient and true. The second half of the verse is <span class="accented">parenthetical, to</span> show that the unbeliever, though be has no witness in himself, is not therefore excused. In verse 11 we return to the main proposition at the beginning of verse 10. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/5-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Whoever</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
