The term "behold" is a call to attention, emphasizing the importance of understanding the depth and quality of divine love. The love of the Father is not earned but given, highlighting the grace and generosity inherent in God's nature. This love is reminiscent of the covenantal love God showed Israel, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a>, where God's choice of Israel is based on His love and faithfulness, not their merit.<p><b>that we should be called children of God</b><br>Being called "children of God" signifies a profound transformation in identity and status. This concept is rooted in the idea of adoption, a legal practice in Roman culture where an adopted child received the same rights and inheritance as a biological child. This spiritual adoption is echoed in <a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15-17</a>, where believers receive the Spirit of sonship and become heirs with Christ. It underscores the intimate relationship believers have with God, moving from creation to family.<p><b>And that is what we are!</b><br>This affirmation reinforces the reality of the believer's new identity. It is not merely a title but a present reality. The certainty of this statement reflects the assurance of salvation and the transformative power of God's love. This echoes <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>, where those who receive Christ are given the right to become children of God, emphasizing the legitimacy and permanence of this new identity.<p><b>The reason the world does not know us</b><br>The world, in this context, refers to the system of values and beliefs opposed to God. The lack of recognition from the world is due to a fundamental difference in nature and allegiance. This is consistent with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-19</a>, where He explains that the world hates His followers because they are not of the world, just as He is not. This distinction highlights the believer's separation from worldly values and the spiritual blindness of those who do not know God.<p><b>is that it did not know Him</b><br>The world's failure to recognize believers is rooted in its failure to recognize God Himself. This reflects the spiritual ignorance and rejection of God that is prevalent in human history. In <a href="/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10-11</a>, it is noted that Jesus came into the world He created, yet the world did not recognize Him. This lack of recognition is a recurring theme in Scripture, illustrating the spiritual blindness that can only be overcome through divine revelation and the work of the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, one of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The source of the love bestowed upon believers, calling them His children.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/children_of_god.htm">Children of God</a></b><br>Refers to believers who have received God's love and are identified as His children.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Represents those who do not recognize or understand the identity and relationship believers have with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Implied in the text as the one whom the world did not know, leading to their lack of understanding of believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_magnitude_of_god's_love.htm">The Magnitude of God's Love</a></b><br>Reflect on the depth and quality of God's love that allows us to be called His children.
