The "light" symbolizes truth, purity, and the presence of God, as seen in <a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4-5</a>, where Jesus is described as the light of men. The claim to be "in the light" suggests a profession of faith or a declaration of living according to God's truth. In the cultural context of the early church, claiming to be in the light would mean aligning oneself with the teachings of Jesus and the apostles, distinguishing oneself from the darkness of sin and ignorance.<p><b>but hates his brother</b><br>Hatred towards a brother, in this context, refers to animosity or lack of love towards fellow believers. The term "brother" is often used in the New Testament to denote fellow Christians, emphasizing the familial bond within the body of Christ. This phrase highlights the inconsistency between professing to live in the light and harboring hatred, which contradicts the commandment to love one another as seen in <a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>. The cultural and historical context of the early church, which faced divisions and false teachings, underscores the importance of love and unity among believers.<p><b>he is still in the darkness</b><br>Being "in the darkness" signifies living in sin, ignorance, or separation from God. Despite any claims to the contrary, harboring hatred is evidence of remaining in spiritual darkness. This echoes the dualistic themes found throughout John's writings, where light and darkness are used to contrast truth and falsehood, righteousness and sin. Theologically, this serves as a warning that genuine faith is evidenced by love and obedience, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/1-6.htm">John 1:6-7</a>, where walking in the light is associated with fellowship and cleansing from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 1 John, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Jesus and his emphasis on love and truth in his writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_community.htm">Early Christian Community</a></b><br>The audience of John's letter, likely composed of believers in Asia Minor facing challenges from false teachings and internal divisions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals who were spreading incorrect doctrines and causing confusion and division within the early church.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_light.htm">The Light</a></b><br>A metaphor for living in truth, righteousness, and fellowship with God, often used by John to describe the presence and influence of God in a believer's life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/darkness.htm">Darkness</a></b><br>Symbolizes sin, ignorance, and separation from God, representing a life not aligned with God's truth and love.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_incompatibility_of_light_and_hatred.htm">The Incompatibility of Light and Hatred</a></b><br>Claiming to be in the light while harboring hatred is contradictory.

And as He, by being the propitiation for the sins of the whole world, had declared the universality of God's family and kingdom, so the sympathy of believers would extend in different degrees as far as the whole human race; to those first who were conscious of the same hopes as themselves; to those next who might be brought to share them; to those, perhaps, in a less degree, who in every nation feared God and worked righteousness without knowing the Saviour personally; and so on, finally, to all who did not wilfully excommunicate themselves. But the brotherly love would be chiefly amongst Christian friends, else it would be diffused into nothingness.<p>(9) <span class= "bld">He that saith . . .</span>--The whole history of religious rancour has been a deplorable illustration of these words. Controversy for principles honestly and reasonably held is one thing: prejudice, spite, private censures and condemnations, harsh words, suspicions, jealousies, misunderstandings and misrepresentations are the chief props of the kingdom of darkness among Christian churches and nations.

These verses set forth in a variety of forms the affinity between love and light, hatred and darkness, and the consequent incompatibility between hatred and light. "Hate" <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is not to be watered down into "neglect" or "fail to love." St. John knows nothing of such compromises. Love is love, and hate is hate, and between the two there is no neutral ground, any more than between life and death, or between Christ and antichrist. "He that is not with me is against me." "Love is the moral counterpart of intellectual light. It is a modern fashion to represent these two tempers as necessarily opposed. But St. John is at once earnestly dogmatic and earnestly philanthropic; for the Incarnation has taught him both the preciousness of man and the preciousness of truth" (Liddon). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that saith.</span> For the fifth time St. John points out a glaring inconsistency which is possible between profession and fact (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c0;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6, 8, 10</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="/1_john/2-4.htm">1 John 2:4</a>.9); cf. <a href="/1_john/4-20.htm">1 John 4:20</a>. In all these passages the case is put hypothetically; but in some of the Gnostic teaching of the age this inconsistency existed beyond a doubt. Is in darkness even until now. His supposing that hatred is compatible with light proves the darkness in which he is. Nay, more, it shows that, in spite of his having nominally entered the company of the children of light, he has really never left the darkness. "If ye loved only your brethren, ye would not yet be perfect; but if ye hate your brethren, what are ye? where are ye?" (St. Augustine). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_john/2-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If anyone</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
