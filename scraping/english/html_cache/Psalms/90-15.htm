The psalmist acknowledges God's sovereignty in allowing affliction, which is a common theme throughout the Old Testament, where God uses trials to discipline and refine His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-5.htm">Deuteronomy 8:5</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>). The request for gladness equal to the days of affliction suggests a desire for divine justice and mercy, reminiscent of Job's restoration (<a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>). Theologically, it underscores the belief in God's ability to transform suffering into joy, a theme echoed in the New Testament (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><b>for as many years as we have seen evil</b><br>This part of the verse acknowledges the prolonged experience of hardship and evil, which can be understood in the context of Israel's history, such as the years of wandering in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>) or the Babylonian exile (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>). The mention of "years" indicates a significant period, suggesting that the community has endured long-term suffering. Theologically, it points to the hope for redemption and restoration, a promise seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a>, where God promises a double portion of blessing for former shame. This longing for deliverance and restoration is ultimately fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus Christ, who brings eternal joy and redemption (<a href="/john/16-20.htm">John 16:20-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/90.htm">Psalm 90</a>, Moses is a central figure in the Old Testament, known for leading the Israelites out of Egypt and receiving the Ten Commandments from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, who experienced both the afflictions of slavery in Egypt and the trials during their wilderness journey, are the primary audience and context for this Psalm.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness_wanderings.htm">Wilderness Wanderings</a></b><br>The 40-year period during which the Israelites wandered in the desert, experiencing both God's discipline and His provision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_affliction.htm">Understanding Affliction</a></b><br>Recognize that afflictions are part of God's sovereign plan and can lead to spiritual growth and maturity.
