It is a call to worship and a declaration of praise. The use of "Hallelujah" in the Psalms often marks a transition to a section of praise and thanksgiving. It is a reminder of the communal aspect of worship, inviting all believers to join in glorifying God. This phrase is used throughout the Psalms and is a precursor to its use in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>, where it is associated with the ultimate victory and celebration in heaven.<p><b>Give thanks to the LORD,</b><br>Thanksgiving is a central theme in the Psalms, reflecting the importance of gratitude in the believer's life. The act of giving thanks is not just a response to God's blessings but a recognition of His sovereignty and goodness. In the historical context, Israelites expressed gratitude through sacrifices and offerings at the temple, as well as through psalms and hymns. This phrase encourages believers to maintain a posture of thankfulness, acknowledging God's provision and care in all circumstances.<p><b>for He is good;</b><br>The goodness of God is a foundational attribute in Scripture, affirming His moral perfection and benevolence. This phrase echoes the declaration in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, where God reveals His character to Moses. The goodness of God is a source of comfort and assurance for believers, as it implies that His actions and plans are always for the ultimate benefit of His people. This concept is further explored in the New Testament, where Jesus embodies the goodness of God through His life and ministry.<p><b>His loving devotion endures forever.</b><br>The Hebrew word for "loving devotion" is "chesed," often translated as "steadfast love" or "mercy." It signifies God's covenantal faithfulness and unwavering commitment to His people. This enduring love is a recurring theme in the Psalms and is central to the understanding of God's relationship with Israel. The phrase "endures forever" emphasizes the eternal nature of God's love, which is not subject to change or decay. This assurance of God's perpetual love is fulfilled in the New Testament through the person and work of Jesus Christ, who embodies God's eternal covenant with humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature.

It is derived from the Hebrew "halal" (to praise) and "Yah" (a shortened form of Yahweh). This call to worship is not just an invitation but a directive for believers to actively engage in praising God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/thanksgiving_as_a_lifestyle.htm">Thanksgiving as a Lifestyle</a></b><br>Giving thanks to the LORD should be a continual practice for believers. Recognizing God's goodness in our daily lives helps cultivate a heart of gratitude and aligns us with His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_goodness.htm">Understanding God's Goodness</a></b><br>The Hebrew word for "good" (tov) encompasses moral goodness, kindness, and benevolence.

The precise date of its first appearance cannot be ascertained. The chronicler includes it in the compilation from different psalms, which he introduces as sung when the Ark was brought to Zion (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-34.htm" title="O give thanks to the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy endures for ever.">1Chronicles 16:34</a>): and represents it not only as chanted by the procession of priests and Levites, but as bursting spontaneously from the lips of the assembled multitudes at the dedication of Solomon's Temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-3.htm" title="And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD on the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endures for ever.">2Chronicles 7:3</a>). He mentions it also in connection with Jehoshaphat's revival of choral music. And it is probable that he was not guilty of any great anachronism in giving it this early existence; for Jeremiah speaks of it as a refrain as familiar as those customary at weddings (<a href="/jeremiah/33-11.htm" title="The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy endures for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 33:11</a>), and, indeed, foretells its revival as of a practice once common, but long disused. But the fact that it is found in four liturgical hymns, besides Psalms 136, where it becomes a refrain after every verse, as well <span class= "ital">as </span>its express mention in <a href="/ezra/3-11.htm" title="And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks to the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endures for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.">Ezra 3:11</a> as used at the dedication of the second Temple, shows that its use became more general after the Captivity; and it was in use in the Maccabaean period (<a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/4-24.htm" title="After this they went home, and sung a song of thanksgiving, and praised the Lord in heaven: because it is good, because his mercy endureth forever.">1 Maccabees 4:24</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/106.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Praise ye the Lord</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/104-35.htm">Psalm 104:35</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-45.htm">Psalm 105:45</a>). <span class="cmt_word">O give thanks unto the Lord</span> (so in <a href="/psalms/105-1.htm">Psalm 105:1</a>).
