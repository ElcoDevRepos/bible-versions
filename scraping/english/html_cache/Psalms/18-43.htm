Historically, David faced numerous internal challenges, including opposition from Saul and later from his own son Absalom. The "strife of the people" can be seen as the internal discord and rebellion within Israel. This deliverance is a testament to God's faithfulness in protecting His anointed. It echoes the broader biblical theme of God as a deliverer, seen in the Exodus narrative where God delivers Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>). Theologically, it underscores the belief in God's sovereignty over human affairs and His ability to bring peace amidst turmoil.<p><b>You have made me the head of nations;</b><br>This phrase signifies the elevation of David's status beyond Israel. Historically, David's military conquests expanded Israel's influence, making it a dominant power in the region. This fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be a blessing to all nations (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>) is seen in David's reign. Theologically, it prefigures the messianic kingdom where Christ, a descendant of David, is recognized as the King of Kings (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>). This phrase also highlights the theme of divine appointment and the idea that true leadership is established by God.<p><b>a people I had not known shall serve me.</b><br>This phrase indicates the submission of foreign nations to David's rule, which historically occurred as David expanded his kingdom. It reflects the ancient Near Eastern context where conquering kings often ruled over diverse peoples. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who draws all nations to Himself (<a href="/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32</a>). Theologically, it points to the inclusivity of God's kingdom, where people from every tribe and tongue will worship Him (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>). This phrase also emphasizes the unexpected nature of God's plans, where those outside the covenant community are brought into service and relationship with the covenant God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David is expressing gratitude for God's deliverance and elevation.

God literally elevated him to regional supremacy, fulfilling <a href="/deuteronomy/28-13.htm">Deuteronomy 28:13</a>: &#8220;The LORD will make you the head and not the tail.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This advancement was never self-made; it flowed from the covenant promise given to Abraham, &#8220;I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/17-6.htm">Genesis 17:6</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s kingship foreshadows Christ, the Son of David, who is &#8220;King of kings and Lord of lords&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>). Just as God exalted David over earthly nations, He will ultimately place every knee under Jesus&#8217; authority (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<p>&#8226; In practical terms, God still positions His servants in influence&#8212;family, workplace, community&#8212;not for personal prestige but for His glory and the blessing of others (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A people I had not known shall serve me</b><p>&#8226; David witnessed foreigners&#8212;nations he never met&#8212;bringing gifts and pledging allegiance (<a href="/2_samuel/22-45.htm">2 Samuel 22:45</a>). The line speaks literally of Gentile submission during his reign.<p>&#8226; Yet the Spirit hints at a larger horizon: the future inclusion of Gentiles in God&#8217;s kingdom. Isaiah echoed it&#8212;&#8220;Nations you do not know will run to you&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a>)&#8212;and the early church saw it fulfilled as Gentiles turned to Christ (<a href="/acts/15-14.htm">Acts 15:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern continues today: people who once had no covenant connection now gladly serve the Son of David, forming &#8220;one new man&#8221; in Him (<a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13-18</a>).<p>&#8226; For the believer, this phrase fuels missions. Since God draws those we have &#8220;not known,&#8221; we step out in faith, confident that He has hearts prepared beyond our borders (<a href="/romans/15-20.htm">Romans 15:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/18-43.htm">Psalm 18:43</a> celebrates the LORD&#8217;s triple work: rescuing His servant from internal conflict, raising him to unprecedented authority, and extending that influence to strangers. The verse is a historical fact in David&#8217;s life, a prophetic preview of Christ&#8217;s universal reign, and an ongoing promise that God still delivers, exalts, and gathers people for His glory today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(43) <span class= "bld">People.</span>--The parallelism favours the interpretation which takes "people" as equivalent to <span class= "ital">peoples</span>--the Gentiles.

In one verse he at once sums up his past deliverances and anticipates fresh glories. God has delivered him from the strivings of those who were hostile to him among his own people (see vers. 4-18), and has also given him victory over the heathen. In the future he will do even more. <span class="cmt_word">And thou hast made me the head of the heathen</span>. The antithesis between "people" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>) and "heathen," or "nations" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>), is unmistakable. The long series of David's victories have made him "head" over the latter. This is less clearly seen in the history of David's reign than in the description given of the state of the kingdom inherited from David by Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21, 24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A people whom I have not known shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">serve me</span>.
