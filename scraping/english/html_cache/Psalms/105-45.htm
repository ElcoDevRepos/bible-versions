The statutes refer to the decrees and commandments given by God, particularly those delivered through Moses on Mount Sinai. These statutes were meant to set Israel apart as a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). The call to keep these statutes is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament, highlighting the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The statutes are not merely legalistic requirements but are intended to guide the people in living a life that reflects God's holiness and righteousness (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). This obedience is a response to God's faithfulness and deliverance, as seen in the historical context of the Exodus and the giving of the Law.<p><b>and obey His laws</b><br>Obedience to God's laws is a central theme in the Bible, reflecting the covenantal relationship between God and His people. The laws include moral, ceremonial, and civil aspects, all designed to govern the life of Israel in a way that honors God. The historical context of this phrase is rooted in the Sinai covenant, where God established His laws as a means for Israel to live in harmony with Him and each other (<a href="/deuteronomy/4.htm">Deuteronomy 4:1-2</a>). Obedience is not just about external compliance but involves a heart aligned with God's will (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5-6</a>). The call to obey is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus fulfills the Law and calls His followers to a deeper righteousness (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17-20</a>). This obedience is empowered by the Holy Spirit, who writes God's laws on the hearts of believers (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, <a href="/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10</a>).<p><b>Hallelujah!</b><br>The term "Hallelujah" is a Hebrew expression meaning "Praise the Lord." It is a call to worship and a response of gratitude for God's mighty acts and faithfulness. This exclamation is fitting at the conclusion of the psalm, which recounts God's wondrous deeds on behalf of Israel, from the patriarchs to the Exodus and the conquest of Canaan. The use of "Hallelujah" connects this psalm to the broader biblical tradition of praise, seen in the Psalms and the book of Revelation (<a href="/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19:1-6</a>). It serves as a reminder that the ultimate purpose of God's actions is His glory and the worship of His name. This praise is not only for Israel but extends to all nations, as God's redemptive plan through Jesus Christ invites all people to join in the worship of the one true God (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, emphasizing His statutes and laws.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of God's statutes and laws, as referenced throughout <a href="/bsb/psalms/105.htm">Psalm 105</a>.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place from which God delivered the Israelites, a key event leading to the giving of the law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader through whom God delivered the law to the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The Promised Land where the Israelites were to live out God's statutes and laws.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_law.htm">Obedience to God's Law</a></b><br>The verse underscores the importance of obedience to God's statutes as a response to His faithfulness and deliverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purpose_of_the_law.htm">Purpose of the Law</a></b><br>God's laws are given not as a burden but as a guide to living a life that honors Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/worship_and_praise.htm">Worship and Praise</a></b><br>The concluding "Hallelujah" reminds us that obedience is an act of worship and praise to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/continuity_of_god's_plan.htm">Continuity of God's Plan</a></b><br>The statutes and laws are part of God's continuous plan for His people, from the Old Testament to the New Testament.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_out_faith.htm">Living Out Faith</a></b><br>The call to keep and observe God's laws is a call to live out one's faith in daily life.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_105_45_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 105:45?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_follow_His_precepts_daily.htm">How can we "keep His precepts" in our daily lives today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_105_45_on_obeying_God_s_laws.htm">What does Psalm 105:45 teach about obedience to God's laws?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_105_45_Jesus_on_obedience.htm">How does Psalm 105:45 connect to Jesus' teachings on obedience?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_observe_His_laws_in_Psalm_105_45.htm">Why is it important to "observe His laws" according to Psalm 105:45?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Encourage_others_to_follow_God_s_ways.htm">How can we encourage others to follow God's precepts as Psalm 105:45 suggests?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_105_45_Importance_of_obeying_God.htm">How does Psalm 105:45 emphasize the importance of obeying God's laws?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Context_of_Psalm_105_45_s_writing.htm">What historical context surrounds the writing of Psalm 105:45?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_105_45_and_God_s_faithfulness.htm">How does Psalm 105:45 relate to the overall theme of God's faithfulness in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_105.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 105?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_was_jesus'_place_of_residence.htm">What defines a psalm?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_do_critics_reconcile_god's_justice.htm">If Psalm 119 proclaims that God is just and good, how do critics reconcile that with Old Testament accounts of severe judgments and punishments (Psalm 119)?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_do_the_faithful_suffer.htm">The psalm insists that following God's laws brings peace and protection, yet other Bible passages show faithful people enduring suffering and persecution (Psalm 119:165).</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'i_die_daily'_mean.htm">What is the longest chapter in the Bible?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 105:45 Mean</div><b>Context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/105.htm">Psalm 105</a></b><p><a href="/bsb/psalms/105.htm">Psalm 105</a> recounts God&#8217;s mighty acts from Abraham through the Exodus.
