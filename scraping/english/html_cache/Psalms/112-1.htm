It is an exclamation of worship and joy, often used in the Psalms to invite the congregation to join in praising God. The use of "Hallelujah" sets the tone for the psalm, emphasizing the importance of worship and reverence for God.<p><b>Blessed is the man</b><br>The concept of being "blessed" in the biblical sense refers to a state of happiness and well-being that comes from a right relationship with God. This echoes the Beatitudes in the New Testament, where Jesus describes the blessedness of those who live according to God's will. The "man" here is representative of any person who aligns their life with God's principles.<p><b>who fears the LORD</b><br>The "fear of the LORD" is a central theme in wisdom literature, such as Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. It denotes a deep respect, reverence, and awe for God, recognizing His power, authority, and holiness. This fear is not about being afraid but about acknowledging God's rightful place in one's life, leading to obedience and worship. It is the beginning of wisdom and understanding.<p><b>who greatly delights in His commandments</b><br>Delighting in God's commandments implies a love and appreciation for His laws and teachings. This is not mere duty but a genuine joy in following God's ways, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1</a>, where the righteous man meditates on the law day and night. It reflects a heart transformed by God's grace, finding pleasure in living according to His will.
