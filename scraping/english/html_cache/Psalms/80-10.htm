In biblical symbolism, the vine often represents Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>). The mountains could symbolize the nations or the high places of the earth, indicating the expansive influence and blessing of Israel under God's favor. The imagery suggests a time of prosperity and divine protection, reminiscent of the reigns of David and Solomon when Israel's influence was at its peak. The covering shade implies God's provision and care, as seen in other scriptures where God is described as a protective shade (<a href="/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5</a>).<p><b>and the mighty cedars with its branches</b><br>The mighty cedars refer to the renowned cedars of Lebanon, known for their strength and grandeur. These trees are often used in the Bible to symbolize power and majesty (<a href="/1_kings/4-33.htm">1 Kings 4:33</a>). The vine's branches extending to cover these cedars suggest Israel's reach and influence over even the most powerful and majestic entities. This can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual and political influence Israel was meant to have among the nations. The imagery also points to the idea of God's people being a source of blessing and influence, a theme echoed in the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>). In a typological sense, the vine can be seen as a precursor to Christ, who is the true vine (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1</a>), extending His influence and kingdom over all the earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist (Asaph or a descendant of Asaph)</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/80.htm">Psalm 80</a>, traditionally attributed to Asaph or his descendants, who were Levites appointed by King David to lead worship in the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel (the Vine)</a></b><br>The nation of Israel is metaphorically represented as a vine that God brought out of Egypt and planted in the Promised Land, as described in the broader context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/80.htm">Psalm 80</a>.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountains_and_mighty_cedars.htm">Mountains and Mighty Cedars</a></b><br>These natural elements symbolize the vastness and strength of Israel's growth and influence under God's care and blessing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place from which God delivered the Israelites, symbolizing their liberation and the beginning of their journey to becoming a great nation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land (Canaan)</a></b><br>The land where God planted Israel, allowing it to grow and flourish, as depicted in the imagery of the vine spreading its branches.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_care.htm">God's Provision and Care</a></b><br>Just as God provided for Israel, He provides for us today.

God&#8217;s blessing on Israel grew so broad and lush that every corner&#8212;from fertile valleys to rugged peaks&#8212;benefited. Compare the picture with <a href="/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a> (&#8220;Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours&#8221;) and <a href="/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43-45</a>, both describing total occupation of the land God promised.<p>&#8226; Mountains often symbolize stability and permanence. When those immovable heights are &#8220;covered,&#8221; the text underscores just how far-reaching the vine&#8217;s (Israel&#8217;s) growth had become. <a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20-21, 25</a> portrays the same era of peace and prosperity under Solomon when &#8220;Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand on the seashore.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The imagery also hints at influence, not merely geography. <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a> speaks of all nations streaming to &#8220;the mountain of the LORD&#8217;s house,&#8221; foreshadowing God&#8217;s intent for Israel&#8217;s witness to rise above cultural high points.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Mighty Cedars with Its Branches</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;and the mighty cedars with its branches.&#8221; Cedars of Lebanon were famed for strength, height, and longevity (<a href="/psalms/29-5.htm">Psalm 29:5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>). For the psalmist to say Israel&#8217;s branches reached those formidable trees means:<p>&#8226; God caused Israel&#8217;s reach to rival&#8212;and even surpass&#8212;the greatest natural symbols of power in the region. <a href="/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22-24</a> pictures a similar scene where a branch planted by God towers over &#8220;every kind of cedar.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase speaks of protection and refuge. <a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3-6</a> describes birds nesting in lofty cedar boughs; likewise, Israel, at its best, offered safety and blessing to outsiders (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). <a href="/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8-11</a> anticipates foreign kings coming under that same benevolent canopy.<p>&#8226; There is also a sober reminder: great height carries great responsibility. <a href="/amos/2-9.htm">Amos 2:9</a> recalls the Amorites, &#8220;tall as the cedars,&#8221; who were still judged by God.
