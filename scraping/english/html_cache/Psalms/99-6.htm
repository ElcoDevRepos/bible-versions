Moses, though not a priest in the traditional sense, acted as a mediator between God and the people, similar to a priestly role. Aaron, his brother, was the first high priest, establishing the Aaronic priesthood. This phrase highlights their unique positions in serving God and leading the Israelites. The priestly role involved offering sacrifices and interceding for the people, which Moses and Aaron did during their leadership. This connection emphasizes the importance of faithful leadership and obedience to God's commands.<p><b>Samuel was among those who called on His name.</b><br>Samuel, a prophet and judge, played a crucial role in Israel's history, bridging the period between the judges and the monarchy. Known for his dedication to God from a young age, Samuel's life was marked by prayer and direct communication with God. His calling on God's name signifies his reliance on divine guidance and his role as an intercessor for the people. Samuel's leadership was characterized by his commitment to God's will, and he was instrumental in anointing the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David. This phrase underscores the power of prayer and the importance of seeking God's guidance.<p><b>They called to the LORD and He answered.</b><br>This statement reflects the faithfulness of God in responding to those who earnestly seek Him. Throughout the Bible, God is depicted as a responsive and compassionate deity who listens to the prayers of His people. The experiences of Moses, Aaron, and Samuel demonstrate that God answers those who call upon Him in sincerity and truth. This assurance of divine response is a recurring theme in Scripture, encouraging believers to maintain a strong prayer life. The phrase also points to the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God promises to be attentive to His people's needs and concerns.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.
