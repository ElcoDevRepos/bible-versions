Shepherding was a vital part of the agrarian society, requiring diligence and care. David's experience with the ewes prepared him for leadership, teaching him responsibility and protection. This mirrors the biblical theme of God choosing the humble and lowly for great purposes, as seen in the lives of Moses and Gideon. The shepherd motif is significant throughout Scripture, symbolizing guidance and care, and is later used to describe Jesus as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>He brought him</b><br>This indicates divine intervention and selection. God actively chose David, demonstrating His sovereign will in raising leaders. This act of bringing David from the fields to the throne underscores the biblical principle that God exalts the humble (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11-13</a>). It also reflects the theme of God's providence and His ability to orchestrate events for His purposes, as seen in Joseph's rise to power in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-41.htm">Genesis 41:41</a>).<p><b>to be shepherd of His people Jacob</b><br>The term "shepherd" here is metaphorical, representing leadership and governance. David's role as king was to guide, protect, and nurture the nation of Israel, much like a shepherd with his flock. The reference to "His people Jacob" connects to the covenantal relationship God established with the patriarchs, emphasizing continuity and faithfulness. This shepherd imagery is prophetic of Christ, who is the ultimate Shepherd of God's people, fulfilling the promises made to Jacob (<a href="/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a>).<p><b>of Israel His inheritance</b><br>Israel is described as God's inheritance, highlighting the special relationship between God and His chosen people. This concept of inheritance is rooted in the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised to make Abraham's descendants a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). It signifies possession, care, and a lasting legacy. The idea of inheritance is also eschatological, pointing to the future fulfillment of God's promises through Christ, who secures an eternal inheritance for believers (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The verse refers to David, who was taken from shepherding sheep to shepherding the people of Israel.
