In the Hebrew context, "bless" (barak) implies kneeling and giving adoration. It is an invitation to acknowledge God's greatness and goodness. The act of blessing God is a recurring theme in the Psalms, emphasizing the importance of worship in the life of believers. This call to bless the Lord is not just a personal act but a communal one, inviting all creation to join in praise.<p><b>all His hosts</b><br>The term "hosts" refers to the heavenly beings, often understood as angels, who serve God. In biblical literature, these hosts are depicted as a vast army of spiritual beings who execute God's commands and serve His purposes. The imagery of a heavenly host is prevalent in passages like <a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a> and <a href="/luke/2-13.htm">Luke 2:13</a>, where angels are seen as God's messengers and warriors. This phrase underscores the idea that all of creation, both seen and unseen, is called to worship God.<p><b>you servants who do His will</b><br>This phrase identifies the hosts as servants, emphasizing their role in carrying out God's commands. The concept of servanthood is central to biblical theology, highlighting obedience and submission to God's authority. In the New Testament, Jesus is the ultimate example of a servant who perfectly does the Father's will (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a>). The call to do God's will is a reminder of the purpose and duty of all believers, aligning their actions with God's desires as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-10.htm">Matthew 6:10</a>, where Jesus teaches His disciples to pray for God's will to be done on earth as it is in heaven.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature. He is the central figure to whom the blessing is directed.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_hosts.htm">His Hosts</a></b><br>Refers to the heavenly beings, often understood as angels, who serve God and carry out His commands. The term "hosts" (Hebrew: "tzeva'ot") can also imply a sense of organized, powerful forces.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants.htm">Servants</a></b><br>These are the beings who serve God by doing His will.

David modeled this in <a href="/psalms/34-1.htm">Psalm 34:1</a>&#8212;&#8220;I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise will always be on my lips&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Because the command is rooted in who God is, every circumstance fits the call (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Notice the personal covenant name &#8220;LORD&#8221; (YHWH). Scripture consistently presents Him as faithful and unchanging (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-1.htm">Psalm 103:1</a>), so His people never lack reason to bless Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all His hosts</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Hosts&#8221; points first to the countless angels surrounding God&#8217;s throne. Micaiah saw &#8220;all the host of heaven standing by Him&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>).<p>&#8226; At Jesus&#8217; birth, &#8220;a great multitude of the heavenly host&#8221; erupted in praise (<a href="/luke/2-13.htm">Luke 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11</a> adds &#8220;myriads of myriads&#8221; of angels, underscoring the sheer scale of this worshiping army.<p>&#8226; The command reaches every rank of that army. No angel is exempt; all owe continuous praise to their Creator and Commander.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you servants</b><p>&#8226; The phrase narrows in on the identity of those hosts: they are God&#8217;s servants. Angels are &#8220;ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a> calls them His &#8220;messengers&#8221; and &#8220;servants,&#8221; showing their readiness to act.<p>&#8226; Yet Scripture also applies the title &#8220;servant&#8221; to faithful human believers (<a href="/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>; <a href="/john/12-26.htm">John 12:26</a>). In Christ, we are drawn into the same calling of devoted service and praise.<p>&#8226; Whether celestial or earthly, the servant&#8217;s life centers on obedience and worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who do His will</b><p>&#8226; Servants are defined by what they do&#8212;specifically, they &#8220;do His will.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus taught us to pray, &#8220;Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-10.htm">Matthew 6:10</a>). The verse reminds us heaven is already practicing what earth is called to pursue.<p>&#8226; The Messiah Himself set the pattern: &#8220;Here I am&#8230; I have come to do Your will, O God&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-7.htm">Hebrews 10:7</a>; cf. <a href="/psalms/40-8.htm">Psalm 40:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine obedience is active, consistent, and heartfelt (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>; <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). Praise without obedience rings hollow; praise joined to obedience magnifies God&#8217;s glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/103-21.htm">Psalm 103:21</a> summons every angelic host and every faithful servant to an unending chorus of praise rooted in wholehearted obedience. The verse paints a clear picture: those who know the LORD best&#8212;His heavenly armies and His earthly people&#8212;respond to Him by blessing His name and carrying out His will.
