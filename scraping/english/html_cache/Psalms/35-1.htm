David's life was marked by numerous conflicts, both personal and national, which often drove him to seek God's intervention. The historical context of David's reign, including his battles with surrounding nations and internal strife, provides a backdrop for understanding his plea for divine assistance.<p><b>Contend with my opponents, O LORD;</b><br>The term "contend" suggests a legal or judicial battle, invoking the image of God as a divine advocate or judge. In ancient Israel, legal disputes were often settled at the city gates, where elders would hear cases. David's request for God to contend on his behalf reflects his reliance on divine justice over human judgment. This plea is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/49-25.htm">Isaiah 49:25</a>, where God promises to contend with those who contend with His people, highlighting God's role as a defender of the righteous.<p><b>fight against those who fight against me.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the military aspect of David's request, calling upon God to actively engage in battle against his enemies. Throughout the Old Testament, God is depicted as a warrior who fights for Israel, as seen in <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>, where He is described as "a man of war." David's appeal for divine intervention in battle reflects the cultural understanding of God as a protector and deliverer. This also foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ over spiritual enemies, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>, where Jesus is portrayed as a conquering king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this psalm, David is seeking God's intervention against his adversaries.

From facing lions and bears (<a href="/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34-37</a>) to fleeing Saul&#8217;s spears (<a href="/1_samuel/19-10.htm">1 Samuel 19:10</a>) and Absalom&#8217;s rebellion (<a href="/2_samuel/15-14.htm">2 Samuel 15:14</a>), conflict was woven into his story. Writing under the Spirit&#8217;s inspiration (<a href="/2_samuel/23-2.htm">2 Samuel 23:2</a>), he turns every threat into prayer, modeling how God&#8217;s people should instinctively run to the Lord whenever opposition arises (<a href="/psalms/18-1.htm">Psalm 18:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Contend with my opponents, O LORD;</b><p>&#8220;Contend&#8221; pictures a courtroom dispute where the LORD steps in as both advocate and judge. David knows he cannot out-argue or out-maneuver his adversaries, so he pleads for divine intervention.<p>&#8226; The LORD defends the helpless: &#8220;I will contend with those who contend with you&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/49-25.htm">Isaiah 49:25</a>).<p>&#8226; He vindicates the righteous: &#8220;He will bring forth your righteousness like the dawn&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/37-6.htm">Psalm 37:6</a>).<p>&#8226; He exposes false accusations: see <a href="/psalms/109-1.htm">Psalm 109:1-4</a> and the ultimate example in Christ&#8217;s trials (<a href="/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4</a>).<p>What does it mean? When enemies slander or scheme, believers may confidently ask God to enter the fray as the perfect defender who sees every motive and renders true justice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>fight against those who fight against me.</b><p>The language shifts from courtroom to battlefield. From the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>) to Jehoshaphat&#8217;s day (&#8220;the battle is not yours, but God&#8217;s,&#8221; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>), Scripture repeatedly portrays the LORD as Warrior. David banks on that history.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s action: He arms His people (<a href="/psalms/144-1.htm">Psalm 144:1</a>), sends angelic hosts (<a href="/2_kings/6-16.htm">2 Kings 6:16-17</a>), and causes enemy plans to collapse (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Our response:<p>&#8211; Stand firm in faith (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-13</a>).<p>&#8211; Refuse personal vengeance, leaving room for God&#8217;s wrath (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p>&#8211; Keep doing good while trusting divine timing (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>).<p>What does it mean? God personally engages hostile forces&#8212;whether physical armies or spiritual powers&#8212;on behalf of His covenant children. The verse assures us that no foe is too strong when the LORD Himself takes the field.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/35-1.htm">Psalm 35:1</a> reveals a twofold plea: &#8220;Contend&#8221; in the courtroom and &#8220;fight&#8221; on the battlefield. David, confident in the LORD&#8217;s proven faithfulness, asks God to defend and deliver him from unjust attackers. Believers today may echo the same prayer, trusting that the Lord who vindicates His servants and triumphs over every enemy is still present, powerful, and willing to act.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/35.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Plead my cause.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Strive, O Jehovah, with them that strive with me. </span>The construction requires this, and the parallelism suggests recourse to arms rather than to the law.<p><span class= "bld">Fight.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">devour. </span>(Comp. <a href="/numbers/24-8.htm" title="God brought him forth out of Egypt; he has as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.">Numbers 24:8</a>.<p>"He shall eat up the nations."

The word translated "plead" is a judicial term; but the context shows that it was in the battle-field, rather than in the law-courts, that David's cause was to be pleaded. The second hemistich is therefore added to explain and correct the first; it is fighting, not pleading, that is needed under the circumstances. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/35-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Of David.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1448;&#1491;
