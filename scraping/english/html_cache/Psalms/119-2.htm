The Hebrew word for "blessed" is "esher," which implies happiness and contentment. The concept of keeping God's testimonies suggests a commitment to obeying God's laws and decrees. In the Old Testament, testimonies often refer to the covenantal laws given to Israel, such as those found in the Torah. This phrase emphasizes the importance of obedience to God's word as a source of blessing. The idea of keeping God's testimonies is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/6-17.htm">Deuteronomy 6:17</a>, which commands the Israelites to diligently keep the commandments of the Lord. This obedience is not merely external but involves a heartfelt commitment to God's will.<p><b>and seek Him with all their heart</b><br>Seeking God with all one's heart implies a wholehearted devotion and earnest pursuit of a relationship with Him. The heart, in biblical terms, represents the center of one's being, including mind, will, and emotions. This phrase underscores the necessity of sincerity and total dedication in one's spiritual life. The call to seek God wholeheartedly is a recurring theme in scripture, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>, where God promises that those who seek Him with all their heart will find Him. This pursuit of God is not passive but active, requiring intentional effort and desire. The phrase also points to the greatest commandment, as stated by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>, to love the Lord with all one's heart, soul, and mind. This wholehearted seeking is a reflection of a deep, personal relationship with God, characterized by love and commitment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who expresses a deep love for God's law and a desire to live according to His commandments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in the Psalm, whose testimonies and commandments are the focus of the believer's devotion and obedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the law was given, serving as the historical and cultural context for the Psalm.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heart.htm">Heart</a></b><br>Represents the inner being or soul of a person, emphasizing sincerity and total commitment in seeking God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/testimonies.htm">Testimonies</a></b><br>Refers to God's laws, decrees, and commandments, which are to be kept and cherished by believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/w/wholehearted_devotion.htm">Wholehearted Devotion</a></b><br>True blessing comes from seeking God with all our heart, not just outwardly but with sincere and complete devotion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_word.htm">Obedience to God's Word</a></b><br>Keeping God's testimonies is a sign of our love and commitment to Him, and it brings spiritual blessings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart's_role.htm">The Heart's Role</a></b><br>Our heart's condition is crucial in our relationship with God; it must be fully engaged in seeking Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/pursuit_of_holiness.htm">Pursuit of Holiness</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to pursue holiness by aligning our lives with God's commandments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/continuous_seeking.htm">Continuous Seeking</a></b><br>Seeking God is a lifelong journey that requires persistence and dedication.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_119_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 119:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_do_we_uphold_His_testimonies_daily.htm">How can we "keep His testimonies" in our daily lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_is_wholehearted_seeking_of_Him.htm">What does it mean to "seek Him with all their heart"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Psalm_119_2_to_Matthew_22_37.htm">How does Psalm 119:2 connect with Jesus' teachings in Matthew 22:37?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_seek_God_wholeheartedly_for_growth.htm">Why is wholehearted seeking of God crucial for spiritual growth and obedience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_align_hearts_with_God_s_word.htm">What practical steps help us align our hearts with God's testimonies?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_119_2_on_wholehearted_seeking.htm">How does Psalm 119:2 define the concept of "seeking God with all your heart"?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Psalm_119_2_s_writing.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 119:2?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_119_2_s_link_to_biblical_obedience.htm">How does Psalm 119:2 relate to the overall theme of obedience in the Bible?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_119.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 119?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_did_ruth_mean_by_'i_will_go'.htm">Have you remembered the Lord today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_lying_against_god's_teachings.htm">How can we express gratitude according to the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_it_mean_to_seek_god.htm">What does it mean to seek God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_a_hedge_of_protection.htm">What defines a hedge of protection?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 119:2 Mean</div><b>Blessed</b><p><a href="/psalms/119-2.htm">Psalm 119:2</a> opens with &#8220;Blessed,&#8221; signaling true, enduring happiness that flows from God rather than circumstance (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-12</a>).
