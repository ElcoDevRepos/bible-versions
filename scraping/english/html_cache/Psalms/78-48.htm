The plague of hail was a direct judgment against the Egyptian gods, particularly those associated with agriculture and livestock, such as Hathor and Apis. The devastation of cattle by hail signifies God's power over nature and His ability to protect or destroy as He wills. The hailstorm was unprecedented in its severity, demonstrating God's supremacy over the Egyptian deities and the futility of relying on them for protection. This event also highlights the distinction God made between the Egyptians and the Israelites, as the land of Goshen, where the Israelites lived, was spared from the hail.<p><b>and their livestock to bolts of lightning.</b><br>The mention of "bolts of lightning" further emphasizes the intensity and supernatural nature of the plague. Lightning, often associated with divine presence and judgment in the Bible, underscores the direct intervention of God in the affairs of Egypt. This imagery is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God uses natural phenomena to execute judgment, such as the fire from heaven that consumed the sacrifices of Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>. The destruction of livestock not only had economic implications for Egypt but also symbolized the dismantling of their societal structure and reliance on false gods. This act of judgment foreshadows the ultimate deliverance of God's people and serves as a type of Christ, who would later come to deliver humanity from spiritual bondage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, demonstrating His power and judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a></b><br>The recipients of God's judgment through the plagues, including the hail and lightning.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cattle_and_livestock.htm">Cattle and Livestock</a></b><br>Representing the wealth and sustenance of the Egyptians, which were destroyed as part of the plagues.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hail_and_lightning.htm">Hail and Lightning</a></b><br>Natural elements used by God as instruments of His judgment during the plagues in Egypt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/plagues_of_egypt.htm">Plagues of Egypt</a></b><br>A series of divine judgments upon Egypt, of which the hail and lightning were a part.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nature.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nature</a></b><br>God controls all elements of nature and can use them to fulfill His purposes.
