In the biblical narrative, the conquest of Canaan, as described in the Book of Joshua, was marked by divine intervention rather than human strength. The fall of Jericho (Joshua 6) is a prime example, where the walls fell not by force but by following God's instructions. This underscores the theme of reliance on God rather than human power, a recurring motif throughout Scripture.<p><b>their arm did not bring them victory.</b><br>The "arm" symbolizes human strength and effort. The Israelites' victories were not due to their own physical prowess or strategic abilities. This reflects a broader biblical principle found in passages like <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>, "Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit," indicating that true success comes from divine assistance. Historically, the Israelites were often outnumbered and outmatched by their enemies, yet they triumphed through God's intervention.<p><b>It was by Your right hand,</b><br>The "right hand" of God is a metaphor for His power and authority. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the right hand was associated with strength and skill. This phrase highlights that it was God's power that secured the land for Israel. The right hand of God is also a messianic symbol, pointing to Jesus Christ, who is seated at the right hand of the Father (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>), signifying His divine authority and power.<p><b>Your arm,</b><br>This reiterates the theme of divine strength. God's "arm" is often depicted in Scripture as a source of deliverance and salvation (<a href="/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a>). The imagery of God's arm conveys His active involvement in the affairs of His people, ensuring their victory and protection. It serves as a reminder of God's omnipotence and His role as the ultimate deliverer.<p><b>and the light of Your face,</b><br>The "light of Your face" symbolizes God's favor and presence. In the Aaronic blessing (<a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>), the shining of God's face upon His people is a sign of His grace and peace. This imagery suggests that the Israelites' success was due to God's favorable disposition towards them. The light also represents guidance and revelation, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, where God's word is described as a lamp and light.<p><b>because You favored them.</b><br>God's favor is the ultimate reason for Israel's victories. This favor is rooted in His covenantal promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as His love for His chosen people. The concept of divine favor is central to the biblical narrative, where God's grace and mercy are extended to His people despite their shortcomings. This favor is also a type of the grace extended through Jesus Christ, who brings salvation not by human merit but by God's unmerited favor (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were given the Promised Land, not by their own might, but by God's intervention.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_right_hand.htm">God's Right Hand</a></b><br>A metaphor for God's power and intervention in the affairs of His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_face.htm">God's Face</a></b><br>Symbolizes God's favor and presence with His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/divine_delight.htm">Divine Delight</a></b><br>God's pleasure in His people, which is the reason for His intervention and blessing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_victory.htm">God's Sovereignty in Victory</a></b><br>Recognize that true victory comes from God, not from human strength or strategy.
