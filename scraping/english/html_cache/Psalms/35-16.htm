In ancient Near Eastern culture, feasts were often occasions for celebration and social interaction. However, the presence of "godless jesters" suggests a perversion of this setting, where instead of joy and fellowship, there is ridicule and derision. The term "godless" indicates a lack of reverence for God, aligning these jesters with the wicked. This imagery can be connected to other biblical instances where mockery is used against the righteous, such as in the accounts of Jesus' trial and crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-27.htm">Matthew 27:27-31</a>). The cultural context of jesters, who were entertainers often allowed to speak freely, underscores the depth of disrespect shown to the psalmist.<p><b>they gnashed their teeth at me</b><br>Gnashing of teeth is a biblical expression of intense anger or hostility. It is used in various scriptures to depict the fury of the wicked against the righteous (<a href="/acts/7-54.htm">Acts 7:54</a>) and is also associated with the anguish of the damned (<a href="/matthew/8-12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>). In this context, it emphasizes the deep-seated animosity and aggression directed towards the psalmist. Historically, this expression would resonate with an audience familiar with the physical manifestation of rage. Theologically, it can be seen as a foreshadowing of the suffering of Christ, who faced similar hostility and scorn from His adversaries. This phrase highlights the psalmist's experience of being unjustly targeted by those who oppose God's ways.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/35.htm">Psalm 35</a>, David is expressing his distress and seeking God's intervention against his adversaries.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/adversaries.htm">Adversaries</a></b><br>The people who are opposing David, described metaphorically as "godless jesters" who mock and attack him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast.htm">Feast</a></b><br>A setting that implies a gathering or celebration, where the adversaries are likened to jesters, highlighting their mockery and scorn.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and protector whom David is appealing to for justice and deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesters.htm">Jesters</a></b><br>Symbolic of those who mock and ridicule, showing a lack of reverence and respect.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_opposition.htm">Understanding Opposition</a></b><br>Recognize that as followers of Christ, we may face mockery and opposition from those who do not understand or respect our faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_mockery.htm">Responding to Mockery</a></b><br>Instead of retaliating, we should follow David's example by turning to God in prayer and seeking His justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trusting_god's_justice.htm">Trusting God's Justice</a></b><br>Trust that God sees the injustices we face and will act in His perfect timing to vindicate His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/maintaining_integrity.htm">Maintaining Integrity</a></b><br>Even when mocked or ridiculed, maintain a Christ-like attitude, showing love and forgiveness to those who oppose us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer.htm">The Power of Prayer</a></b><br>Use prayer as a powerful tool to bring our struggles before God, knowing that He hears and cares for us.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_35_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 35:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_35_16_on_David_s_foes_behavior.htm">How does Psalm 35:16 describe the behavior of David's adversaries?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_mockery_from_Psalm_35_16.htm">What can we learn about handling mockery from Psalm 35:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_35_16_s_link_to_Jesus_trials.htm">How does Psalm 35:16 connect with Jesus' experience in the Gospels?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Christian_response_to_mockery_in_Ps_35_16.htm">How should Christians respond to being mocked, based on Psalm 35:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_resist_joining_mockery.htm">What practical steps can we take to avoid joining in mockery?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_35_16_on_human_malice_mockery.htm">What does Psalm 35:16 reveal about the nature of human malice and mockery?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_35_16_Justice_divine_intervention.htm">How does Psalm 35:16 challenge our understanding of justice and divine intervention?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Psalm_35_16_show_faith_struggles.htm">In what ways does Psalm 35:16 reflect the struggles of the faithful against their adversaries?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_35.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/do_jews_and_christians_share_a_god.htm">What does 'You prepare a table before me' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_it_mean_to_praise_god.htm">What does it mean to praise God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'gnashing_of_teeth'_mean.htm">What does "gnashing of teeth" mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/is_there_proof_of_judgment_in_psalm_125_5.htm">In Psalm 125:5, is there historical or archaeological proof of a specific judgment that differentiates the fate of the righteous from the 'evildoers' mentioned?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 35:16 Mean</div><b>Like godless jesters</b><p>&#8220;Like godless jesters&#8221;

The LXX. and Vulg. have, "they tempted me, they mocked me with a mocking"; Symmachus, "in hypocrisy, with feigned words"; Chaldee, "with derisive words of flattery."
