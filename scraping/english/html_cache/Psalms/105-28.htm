The darkness was a direct act of God, demonstrating His power over creation and the Egyptian gods, particularly Ra, the sun god. This plague was a supernatural darkness, possibly a thick, tangible darkness that could be felt, emphasizing the severity of God's judgment. The darkness lasted for three days, symbolizing a complete period of divine judgment. This event foreshadows the darkness that covered the land during the crucifixion of Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/27-45.htm">Matthew 27:45</a>), symbolizing judgment and the power of God over life and death.<p><b>yet they defied His words.</b><br>Despite the miraculous and terrifying nature of the plagues, Pharaoh and the Egyptians continued to resist God's command to let the Israelites go. This defiance highlights the hardness of Pharaoh's heart, a recurring theme in the Exodus narrative (<a href="/exodus/7-13.htm">Exodus 7:13, 9</a>:12). It serves as a warning against the dangers of pride and disobedience to God's will. The phrase underscores the futility of resisting God's sovereign plans, as His purposes will ultimately prevail. This defiance is contrasted with the obedience of Jesus Christ, who submitted to the Father's will even unto death (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>), serving as the ultimate example of faithfulness and submission to God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who sent the darkness as a sign of His power and judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>God's chosen leaders who were instrumental in delivering God's message and performing signs before Pharaoh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who hardened his heart against God's commands.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved and where God demonstrated His power through plagues.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plague_of_darkness.htm">The Plague of Darkness</a></b><br>One of the ten plagues God sent upon Egypt, symbolizing judgment and divine authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>God has control over nature and uses it to fulfill His purposes.

Of whom is it said, "They rebelled not against his words"? Of the Egyptians it is not true; and to refer the words to Moses and Aaron, in contrast with their resistance to the Divine command at Massah and Meribah, is feeble. The LXX. and the Syriac solved the difficulty by rejecting the negative. (Comp. the Prayer Book Version.)<p>The simplest explanation is to take the verb as imperfect subjunctive: "He sent darkness, and made it dark, that they might not rebel against his word."<p>But this fails to supply a reason for the position in the list of the ninth plague, and the suggested emendation of Mr. Burgess is so satisfactory in this respect, that it almost by itself carries conviction with it. By a very slight change, he obtains: "He sent darkness, and darkened them, that they might not discern his tokens;" taking <span class= "ital">deber </span>in the same sense that it bears in <a href="/psalms/105-27.htm" title="They showed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.">Psalm 105:27</a>.<p>Thus the plague of darkness is, by a slight device of the poet, made to symbolise the moral blindness displayed by the Egyptians throughout.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/105.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He sent darkness, and made it dark</span> (see <a href="/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And they rebelled not against his word.</span> If the "not" is to stand in this passage, it must be referred to Moses and Aaron.
