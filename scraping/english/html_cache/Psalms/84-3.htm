In biblical times, sparrows were common and inexpensive, often used as a metaphor for something of little value (<a href="/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29</a>). The mention of a sparrow finding a home in the temple courts suggests a place of safety and belonging, symbolizing God's inclusive love and the peace found in His presence.<p><b>and the swallow a nest for herself</b><br>Swallows are known for their migratory nature and their ability to build nests in various locations. The imagery of a swallow finding a nest in the temple signifies rest and security in God's house. This reflects the idea that those who seek God will find rest and a place to dwell, echoing Jesus' invitation in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a> to find rest in Him.<p><b>where she places her young</b><br>The mention of placing her young emphasizes the nurturing aspect of God's presence. It suggests that God's house is not only a place of refuge for individuals but also for families and future generations. This can be seen as a call to raise children in the knowledge and fear of the Lord, as instructed in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>.<p><b>near Your altars</b><br>The altars in the temple were central to worship and sacrifice, representing atonement and communion with God. Being near the altars signifies closeness to God's presence and the blessings that come from worship and sacrifice. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate sacrifice, which brings believers into a closer relationship with God (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p><b>O LORD of Hosts</b><br>This title for God emphasizes His sovereignty and power over all the heavenly armies. It reflects God's might and authority, reassuring believers of His ability to protect and provide for them. The title is often used in contexts of divine intervention and deliverance, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a> when David confronts Goliath.<p><b>my King and my God</b><br>This personal declaration of faith acknowledges God's rule and authority in the psalmist's life. It reflects a deep, personal relationship with God, recognizing Him as both sovereign ruler and personal deity. This dual acknowledgment is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus is recognized as both Lord and God (<a href="/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>), affirming His divine kingship and personal relationship with believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sparrow_and_swallow.htm">Sparrow and Swallow</a></b><br>These birds are often seen as symbols of insignificance and vulnerability.

"Our common house- sparrow is found on the coast in the towns, and inland its place is taken by a very closely-allied species, <span class= "ital">Passer Cisalpina</span>" (Tristram, <span class= "ital">Nat. Hist. of the Bible, </span>p. 202).<p><span class= "bld">Swallow.</span>--Heb. <span class= "ital">deror, </span>which by its etymology implies a bird of rapid whirling flight. (See <a href="/proverbs/26-2.htm" title="As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.">Proverbs 26:2</a>, where this characteristic is especially noticed.) The ancient versions take the word as cognate with "turtle-dove." In an appendix to Delitzsch's Commentary on the Psalms, Dr. J. G. Wetzstein, identifies the <span class= "ital">tsippor </span>with the <span class= "ital">osfur </span>of the Arabs, a generic name for small chirping birds, and <span class= "ital">deror </span>with <span class= "ital">d-ri. </span>which is specific of the <span class= "ital">sparrow.</span><p><span class= "bld">Even thy altars.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">at </span>or <span class= "ital">near thine altars, </span>though even if taken as in the Authorised "Version the meaning is the same. There is no real occasion for the great difficulty that has been made about this verse. It is absurd indeed to think of the birds actually nesting on the altars; but that they were found in and about the Temple is quite probable, just as in Herodotus (i. 159) we read of Aristodicus making the circuit of the temple at Branchidae, and taking the nests of young sparrows and other birds. (Comp. the story in 'lian of the man who was slain for harming a sparrow that had sheltered in the temple of 'sculapius.) Ewald gives many other references, and among them one to Burckhardt showing that birds nest in the Kaaba at Mecca.<p>The Hebrew poetic style is not favourable to simile, or the psalmist would have written (as a modern would), "As the birds delight to nest at thine altars, so do I love to dwell in thine house."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/84.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young</span>. Both sparrows and swallows abound in Palestine. Canon Tristram found the nest of a sparrow "so closely allied to our own that it is difficult to distinguish it," in a chink of the Haram wall at Jerusalem, near the Golden Gate ('Land of Israel,' p. 182). An anecdote related by Herodotus (1, 159) shows that sparrows built about the Greek temples. The general meaning of the figure in this place seems to be, "If even birds love to build their nests, as they do, in the sacred precincts, how much more reason has the believing heart to find its home in the house of its God!" But the psalmist thinks it enough to suggest the parallel, and does not stop to carry it out. Even <span class="cmt_word">thine altars.</span> The "altar" is put, by metonymy, for the temple itself. <span class="cmt_word">O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/5-2.htm">Psalm 5:2</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/84-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Even</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(gam-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1571.htm">Strong's 1571: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assemblage, also, even, yea, though, both, and</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the sparrow</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1448;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;
