The Israelites, led by Moses, were escaping from Egyptian bondage, and God parted the sea to allow them to cross on dry ground. This event is a demonstration of God's power over nature and His ability to deliver His people. The sea fleeing symbolizes the removal of obstacles through divine intervention. Theologically, it represents salvation and deliverance, prefiguring Christ's victory over sin and death. The sea's obedience to God's command highlights His sovereignty over creation.<p><b>O Jordan, that you turned back</b><br>This refers to the crossing of the Jordan River by the Israelites as they entered the Promised Land, as described in <a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14-17</a>. The river stopped flowing and piled up in a heap, allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground. This event parallels the crossing of the Red Sea and signifies a new beginning for the Israelites as they claim the land promised to their ancestors. It underscores God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises. Theologically, the Jordan River's turning back can be seen as a type of baptism, symbolizing the transition from the old life to the new life in Christ. The event also foreshadows the ultimate inheritance believers receive through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea (Red Sea)</a></b><br>The Red Sea is a significant body of water that the Israelites crossed during the Exodus from Egypt.
