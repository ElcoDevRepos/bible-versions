In the context of <a href="/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, David is expressing deep distress and seeking God's intervention. The idea of adding iniquity to iniquity suggests a cumulative judgment, where the sins of the wicked are compounded. This can be seen as a call for God to allow the natural consequences of their actions to unfold, leading to further moral and spiritual decline. Biblically, this echoes the principle found in <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-28</a>, where God gives people over to their sinful desires as a form of judgment. Theologically, it underscores the seriousness of sin and the justice of God in dealing with persistent rebellion.<p><b>let them not share in Your righteousness.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the separation between the wicked and the righteous. In the Old Testament, righteousness is often associated with covenantal faithfulness and right standing before God. The psalmist is asking that those who persist in their iniquity be excluded from the blessings and favor that come with being in right relationship with God. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the separation of the righteous and the wicked, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/1-5.htm">Psalm 1:5-6</a> and <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>. It also points to the ultimate judgment where those who reject God are denied the inheritance of the righteous, emphasizing the importance of living a life aligned with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, David is expressing deep distress and calling upon God for justice against his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_david.htm">Enemies of David</a></b><br>The individuals or groups who oppose David, causing him suffering and persecution.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and source of righteousness, whom David is appealing to for justice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/righteousness.htm">Righteousness</a></b><br>The state of being morally right or justifiable, which David desires to be withheld from his enemies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/iniquity.htm">Iniquity</a></b><br>Refers to sin or moral wrongdoing, which David asks God to increase upon his adversaries.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_imprecatory_psalms.htm">Understanding Imprecatory Psalms</a></b><br>These Psalms express raw human emotions and a desire for divine justice.

His words echo the principle seen when God &#8220;gave them over&#8221; to their sinful desires (<a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>) and when Pharaoh&#8217;s hard heart was further hardened by God&#8217;s judgment (<a href="/exodus/9-12.htm">Exodus 9:12</a>). In effect:<p>&#8226; Those who continually choose sin are confirmed in it, showing that Divine justice is never unjust but proportionate (<a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; By permitting vice to run its course, God exposes wickedness for what it is, just as He will in the final judgment (<a href="/revelation/22-11.htm">Revelation 22:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; This severe request rises from zeal for God&#8217;s honor, not personal vindictiveness. David trusts the Lord&#8217;s perfect assessment, mirroring the call to &#8220;leave room for God&#8217;s wrath&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>let them not share in Your righteousness</b><p>The second half reads, &#8220;let them not share in Your righteousness.&#8221; Here David prays that unrepentant enemies would remain outside the covenant blessing reserved for the faithful. He is not denying forgiveness to those who turn; he is asking that the unyielding not be counted among the righteous, which would mock God&#8217;s justice (<a href="/psalms/5-4.htm">Psalm 5:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently separates the righteous from the wicked (<a href="/psalms/1-5.htm">Psalm 1:5-6</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-32.htm">Matthew 25:32-33</a>).<p>&#8226; Participation in God&#8217;s righteousness requires faith and repentance (<a href="/isaiah/55-7.htm">Isaiah 55:7</a>; <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>).<p>&#8226; By excluding the obstinate, God guards the purity of His people, just as Ananias and Sapphira were judged to preserve the early church&#8217;s integrity (<a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/69-27.htm">Psalm 69:27</a> appeals to God&#8217;s righteous character: if sinners refuse mercy, let them experience the full weight of their own sin and remain outside the blessings reserved for the repentant. The verse affirms that God&#8217;s justice is active, precise, and ultimately protective of His holiness and people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/69.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27, 28) It is doubtful whether these verses give the talk of the enemies just mentioned, or whether the psalmist himself, after a pause, resumes his imprecations. The former supposition certainly adds a fresh force to the prayer of <a href="/psalms/69-29.htm" title="But I am poor and sorrowful: let your salvation, O God, set me up on high.">Psalm 69:29</a>; and it is more natural to suppose that the string of curses, once ended, should not be taken up again. On the other hand, would the apostates, against whom the psalm is directed, have put their animosity into the shape of a wish to have names blotted out of God's book? If so, it must be in irony.<p>(27) <span class= "bld">Add iniquity</span>--This may be understood in two different senses: (1) <span class= "ital">Let sin be added to sin in thy account, till the tale be full. </span>(2) <span class= "ital">Add guilt for guilt, i.e., for each wrong committed write down a punishment.</span><p><span class= "bld">And let them not . . .</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>let them not be justified in thy sight;
