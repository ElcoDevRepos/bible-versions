In ancient Israel, the temple was located on Mount Zion in Jerusalem, often referred to as the "hill of the LORD." Ascending this hill signifies coming into God's presence, which was a privilege reserved for those who were ritually pure and morally upright. The concept of ascending a hill to meet with God is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>, where nations are invited to go up to the mountain of the LORD. The hill represents a place of worship and divine encounter, emphasizing the need for spiritual preparation and purity.<p><b>Who may stand in His holy place?</b><br>Standing in the holy place refers to being in the presence of God, specifically in the temple's inner courts where the priests ministered. The holy place was a sacred area, and only those who were consecrated and followed the laws of purity could enter. This requirement underscores the holiness of God and the need for humans to be sanctified to approach Him. The question posed in this phrase highlights the exclusivity and reverence associated with God's presence. It also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who, through His sacrifice, allows believers to stand in God's presence, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>, where believers are encouraged to draw near to God with a sincere heart and full assurance of faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and faithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hill_of_the_lord.htm">The Hill of the LORD</a></b><br>Often understood as Mount Zion, the location of the temple in Jerusalem, symbolizing God's dwelling place.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_place.htm">Holy Place</a></b><br>Refers to the inner sanctuary of the temple, representing God's presence and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_holiness.htm">The Call to Holiness</a></b><br>God calls His people to live lives of purity and holiness.

Who is worthy to be brought into contact with a God of such might and glory? Who shall ascend into his hill? God's "hill" is, in reality, the highest heaven, wherein he has his dwelling-place. Its representative on earth was, at this time, the Mount Zion, where it was already determined in the Divine counsels that the temple should be built, and whither David was now about to transfer the ark of the covenant (see the introductory paragraph). David asks the question as a warning to the Levites, whom he was about to employ in the transport of the ark, that they might purify themselves in heart and soul before venturing to take part in the solemn ceremony. <span class="cmt_word">Or who shall stand in his holy place?</span> Who, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, shall stand and minister inside the tabernacle, when the ark has been placed therein, and it has thus become, in a special sense, God's holy place? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/24-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">may ascend</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5927.htm">Strong's 5927: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ascend, in, actively</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the hill</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;har-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2022.htm">Strong's 2022: </a> </span><span class="str2">Mountain, hill, hill country</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">may stand</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1437;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;q&#363;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6965.htm">Strong's 6965: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arise, stand up, stand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in His holy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#601;&#183;&#353;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6944.htm">Strong's 6944: </a> </span><span class="str2">A sacred place, thing, sanctity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">place?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1511;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(bim&#183;q&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4725.htm">Strong's 4725: </a> </span><span class="str2">A standing, a spot, a condition</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">OT Poetry: Psalm 24:3 Who may ascend to Yahweh's hill?
