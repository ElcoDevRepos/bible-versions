In the context of <a href="/psalms/48.htm">Psalm 48</a>, the "they" refers to the kings or enemies of Zion who approach with the intent to conquer. The sight of Jerusalem, particularly the city of God, leaves them in awe. Historically, Jerusalem was a fortified city, and its defenses were a source of pride and security for its inhabitants. Theologically, this can be seen as a reflection of God's protection over His people, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/2_chronicles/20-29.htm">2 Chronicles 20:29</a>, where the fear of God fell on all the kingdoms when they heard how the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel. This astonishment can also be linked to the divine presence in Zion, which is a type of Christ, as He is the ultimate revelation of God's glory and power.<p><b>they fled in terror.</b><br>The reaction of fleeing in terror indicates a complete reversal of the enemies' intentions. This reflects the power and might of God in defending His people, as seen in numerous biblical accounts where God intervenes on behalf of Israel, such as in <a href="/exodus/14-25.htm">Exodus 14:25</a>, where the Egyptians fled from the Israelites at the Red Sea. Theologically, this can be seen as a demonstration of God's sovereignty and the futility of opposing His will. The fear and retreat of the enemies can also be seen as a prophetic picture of the ultimate defeat of evil at the end of times, as described in <a href="/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19-21</a>, where the forces of evil are defeated by Christ. This phrase underscores the theme of divine protection and the assurance that God is a refuge for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion/jerusalem.htm">Zion/Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city of God, often symbolizing God's presence and protection.
