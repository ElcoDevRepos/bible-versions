The hunger and thirst symbolize a deeper spiritual longing for God, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42:1-2</a>, where the psalmist expresses a thirst for God. Historically, the Israelites experienced literal hunger and thirst in the desert (<a href="/exodus/16-3.htm">Exodus 16:3, 17</a>:3), which God addressed by providing manna and water. This provision prefigures Jesus Christ, who declared Himself the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>) and offered "living water" (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>), fulfilling the spiritual needs of humanity.<p><b>their soul fainted within them.</b><br>The fainting of the soul indicates a state of despair and helplessness, often experienced by the Israelites when they faced trials in the wilderness. This condition reflects a broader biblical theme of human dependency on God for strength and sustenance, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29-31</a>, where God promises to renew the strength of those who wait on Him. The fainting soul also points to the need for spiritual renewal and salvation, which is ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who offers rest for the weary soul (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>). This phrase underscores the human condition of spiritual exhaustion and the divine provision of restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>This Psalm is traditionally understood to reflect the experiences of the Israelites, particularly during their wilderness wanderings after the Exodus from Egypt. They often faced physical hunger and thirst, which tested their faith and reliance on God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting of the wilderness is significant as it represents a place of testing and dependence on God.

Their hunger was not imaginary; it was a bodily ache that reminded them of absolute dependence on God.<p>&#8226; God had allowed Israel to experience physical lack before&#8212;&#8220;The whole congregation&#8230;said, &#8216;You have brought us into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/exodus/16-3.htm">Exodus 16:3</a>). He then sent manna, proving that He &#8220;humbles you&#8230;to make you know that man does not live on bread alone&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The lesson stretches beyond Israel. Jesus later says, &#8220;I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to Me will never hunger&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), echoing the truth that every empty stomach ultimately points to Him.<p>So, when the psalmist writes, &#8220;They were hungry,&#8221; he records both a literal desert experience and a spiritual signpost: earthly cravings expose our deeper need for God&#8217;s provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and thirsty</b><p>Desert travel meant relentless dehydration.

Such fainting is what happens when human endurance meets its limit.<p>&#8226; Yet the collapse becomes the turning point: &#8220;Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and He delivered them from their distress&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/107-6.htm">Psalm 107:6</a>). Isaiah echoes the pattern: &#8220;Even youths grow weary&#8230; but those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-30.htm">Isaiah 40:30&#8211;31</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness shines brightest when our strength is gone (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9&#8211;10</a>).
