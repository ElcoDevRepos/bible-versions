This struggle is a common theme in wisdom literature, such as in the Book of Job. The attempt to understand divine justice and the prosperity of the wicked is a recurring biblical theme, reflecting the human quest for meaning in the face of life's injustices. This phrase indicates a personal effort to comprehend a complex spiritual and moral dilemma, highlighting the limitations of human understanding without divine revelation.<p><b>it was troublesome in my sight</b><br>The psalmist expresses a deep emotional and intellectual struggle. The Hebrew word for "troublesome" can also imply labor or toil, suggesting that this contemplation was not only mentally taxing but also spiritually burdensome. This reflects the broader biblical theme of human limitation and the need for divine insight, as seen in Ecclesiastes, where human wisdom alone is insufficient to grasp God's purposes. The psalmist's struggle foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Christ, who provides ultimate understanding and resolution to the problem of evil and suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, Asaph was a prominent Levite singer and seer in David's court.

Verse 16 shows his turning point: &#8220;When I tried to understand &#8230;&#8221;. The focus is on his personal effort.<p>&#8226; Human reasoning has limits. Solomon admitted, &#8220;I observed all the work of God, that a man cannot comprehend what happens under the sun&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Even the righteous Job confessed, &#8220;These are but the fringes of His ways&#8221; (<a href="/job/26-14.htm">Job 26:14</a>).<p>&#8226; God invites us to seek wisdom, yet He reminds us, &#8220;My thoughts are not your thoughts&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p>Asaph&#8217;s first step&#8212;trying to figure things out on his own&#8212;mirrors our impulse to tally injustices and explain mysteries by sheer logic.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all this</b><p>&#8220;All this&#8221; looks back to verses 3-15: the wicked have sleek bodies, ease, wealth, and no pangs in death, while God&#8217;s people are chastened. Asaph&#8217;s ledger of life&#8217;s unfairness grew heavier by the line.<p>&#8226; Similar laments echo in <b><a href="/psalms/37-7.htm">Psalm 37:7-9</a></b>, <b><a href="/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a></b>, and <b><a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13-17</a></b>, where faithful servants puzzle over evil flourishing.<p>&#8226; Jesus later observed that the Father &#8220;sends rain on the righteous and the wicked&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>), affirming the same tension.<p>The phrase reminds us that the problem isn&#8217;t a single incident; it is the whole tangled web of apparent injustice under God&#8217;s rule.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it was troublesome</b><p>BSB reads, &#8220;it was troublesome in my sight.&#8221; The Hebrew idea is of wearisome toil&#8212;mental and emotional exhaustion.<p>&#8226; David felt similar strain: &#8220;My heart is in anguish within me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/55-4.htm">Psalm 55:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; When Jeremiah pondered Judah&#8217;s ruin he cried, &#8220;My soul will weep in secret&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/13-17.htm">Jeremiah 13:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul could relate, &#8220;We were burdened beyond our ability&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>).<p>Trying to decode life&#8217;s inequities without God&#8217;s bigger picture can drain joy, foster envy, and erode faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in my sight</b><p>The core issue is perspective.

Asaph&#8217;s attempt to make sense of the prosperity of the wicked led only to weary frustration. The verse reminds us that:<p>&#8226; Human understanding, apart from God, cannot untangle the paradoxes of life.<p>&#8226; The accumulation of unanswered &#8220;why&#8221; questions produces inner turmoil.<p>&#8226; Our natural sight is too short-sighted; only by entering God&#8217;s presence and adopting His eternal viewpoint can peace return.<p>The verse points forward to the sanctuary encounter of verse 17, where divine perspective silences envy and steadies faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/73.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">When I thought . . .</span><span class= "ital">--i.e., when I reflected in order to know this</span>--when I tried to think the matter out, get at the bottom of it.
