Throughout the Bible, God's justice is a central theme, seen in His dealings with nations and individuals. In the Old Testament, God's justice is often demonstrated through His laws given to Israel, which reflect His holy nature (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>). The justice of God is also a key aspect of His covenant relationship with His people, where He promises to uphold righteousness and punish wickedness. In the New Testament, Jesus Christ embodies God's justice, fulfilling the law and offering salvation through His sacrificial death (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25-26</a>). This phrase reassures believers that God is actively involved in the world, ensuring that justice prevails.<p><b>the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the principle of retribution, where the wicked face consequences for their actions. The imagery of being "ensnared" suggests a trap or a pitfall, often used in the Psalms to describe the fate of the wicked (<a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15-16</a>). This reflects the biblical teaching that sin carries its own punishment, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22</a>, where the wicked are caught in their own iniquities. Historically, this principle is evident in the downfall of nations and individuals who opposed God's will, such as Pharaoh in the Exodus narrative. Theologically, it underscores the moral order established by God, where evil ultimately leads to destruction.<p><b>Higgaion Selah</b><br>"Higgaion" is a term that appears infrequently in the Psalms and is thought to indicate a meditative or reflective pause, possibly a musical notation. "Selah" is more common, often interpreted as a pause for contemplation or a musical interlude. Together, these terms suggest a moment for the reader or listener to reflect deeply on the preceding truths about God's justice and the fate of the wicked. This pause invites believers to consider the implications of divine justice in their own lives and the world around them, encouraging a response of worship, repentance, or trust in God's righteous governance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and faithfulness.

<a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>).<p>- We do not guess what justice looks like; we observe it in the Lord&#8217;s interventions&#8212;flooding the earth in Noah&#8217;s day (<a href="/bsb/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6-8</a>), toppling Pharaoh&#8217;s power at the Red Sea (<a href="/bsb/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>), and ultimately judging sin at the cross where &#8220;mercy and truth have met together; righteousness and peace have kissed&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/85-10.htm">Psalm 85:10</a>).<p>- When God acts justly, the world sees who He is. <a href="/jeremiah/9-24.htm">Jeremiah 9:24</a> says He &#8220;exercises loving devotion, justice, and righteousness on the earth&#8212;for I delight in these things.&#8221; In other words, justice is not an occasional hobby for God; it is His heart on display.<p>- For the believer, this line invites worship and assurance: the same Lord who saved Israel and vindicated Christ will set everything right in our lives too (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands</b><p>- Scripture consistently shows a boomerang effect on evil. The pit an evildoer digs becomes his own trap (<a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15-16</a>). Haman builds gallows for Mordecai and ends up hanging on them (<a href="/esther/7-10.htm">Esther 7:10</a>).<p>- Solomon summarizes the principle: &#8220;So they will eat the fruit of their own way&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/1-31.htm">Proverbs 1:31</a>). Paul echoes it centuries later: &#8220;Whatever a man sows, he will reap&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s justice is therefore self-evident; He often lets sin collapse on itself. This serves two purposes:<p>&#8226; It vindicates God&#8217;s righteousness without believers taking revenge (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p>&#8226; It warns the rebellious that no sin is harmless or hidden (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>).<p>- For the faithful, this line offers relief. We may see injustice flourish for a season, but evil is busy weaving its own snare. God&#8217;s timing may test our patience, yet His justice never fails (<a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Higgaion Selah</b><p>- &#8220;Selah&#8221; signals a pause. &#8220;Higgaion&#8221; suggests thoughtful meditation. Together they invite us to stop, breathe, and let the two preceding truths sink in (<a href="/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>; 4:4).<p>- Pausing is not wasted time; it is worship. As we dwell on God&#8217;s perfect justice and the self-destruction of wickedness, our fears shrink and our faith steadies (<a href="/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>).<p>- Use the pause to:<p>&#8226; Thank God that His justice is sure and personal.<p>&#8226; Release any urge for retaliation, trusting His timing.<p>&#8226; Pray for the wicked to repent before their own works destroy them (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a> assures us that the Lord&#8217;s justice is both His calling card and His courtroom. His righteous interventions reveal who He is, while evil collapses under its own weight, proving that sin carries built-in judgment. A holy pause invites us to savor these truths, rest in God&#8217;s fairness, and live confidently under His watchful, just hand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">The Lord.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Jehovah hath made himself known.

In the two latter places it is translated; in <a href="/psalms/19-14.htm" title="Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in your sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.">Psalm 19:14</a>, "meditation;" in <a href="/psalms/92-4.htm" title="For you, LORD, have made me glad through your work: I will triumph in the works of your hands.">Psalm 92:4</a>, "solemn sound." Both meanings are etymologically possible, but the word apparently, indicates some change in the music, or possibly, as joined with <span class= "ital">selah, </span>a direction to some particular part of the orchestra.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is known by the judgment which he executeth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the Lord hath made himself known</span>; <span class="accented">he executeth judgment</span> (see the Revised Version; and comp. <a href="/ezekiel/20-9.htm">Ezekiel 20:9</a>). The two clauses are grammatically distinct, though no doubt closely connected in their meaning. God makes himself known - manifests his character, by the judgments which he executes, shows himself just, perhaps severe, certainly One who "will not at all acquit the wicked" (<a href="/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands</span>. Some translate, "he snareth the wicked," or, "by snaring the wicked" - the special way in which God manifests himself (see Kay, p. 31; 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 190). Higgaion. This word is found in three other places only, viz. <a href="/psalms/19-14.htm">Psalm 19:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/92-3.htm">Psalm 92:3</a>; and <a href="/lamentations/3-61.htm">Lamentations 3:61</a>. In the first it is translated "meditation," and has clearly that meaning; in the second it is supposed to mean "a gentle strain:" in the third it seems best rendered by "musing" or "reflection." Here it stands by itself, as a sort of rubrical direction, like the following word, "Selah." Some suppose it a direction to the choir to play a gentle strain of instrumental music as an interlude; others regard it as enjoining upon the congregation a space of quiet "meditation" (see Hengstenberg, <span class="accented">ad loc.</span>;
