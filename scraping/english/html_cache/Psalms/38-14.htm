In the biblical context, being unable to hear can symbolize a lack of understanding or awareness. In ancient Israel, hearing was often associated with obedience and wisdom, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, "Hear, O Israel." The psalmist's comparison to a man who cannot hear may indicate a sense of isolation or being cut off from divine guidance. This imagery can also be connected to the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who silently endures affliction, prefiguring Christ's own silent suffering during His trial and crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-12.htm">Matthew 27:12-14</a>).<p><b>whose mouth offers no reply</b><br>This phrase suggests a deliberate choice to remain silent in the face of accusation or adversity. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, silence could be a sign of wisdom or resignation. <a href="/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28</a> states, "Even a fool is considered wise if he keeps silent." The psalmist's silence may reflect a trust in God to be his defender, as seen in <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>, "The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still." This also parallels Jesus' response during His trial, where He chose not to defend Himself against false charges (<a href="/mark/15-3.htm">Mark 15:3-5</a>), fulfilling the prophecy of the suffering servant who "did not open his mouth" (<a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to King David, this psalm is a penitential psalm where David expresses deep sorrow for his sins and the resulting physical and emotional suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The psalm references adversaries who take advantage of David's weakened state, highlighting the theme of persecution and betrayal.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate recipient of David's plea for mercy and healing, emphasizing the relationship between the psalmist and the divine.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_silence.htm">The Power of Silence</a></b><br>Silence can be a powerful response in the face of accusation or conflict, allowing God to be our defender.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_justice.htm">Trust in God's Justice</a></b><br>By not responding to his enemies, David demonstrates trust in God's ultimate justice and timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_suffering.htm">Humility in Suffering</a></b><br>David's silence reflects a humble acceptance of his situation, recognizing his need for God's mercy and intervention.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/self-control_and_restraint.htm">Self-Control and Restraint</a></b><br>Practicing restraint in speech can prevent further conflict and demonstrate spiritual maturity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayerful_dependence.htm">Prayerful Dependence</a></b><br>In times of distress, turning to God in prayer rather than reacting impulsively can lead to peace and resolution.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_38_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 38:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_38_14_Rely_on_God_in_silence.htm">How does Psalm 38:14 encourage reliance on God during times of silence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_David_s_response_in_Psalm_38_14.htm">What can we learn from David's response to adversity in Psalm 38:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_38_14_and_Jesus_silence_link.htm">How does Psalm 38:14 connect with Jesus' silence before His accusers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Psalm_38_14_s_patience.htm">How can we apply the patience shown in Psalm 38:14 to our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Psalm_38_14_teach_trust.htm">In what ways does Psalm 38:14 teach us to trust God's timing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_38_14_Silence_in_suffering.htm">How does Psalm 38:14 reflect the theme of silence in suffering?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_influenced_Psalm_38_14.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 38:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_38_14_s_impact_on_divine_dialogue.htm">How does Psalm 38:14 challenge our understanding of communication with God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_38.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 38?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_is_sunday_1_significant.htm">What insights does Day 38 offer on spiritual growth?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_a_godly_man.htm">What defines a godly man?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_'sin_no_more'_inconsistent_with_scripture.htm">If Jesus commanded the healed man to 'sin no more' (John 5:14), implying sin caused his condition, isn't that inconsistent with other Scriptures that refute direct sin-illness links?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_god_expect_from_us.htm">What does God expect from us?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 38:14 Mean</div><b>I am like a man who cannot hear</b><p>&#8226;
