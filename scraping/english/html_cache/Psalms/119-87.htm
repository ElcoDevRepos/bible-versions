Historically, the psalmist, often attributed to David, faced numerous threats from enemies, including King Saul and foreign adversaries. This expression of being nearly wiped out resonates with the experiences of the Israelites, who frequently faced existential threats from surrounding nations. Theologically, it echoes the trials faced by God's people throughout the Bible, such as the near annihilation of the Jews in the book of Esther. It also prefigures the suffering of Christ, who faced rejection and persecution, culminating in His crucifixion. The phrase underscores the reality of spiritual warfare and the believer's vulnerability in a fallen world.<p><b>but I have not forsaken Your precepts</b><br>Despite the severe trials, the psalmist's commitment to God's law remains steadfast. This reflects the biblical theme of perseverance in faith, as seen in Job's unwavering trust in God despite his suffering. The precepts refer to God's commandments and teachings, which are central to the life of a believer. This commitment to God's word is a recurring theme in <a href="/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, emphasizing the importance of Scripture as a guide and source of strength. The phrase also points to the New Testament teaching of abiding in Christ and His word (<a href="/john/15-7.htm">John 15:7</a>). It highlights the believer's call to remain faithful to God's commands, even in the face of adversity, mirroring Christ's obedience to the Father throughout His earthly ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who expresses his deep devotion to God's law amidst persecution.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/persecutors.htm">Persecutors</a></b><br>The unspecified adversaries who threaten the psalmist's life, representing any force or group opposing the faithful.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_precepts.htm">God's Precepts</a></b><br>The divine laws and commandments that the psalmist remains committed to, despite external pressures.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_faith.htm">Perseverance in Faith</a></b><br>Despite severe trials, the psalmist's unwavering commitment to God's precepts serves as a model for enduring faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_god's_word.htm">Value of God's Word</a></b><br>The psalmist's refusal to forsake God's precepts highlights the importance of valuing and adhering to Scripture in all circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_resilience.htm">Spiritual Resilience</a></b><br>The psalmist's experience teaches believers to develop spiritual resilience, trusting in God's word even when facing life's adversities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_protection.htm">Divine Protection</a></b><br>While the psalmist faced near destruction, his survival underscores the protective power of God's word and presence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_righteousness.htm">Commitment to Righteousness</a></b><br>The psalmist's dedication to God's precepts, despite opposition, encourages believers to prioritize righteousness over comfort or safety.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_119_87_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 119:87?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_119_87_Persevere_through_trials.htm">How can Psalm 119:87 inspire perseverance in the face of adversity today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_almost_wiped_me_reveal.htm">What does "almost wiped me from the earth" reveal about the psalmist's trials?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Psalm_119_87_to_Jesus_endurance.htm">How does Psalm 119:87 connect with Jesus' endurance in the Gospels?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_stay_true_to_God_under_stress.htm">In what ways can we remain faithful to God's precepts under pressure?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_119_87_Trust_God_s_deliverance.htm">How can Psalm 119:87 encourage us to trust God's deliverance in difficult times?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_119_87_Faith_s_endurance_in_trials.htm">What does Psalm 119:87 reveal about enduring faith amidst persecution?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_119_87_and_divine_protection.htm">How does Psalm 119:87 relate to the theme of divine protection?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Psalm_119_87.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 119:87?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_119.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 119?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what's_psalm_119's_main_message.htm">What is the central message of Psalm 119?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/key_themes_in_david's_psalms.htm">What are the key themes in the Psalms of David?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_david's_authorship_of_psalm_119.htm">How can we reconcile the traditional view that Psalm 119 was authored by David with scholarly assertions that it may have multiple authors or was written much later (Psalm 119)?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_do_psalms,_hymns,_and_songs_differ.htm">What distinguishes psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 119:87 Mean</div><b>They almost wiped me</b><p>&#8226; The psalmist speaks of a near-total annihilation.
