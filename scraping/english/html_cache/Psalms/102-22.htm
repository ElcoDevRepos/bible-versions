Biblically, this reflects the prophetic vision of a time when all nations will come together in unity. The idea of nations assembling is seen in prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>, where nations stream to the mountain of the Lord. Historically, the gathering of nations was a rare occurrence, often only seen in times of war or significant political alliances. This assembly, however, is for a divine purpose, indicating a shift from earthly to heavenly priorities.<p><b>to serve the LORD</b><br>The service to the LORD implies worship and obedience, a theme prevalent throughout the Psalms and the entire Bible. This service is not just ritualistic but involves a heartfelt commitment to God's will. Theologically, this points to the ultimate reign of God over all creation, as seen in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9-10</a>, where a multitude from every nation worships before the throne. This service is a fulfillment of the Abrahamic covenant, where all nations would be blessed through his seed, ultimately realized in Jesus Christ. The phrase underscores the eschatological hope of a restored creation where God is universally acknowledged and worshiped.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peoples_and_kingdoms.htm">Peoples and Kingdoms</a></b><br>This phrase refers to the diverse nations and groups of people across the earth.
