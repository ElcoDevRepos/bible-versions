In biblical times, words were powerful tools for both blessing and cursing. The psalmist, traditionally understood to be David, often faced enemies who used words to undermine and attack him. This phrase can be connected to the broader biblical theme of the power of the tongue, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>, which states that "death and life are in the power of the tongue." The enemy's voice here may also symbolize spiritual adversaries, aligning with <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, which speaks of spiritual warfare against rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms.<p><b>at the pressure of the wicked</b><br>The "pressure of the wicked" indicates a sense of being overwhelmed or oppressed by those who do evil. This pressure could be physical, emotional, or spiritual. Historically, David faced numerous adversaries, including King Saul and his own son Absalom, who sought to harm him. The term "wicked" in the Psalms often refers to those who are morally corrupt and opposed to God's ways. This pressure can be seen as a type of the trials faced by Jesus Christ, who was also oppressed by the wicked, as described in the Gospels, particularly during His passion and crucifixion.<p><b>For they bring down disaster upon me</b><br>This phrase reflects the intent and actions of the psalmist's enemies to cause harm and destruction. The word "disaster" implies a significant and possibly life-threatening situation. In the historical context, David experienced numerous plots against his life, such as those by Saul and Absalom. This can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate disaster brought upon Jesus by His enemies, leading to His crucifixion. Theologically, this reflects the reality of living in a fallen world where the righteous often suffer at the hands of the wicked, a theme explored throughout the Psalms and the book of Job.<p><b>and resent me in their anger</b><br>The resentment and anger of the psalmist's enemies highlight the deep-seated animosity they hold. This anger could stem from jealousy, fear, or a desire for power. In David's life, Saul's anger and resentment were fueled by jealousy over David's success and popularity. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of the righteous being hated without cause, as seen in <a href="/john/15-25.htm">John 15:25</a>, where Jesus states that He was hated without reason. The anger of the wicked is often irrational and rooted in their opposition to God's anointed, whether it be David or Christ Himself.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/55.htm">Psalm 55</a>, David is expressing his distress and seeking God's intervention against his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The adversaries of David, who are causing him distress through their words and actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wicked.htm">Wicked</a></b><br>Those who are morally wrong or evil, contributing to David's turmoil.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, it is often the backdrop for David's psalms, representing a place of both refuge and conflict.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate refuge and source of strength for David amidst his trials.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_spiritual_warfare.htm">Understanding Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Recognize that the pressures and reviling from enemies can be part of a larger spiritual battle.

Saul&#8217;s repeated attempts on David&#8217;s life (<a href="/1_samuel/19-1.htm">1 Samuel 19:1-2</a>) and the plotting of those who &#8220;devise mischief in their hearts&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/140-1.htm">Psalm 140:1-2</a>) illustrate the point.<p>&#8226; Disaster includes ruined reputation, shattered relationships, or actual violence.<p>&#8226; God sees every plot (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>) and &#8220;makes all things work together for good&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>), even turning intended evil into eventual blessing, as He did for Joseph (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>resent me in their anger</b><p>&#8220;And resent me in their anger&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/55-3.htm">Psalm 55:3</a>).
