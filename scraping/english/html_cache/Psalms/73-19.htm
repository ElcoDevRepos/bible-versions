In biblical context, this sudden destruction is often seen as a divine act of judgment. The Bible frequently warns that those who live in opposition to God's ways may experience sudden calamity (<a href="/proverbs/6-15.htm">Proverbs 6:15</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>). The imagery of being "laid waste" suggests total ruin, reminiscent of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>), where judgment came swiftly and completely.<p><b>completely swept away by terrors!</b><br>The phrase "completely swept away" indicates total eradication, leaving no trace behind. This can be connected to the flood narrative in <a href="/genesis/7.htm">Genesis 7</a>, where the wicked were entirely wiped out by the waters. The "terrors" refer to the overwhelming fear and panic that accompany divine judgment. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, such language would resonate with the fear of invading armies or natural disasters, both seen as instruments of divine retribution. This phrase also echoes the fate of the Egyptians in the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-27.htm">Exodus 14:27-28</a>), where they were suddenly and completely destroyed, serving as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, Asaph was a prominent Levite singer and seer in David's court.

The psalmist has been struggling with the apparent ease of the wicked, yet here he witnesses the speed with which God&#8217;s justice arrives.<p>- Scripture often highlights the unexpected timing of divine judgment:<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/6-15.htm">Proverbs 6:15</a> says of the schemer, &#8220;Therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in an instant he will be shattered beyond recovery.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a> warns, &#8220;While people are saying, &#8216;Peace and security,&#8217; destruction will come upon them suddenly.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus tells the rich fool in <a href="/luke/12-20.htm">Luke 12:20</a>, &#8220;This very night your soul will be required of you.&#8221;<p>- The suddenness reminds us that God&#8217;s patience is not laxity; when the appointed moment comes, consequences fall without delay.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they are laid waste</b><p>- &#8220;They are laid waste&#8221; pictures total ruin&#8212;nothing left standing of the proud life that once looked so solid.<p>- Notice the shift from prosperity (earlier in the psalm) to devastation. The contrast is deliberate: what seemed unshakable collapses in an instant.<p>- Parallel passages reinforce this certainty:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/37-38.htm">Psalm 37:38</a>: &#8220;But transgressors will all be destroyed; the future of the wicked will be cut off.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>: &#8220;All the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/18-17.htm">Revelation 18:17</a> describes Babylon&#8217;s fall: &#8220;In a single hour such great wealth has been laid waste.&#8221;<p>- For believers wrestling with injustice, this line assures that God&#8217;s scales do balance, even if the payout date is unknown to us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>completely swept away</b><p>- The phrase intensifies the prior line: not only are the wicked ruined, they are &#8220;completely swept away.&#8221; No partial judgment, no loopholes, no corner of refuge.<p>- Visualize floodwaters removing every trace; that is the image <a href="/isaiah/28-22.htm">Isaiah 28:22</a> gives: &#8220;Destruction has been decreed&#8230; making a complete end.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a> echoes, &#8220;With an overwhelming flood He will make a complete end of Nineveh.&#8221;<p>- Jesus employs the same picture in <a href="/matthew/24-39.htm">Matthew 24:39</a>, comparing end-time judgment to the flood that &#8220;took them all away.&#8221;<p>- The thoroughness of God&#8217;s action comforts the righteous: evil will not merely be dented, it will be erased.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by terrors</b><p>- The instrument of their downfall is &#8220;terrors.&#8221; The external collapse is paired with internal panic.<p>- <a href="/job/18-11.htm">Job 18:11&#8211;14</a> depicts the wicked being &#8220;terrified on every side&#8221; before being &#8220;torn from the security of his tent.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/proverbs/3-25.htm">Proverbs 3:25-26</a> encourages believers, &#8220;Do not fear sudden terror&#8230; for the LORD will be your confidence,&#8221; implying that terror is reserved for those outside His refuge.<p>- <a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a> shows kings and mighty men hiding in caves, crying for rocks to fall on them&#8212;terror overwhelming the once-powerful.<p>- These passages underline that ultimate fear belongs to those who ignored the fear of the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/73-19.htm">Psalm 73:19</a> answers the psalmist&#8217;s earlier doubts by revealing God&#8217;s decisive, sudden, and thorough judgment on the wicked. Their downfall comes without warning, leaves nothing intact, and is accompanied by paralyzing fear. For the believer, the verse is both a warning against envy and a reassurance that God&#8217;s justice, though sometimes delayed, is never denied.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/73.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">In a moment.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">in a wink. </span>(Comp.
