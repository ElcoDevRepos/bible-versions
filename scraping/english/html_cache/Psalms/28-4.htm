The concept of retribution is seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/proverbs/24-12.htm">Proverbs 24:12</a>, which emphasizes that God will repay each person according to their deeds. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of sowing and reaping, as found in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>. The psalmist's plea for justice is rooted in the understanding that God is a righteous judge who sees all actions and will administer justice accordingly.<p><b>and for their works of evil</b><br>The mention of "works of evil" highlights the moral and ethical dimensions of human actions. In the biblical context, evil deeds are those that go against God's commandments and disrupt the harmony of His creation. The psalmist's call for recompense for evil works underscores the seriousness with which God views sin. This is consistent with the teachings found in the Old Testament law, where specific consequences were prescribed for various transgressions (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-39</a>).<p><b>Repay them for what their hands have done</b><br>The imagery of "hands" signifies the tangible actions and efforts of individuals. In ancient Near Eastern culture, hands were often symbolic of power and action. This phrase emphasizes personal responsibility and the direct correlation between one's actions and the resulting divine judgment. The Bible frequently uses the metaphor of hands to describe human activity, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/59-3.htm">Isaiah 59:3</a>, where hands are described as defiled with blood, indicating guilt and wrongdoing.<p><b>bring back on them what they deserve</b><br>This plea for retributive justice is a call for God to enact His righteous judgment. The idea of receiving what one deserves is a common theme in the wisdom literature, such as in <a href="/job/34-11.htm">Job 34:11</a>, which states that God repays a person according to their deeds. The psalmist's request reflects a deep trust in God's justice system, where ultimate fairness is assured. This also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of final judgment, where each person will be judged according to their works (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this psalm, David is expressing a plea for justice against his enemies. He is a central figure in the Old Testament, known for his deep relationship with God and his role as the King of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_david.htm">Enemies of David</a></b><br>While not named specifically in this verse, the context of the psalm suggests that David is referring to those who act wickedly and oppose him, and by extension, oppose God's will.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and the one to whom David is appealing for justice.

A general notice of the imprecations of the Psalms will be found in the General Introduction (VI.). Here it is enough to remark that there is no indication of personal animosity or vindictiveness. The poet, even if expressing his own feelings, was identified with devout Israel, to whom it was natural not only to expect from Jehovah the manifestation of judgment which could alone remove the conditions that were so unfavourable to the true religion, but also to pray that He would at the same time vindicate Himself and justify those faithful to Him. (Comp. for the general thought <a href="/context/isaiah/3-8.htm" title="For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.">Isaiah 3:8-11</a>.) In the actual course of God's providence, the retribution is often very accurately apportioned to the evil deed, and the Bible contains many strong instances--<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>that of Adonibezek (<a href="/judges/1-5.htm" title="And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.">Judges 1:5</a>; <a href="/judges/1-7.htm" title="And Adonibezek said, Three score and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me.
