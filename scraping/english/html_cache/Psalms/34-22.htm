In the Old Testament, redemption often refers to God's deliverance of Israel from slavery in Egypt, as seen in <a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>. The concept of redemption is also tied to the kinsman-redeemer in the Book of Ruth, where Boaz redeems Ruth, symbolizing God's provision and protection. In the New Testament, redemption is fulfilled through Jesus Christ, who redeems humanity from sin (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>). The term "servants" here refers to those who are devoted to God, highlighting a relationship of obedience and faithfulness. This aligns with the New Testament understanding of believers as servants of Christ (<a href="/romans/6-22.htm">Romans 6:22</a>).<p><b>and none who take refuge in Him</b><br>Taking refuge in God is a recurring theme in the Psalms, symbolizing trust and reliance on God's protection and strength. This imagery is akin to seeking shelter from a storm, indicating safety and security in God's presence. In ancient Near Eastern culture, cities of refuge provided safety for those who accidentally committed manslaughter, reflecting God's provision of refuge for His people (<a href="/numbers/35-9.htm">Numbers 35:9-15</a>). Spiritually, this refuge is found in Christ, who invites all to come to Him for rest (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>). The idea of refuge also connects to the imagery of God as a fortress or stronghold (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>).<p><b>will be condemned</b><br>The assurance that those who take refuge in God will not be condemned speaks to the ultimate deliverance and justification found in Him. In the New Testament, this is echoed in <a href="/romans/8.htm">Romans 8:1</a>, which states that there is no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus. This promise of no condemnation is rooted in the sacrificial work of Jesus, who bore the penalty of sin on behalf of believers. Theologically, this reflects the doctrine of justification, where believers are declared righteous before God. The absence of condemnation assures believers of their eternal security and God's unwavering commitment to their salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal, self-existent nature and His faithfulness to His promises.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_servants.htm">His Servants</a></b><br>Those who are devoted to God, serving Him with their lives, and seeking to follow His will.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/refuge.htm">Refuge</a></b><br>A place of safety and protection, symbolizing trust and reliance on God for deliverance and security.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/condemnation.htm">Condemnation</a></b><br>The act of declaring someone guilty or worthy of punishment, which is contrasted with the redemption offered by God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/redemption_through_the_lord.htm">Redemption through the LORD</a></b><br>God is the ultimate Redeemer, offering salvation and deliverance to those who serve Him.
