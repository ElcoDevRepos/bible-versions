This event is a fulfillment of the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob regarding the land of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The driving out of nations is also a demonstration of God's sovereignty and judgment against the Canaanites' idolatry and immorality (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4-5</a>). Archaeological evidence supports the existence of various Canaanite city-states during this period, which were eventually overtaken by the Israelites.<p><b>and apportioned their inheritance</b><br>This phrase highlights God's role in dividing the land among the tribes of Israel, as described in the book of Joshua (Joshua 13-21). The land was distributed by lot, which was seen as a means of divine decision-making (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>). This apportionment was not just a physical allocation but also a spiritual inheritance, as the land was considered a gift from God, fulfilling His covenant promises. The concept of inheritance is significant in biblical theology, symbolizing the blessings and responsibilities of being God's chosen people.<p><b>He settled the tribes of Israel in their tents</b><br>This phrase indicates the establishment of the Israelites in the Promised Land, where each tribe received its designated territory. The reference to "tents" may evoke the imagery of the Israelites' nomadic past during the wilderness wanderings, contrasting with their new settled life in Canaan. This settlement was a crucial step in the formation of Israel as a nation, allowing them to develop socially, economically, and religiously. Theologically, it points to God's faithfulness in providing rest and security for His people, a theme echoed in the New Testament with the spiritual rest found in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as the one who actively drives out nations and apportions the land to Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>These are the pagan nations that occupied the Promised Land before the Israelites.
