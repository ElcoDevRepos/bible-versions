In the context of Israel's history, it often refers to the people's tendency to revert to disobedience and idolatry after periods of faithfulness. This pattern is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the Book of Judges, where Israel repeatedly falls away from God after being delivered from their enemies. The act of turning back suggests a conscious decision to abandon the covenant relationship with God.<p><b>and were faithless like their fathers,</b><br>The reference to "their fathers" points to the previous generations of Israelites who also struggled with faithfulness. This includes the generation that wandered in the wilderness for 40 years due to their lack of trust in God's promises (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>). The term "faithless" underscores a breach of trust and loyalty, highlighting a recurring theme of spiritual infidelity. This pattern of behavior serves as a warning and a lesson for future generations, emphasizing the importance of steadfast faith.<p><b>twisted like a faulty bow.</b><br>A faulty bow is one that does not shoot arrows straight, symbolizing unreliability and ineffectiveness. In ancient warfare, a dependable bow was crucial for survival and success in battle. This metaphor illustrates the Israelites' spiritual unreliability and their failure to fulfill their purpose as God's chosen people. The imagery of a twisted bow can also be connected to the idea of moral and spiritual crookedness, contrasting with the straight and narrow path of righteousness. This metaphor is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/hosea/7-16.htm">Hosea 7:16</a>, where Israel is described as a "deceitful bow," further emphasizing their unfaithfulness and the consequences of their actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience and subject of <a href="/bsb/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>, representing God's chosen people who repeatedly turned away from Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/fathers/ancestors.htm">Fathers/Ancestors</a></b><br>Refers to the previous generations of Israelites who were unfaithful to God, particularly during the wilderness wanderings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure who remains faithful despite the Israelites' repeated unfaithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness_wanderings.htm">Wilderness Wanderings</a></b><br>The period after the Exodus when the Israelites wandered in the desert for 40 years due to their disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/faulty_bow.htm">Faulty Bow</a></b><br>A metaphor used to describe the Israelites' unreliability and failure to fulfill their purpose.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_god.htm">Faithfulness to God</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were called to be faithful, we are called to remain steadfast in our relationship with God, avoiding the pitfalls of turning back to old ways.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/learning_from_the_past.htm">Learning from the Past</a></b><br>The history of the Israelites serves as a warning.

God had led Israel forward toward covenant blessing, yet they pivoted and headed the opposite way. <a href="/numbers/14-4.htm">Numbers 14:4</a> shows the same impulse: &#8220;Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt&#8221;.<p>- Turning back is never neutral; it signals distrust of God&#8217;s promises. <a href="/jeremiah/2-19.htm">Jeremiah 2:19</a> warns, &#8220;Your own backsliding will rebuke you,&#8221; underscoring the painful consequences that follow a backward step.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And were faithless</b><p>- Faithlessness is more than a lapse; it&#8217;s a settled refusal to believe and obey. <a href="/judges/2-19.htm">Judges 2:19</a> notes that after each judge died, &#8220;they turned back and behaved more corruptly,&#8221; revealing a pattern rather than an isolated fall.<p>- <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a> cautions believers, &#8220;See to it&#8230; that none of you has an evil, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God,&#8221; reminding us that faithlessness starts in the heart long before it surfaces in actions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like their fathers</b><p>- The psalmist highlights generational repetition. <a href="/bsb/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>, where Israel crafted the golden calf, stands as the classic &#8220;fatherly&#8221; failure now echoed by their descendants.<p>- <a href="/psalms/106-6.htm">Psalm 106:6</a> admits, &#8220;We have sinned like our fathers; we have done wrong and acted wickedly.&#8221; Each generation must choose faithfulness rather than assume inherited privilege inoculates them against disobedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Twisted like a faulty bow</b><p>- A bow is designed to launch arrows straight and true. A warped bow, however, sends them off course. <a href="/hosea/7-16.htm">Hosea 7:16</a> uses the same image: &#8220;They are like a faulty bow; their princes will fall by the sword.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/jeremiah/9-3.htm">Jeremiah 9:3</a> adds, &#8220;They bend their tongues like bows; lies prevail.&#8221; A twisted life bends truth, warps worship, and produces aimless living. The tragedy is potential wasted&#8212;created to hit God&#8217;s target, they misfire again and again.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/78-57.htm">Psalm 78:57</a> stacks four vivid descriptions to expose Israel&#8217;s covenant breach: they reversed direction, refused faith, recycled their ancestors&#8217; sins, and warped their God-given purpose. The verse is both a mirror and a warning: any heart that turns from trust in the Lord will drift into the same pattern of uselessness and loss. Clinging to God&#8217;s promises and walking forward in obedience keeps the bow straight, the course true, and the legacy blessed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/78.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(57) <span class= "bld">Turned aside . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">turned like a relaxed bow. </span>(See Note to <a href="/psalms/78-9.htm" title="The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.">Psalm 78:9</a>.)
