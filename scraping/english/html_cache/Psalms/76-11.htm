The emphasis on fulfilling vows underscores the importance of integrity and faithfulness in one's relationship with God. This reflects the covenantal relationship between God and His people, where obedience and faithfulness are paramount. The call to make and fulfill vows is a reminder of the Israelites' covenant obligations, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21-23</a>, where vows are not to be delayed or neglected. This phrase also echoes the wisdom literature, such as <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>, which warns against making rash vows. In a broader sense, it points to the ultimate fulfillment of vows in Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the law and the prophets.<p><b>let all the neighboring lands bring tribute to Him</b><br>This phrase reflects the historical context of Israel as a nation surrounded by other peoples and kingdoms. Tribute was a common practice in the ancient Near East, where vassal states would bring gifts or payments to a dominant power as a sign of submission or alliance. Here, the psalmist envisions a time when surrounding nations recognize the sovereignty of the LORD and honor Him. This can be seen as a prophetic vision of the messianic kingdom, where all nations acknowledge God's rule, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a> and <a href="/zechariah/14-16.htm">Zechariah 14:16</a>. It also foreshadows the Great Commission, where the gospel is to be preached to all nations, bringing them into submission to Christ.<p><b>who is to be feared.</b><br>The fear of the LORD is a central theme in the wisdom literature, particularly in Proverbs, where it is described as the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). This fear is not merely terror but a profound reverence and awe for God's holiness, power, and justice. In the context of <a href="/psalms/76.htm">Psalm 76</a>, it highlights God's might in delivering His people and defeating their enemies, as seen in the historical backdrop of God's deliverance of Jerusalem from Assyrian forces (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35-37</a>). This fear is also a recognition of God's ultimate authority and judgment, which is a recurring theme throughout the Psalms and the prophetic writings. In the New Testament, this reverence is deepened through the revelation of Jesus Christ, who embodies the fullness of God's power and love, calling believers to live in holy fear and obedience (<a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is to be revered and worshiped.

Scripture repeatedly couples vow-making with gratitude and obedience:<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21&#8211;23</a> warns that making a vow is voluntary, but once spoken it must be kept.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4&#8211;5</a> cautions that delay in payment displeases God more than silence.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jonah/2-9.htm">Jonah 2:9</a> shows the prophet, fresh from deliverance, promising sacrifices &#8220;with a voice of thanksgiving.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14</a> connects thanksgiving and vow-keeping as worship.<p>In the psalmist&#8217;s setting&#8212;fresh remembrance of God shattering enemy weapons (<a href="/psalms/76-3.htm">Psalm 76:3</a>)&#8212;the people respond by pledging offerings, sacrifices, or specific acts of obedience. For us, vows may look like commitments of time, resources, or service made in light of Christ&#8217;s redemption. The call is simple: if we promise, we follow through.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the LORD your God</b><p>The object of every vow matters more than the vow itself. &#8220;The LORD your God&#8221; highlights relationship:<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4&#8211;5</a> commands wholehearted love toward the one true God, not a vague spirituality.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/116-12.htm">Psalm 116:12&#8211;14</a> asks, &#8220;How can I repay the LORD for all His goodness to me?&#8221; and answers by lifting the cup of salvation and fulfilling vows in His courts.<p>&#8226; <a href="/malachi/1-14.htm">Malachi 1:14</a> rebukes those who vow excellent offerings but deliver blemished substitutes, reminding us that the Lord&#8217;s name is &#8220;great among the nations.&#8221;<p>Vows are therefore personal yet God-centered&#8212;expressions of loyalty to the covenant-keeping King who first claimed us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>let all the neighboring lands bring tribute</b><p>The verse widens from Israel&#8217;s worship to global acknowledgement: &#8220;let all the neighboring lands bring tribute.&#8221; The psalm celebrates God&#8217;s victory over aggressive nations (<a href="/psalms/76-5.htm">Psalm 76:5-6</a>), so surrounding peoples are summoned to surrender offerings rather than swords. Throughout Scripture, this movement from Israel&#8217;s praise to worldwide homage recurs:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10&#8211;11</a> foresees kings of Tarshish and Sheba presenting gifts and bowing before the Messiah.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3&#8211;6</a> pictures nations and their wealth streaming to Jerusalem in the light of God&#8217;s glory.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a> envisions the kings of the earth bringing their splendor into the New Jerusalem.<p>Tribute is recognition of rightful rule. When we give our resources, honor, and obedience, we join a procession that one day will include every nation and tongue.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Him who is to be feared.</b><p>The reason for vows and tribute is clear: God &#8220;is to be feared.&#8221; This fear is not paralyzing dread but reverent awe that springs from witnessing His power. <a href="/bsb/psalms/76.htm">Psalm 76</a> has just proclaimed that at God&#8217;s rebuke, &#8220;both horse and rider fell asleep&#8221; (v. 6).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/33-8.htm">Psalm 33:8</a> calls &#8220;all the earth&#8221; to stand in awe because He spoke and it came to be.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a> links the fear of the LORD with the beginning of wisdom; right awe births right living.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/15-4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a> asks, &#8220;Who will not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name?&#8221; after the defeat of evil.<p>Healthy fear keeps worship sincere, vows genuine, and tribute wholehearted. It reminds us that the God who delivers is also the God who judges.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/76-11.htm">Psalm 76:11</a> invites an active, twofold response to God&#8217;s mighty rule:<p>1. Personally&#8212;make promises that match His mercy, and keep them because integrity honors Him.<p>2. Corporately&#8212;join the nations in offering tribute, acknowledging that the King who rescues His people also reigns over all.<p>Both responses flow from holy awe. When we fear the Lord rightly, our words, wallets, and wills align in joyful obedience to the One whose power none can resist.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/76.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Vow, and pay . . .</span>--This clause seems to be addressed to the Israelites, the next to the heathen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/76.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Vow</span>, <span class="cmt_word">and pay unto the Lord your God.</span> The people of Israel are now addressed.
