The imagery of a "callous" heart suggests a hardening that prevents sensitivity to spiritual matters, akin to the hardened hearts of the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>). Biblically, a callous heart is often associated with rebellion against God (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus speaks of the people's hearts growing dull (<a href="/matthew/13-15.htm">Matthew 13:15</a>), indicating a similar spiritual insensitivity. This condition is a result of persistent sin and rejection of God's word, leading to a lack of understanding and responsiveness to His commands.<p><b>but I delight in Your law</b><br>In contrast to the callous hearts, the psalmist expresses joy and pleasure in God's law. This delight is not merely intellectual but involves a deep, heartfelt appreciation for God's instructions. The law here refers to the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, which were central to Jewish life and worship. The psalmist's delight reflects a personal relationship with God, where His commandments are seen as life-giving and beneficial (<a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>). This delight is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus fulfills the law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>) and believers are called to love God's commandments (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). The psalmist's attitude serves as a model for believers, emphasizing the importance of valuing and meditating on God's word as a source of wisdom and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who expresses a deep love and commitment to God's law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Those whose hearts are described as "hard and callous," representing individuals who reject or are indifferent to God's commandments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_law.htm">God's Law</a></b><br>The divine instructions and commandments given by God, which the psalmist delights in and meditates upon.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_hardness_of_heart.htm">Understanding Hardness of Heart</a></b><br>The Hebrew word for "hard" (tuphash) implies insensitivity and stubbornness.

Scripture repeatedly teaches that every outward act flows from the heart (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34&#8211;35</a>). When the heart is set against the Lord, external rebellion naturally follows (<a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are hard and callous</b><p>A &#8220;hard and callous&#8221; heart is unresponsive to God, much like Pharaoh&#8217;s in <a href="/bsb/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7&#8211;11</a>.<p>&#8226; It refuses conviction (<a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>).<p>&#8226; It lacks compassion (<a href="/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17</a>).<p>&#8226; It remains unmoved by truth (<a href="/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18&#8211;19</a>).<p>The psalmist is experiencing pressure from such people (<a href="/psalms/119-69.htm">Psalm 119:69</a>), yet he accurately diagnoses the root problem: spiritual numbness. <a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a> warns that sin &#8220;hardens&#8221; when left unchecked, showing this condition is the result of repeated resistance to God&#8217;s voice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but I delight</b><p>In striking contrast, the writer chooses joy. Where the opposition is cold, he is warm toward God. Delight is an active, affectionate pleasure (<a href="/psalms/37-4.htm">Psalm 37:4</a>).<p>&#8226; It is not forced duty but eager embrace (<a href="/psalms/40-8.htm">Psalm 40:8</a>).<p>&#8226; It is sustained even under affliction (<a href="/psalms/119-92.htm">Psalm 119:92</a>).<p>This delight fuels perseverance; when hearts around him grow dull, his heart grows more alive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in Your law</b><p>The &#8220;law&#8221; (torah) is God&#8217;s revealed instruction.
