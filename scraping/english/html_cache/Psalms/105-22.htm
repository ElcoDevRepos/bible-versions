This authority is significant as it demonstrates God's providence and fulfillment of His promises to Joseph, despite his earlier hardships. Joseph's ability to instruct the princes "as he pleased" indicates the trust and respect he earned, reflecting his wisdom and discernment. This mirrors the wisdom of Christ, who instructs with authority (<a href="/matthew/7-29.htm">Matthew 7:29</a>).<p><b>and teach his elders wisdom</b><br>Joseph's role in teaching the elders of Egypt highlights his God-given wisdom, which was recognized even by those outside the covenant community. This wisdom is reminiscent of Solomon, who was also renowned for his wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>). Joseph's ability to teach the elders signifies the influence of God's people in foreign lands, foreshadowing the spread of the Gospel to all nations. It also points to Christ, who is the ultimate source of wisdom (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>), teaching both Jews and Gentiles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers, rose to power in Egypt, and became second only to Pharaoh.
