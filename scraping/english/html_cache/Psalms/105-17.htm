The "man" referred to is Joseph, whose life story is a testament to God's ability to use individuals to fulfill His divine plan. Joseph's journey to Egypt was not a mere coincidence but a deliberate act of God to preserve the lineage of Israel during a time of famine. This reflects the biblical theme of God preparing the way for His people, similar to how John the Baptist was sent before Jesus (<a href="/john/1-6.htm">John 1:6-8</a>).<p><b>Joseph, sold as a slave.</b><br>Joseph's sale into slavery by his brothers (<a href="/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>) is a pivotal moment in biblical history. It demonstrates the themes of betrayal and redemption, as what was intended for harm, God used for good (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>). This event foreshadows the suffering and eventual exaltation of Jesus Christ, who was also betrayed and sold for silver (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>). Joseph's time in Egypt set the stage for the eventual Exodus, a foundational event for the nation of Israel. His story is a powerful example of faith and perseverance, showing how God can elevate the humble and use adversity to achieve His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A key figure in the Old Testament, Joseph was the eleventh son of Jacob and the first son of Rachel.
