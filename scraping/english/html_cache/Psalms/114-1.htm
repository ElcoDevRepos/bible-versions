The departure from Egypt is a central theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing liberation and God's faithfulness. The Exodus is dated around the 13th century BCE, during the reign of Pharaoh Ramses II, according to some scholars. This event is celebrated annually in the Jewish festival of Passover, which commemorates the night when the angel of death passed over the homes of the Israelites. Theologically, the Exodus prefigures the salvation offered through Jesus Christ, who delivers believers from the bondage of sin.<p><b>the house of Jacob</b><br>The term "house of Jacob" refers to the descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, who was the grandson of Abraham. This phrase emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and the patriarchs, highlighting the continuity of God's promises from Abraham to Isaac to Jacob. The "house of Jacob" signifies the collective identity of the twelve tribes of Israel. In the New Testament, this concept is expanded to include all believers as part of the spiritual Israel, as seen in passages like <a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>.<p><b>from a people of foreign tongue</b><br>This phrase highlights the cultural and linguistic differences between the Israelites and the Egyptians. The Egyptians spoke a different language and had distinct customs and religious practices, which often led to the Israelites being marginalized and oppressed. The "foreign tongue" underscores the alienation and separation experienced by the Israelites in Egypt. In a broader sense, this can be seen as a metaphor for the believer's journey from the world of sin to the kingdom of God, where they are called to be set apart and holy. The deliverance from a "foreign tongue" also foreshadows the ultimate reconciliation of all nations and languages under Christ, as depicted in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the descendants of Jacob, also known as the Israelites, who were chosen by God as His people. In this context, it signifies the collective nation that God delivered from slavery in Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A significant location in biblical history, Egypt was the land where the Israelites were enslaved for 400 years before God delivered them through Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_jacob.htm">House of Jacob</a></b><br>Another term for the Israelites, emphasizing their lineage from Jacob, who was renamed Israel by God.
