In ancient Israel, bees were common and known for their aggressive defense of their hives. The imagery suggests a situation of overwhelming odds and relentless attack. Biblically, bees are mentioned in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>, where the Amorites chased the Israelites as bees do, indicating a fierce and determined pursuit. This reflects the psalmist's experience of being besieged by adversaries, a common theme in the Psalms where the faithful often face overwhelming opposition.<p><b>but they were extinguished like burning thorns</b><br>Thorns, when set on fire, burn quickly and with intense heat but are soon consumed. This metaphor suggests that while the enemies were initially fierce and threatening, their threat was ultimately short-lived and easily overcome. In biblical times, thorns were often used as fuel for quick fires, symbolizing the temporary nature of the enemies' power. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a>, where the laughter of fools is compared to the crackling of thorns under a pot, emphasizing the fleeting nature of their threat. The psalmist's confidence in God's deliverance is highlighted here, as the enemies' efforts are rendered futile.<p><b>in the name of the LORD I cut them off</b><br>Invoking the name of the LORD signifies reliance on divine power and authority. In the Old Testament, the name of the LORD represents His character, presence, and power. The phrase "I cut them off" indicates a decisive victory over the enemies, achieved not by human strength but through divine intervention. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where God acts as the protector and deliverer. The phrase resonates with the story of David and Goliath in <a href="/1_samuel/17.htm">1 Samuel 17</a>, where David declares that he comes against Goliath in the name of the LORD, underscoring the theme of triumph through faith in God's power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to King David, the psalmist is the speaker who describes being surrounded by enemies and finding deliverance through the LORD.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>Represented metaphorically as bees, these are the adversaries that surround the psalmist, symbolizing overwhelming and persistent threats.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who provides strength and deliverance to the psalmist.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bees.htm">Bees</a></b><br>Used metaphorically to describe the numerous and aggressive nature of the psalmist's enemies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/burning_thorns.htm">Burning Thorns</a></b><br>A metaphor for the temporary and ultimately ineffective nature of the enemies' threats.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reliance_on_god's_name.htm">Reliance on God's Name</a></b><br>The psalmist's victory is attributed to the name of the LORD.

The psalm-writer is not exaggerating; the onslaught of foes was relentless, chaotic, and seemingly impossible to escape&#8212;very much like the Amorites who &#8220;chased you like a swarm of bees&#8221; in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>.<p>&#8226; The image captures panic and claustrophobia. When David spoke of &#8220;encompassing&#8221; enemies in <a href="/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a>, the feeling was the same: hemmed in on every side.<p>&#8226; Yet notice: the psalmist can still describe the situation clearly. Fear has not stolen his faith; he is alert, watching, and preparing to trust God for deliverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but they were extinguished like burning thorns</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;but they were extinguished like burning thorns;&#8221; <a href="/psalms/118-12.htm">Psalm 118:12</a>b.<p>&#8226; Thorns flare up quickly and die just as fast (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a>). That short-lived blaze mirrors how God often deals with opposition&#8212;spectacular heat, followed by sudden nothing.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/83-13.htm">Psalm 83:13-15</a> asks God to make His enemies &#8220;like a tumbleweed&#8230; as fire consumes the forest,&#8221; the same idea of brief, powerless flame.<p>&#8226; <a href="/nahum/1-10.htm">Nahum 1:10</a> says adversaries &#8220;are consumed like dry stubble.&#8221; Dry thornbushes never win against a steady fire; likewise, the strongest human conspiracy cannot stand before the Lord&#8217;s decisive breath (<a href="/isaiah/33-12.htm">Isaiah 33:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The psalmist is already looking back: what seemed overwhelming a moment ago is now a pile of ashes.

The phrase &#8220;in the name of the LORD&#8221; is not magic wording; it is confidence in God&#8217;s revealed character and covenant faithfulness.<p>&#8226; David faced Goliath &#8220;in the name of the LORD of Hosts&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>).

The weapons remain spiritual, not carnal (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>), but the outcome is the same: when God&#8217;s people act in His name and according to His will, the adversary&#8217;s swarming ends abruptly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/118-12.htm">Psalm 118:12</a> paints a three-part movement: overwhelming trouble, God&#8217;s sudden quenching of that trouble, and the believer&#8217;s active, victorious response in the Lord&#8217;s name. What begins as a buzzing, all-encompassing threat ends as useless ash, because the living God steps in. The psalm invites every reader to trade panic for trust&#8212;seeing enemies for what they are: noisy yet temporary, and seeing God for who He is: eternally able, instantly present, and unfailingly faithful.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/118.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Like bees.</span>--The image of the "bees" may be derived from <a href="/deuteronomy/1-44.htm" title="And the Amorites, which dwelled in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even to Hormah.">Deuteronomy 1:44</a> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/7-18.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.">Isaiah 7:18</a>), but the LXX. suggest that the poet employed an original and far more expressive image, for they read, "as bees surround the comb." Possibly the word <span class= "ital">comb </span>dropped out of the Hebrew text, because the copyist was thinking of <a href="/deuteronomy/1-44.htm" title="And the Amorites, which dwelled in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even to Hormah.">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The fire of thorns.</span>--See <a href="/psalms/58-9.htm" title="Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.">Psalm 58:9</a>, Note.
