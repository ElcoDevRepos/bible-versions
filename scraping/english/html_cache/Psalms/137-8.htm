Babylon was a significant city in ancient Mesopotamia, known for its wealth, power, and idolatry. In biblical history, Babylon is often seen as a symbol of opposition to God and His people. The term "daughter" suggests a close relationship or offspring, indicating the city's inhabitants or the nation itself. Babylon's role in the exile of the Israelites is crucial, as it was the empire that destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple in 586 BC, leading to the Babylonian Captivity.<p><b>doomed to destruction</b><br>This phrase prophesies the eventual downfall of Babylon. Historically, Babylon fell to the Medes and Persians in 539 BC, fulfilling prophecies found in <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/51.htm">Jeremiah 51</a>. The destruction of Babylon serves as a reminder of God's justice and sovereignty over nations. It also symbolizes the ultimate defeat of all powers that oppose God, as seen in the apocalyptic imagery of <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, where Babylon represents the world system in rebellion against God.<p><b>blessed is he who repays you</b><br>The concept of repayment here is tied to the biblical principle of justice and retribution. In the context of the psalm, it reflects the desire for divine justice against those who have wronged God's people. This echoes the lex talionis, or the law of retaliation, found in <a href="/exodus/21-24.htm">Exodus 21:24</a>, "eye for eye, tooth for tooth." The psalmist expresses a longing for the restoration of justice, which is a recurring theme throughout the Psalms and the prophetic books.<p><b>as you have done to us</b><br>This phrase highlights the principle of measure-for-measure justice. Babylon's actions against Jerusalem and the Israelites were severe, including the destruction of the Temple and the exile of the people. The psalmist's call for Babylon to be repaid in kind reflects the deep pain and desire for vindication felt by the exiled community. This mirrors the sentiment found in <a href="/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>, "As you have done, it will be done to you; your deeds will return upon your own head." The call for retribution is not merely personal vengeance but a plea for God's righteous judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughter_of_babylon.htm">Daughter of Babylon</a></b><br>This term refers to the city of Babylon, personified as a woman.
