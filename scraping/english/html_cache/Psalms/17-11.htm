In the context of David's life, this could refer to the times when King Saul pursued him (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14-15</a>). The imagery of being hunted is common in the Psalms, reflecting the real threats David faced. This pursuit can also symbolize spiritual warfare, where believers feel pursued by evil forces (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p><b>and now surround us</b><br>The idea of being surrounded implies a sense of entrapment and vulnerability. Historically, David often found himself encircled by adversaries, whether it was Saul's army or foreign enemies like the Philistines. This phrase can also be seen as a metaphor for the trials and pressures that encircle believers, testing their faith and reliance on God (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8-9</a>).<p><b>their eyes are set</b><br>This indicates a focused and determined intent by the enemies. In biblical times, the eyes were often seen as the windows to one's intentions and desires (<a href="/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22-23</a>). The enemies' fixed gaze suggests a premeditated plan to harm. This can be compared to the way Satan prowls like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<p><b>to cast us to the ground</b><br>This phrase conveys the ultimate goal of the enemies: to bring about the psalmist's downfall. In a broader spiritual sense, it reflects the adversary's desire to cause believers to stumble and fall away from their faith. The imagery of being cast to the ground can also be seen in the context of humility and submission before God, as believers are called to humble themselves under God's mighty hand (<a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of the psalm, traditionally believed to be King David, who often faced enemies and sought God's protection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The adversaries who are pursuing David, representing those who oppose the righteous.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The protector and deliverer whom David calls upon for help.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The broader context of the nation, often surrounded by hostile nations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>A possible setting for David's plea, as he often fled to the wilderness to escape his enemies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_opposition.htm">The Reality of Opposition</a></b><br>Believers will face opposition, just as David did.

David&#8217;s words are literal, rooted in real danger, but they also mirror the ongoing conflict believers face. Scripture consistently assures us that although enemies may track, encircle, and plot, God sees, shields, and ultimately delivers those who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">They have now . . .</span>--Evidently the meaning is, <span class= "ital">Wherever we go they surround us like curs, i.e., </span>they dog our footsteps.

Ewald, "they direct their eyes through the land to strike." But Mr. Burgess suggests a translation at once simple and convincing. He brings the first word back from the next verse, and points it <span class= "ital">our blood, </span>instead of the awkward <span class= "ital">his likeness. </span>He thus gets, "They have set their eyes to shed our blood on the earth." For the Hebrew verb in similar sense, comp. <a href="/isaiah/66-12.htm" title="For thus said the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall you suck, you shall be borne on her sides, and be dandled on her knees.">Isaiah 66:12</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They have now compassed us</span> in <span class="cmt_word">our steps;</span> rather, [<span class="accented">following</span>] <span class="accented">our steps</span>, <span class="accented">they now compass me</span> (comp. ver. 9; and see <a href="/1_samuel/23-26.htm">1 Samuel 23:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They have set their eyes bowing down to the earth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they have set their eyes</span>, <span class="accented">to east</span> [<span class="accented">me</span>] <span class="accented">down to the earth.</span> The simile of the lion is already in the writer's mind. As the lion, before making his spring, fixes his eyes intently upon the prey - not to fascinate it, but to make sure of his distance - with intent, when he springs, to cast the prey down to the earth; so it is now with my enemies, who have set their eyes on me.
