The term "anointed" refers to those chosen by God for a specific purpose, often kings or prophets. In the Old Testament, anointing with oil was a symbolic act of consecration (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). The anointed one in this context is likely King David, but it also prophetically points to Jesus Christ, the ultimate Anointed One (Messiah), who is saved from death through His resurrection. The assurance of salvation for the anointed underscores God's faithfulness to His covenant promises.<p><b>He answers him from His holy heaven</b><br>This part emphasizes God's transcendence and His ability to intervene from His heavenly realm. "Holy heaven" signifies the place of God's perfect rule and authority. The idea of God answering from heaven is seen throughout the Psalms and other scriptures, indicating His responsiveness to the prayers of His people (<a href="/psalms/121.htm">Psalm 121:1-2</a>). It also highlights the belief that God is not distant but actively involved in the affairs of His chosen ones.<p><b>with the saving power of His right hand.</b><br>The "right hand" symbolizes strength and power in biblical literature. It is often associated with God's mighty acts of deliverance and protection (<a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>). The right hand of God is a metaphor for His ability to save and uphold His people. In the New Testament, Jesus is described as sitting at the right hand of God, signifying His authority and power (<a href="/mark/16-19.htm">Mark 16:19</a>). This phrase assures believers of God's powerful intervention on behalf of His anointed, reinforcing the theme of divine salvation and protection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature.
