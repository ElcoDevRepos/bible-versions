In the context of the Psalms, this reflects the personal relationship between God and His people, a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament. The idea of God being "near" is also seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>, where it is stated that no other nation has a god so near to them as the LORD is to Israel. This nearness is not just physical but relational, indicating God's readiness to listen and respond. The concept of calling on the Lord is a common biblical motif, seen in passages like <a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a> and <a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>, which promise salvation to those who call on the name of the Lord.<p><b>to all who call out to Him in truth</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of sincerity and authenticity in one's relationship with God. Calling out "in truth" implies a genuine, heartfelt plea, free from deceit or hypocrisy. In the biblical context, truth is often associated with faithfulness and integrity, as seen in <a href="/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>, where God desires truth in the inward being. The call to worship God in spirit and truth is echoed in <a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>, where Jesus speaks to the Samaritan woman at the well. This requirement for truthfulness aligns with the broader biblical narrative that God desires a sincere heart, as seen in the lives of figures like David, who, despite his failings, is described as a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal presence and faithfulness to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The attributed author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/145.htm">Psalm 145</a>, a king of Israel known for his deep relationship with God and his psalms of praise and worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the psalm was originally addressed, representing God's chosen people who were to call upon Him in truth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nearness_of_god.htm">The Nearness of God</a></b><br>God is not distant or aloof; He is accessible to those who earnestly seek Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/calling_on_god_in_truth.htm">Calling on God in Truth</a></b><br>Sincerity and honesty in our relationship with God are crucial.
