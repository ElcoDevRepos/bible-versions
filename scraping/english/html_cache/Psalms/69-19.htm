In the biblical context, reproach often signifies public humiliation or criticism, which was a severe social stigma in ancient Israel. The psalmist acknowledges that God is fully aware of his suffering, indicating a personal relationship with God who sees and understands human struggles. This can be connected to the experiences of Jesus Christ, who also faced reproach and shame, particularly during His trial and crucifixion (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>). The psalmist's lament is a common theme in the Psalms, where the writer often expresses feelings of abandonment or persecution, yet maintains faith in God's ultimate justice and vindication.<p><b>All my adversaries are before You.</b><br>Here, the psalmist recognizes that God is aware of those who oppose him. In the historical and cultural context of ancient Israel, adversaries could include foreign nations, personal enemies, or even fellow Israelites who opposed the psalmist's leadership or message. This acknowledgment serves as a reminder of God's omniscience and sovereignty over all human affairs. The phrase suggests a plea for divine intervention, trusting that God will deal justly with those who cause harm. This is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to leave vengeance to God (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>). The psalmist's confidence that God sees all adversaries can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate victory over His enemies, as described in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, David is expressing his deep distress and seeking God's intervention.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/adversaries.htm">Adversaries</a></b><br>The enemies or opponents of David, who are causing him reproach, shame, and disgrace.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The omniscient and omnipresent being who is aware of David's suffering and adversaries.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience.htm">God's Omniscience</a></b><br>God is fully aware of our struggles and adversities.

All my adversaries are before You.&#8221; The first two words center the entire verse on the Lord&#8217;s intimate awareness. He is not merely informed; He is personally acquainted with everything happening to His servant (<a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; God sees the whole picture when we feel nobody else does.<p>&#8226; His knowledge is active, not passive&#8212;He is already moving toward help, as He proved when He told Moses, &#8220;I have surely seen the affliction of My people&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>my reproach</b><p>&#8220;Reproach&#8221; speaks of insults and mockery. David, the human author, endured sneers for his zeal (<a href="/psalms/69-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a>), yet he pours that hurt straight into prayer, trusting God to respond. Centuries later, this line also foreshadows Christ, who &#8220;bore the reproach&#8221; of sinners (<a href="/romans/15-3.htm">Romans 15:3</a> echoing <a href="/psalms/69-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Reproach reminds us that loyalty to God may invite ridicule.<p>&#8226; The gospel turns reproach into reward, because sharing in Christ&#8217;s sufferings aligns us with His glory (<a href="/1_peter/4-14.htm">1 Peter 4:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>my shame</b><p>Shame is the inward sting that follows reproach. By naming it, the psalmist shows that God welcomes honest emotion. The Lord who &#8220;despised the shame&#8221; of the cross (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>) understands every pang His child feels.<p>&#8226; We can admit embarrassment without fear of rejection&#8212;He already knows it.<p>&#8226; Godly sorrow need not paralyze; it can lead to repentance and renewed hope (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and disgrace</b><p>Disgrace is the public fallout&#8212;loss of reputation, status, or safety (<a href="/psalms/25-20.htm">Psalm 25:20</a>). David faced national humiliation; Jesus endured the ultimate disgrace of the cross so believers might never be put to shame (<a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6</a>).<p>&#8226; What people call disgrace, God can transform into display of His faithfulness (<a href="/lamentations/3-30.htm">Lamentations 3:30&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8226; Our identity is secured by His approval, not public opinion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All my adversaries are before You</b><p>Every enemy who plots, whispers, or attacks is fully visible to the Judge of all the earth (<a href="/psalms/37-12.htm">Psalm 37:12&#8211;13</a>). Nothing escapes His docket. When Jehoshaphat heard of invading armies, the prophet assured him, &#8220;the battle is not yours, but God&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15&#8211;17</a>). Paul echoes the same confidence: &#8220;Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, says the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s perfect awareness reassures us that justice will be served, even when delayed.<p>&#8226; Knowing our foes are before Him frees us to focus on faithfulness rather than retaliation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/69-19.htm">Psalm 69:19</a> reassures us that the Lord personally knows every insult, inward sting, and public humiliation His people suffer, and He keeps a clear view of every adversary.
