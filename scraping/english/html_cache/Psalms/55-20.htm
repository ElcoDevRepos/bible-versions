The term "companion" suggests a person with whom there was once a close relationship, possibly a friend or ally. This betrayal echoes the experience of David, who faced treachery from those he trusted, such as Ahithophel during Absalom's rebellion (<a href="/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12</a>). In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus, as both involve a trusted friend turning against the one they were close to (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>). The pain of betrayal is a universal human experience, and this verse captures the deep emotional impact of such an act.<p><b>he violates his covenant.</b><br>The breaking of a covenant in biblical times was a serious offense, as covenants were sacred agreements often made before God. This phrase indicates a deliberate and grievous breach of trust. In the ancient Near Eastern context, covenants were binding and involved solemn oaths, often sealed with sacrifices (<a href="/genesis/15-9.htm">Genesis 15:9-10</a>). The violation of a covenant could lead to severe consequences, both spiritually and socially. This breach of covenant can also be seen as a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the new covenant through His sacrifice, contrasting with human unfaithfulness. The breaking of covenants by people throughout the Bible underscores the need for a faithful Savior who would establish an unbreakable covenant with His people (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/55.htm">Psalm 55</a>, David is expressing his anguish over betrayal by a close friend.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/companion.htm">Companion</a></b><br>This refers to the person who has betrayed David, likely someone he trusted deeply.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>A solemn agreement or promise, often seen as sacred, which has been broken by the companion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of David's life and reign often centers around Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/betrayal.htm">Betrayal</a></b><br>The central event in this verse, highlighting the pain of being betrayed by someone close.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_pain_of_betrayal.htm">The Pain of Betrayal</a></b><br>Betrayal by a close friend or companion can be one of the most painful experiences.
