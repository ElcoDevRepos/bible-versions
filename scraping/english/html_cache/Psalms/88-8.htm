In the context of ancient Israel, community and relationships were vital for survival and social identity. The psalmist's lament here echoes Job's experience, where he felt forsaken by friends and family (<a href="/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13-19</a>). This separation can also be seen as a form of divine testing or discipline, a theme present throughout the Old Testament. Theologically, it underscores the human experience of feeling distant from others, which can be a metaphor for spiritual separation from God. This phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, who was abandoned by His disciples in His hour of need (<a href="/mark/14-50.htm">Mark 14:50</a>).<p><b>You have made me repulsive to them;</b><br>The psalmist feels that God has caused others to view him with disgust. This could be due to a perceived sin or affliction, as leprosy or other diseases often led to social ostracism in biblical times (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45-46</a>). The cultural context of purity laws in Israel meant that physical ailments were often seen as a sign of divine displeasure. This phrase can also be connected to the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who was despised and rejected by men. It foreshadows Christ's own experience of being despised and rejected (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>), highlighting the theme of suffering and redemption.<p><b>I am confined and cannot escape.</b><br>This expression of entrapment can be both physical and spiritual. Historically, confinement could refer to imprisonment or being trapped by circumstances beyond one's control. Spiritually, it reflects the feeling of being ensnared by sin or despair. The psalmist's cry is reminiscent of Jonah's prayer from the belly of the fish, where he felt trapped and helpless (<a href="/jonah/2-2.htm">Jonah 2:2-6</a>). This phrase also points to the ultimate confinement of death, from which only God can deliver. In a Christological sense, it prefigures Jesus' entombment and His victory over the grave, offering hope of liberation and resurrection (<a href="/matthew/28-6.htm">Matthew 28:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist (Heman the Ezrahite)</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/88.htm">Psalm 88</a>, traditionally identified as Heman the Ezrahite, is expressing deep anguish and isolation.

He does not blame fickle companions; he sees the Lord&#8217;s purposeful action.<p>&#8226; Job voiced a similar grief when he said, &#8220;He has alienated my brothers from me&#8221; (<a href="/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; David lamented, &#8220;Because of all my adversaries, I am a reproach&#8212;especially to my neighbors&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/31-11.htm">Psalm 31:11</a>).<p>Seeing God as the One who allows&#8212;even orchestrates&#8212;this separation invites us to trust His wisdom. He may be stripping away human supports so that our hearts cling to Him alone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have made me repulsive to them</b><p>Rejection deepens when friends not only leave but find us offensive. The psalmist feels like an outcast, a reminder that righteous sufferers can be misunderstood.<p>&#8226; Isaiah foretold of Christ: &#8220;He was despised and rejected by men&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>), showing that ultimate innocence does not shield one from scorn.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/psalms/109-25.htm">Psalm 109:25</a> David cried, &#8220;I am an object of scorn to them; when they see me, they shake their heads.&#8221;<p>Such verses disclose a pattern: God&#8217;s servants may be treated as repulsive so that their fellowship with the Man of Sorrows grows sweeter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am confined and cannot escape</b><p>Isolation now turns inward; the psalmist feels trapped with no exit.<p>&#8226; &#8220;He has walled me in so I cannot escape; He has weighed me down with chains&#8221; echoes <a href="/lamentations/3-7.htm">Lamentations 3:7</a>.<p>&#8226; Job felt similarly: &#8220;You put my feet in stocks&#8221; (<a href="/job/13-27.htm">Job 13:27</a>).<p>&#8226; David pleaded, &#8220;Bring my soul out of prison&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/142-7.htm">Psalm 142:7</a>), revealing that even godly hearts can feel locked away.<p>This confinement presses the sufferer toward God, who alone possesses the key. What seems like a prison can become a sanctuary where His presence is most keenly known.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/88-8.htm">Psalm 88:8</a> paints a threefold portrait of suffering: friends withdrawn, reputation stained, freedom restricted&#8212;all under God&#8217;s governance. Cross-scripture echoes show that such experiences are neither random nor unique; they align the believer with saints of old and with the Savior Himself. When companionship, approval, and mobility vanish, the Lord remains, inviting deeper dependence and promising eventual deliverance in His perfect time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/88.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">I am shut up.</span>--Not necessarily an actual imprisonment or incarceration on account of leprosy, but another figurative way of describing great trouble. <a href="/job/19-8.htm" title="He has fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he has set darkness in my paths.">Job 19:8</a> seems to have been before the poet.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/88.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me.</span> Compare the similar complaint of Job (<a href="/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13, 14</a>); and see also <a href="/psalms/31-11.htm">Psalm 31:11</a>; and <span class="accented">infra</span>, ver. 18. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast made me an abomination unto them.</span> So Job (<a href="/job/9-31.htm">Job 9:31</a>; <a href="/job/19-19.htm">Job 19:19</a>; <a href="/job/30-10.htm">Job 30:10</a>).
