This reflects a boldness and confidence in the truth of God's Word. Historically, figures like Daniel and Joseph exemplified this courage, standing before kings and rulers to declare God's truth. In the ancient Near East, kings were seen as ultimate authorities, and speaking before them required great courage and conviction. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament apostles, such as Paul, who spoke before governors and kings, as seen in <a href="/acts/26.htm">Acts 26:1-29</a>. The willingness to speak God's testimonies before kings highlights the universal authority and relevance of God's Word, transcending human power structures.<p><b>and I will not be ashamed</b><br>The psalmist's declaration of not being ashamed underscores a deep trust and confidence in God's testimonies. In a cultural context where honor and shame were significant social values, the psalmist's assurance indicates a profound belief in the righteousness and truth of God's laws. This sentiment is echoed in <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>, where Paul states he is not ashamed of the gospel. The idea of not being ashamed also connects to the prophetic anticipation of the Messiah, who would embody and fulfill God's testimonies. Jesus Christ, in His earthly ministry, exemplified this unashamed proclamation of God's truth, even in the face of opposition and persecution. The psalmist's resolve serves as an encouragement for believers to stand firm in their faith, regardless of societal pressures or the presence of influential figures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who expresses a deep love and commitment to God's law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings.htm">Kings</a></b><br>Represents rulers or people in authority before whom the psalmist is willing to speak boldly about God's testimonies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_testimonies.htm">God's Testimonies</a></b><br>Refers to the laws, decrees, and commandments given by God, which the psalmist is committed to proclaiming.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/b/boldness_in_witnessing.htm">Boldness in Witnessing</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to speak of God's truths with confidence, even in the presence of those in authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unashamed_faith.htm">Unashamed Faith</a></b><br>Our faith should be evident and unashamed, reflecting a deep trust in God's word and His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_from_the_spirit.htm">Courage from the Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit empowers us to speak boldly and wisely, especially when facing opposition or scrutiny.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_god's_word.htm">Commitment to God's Word</a></b><br>A strong commitment to understanding and living out God's testimonies equips us to share them effectively with others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/influence_of_godly_testimony.htm">Influence of Godly Testimony</a></b><br>Our testimony can have a profound impact, even on those in high positions, when we speak with integrity and conviction.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_119_46_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 119:46?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_boldly_share_Your_testimonies.htm">How can we "speak of Your testimonies" boldly in today's society?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_119_46_on_courage_to_share_God_s_Word.htm">What does Psalm 119:46 teach about courage in sharing God's Word?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Psalm_119_46_to_Matthew_28_19-20.htm">How does Psalm 119:46 connect with Jesus' command in Matthew 28:19-20?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prepare_to_share_faith_with_leaders.htm">In what ways can we prepare to "speak before kings" about our faith?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_119_46_Daily_witness_inspiration.htm">How can Psalm 119:46 inspire us to witness in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_119_46_Speak_faith_to_leaders.htm">How does Psalm 119:46 encourage believers to speak openly about their faith before leaders?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Psalm_119_46.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 119:46?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_119_46_and_biblical_courage.htm">How does Psalm 119:46 relate to the theme of courage in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_119.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 119?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/can_psalm_46_1_be_proven_historically.htm">Can the claim that 'God is our refuge and strength' (Psalm 46:1) be historically validated via archeological or extra-biblical evidence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_psalm_2_2_literal_without_records.htm">How can Psalm 2:2 be taken literally when there is no historical record of all nations conspiring against Israel's king?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_psalm_22_1_contradict_god's_faithfulness.htm">Psalm 22:1 - Does the writer's cry of abandonment contradict other biblical depictions of God's faithfulness to the righteous?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_do_the_faithful_suffer.htm">The psalm insists that following God's laws brings peace and protection, yet other Bible passages show faithful people enduring suffering and persecution (Psalm 119:165).</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 119:46 Mean</div><b>I will speak</b><p>&#8226; The verse opens with a deliberate choice.
