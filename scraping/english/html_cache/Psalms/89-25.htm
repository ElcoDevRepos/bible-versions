In biblical times, the sea often represented chaos and the unknown. By setting his hand over the sea, it implies control over these elements. This can be seen as a reference to the Davidic covenant, where God promises to establish David's lineage and kingdom. The sea could also symbolize the Gentile nations, indicating a future reign over all peoples. This foreshadows the messianic rule of Jesus Christ, who calms the stormy seas in the Gospels, demonstrating His authority over creation (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>).<p><b>and his right hand upon the rivers</b><br>The right hand is traditionally a symbol of power and strength. Placing it upon the rivers suggests control over the life-giving and sustaining forces of the earth. Rivers were crucial in ancient times for agriculture, trade, and sustenance. This imagery can be linked to the promise of a prosperous and expansive kingdom under David's line. It also connects to the prophecy of the Messiah's reign, where Jesus is seen as the source of living water (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>), providing spiritual sustenance and life. The rivers may also represent boundaries of the promised land, indicating the extent of the kingdom's reach.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ethan_the_ezrahite.htm">Ethan the Ezrahite</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, who is traditionally understood to be a wise man during the time of King Solomon. He is credited with writing this psalm, which reflects on God's covenant with David.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The psalm is a reflection on God's covenant with David, promising him an enduring dynasty. David is a central figure in the Old Testament, known for his kingship and his heart for God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea_and_rivers.htm">The Sea and Rivers</a></b><br>Symbolic elements in this verse representing vast dominion and control.
