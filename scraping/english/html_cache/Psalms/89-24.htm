In the context of <a href="/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, it refers to God's promises to David and his descendants. The Hebrew words for "faithfulness" (emunah) and "loving devotion" (chesed) are often used to describe God's steadfast love and reliability. These attributes are central to God's character and are frequently mentioned in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/36-5.htm">Psalm 36:5</a>, <a href="/psalms/57-10.htm">Psalm 57:10</a>). The Davidic Covenant, found in <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, is a key backdrop, where God promises to establish David's throne forever. This covenantal promise is seen as a precursor to the coming of the Messiah, who Christians believe is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the ultimate descendant of David.<p><b>and through My name his horn will be exalted</b><br>The "horn" is a biblical symbol of strength and power, often used to denote military might or royal authority (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a>, <a href="/psalms/132-17.htm">Psalm 132:17</a>). In ancient Near Eastern culture, the horn of an animal, such as a ram or bull, represented strength and dominance. The phrase "through My name" indicates that this exaltation and empowerment come directly from God, not through human effort. The name of God signifies His authority and presence, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, where God reveals His name to Moses. This exaltation of the horn is prophetic, pointing to the ultimate reign of the Messiah, who Christians believe is Jesus, as He is given all authority in heaven and on earth (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). The exaltation of the horn through God's name underscores the divine origin and support of the king's power, aligning with the messianic expectations of a ruler who would establish God's kingdom eternally.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ethan_the_ezrahite.htm">Ethan the Ezrahite</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, who is traditionally believed to be a wise man during the time of Solomon.
