The "hungry" can be understood both literally and spiritually, representing those who are in physical need and those who are spiritually seeking. In biblical history, God often provided for His people in times of need, such as when He provided manna for the Israelites in the wilderness (Exodus 16). The act of causing the hungry to settle suggests a divine intervention where God leads people to a place of sustenance and stability. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God as a provider and sustainer, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>, "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want."<p><b>that they may establish a city</b><br>The establishment of a city signifies a transition from wandering or instability to permanence and community. In ancient times, cities were centers of security, culture, and economic activity. The biblical narrative often contrasts the nomadic life of the patriarchs with the settled life in the Promised Land. The idea of establishing a city can also be seen as a fulfillment of God's promises, such as the promise to Abraham that his descendants would inherit the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). This phrase can also be seen as a type of the New Jerusalem, the ultimate city of God described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>, where God's people will dwell eternally.<p><b>in which to dwell</b><br>Dwelling implies a sense of belonging and rest. In the biblical context, dwelling in a city provided protection and a sense of community. This phrase echoes the biblical promise of God providing a place for His people, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10</a>, where God promises to give His people rest from their enemies and a place to dwell. Spiritually, this can be seen as a metaphor for the believer's rest in Christ, who provides ultimate security and peace. Jesus' promise in <a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>, where He speaks of preparing a place for His followers, resonates with this idea of dwelling in a secure and eternal home.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hungry.htm">The Hungry</a></b><br>Represents those in need, both physically and spiritually.
