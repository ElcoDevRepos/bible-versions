In biblical context, the mouth is often seen as a reflection of the heart (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>). Cursing here refers to invoking harm or evil upon others, which is contrary to the biblical call to bless rather than curse (<a href="/romans/12-14.htm">Romans 12:14</a>). Deceit involves misleading others, a trait condemned throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>). Violence, in this context, suggests not only physical harm but also the aggressive use of words to oppress or manipulate. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that words can be as damaging as physical actions (<a href="/james/3-6.htm">James 3:6</a>).<p><b>trouble and malice are under his tongue.</b><br>This part of the verse suggests that the wicked harbor intentions of harm and ill will, ready to be unleashed at any moment. The imagery of "under his tongue" implies that these negative traits are hidden but ready to surface, indicating a premeditated nature of sin. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, speech was a powerful tool, and the ability to control one's tongue was seen as a sign of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/10-19.htm">Proverbs 10:19</a>). The mention of trouble and malice connects to the broader biblical narrative of the heart's inclination towards evil (<a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>). This phrase also serves as a warning to believers to guard their hearts and tongues, as echoed in the teachings of Jesus and the apostles (<a href="/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked_person.htm">The Wicked Person</a></b><br>The primary subject of this verse, representing those who oppose God and His ways.
