This miraculous transformation of the Nile River's waters into blood was a direct challenge to the Egyptian gods, particularly Hapi, the god of the Nile, demonstrating the supremacy of the God of Israel. The Nile was central to Egyptian life, providing water, transportation, and fertile soil. Turning it to blood symbolized a disruption of life and order, emphasizing God's power over creation. This act also foreshadows the blood of Christ, which brings both judgment and redemption.<p><b>and caused their fish to die</b><br>The death of the fish in the Nile further underscores the severity of the plague. Fish were a staple in the Egyptian diet and an economic resource, so their death would have had significant social and economic repercussions. This event highlights the comprehensive nature of God's judgment, affecting not just the water but the ecosystem and livelihood of the Egyptians. The death of the fish also serves as a reminder of the consequences of sin and rebellion against God, as seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>, which speaks of the wages of sin being death.

By recalling the first plague, the psalmist underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness to keep His covenant with Abraham (<a href="/psalms/105-8.htm">Psalm 105:8-10</a>) and His power to humble proud nations (<a href="/psalms/107-40.htm">Psalm 107:40</a>).<p>- The verb highlights sovereignty&#8212;God is not reacting; He is directing events for His redemptive purpose, just as He controlled the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>) and later the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/3-13.htm">Joshua 3:13-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>their waters to blood</b><p>- &#8220;Waters&#8221; in <a href="/exodus/7-19.htm">Exodus 7:19</a> include rivers, canals, ponds, and reservoirs, showing a comprehensive judgment.

Turning life-giving water into blood signaled that Egypt&#8217;s life source was now a sentence of judgment.<p>- The miracle was literal, not symbolic only; Moses records, &#8220;all the water was turned to blood&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20</a>). <a href="/psalms/78-44.htm">Psalm 78:44</a> repeats the same fact, reinforcing the historicity.<p>- <a href="/revelation/16-3.htm">Revelation 16:3-4</a> looks back to this plague and projects it forward into end-times judgment, linking God&#8217;s past acts with His future justice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and caused their fish to die</b><p>- <a href="/exodus/7-21.htm">Exodus 7:21</a> states, &#8220;The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water.&#8221; The death of the fish proves the transformation was real, not an optical illusion.<p>- Practical fallout:<p>&#8226; Food scarcity&#8212;fishing was a staple industry (<a href="/isaiah/19-8.htm">Isaiah 19:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Economic blow&#8212;fish were central to trade and diet.<p>&#8226; Environmental crisis&#8212;the stench made daily life unbearable, dramatizing the cost of resisting God.<p>- Spiritually, the death of the fish struck at Egypt&#8217;s gods.
