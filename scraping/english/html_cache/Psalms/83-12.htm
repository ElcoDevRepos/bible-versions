In the context of <a href="/psalms/83.htm">Psalm 83</a>, these are historical adversaries who sought to destroy Israel. The psalmist Asaph is calling upon God to remember the threats and actions of these nations. This reflects a recurring theme in the Old Testament where Israel faces opposition from surrounding nations.<p><b>&#8220;Let us possess for ourselves</b><br>The desire to possess indicates a covetous intent to take over the land that God had given to Israel. This reflects the historical reality of territorial conflicts in the ancient Near East, where land was a primary source of wealth and power. The phrase suggests a direct challenge to God's sovereignty and His covenant promises to Israel regarding the land.<p><b>the pastures of God.&#8221;</b><br>The term "pastures" symbolizes the fertile and prosperous land of Israel, often described as a land flowing with milk and honey. This land was seen as a divine gift, and its possession was tied to the covenant relationship between God and His people. The phrase "pastures of God" underscores the sacredness of the land, as it was not just any territory but one specifically designated by God for His people. This connects to other scriptures where the land is a central element of God's promises, such as in <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/11-12.htm">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>. The desire to take these pastures can be seen as an affront to God's provision and blessing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/83.htm">Psalm 83</a>, Asaph was a prominent Levite singer and seer in David's court.
