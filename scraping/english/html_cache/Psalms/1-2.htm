This delight contrasts with the disdain or indifference often shown by the wicked. The Law of the LORD is not merely a set of rules but a revelation of God's character and will. In the historical context, the Israelites were given the Law as a covenantal guide for living in relationship with God. This delight is echoed in <a href="/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, where the psalmist repeatedly expresses love for God's commandments. The Law serves as a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled it and is the ultimate revelation of God (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>and on His law he meditates day and night</b><br>Meditation here implies a deep, continuous reflection and internalization of God's Word. The Hebrew word for meditate suggests a murmuring or speaking to oneself, indicating an active engagement with the text. This practice was common in ancient Israel, where oral tradition played a significant role. The phrase "day and night" signifies consistency and dedication, suggesting that the righteous person is constantly guided by God's Word. <a href="/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a> similarly emphasizes the importance of meditating on the Law for success and prosperity. This meditation is not passive but transformative, aligning one's life with God's will, much like how Jesus, the Word made flesh, lived in perfect obedience to the Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous_man.htm">The Righteous Man</a></b><br>The individual who finds joy and fulfillment in God's law, contrasting with the wicked described in the surrounding verses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law_of_the_lord.htm">The Law of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the Torah or the teachings and instructions given by God, which are central to the life of the righteous.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/meditation.htm">Meditation</a></b><br>The act of deeply contemplating or pondering over God's law, indicating a continuous and intentional focus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/delight_in_god's_word.htm">Delight in God's Word</a></b><br>True joy and satisfaction are found in engaging with God's Word.
