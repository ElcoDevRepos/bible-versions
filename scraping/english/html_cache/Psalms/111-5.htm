In the biblical context, "those who fear Him" refers to individuals who have a reverent awe and respect for God, acknowledging His power and authority. The provision of food can be seen as both physical sustenance and spiritual nourishment. Historically, God's provision is evident in the wilderness experience of the Israelites, where He provided manna (Exodus 16). This act of provision is a testament to God's faithfulness and His ability to meet the needs of His people. The concept of fearing God is a recurring theme in the wisdom literature, such as <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, which states that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. This fear is not about being afraid but about having a deep respect and commitment to God, which results in His blessings and provision.<p><b>He remembers His covenant forever.</b><br>This phrase underscores the eternal nature of God's promises. The covenant refers to the solemn agreements God made with His people, such as the Abrahamic, Mosaic, and Davidic covenants. These covenants are foundational to understanding God's relationship with Israel and His unfolding plan of redemption. The assurance that God "remembers" His covenant indicates His unwavering faithfulness and commitment to His promises. This is seen throughout the Old Testament, where God repeatedly acts in accordance with His covenant promises, despite Israel's unfaithfulness. The concept of an everlasting covenant is also fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who establishes a new covenant through His death and resurrection (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>). This new covenant is characterized by the forgiveness of sins and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, ensuring that God's promises are not only remembered but also fulfilled in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as the provider and covenant keeper.
