In biblical context, the concept of time is often viewed from an eternal perspective, where human life is fleeting compared to God's eternal nature. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which describes life as a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. The phrase reassures believers that God's justice will prevail in His perfect timing.<p><b>and the wicked will be no more</b><br>This statement reflects the ultimate fate of the wicked, aligning with the biblical theme of divine justice. Throughout Scripture, there is a consistent message that those who oppose God and His ways will face judgment and destruction. This is seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>, which contrasts the way of the righteous with the way of the wicked that leads to ruin. The prophetic literature, such as in <a href="/malachi/4.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>, also speaks of a day when the arrogant and evildoers will be set ablaze, leaving them neither root nor branch.<p><b>though you look for them</b><br>This phrase suggests an active search or expectation to find the wicked, perhaps reflecting the human tendency to seek justice or understand the fate of those who do wrong. It implies a future time when the wicked, who may seem prominent and powerful now, will be absent. This can be connected to the broader biblical narrative where God's people are encouraged to trust in His justice rather than taking matters into their own hands, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>, which advises believers to leave room for God's wrath.<p><b>they will not be found</b><br>The finality of this phrase underscores the complete removal of the wicked from the earth. It suggests a thorough and irreversible divine action, reminiscent of the fate of the wicked cities like Sodom and Gomorrah, which were utterly destroyed and could not be found again. This also points to the eschatological hope found in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>, where God promises a new creation free from pain, death, and sin, where the former things have passed away. The absence of the wicked is part of the fulfillment of God's promise to establish a new heaven and a new earth where righteousness dwells.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/37.htm">Psalm 37</a>, King David, is reflecting on the fate of the wicked versus the righteous.

In the context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/37.htm">Psalm 37</a>, the wicked are those who seem to prosper temporarily but ultimately face God's judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in verse 10, the righteous are implied as the contrast to the wicked.

The Lord says, &#8220;In just a little while, He who is coming will come and will not delay&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-37.htm">Hebrews 10:37</a>). Habakkuk heard the same promise: &#8220;Though it delays, wait for it, since it will surely come&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>). James urges believers, &#8220;You too, be patient; strengthen your hearts, because the Lord&#8217;s coming is near&#8221; (<a href="/james/5-8.htm">James 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; God limits the season of evil; He has fixed an endpoint.<p>&#8226; This phrase fuels perseverance&#8212;waiting with confidence that justice is not endlessly postponed (<a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;A little while&#8221; underscores that history is moving toward God&#8217;s predetermined conclusion (<a href="/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the wicked will be no more</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;and the wicked will be no more&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/37-10.htm">Psalm 37:10</a>). Scripture consistently affirms the literal removal of unrepentant evil: &#8220;You put an end to everyone who is unfaithful to You&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/73-27.htm">Psalm 73:27</a>). <a href="/proverbs/10-25.htm">Proverbs 10:25</a> notes, &#8220;When the whirlwind passes, the wicked are no more, but the righteous stand firm forever.&#8221; This does not describe a temporary timeout for the wicked but a definitive end&#8212;whether by temporal judgment (<a href="/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18&#8211;19</a>) or final judgment (<a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s holiness guarantees sin cannot endure.<p>&#8226; The wicked &#8220;will be no more&#8221; assures believers that injustice is not permanent.<p>&#8226; This line also comforts those who suffer under evil, knowing God will decisively act (<a href="/nahum/1-9.htm">Nahum 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Though you look for them</b><p>The psalm pictures a future search: &#8220;though you look for them&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/37-10.htm">Psalm 37:10</a>). Isaiah paints the same scene: &#8220;Though you search for your enemies, you will not find them&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/41-12.htm">Isaiah 41:12</a>). After the Red Sea, Moses told Israel, &#8220;The Egyptians whom you see today, you will never see again&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Righteous people will actively recognize the absence of former oppressors.<p>&#8226; Memory of their power will fade into testimony of God&#8217;s deliverance (<a href="/psalms/32-7.htm">Psalm 32:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Even diligent effort to uncover past tyrants will prove futile&#8212;evil&#8217;s footprint erased.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will not be found</b><p>The conclusion is emphatic: &#8220;they will not be found&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/37-10.htm">Psalm 37:10</a>).
