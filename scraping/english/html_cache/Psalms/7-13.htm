In the biblical context, God is often depicted as a warrior who fights on behalf of His people (<a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>). The preparation of weapons indicates a deliberate and just response to wickedness. Historically, the imagery of weapons would resonate with ancient Israel, a nation familiar with warfare and the need for defense against enemies. Theologically, this can be seen as a metaphor for God's righteous judgment against sin, emphasizing His sovereignty and justice.<p><b>He ordains His arrows with fire.</b><br>The imagery of arrows with fire signifies the intensity and thoroughness of God's judgment. In ancient warfare, arrows were sometimes set on fire to cause greater destruction, symbolizing the consuming nature of divine retribution. This can be connected to other scriptures where fire represents God's purifying and judgmental power, such as in <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a> and <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>. The use of fire also points to the holiness of God, who cannot tolerate sin. In a typological sense, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's role in executing judgment at His second coming, where He will judge the living and the dead with righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/7.htm">Psalm 7</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who often wrote psalms during times of distress and persecution.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine warrior and judge who prepares weapons against the wicked.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_david.htm">Enemies of David</a></b><br>The adversaries who falsely accuse and pursue David, prompting his plea for divine intervention.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cush,_a_benjamite.htm">Cush, a Benjamite</a></b><br>Mentioned in the title of the psalm, possibly a specific adversary or representative of David's enemies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/arrows_with_fire.htm">Arrows with Fire</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's judgment and wrath against the wicked.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_righteous_judge.htm">God as Righteous Judge</a></b><br>God prepares His weapons against the wicked, affirming His role as a just and righteous judge who will not let evil go unpunished.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_protection_and_justice.htm">Divine Protection and Justice</a></b><br>Believers can trust in God's protection and justice, knowing that He is actively working against the forces of evil.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_fire.htm">Symbolism of Fire</a></b><br>Fire represents purification and judgment.

God is not merely warning; He is pledging action against the unrepentant, just as He did in <a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a> when He promised decisive blows against Egypt.<p>&#8226; Because these weapons are &#8220;prepared,&#8221; the sinner&#8217;s delay in repentance only meets a God whose justice is fully primed (<a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>).<p>&#8226; For the righteous, this preparation brings comfort: the LORD defends them with the same resolve He displayed when He delivered Israel at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He ordains His arrows with fire</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Ordains&#8221; signals purpose and precision.
