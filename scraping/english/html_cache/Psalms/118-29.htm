In the context of ancient Israel, giving thanks was a communal activity often expressed through psalms, sacrifices, and festivals. The Hebrew word for "thanks" is "yadah," which implies a public declaration of God's deeds. This call to gratitude is echoed throughout the Psalms and is a central theme in Israel's worship practices, as seen in <a href="/1_chronicles/16-34.htm">1 Chronicles 16:34</a> and <a href="/psalms/136.htm">Psalm 136</a>.<p><b>for He is good</b><br>The goodness of the LORD is a foundational attribute in the Hebrew Scriptures. This goodness is not merely moral but encompasses God's kindness, mercy, and provision for His people. The declaration of God's goodness is a recurring theme in the Psalms and is often linked to His creation and covenant faithfulness. In <a href="/exodus/33-19.htm">Exodus 33:19</a>, God proclaims His goodness to Moses, highlighting His gracious and compassionate nature. This goodness is ultimately fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ, who embodies God's perfect goodness.<p><b>His loving devotion endures forever</b><br>The phrase "loving devotion" translates the Hebrew word "chesed," which is a complex term encompassing love, mercy, faithfulness, and covenant loyalty. This enduring devotion is a key aspect of God's relationship with Israel, as seen in His covenants with Abraham, Moses, and David. The eternal nature of God's "chesed" assures believers of His unchanging commitment and faithfulness. This concept is echoed in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, where God's mercies are described as new every morning. In the New Testament, this enduring love is manifested through Christ's sacrificial death and resurrection, offering eternal life to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Yahweh is the covenant-keeping God of Israel, whose goodness and steadfast love are celebrated.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to King David, the psalmist is the one who calls the people to give thanks, reflecting a personal and communal relationship with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of Israel is the primary audience, often called to remember and celebrate God's enduring love and faithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>While not explicitly mentioned in this verse, the context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/118.htm">Psalm 118</a> suggests a setting of worship, likely in or around the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exodus.htm">The Exodus</a></b><br>The historical backdrop of God's enduring love often recalls the Exodus, where God's faithfulness and deliverance were powerfully demonstrated.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_god's_goodness.htm">The Nature of God&#8217;s Goodness</a></b><br>God's goodness is intrinsic to His character.
