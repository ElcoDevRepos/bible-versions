In biblical times, lending and borrowing were common practices, often governed by laws found in the Torah, such as in <a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25-27</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>. The failure to repay a debt was not only a financial issue but also a breach of trust and integrity. <a href="/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7</a> states, "The borrower is slave to the lender," emphasizing the moral obligation to repay debts. The wicked's failure to repay reflects a deeper spiritual and moral deficiency, as they disregard the principles of justice and righteousness that are central to God's law.<p><b>but the righteous are gracious and giving</b><br>In contrast, the righteous are characterized by their generosity and willingness to give. This reflects the biblical principle of stewardship and the call to care for others, as seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>, "A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed." The righteous act in accordance with God's character, who is described as gracious and compassionate throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/psalms/145-8.htm">Psalm 145:8</a>). This generosity is not merely financial but extends to all aspects of life, embodying the love and selflessness that Jesus Christ exemplified. In the New Testament, <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a> encourages believers to give cheerfully, reinforcing the idea that righteousness is demonstrated through acts of kindness and generosity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>In the context of this Psalm, the wicked are those who live contrary to God's laws and principles.
