The term "humble" here is significant, as humility is a key virtue in biblical teaching. Humility involves recognizing one's dependence on God and submitting to His will. This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which emphasizes trusting in the Lord and not relying on one's own understanding. The phrase "in what is right" suggests moral and ethical guidance, aligning with God's righteousness. The humble are those who acknowledge their need for divine direction, and God promises to lead them in paths of righteousness, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23-3.htm">Psalm 23:3</a>.<p><b>and teaches them His way</b><br>Teaching in the biblical context often involves imparting wisdom and understanding. God's "way" refers to His commandments, statutes, and the path of life He desires for His followers. This is echoed in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, where God's word is described as a lamp to one's feet and a light to one's path. The teaching of God's way is not just about knowledge but about living in accordance with His will. Jesus Christ, in the New Testament, is the ultimate revelation of God's way, as He declares Himself to be "the way, the truth, and the life" in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>. This teaching is transformative, leading believers to live lives that reflect God's character and purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>- The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/25.htm">Psalm 25</a>, David was the second king of Israel, known for his deep relationship with God and his authorship of many psalms.
