In biblical times, slander was a serious offense, as it could lead to social ostracism or even legal consequences. The Bible consistently condemns slander (<a href="/proverbs/10-18.htm">Proverbs 10:18</a>, <a href="/james/4-11.htm">James 4:11</a>), highlighting the importance of truth and integrity in relationships. The phrase "in secret" suggests deceit and cowardice, as the slanderer hides their actions from public view. The commitment to "put to silence" such individuals reflects a divine standard of justice, where God, through His appointed leaders, seeks to protect the community from the destructive power of falsehood. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God as a defender of truth and righteousness (<a href="/psalms/31-18.htm">Psalm 31:18</a>).<p><b>the one with haughty eyes and a proud heart, I will not endure.</b><br>This part of the verse addresses the sin of pride, which is often depicted in Scripture as having "haughty eyes" and a "proud heart." Pride is considered one of the most dangerous sins because it leads individuals to elevate themselves above others and even above God. The Bible frequently warns against pride (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>), as it is the root of many other sins and a barrier to receiving God's grace. The imagery of "haughty eyes" suggests arrogance and disdain for others, while a "proud heart" indicates an inner attitude of self-exaltation. The declaration "I will not endure" signifies God's intolerance for pride, as it opposes His nature and disrupts the harmony of His creation. This reflects the biblical principle that God humbles the proud but exalts the humble (<a href="/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/101.htm">Psalm 101</a>, David is expressing his commitment to righteousness and justice in his reign as king.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbor.htm">Neighbor</a></b><br>Represents fellow members of the community or society, emphasizing the importance of maintaining integrity in relationships.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge who upholds justice and righteousness, and who David seeks to emulate in his leadership.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Those who engage in slander and pride, whom David vows to silence and not endure.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_israel.htm">The Kingdom of Israel</a></b><br>The context in which David is setting these standards, aiming to establish a kingdom that reflects God's values.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_our_speech.htm">Guarding Our Speech</a></b><br>We must be vigilant about the words we speak, avoiding slander and gossip, as these are detestable to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultivating_humility.htm">Cultivating Humility</a></b><br>Pride is a barrier to a relationship with God.
