The term "rage" suggests a tumultuous and violent anger, reminiscent of the nations' uproar against God and His anointed in <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1</a>. Historically, Israel faced numerous adversaries, including surrounding nations like the Philistines, Moabites, and Ammonites, who often sought to disrupt and destroy the nation. This enmity can be traced back to the spiritual conflict between the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent (<a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>), symbolizing the ongoing battle between God's people and those opposed to His purposes.<p><b>how Your foes have reared their heads</b><br>The imagery of "rearing their heads" conveys a sense of pride and defiance. In ancient Near Eastern culture, lifting one's head was often associated with asserting dominance or preparing for battle. This phrase suggests that the enemies of God are not only numerous but also bold and unashamed in their opposition. This defiance can be seen in various biblical accounts, such as the arrogance of Pharaoh in Exodus or the taunts of Goliath against the armies of Israel. Theologically, this reflects the broader theme of human pride and rebellion against divine authority, a motif that runs throughout Scripture and finds its ultimate resolution in the victory of Christ over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_god.htm">Enemies of God</a></b><br>These are the adversaries who oppose God's people and His purposes.

Though the Almighty already &#8220;searches every heart and understands every desire and every thought&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>), Scripture often records believers asking Him to look and act (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/80-14.htm">Psalm 80:14</a>). This cry models an active trust: we place our circumstances before the Lord, certain that He both notices and cares.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>How Your enemies rage</b><p>The word &#8220;rage&#8221; paints a picture of nations in uproar against God and His covenant people, echoing <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1</a>, &#8220;Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?&#8221; Such fury is not merely human hostility; it is rebellion against the Lord&#8217;s rule. Throughout history&#8212;whether Pharaoh&#8217;s pursuit in <a href="/bsb/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>, Haman&#8217;s plot in <a href="/bsb/esther/3.htm">Esther 3</a>, or the Sanhedrin&#8217;s opposition to Jesus in <a href="/acts/4-26.htm">Acts 4:26&#8211;28</a>&#8212;God&#8217;s enemies thunder, yet their rage can never overturn His purposes (<a href="/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>). The psalm reminds believers that opposition, no matter how loud, is ultimately powerless before the Sovereign King.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>How Your foes have reared their heads</b><p>To &#8220;rear the head&#8221; signifies arrogant self-exaltation. Prideful adversaries lift themselves high, convinced they can triumph over God&#8217;s people. Nebuchadnezzar boasted this way before God humbled him (<a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30&#8211;37</a>). Likewise, Sennacherib taunted Jerusalem until the Angel of the LORD struck his army (<a href="/bsb/2_kings/19.htm">2 Kings 19</a>). <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a> warns that &#8220;God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble,&#8221; underscoring that every lifted head will one day bow to Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>). The psalmist thus exposes the real issue: prideful resistance to God&#8217;s reign.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/83-2.htm">Psalm 83:2</a> captures a threefold reality: believers invite God to look, enemies rage in futile rebellion, and proud foes exalt themselves&#8212;yet all under the omnipotent gaze of the LORD.
