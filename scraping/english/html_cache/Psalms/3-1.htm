David, the second king of Israel, faced a rebellion led by his son Absalom, as recorded in <a href="/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15-18</a>. This was a time of great personal and political turmoil for David. The rebellion forced David to flee Jerusalem, highlighting the fragility of human power and the consequences of familial discord. This context underscores themes of betrayal and the need for divine intervention. The psalm reflects David's reliance on God during a crisis, a recurring theme in his life and writings.<p><b>O LORD, how my foes have increased!</b><br>David addresses God directly, emphasizing a personal relationship with the divine. The increase in foes refers to the growing number of people siding with Absalom, illustrating the widespread nature of the rebellion. This phrase captures the sense of being overwhelmed by adversaries, a common experience for believers facing spiritual or physical battles. The lamentation is a call for God's attention and intervention, echoing the cries of other biblical figures who faced overwhelming odds, such as Moses and Elijah.<p><b>How many rise up against me!</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the magnitude of the opposition. The rebellion was not just a personal betrayal but a national crisis, with many Israelites turning against their anointed king. The imagery of rising up suggests an active and aggressive stance by the enemies, reflecting the spiritual battles believers face against forces that oppose God's will. This connects to the broader biblical theme of spiritual warfare, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where believers are reminded that their struggle is not against flesh and blood but against spiritual forces.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this Psalm, King David, is expressing his distress during a time of great personal turmoil.

The same pattern reappears in <a href="/psalms/56-9.htm">Psalm 56:9</a>, &#8220;Then my enemies will turn back&#8230;for God is with me.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/3-1.htm">Psalm 3:1</a> captures a king on the run, surrounded by multiplying enemies who actively seek his downfall.
