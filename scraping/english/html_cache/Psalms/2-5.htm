The concept of divine rebuke is consistent throughout Scripture, where God corrects and disciplines those who oppose His will (e.g., <a href="/psalms/6.htm">Psalm 6:1</a>, <a href="/proverbs/3-12.htm">Proverbs 3:12</a>). The use of "anger" here underscores the seriousness of their defiance against God's anointed king, reflecting the righteous indignation of a holy God. In the biblical context, God's anger is not capricious but a just response to sin and rebellion. This rebuke can be seen as a form of divine judgment, which is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15-16</a>).<p><b>and terrifies them in His fury:</b><br>The word "terrifies" indicates the overwhelming power and authority of God that instills fear in those who oppose Him. This is not merely a human fear but a recognition of the divine majesty and the consequences of standing against God's purposes. "Fury" suggests an intense, consuming wrath, which is often associated with God's judgment against sin (e.g., <a href="/nahum/1-6.htm">Nahum 1:6</a>). The imagery here is reminiscent of the theophanies in the Old Testament, where God's presence is accompanied by awe-inspiring phenomena (e.g., <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the eschatological judgment, where God's ultimate justice will be revealed (e.g., <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>). The terrifying aspect of God's fury serves as a warning to the nations and a call to submit to His sovereign rule.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who speaks and acts in righteous anger against those who oppose His anointed.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Representing the collective opposition to God's rule and His anointed one, often seen as the rebellious kings and rulers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_anointed_one.htm">The Anointed One (Messiah)</a></b><br>The king established by God, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is opposed by the nations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>The holy hill where God has set His king, symbolizing God's chosen place and His divine authority.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rebellion.htm">The Rebellion</a></b><br>The event of the nations conspiring against God and His anointed, leading to God's response in anger.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>God's response to rebellion is rooted in His sovereign authority and justice.

Christ does rule; Christ does reign; he sits a King in heaven, and is acknowledged as a King upon earth.
