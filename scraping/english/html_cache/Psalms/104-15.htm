In ancient Israel, wine was a staple in daily life and used in religious ceremonies, such as the Passover. The phrase highlights the God-given gift of wine, which brings joy and gladness to the human heart. This aligns with <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:7</a>, which encourages enjoying life with a joyful heart. The New Testament also references wine in the context of Jesus' first miracle at Cana (<a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1-11</a>), symbolizing the new covenant and the joy found in Christ. However, the Bible also warns against the excess of wine leading to drunkenness (<a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>), emphasizing moderation.<p><b>Oil that makes his face to shine</b><br>Oil, particularly olive oil, was a valuable commodity in biblical times, used for anointing, cooking, and as a cosmetic. The phrase suggests vitality and health, as oil was used to moisturize and protect the skin, making one's face shine. This imagery is seen in <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, where anointing with oil signifies blessing and abundance. In a spiritual sense, oil often represents the Holy Spirit, as seen in the anointing of kings and priests (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). The shining face can also symbolize the joy and favor of God, reminiscent of Moses' radiant face after encountering God (<a href="/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-35</a>).<p><b>And bread that sustains his heart</b><br>Bread is a fundamental element of sustenance and life, representing God's provision. In the ancient Near East, bread was a dietary staple, essential for survival. This phrase underscores God's provision of daily needs, echoing the Lord's Prayer in <a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>, "Give us this day our daily bread." Bread also holds significant spiritual symbolism, as Jesus refers to Himself as the "bread of life" in <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>, indicating that He is essential for spiritual sustenance and eternal life. The breaking of bread in the New Testament (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>) signifies fellowship and unity among believers, pointing to the sustaining power of community in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_creator.htm">God as Creator</a></b><br>The psalm is a hymn of praise to God for His creation and provision.

Receiving it with gratitude honors the Giver.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Oil that makes his face to shine</b><p>&#8226; Next, the psalm praises &#8220;oil that makes his face to shine&#8221;. In the ancient Near East, fragrant oil refreshed skin, conveyed welcome, and marked festive occasions.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a> rejoices, &#8220;You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows,&#8221; depicting God&#8217;s lavish care.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:8</a> urges, &#8220;Never spare the oil for your head,&#8221; highlighting continual celebration in God&#8217;s presence.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a> calls Messiah&#8217;s comfort &#8220;the oil of joy for mourning,&#8221; showing oil as a metaphor for the Spirit&#8217;s uplifting work.<p>&#8226; Even practical ministry employs oil: <a href="/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14</a> directs elders to &#8220;anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord.&#8221; Thus the shining face signals health, welcome, and Spirit-given gladness&#8212;evidence of a Creator who attends to both body and soul.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bread that sustains his heart</b><p>&#8226; Finally, the verse honors &#8220;bread that sustains his heart&#8221;. Bread is the staple God appointed to keep life going.<p>&#8226; From daily manna in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>) to Christ&#8217;s feeding of the five thousand (<a href="/mark/6-41.htm">Mark 6:41</a>), God demonstrates faithful provision.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a> reminds us that bread alone is insufficient without God&#8217;s word, yet the physical loaf still testifies to His sustaining hand.<p>&#8226; Jesus deepens the theme by declaring, &#8220;I am the bread of life&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). The physical bread points forward to Him, the true sustainer of the human heart.<p>&#8226; Whether it arrives by harvest, bakery, or miraculous supply, every crust is an invitation to trust the One who &#8220;gives food to every creature&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/136-25.htm">Psalm 136:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a> strings together wine, oil, and bread as vivid tokens of God&#8217;s everyday goodness. Wine gladdens, oil refreshes, and bread strengthens&#8212;three simple gifts that reveal a Creator personally involved in human joy, health, and endurance. Recognizing these blessings stirs worship, fosters gratitude, and points us ultimately to Christ, the fullness of all God&#8217;s provision.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/104.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">And wine that . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and wine gladdens man's heart, making his face shine more than oil </span>(see-margin.
