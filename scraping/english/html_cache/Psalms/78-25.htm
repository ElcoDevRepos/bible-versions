Manna is described in <a href="/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a> and <a href="/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11</a> as a miraculous food that appeared each morning, sustaining the Israelites for 40 years. The term "bread of angels" suggests a heavenly origin, emphasizing the divine provision and the supernatural nature of this sustenance. In Jewish tradition, manna is often associated with spiritual nourishment, symbolizing God's care and provision. The New Testament draws a parallel between manna and Jesus Christ, the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31-35</a>), highlighting the spiritual sustenance He provides to believers.<p><b>He sent them food in abundance.</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the generosity and sufficiency of God's provision. Despite the Israelites' complaints and lack of faith, God provided not just enough, but an abundance of food. This reflects God's grace and mercy, even in the face of human disobedience. The abundance of manna can be seen as a foreshadowing of the spiritual abundance found in Christ, who offers life and sustenance to all who believe in Him. The concept of divine abundance is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>, where God is described as supplying all needs according to His riches in glory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and wandered in the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to guide the Israelites out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert area where the Israelites wandered for 40 years after leaving Egypt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/manna.htm">Manna</a></b><br>The miraculous food provided by God to the Israelites in the wilderness, described as "the bread of angels."<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The provider and sustainer of the Israelites, demonstrating His power and care through the provision of manna.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>God provides for our needs abundantly, just as He did for the Israelites with manna.
