Jacob represents the chosen lineage through which God's covenant promises were fulfilled. The "word" signifies divine communication, often associated with the Law given to Moses. This revelation is foundational, as seen in <a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>, where God reaffirms His covenant with Jacob. The declaration of God's word to Jacob underscores the personal and direct nature of God's communication with His people, setting the stage for the nation of Israel's unique relationship with God.<p><b>His statutes and judgments to Israel</b><br>The statutes and judgments refer to the laws and decrees given to the nation of Israel, primarily through Moses at Mount Sinai (Exodus 20). These laws were meant to guide Israel in righteousness and justice, setting them apart from other nations. The giving of the Law is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, marking them as God's covenant people. This phrase highlights the continuity from Jacob to the nation of Israel, showing God's faithfulness in maintaining His covenant. The statutes and judgments also foreshadow the coming of Christ, who fulfills the Law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>) and establishes a new covenant with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch whose name was changed to Israel.

God takes the initiative to speak; the verse pictures Him actively revealing, not passively waiting for discovery (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>; <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;His word&#8221; is singular, underscoring the unity and integrity of all He says&#8212;consistent, trustworthy, and enduring (<a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-35.htm">Matthew 24:35</a>).<p>&#8226;

Mentioning Jacob emphasizes grace: the man was flawed, yet God spoke to him and kept covenant promises (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; It highlights continuity&#8212;what God began with the fathers He continues with their children (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His statutes and judgments</b><p>&#8226;

Israel is called to live distinctly so the nations may know the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2-4</a>; <a href="/romans/3-1.htm">Romans 3:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase foreshadows the greater fulfillment in Christ, through whom the blessing extends to all who believe (<a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>), yet without negating God&#8217;s specific promises to Israel (<a href="/romans/11-1.htm">Romans 11:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/147-19.htm">Psalm 147:19</a> celebrates the gracious fact that God speaks clearly and covenantally.
