The context of <a href="/psalms/118.htm">Psalm 118</a> is a celebration of God's deliverance and faithfulness. The psalm is often associated with the Feast of Tabernacles, a time when Israel remembered God's provision and guidance. The phrase underscores that the events being celebrated are not by human effort but by God's intervention. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>, where God declares His control over all things. The phrase also connects to the New Testament, where Jesus refers to this psalm in <a href="/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>, indicating that the work of salvation through Christ is divinely orchestrated.<p><b>and it is marvelous</b><br>The term "marvelous" suggests something extraordinary and beyond human comprehension. In the biblical context, this often refers to God's miraculous acts, such as the parting of the Red Sea or the resurrection of Jesus. The Hebrew word used here can also imply something that causes wonder or amazement, reflecting the reaction of those who witness God's mighty works. This marvel is not just in the act itself but in the realization of God's power and faithfulness. The marvel of God's works is a recurring theme in the Psalms, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139-14.htm">Psalm 139:14</a>, where the psalmist praises God for the wonder of creation.<p><b>in our eyes</b><br>This phrase personalizes the experience of witnessing God's work. It suggests a communal acknowledgment among the people of God, reflecting a shared testimony of His deeds. The "eyes" symbolize perception and understanding, indicating that the people recognize and appreciate the divine nature of what has occurred. This communal aspect is significant in the context of Israel's history, where collective memory and testimony were crucial for maintaining faith and identity. The phrase also points to the importance of spiritual insight, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>, where Paul prays for the eyes of believers' hearts to be enlightened.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing the divine source of the marvelous work being acknowledged.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to King David, the psalmist is expressing awe and gratitude for the LORD's work.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of Israel is often the recipient of God's marvelous deeds, and this psalm is part of the Hallel, sung during Jewish festivals.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/118.htm">Psalm 118</a> is often associated with temple worship and thanksgiving.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/messianic_fulfillment.htm">Messianic Fulfillment</a></b><br>This verse is often seen as prophetic, pointing to Jesus Christ as the cornerstone rejected by builders, yet chosen by God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_origin_of_marvelous_works.htm">Divine Origin of Marvelous Works</a></b><br>Recognize that the source of all truly marvelous works is the LORD.
