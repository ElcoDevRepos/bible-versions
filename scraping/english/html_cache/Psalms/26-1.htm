David's life, from shepherd to king, is marked by his faith and his failings, making his psalms deeply personal and relatable. His authorship suggests a context of personal reflection and prayer, possibly during a time of trial or accusation.<p><b>Vindicate me, O LORD!</b><br>The plea for vindication indicates a situation where David feels unjustly accused or misunderstood. In the ancient Near Eastern context, seeking divine vindication was common, as God was seen as the ultimate judge. This reflects a trust in God's justice, paralleling Job's appeals for vindication amidst suffering (<a href="/job/13-18.htm">Job 13:18</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate vindication found in Christ, who was falsely accused yet justified by God (<a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>).<p><b>For I have walked with integrity;</b><br>David claims a life of integrity, suggesting a consistent and sincere adherence to God's laws. Integrity in the biblical sense involves wholeness and moral uprightness. This echoes the call for holiness found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>. David's assertion is not of sinlessness but of a genuine commitment to God's ways, similar to the blamelessness attributed to Noah (<a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>).<p><b>I have trusted in the LORD without wavering.</b><br>Trusting in the LORD without wavering highlights a steadfast faith, even amidst trials. This unwavering trust is a recurring theme in the Psalms and is exemplified in the life of Abraham, who "did not waver through unbelief" (<a href="/romans/4-20.htm">Romans 4:20</a>). It points to a deep reliance on God's character and promises, prefiguring the perfect faithfulness of Jesus, who trusted the Father completely (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this psalm, King David, is seeking vindication from God.

The inspired superscription roots the prayer in real history and real experience, just as <a href="/2_samuel/23-1.htm">2 Samuel 23:1</a> identifies him as &#8220;the sweet psalmist of Israel.&#8221; By identifying himself, David invites readers to step into his own story of dependence on God (cf. <a href="/psalms/18-1.htm">Psalm 18:1&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Vindicate me, O LORD!</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Vindicate&#8221; means to judge, defend, or clear of accusation. David is asking the righteous Judge to pronounce him innocent and to protect him from false charges (compare <a href="/psalms/7-8.htm">Psalm 7:8&#8211;9</a>; 35:24).<p>&#8226; He turns first to the LORD&#8212;YHWH&#8212;the covenant God who knows every fact (<a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1&#8211;4</a>) and loves justice (<a href="/isaiah/30-18.htm">Isaiah 30:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Because God alone sees the heart, David stakes everything on divine evaluation rather than human opinion (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-3.htm">1 Corinthians 4:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; This bold plea reflects confidence that God will act now, not merely at the final judgment (<a href="/psalms/54-1.htm">Psalm 54:1</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For I have walked with integrity;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Walked&#8221; pictures a steady pattern of life, not a single moment (<a href="/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Integrity&#8221; points to wholeness&#8212;being the same in private and public. <a href="/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a> uses the same concept when calling Job &#8220;blameless and upright.&#8221;<p>&#8226; David is not claiming sinless perfection (see <a href="/psalms/25-7.htm">Psalm 25:7, 11</a>) but a sincere, undivided commitment to God&#8217;s ways (<a href="/1_kings/9-4.htm">1 Kings 9:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/101-2.htm">Psalm 101:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently links personal integrity with confident prayer; &#8220;The LORD sustains the righteous&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/55-22.htm">Psalm 55:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Integrity is visible: David refused idolatry (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3&#8211;4</a>), shunned deceitful company (<a href="/psalms/26-4.htm">Psalm 26:4&#8211;5</a>), and pursued God&#8217;s house (<a href="/psalms/26-8.htm">Psalm 26:8</a>). These actions back up his words.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have trusted in the LORD without wavering.</b><p>&#8226; Trust is relational, resting on the character of God (<a href="/psalms/9-10.htm">Psalm 9:10</a>; 13:5).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Without wavering&#8221; conveys steady reliance&#8212;like the tree firmly planted by streams of water (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>) or the heart that is &#8220;steadfast, trusting in the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/112-7.htm">Psalm 112:7</a>).<p>&#8226; This unwavering trust fuels confidence for God&#8217;s vindication (<a href="/psalms/21-7.htm">Psalm 21:7</a>; 27:1&#8211;3).<p>&#8226; The New Testament echoes the same call: &#8220;But let him ask in faith without doubting&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Trust and integrity belong together; one flows from the other. Faith produces obedience (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6&#8211;8</a>), and obedience reinforces faith (<a href="/john/14-21.htm">John 14:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David&#8217;s prayer in <a href="/psalms/26-1.htm">Psalm 26:1</a> models a life that invites God&#8217;s scrutiny. He asks the LORD to vindicate him because (1) his daily walk displays integrity and (2) his heart steadily trusts the covenant God. The verse reminds believers that when our conscience is clear before God and our faith remains steady, we can confidently appeal to Him for justice, protection, and affirmation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Judge me</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, do me justice, "vindicate me."<p><span class= "bld">I shall not slide.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">I have trusted in Jehovah without wavering<span class= "bld">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Judge me, O Lord; for I have walked in mine integrity</span>. It seems to Christians a bold act to call on God for judgment, but the saints of the earlier dispensation, having, perhaps, a less keen sense of human imperfection, were wont to do so. It is Job's cry from his first utterance until his "words are ended;" and here we find David taking it up and re-echoing it. Man longs to hear the sentence of acquittal from the great Judge. Like Job, David asserts his "integrity," and in the same qualified sense. He is sincere in his endeavours to do right. Yet still he needs mercy and redemption (see ver. 11). <span class="cmt_word">I have trusted also in the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lord; therefore I shall not slide.</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/18-36.htm">Psalm 18:36</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-31.htm">Psalm 37:31</a>). David is confident of his past; for the future he trusts in God to uphold his steps, and save him from slips and falls. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/26-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Of David.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1448;&#1491;
