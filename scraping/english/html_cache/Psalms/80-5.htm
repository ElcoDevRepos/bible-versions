The "bread of tears" symbolizes sustenance that is filled with grief, indicating that their daily life is consumed by sadness. In the historical context, this could refer to times of national distress, such as the Babylonian exile, when the Israelites faced the consequences of their disobedience to God. The imagery of tears as bread highlights the depth of their lamentation, as bread is a basic necessity, suggesting that their sorrow is as constant and essential as their daily food. This phrase can be connected to <a href="/lamentations/3-19.htm">Lamentations 3:19-20</a>, where the prophet Jeremiah speaks of his affliction and bitterness. It also foreshadows the suffering of Christ, who is described as a man of sorrows in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>.<p><b>and made them drink the full measure of their tears</b><br>The "full measure" implies an overwhelming abundance, indicating that the people are not just experiencing a small amount of grief, but are inundated with it. This could be seen as a form of divine discipline, where God allows His people to experience the consequences of their actions to bring them to repentance. The act of drinking tears suggests an internalization of sorrow, where the grief is not only external but also deeply felt within. This can be related to the experience of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane, where He was deeply troubled and His sweat was like drops of blood (<a href="/luke/22-44.htm">Luke 22:44</a>). Theologically, this phrase underscores the idea that God uses trials to refine and purify His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>, which speaks of the peaceful fruit of righteousness that comes from discipline.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/80.htm">Psalm 80</a>, Asaph was a prominent Levite singer and seer in David's court.
