In the context of ancient warfare, the valiant were often the elite warriors or champions of a nation. The imagery of them lying plundered indicates not only their defeat but also the stripping away of their honor and possessions. This can be connected to the historical context of Israel's battles, where God often intervened to give victory to His people against seemingly insurmountable odds, as seen in the defeat of the Assyrian army in <a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35-37</a>. Theologically, it underscores the futility of human strength against divine power.<p><b>they sleep their last sleep.</b><br>The phrase "sleep their last sleep" is a poetic way of describing death. In biblical literature, sleep is often used as a metaphor for death, suggesting a state of rest or inactivity (e.g., <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, <a href="/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11-14</a>). This imagery emphasizes the finality of their defeat and the cessation of their earthly struggles. It also reflects the biblical theme that God has ultimate authority over life and death, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/90-3.htm">Psalm 90:3-6</a>, where human life is transient and subject to God's will.<p><b>No men of might could lift a hand.</b><br>This phrase highlights the complete powerlessness of the mighty warriors in the face of God's judgment. Despite their strength and skill, they are rendered incapable of action. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the biblical principle that human power is insignificant compared to God's sovereignty (<a href="/isaiah/40-23.htm">Isaiah 40:23-24</a>). It also echoes the theme of divine intervention, where God fights on behalf of His people, rendering their enemies powerless, as in the story of Gideon in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>. This serves as a reminder of the ultimate victory of God's purposes and the futility of relying solely on human strength.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_valiant.htm">The Valiant</a></b><br>Refers to the mighty warriors or soldiers who are typically strong and courageous in battle.
