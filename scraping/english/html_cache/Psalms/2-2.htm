Historically, kings often viewed themselves as ultimate authorities, sometimes even as divine figures. In the biblical context, this reflects the frequent rebellion of nations against God's rule, as seen in the narratives of the Old Testament where Israel faced opposition from surrounding nations. This rebellion is not just political but spiritual, as it represents a rejection of God's sovereignty.<p><b>and the rulers gather together</b><br>The gathering of rulers signifies a united front against a common perceived threat. In ancient times, alliances were often formed for military or political purposes. This phrase suggests a concerted effort to resist divine authority, reminiscent of the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>), where humanity united in defiance of God. It also foreshadows the end-times coalition against God described in <a href="/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19</a>.<p><b>against the LORD</b><br>The opposition is directly against Yahweh, the covenant God of Israel. This reflects the broader biblical theme of humanity's rebellion against God, beginning with Adam and Eve in Genesis. Throughout Scripture, the LORD is depicted as the ultimate authority and creator, whose plans cannot be thwarted by human schemes. This rebellion is ultimately futile, as God's purposes will prevail.<p><b>and against His Anointed One:</b><br>The term "Anointed One" refers to the Messiah, a title for Jesus Christ. In the Old Testament, anointing was a sign of being chosen by God for a specific purpose, often used for kings and priests. This phrase prophetically points to the opposition Jesus faced during His earthly ministry and the continued resistance against His reign. It connects to New Testament passages such as <a href="/acts/4-25.htm">Acts 4:25-27</a>, where the early church identifies Jesus as the fulfillment of this prophecy. The Anointed One is central to God's redemptive plan, and opposition to Him is ultimately opposition to God's salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kings_of_the_earth.htm">The Kings of the Earth</a></b><br>These are the earthly rulers and leaders who oppose God's authority.

Their stance may look formidable, but the rest of the psalm (<a href="/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4&#8211;12</a>) assures us that God laughs at their futile revolt and installs His Son on Zion.

Its distinctive reference to an expected prince of the chosen people, who was to redeem them from their enemies, and fulfil completely all the Divine promises for them, probably dates from this psalm, or more distinctly from this psalm than from any one passage. At least, that the traditional Jewish interpretation had fastened upon it as of this importance is shown by the frequent and emphatic quotation of this psalm in the New Testament. (See New Testament use of these verses in <a href="/acts/4-25.htm" title="Who by the mouth of your servant David have said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?">Acts 4:25</a>, and Note in <span class= "ital">New Testament Commentary.</span>) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The kings of the earth set themselves</span>; or<span class="accented">, draw themselves up in array</span> (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/46-4.htm">Jeremiah 46:4</a>). Such kings as Herod the Great, Herod Agrippa, Nero, Galerius, Diocletian, Julian the Apostate, etc. There is always a warfare between the world and the Church, in which kings are apt to take a part, most often on the worldly side. And the rulers take counsel together. "Rulers" are persons having authority, but below the rank of kings Such were the ethnarchs and tetrarchs of the first century, the governors of provinces under the Roman emperor, the members of the Jewish Sanhedrin, and the like. These last frequently "took counsel against the Lord" (see <a href="/matthew/26-3.htm">Matthew 26:3 - 5</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-1.htm">Matthew 27:1</a>; <a href="/acts/4-5.htm">Acts 4:5, 6</a>; <a href="/acts/5-21.htm">Acts 5:21-41</a>).
