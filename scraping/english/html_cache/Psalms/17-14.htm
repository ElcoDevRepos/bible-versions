The psalmist seeks deliverance from worldly men, emphasizing reliance on God's power. The "hand" of the Lord often symbolizes His strength and action in the world (<a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>). This reflects a common biblical theme where God's people seek refuge from those who oppose them, trusting in His sovereignty and justice.<p><b>from men of the world whose portion is in this life.</b><br>Here, the psalmist contrasts the temporal focus of worldly men with the eternal perspective of the faithful. These men are described as having their "portion" in this life, indicating their satisfaction with earthly pleasures and material wealth. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/luke/16-25.htm">Luke 16:25</a>, where the rich man receives his "good things" during his lifetime, highlighting the transient nature of worldly success compared to eternal rewards.<p><b>May You fill the bellies of Your treasured ones</b><br>The psalmist prays for God's provision for His faithful followers, referred to as "treasured ones." This term suggests a special relationship between God and His people, akin to the covenant relationship seen throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). The request for God to "fill the bellies" signifies a desire for both physical sustenance and spiritual fulfillment, reflecting God's care for the whole person.<p><b>and satisfy their sons,</b><br>This phrase extends the blessing to the next generation, emphasizing the importance of legacy and continuity of faith. The satisfaction of the sons implies not only physical provision but also spiritual inheritance. This aligns with the biblical principle of generational blessings, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>, where a good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children.<p><b>so they leave their abundance to their children.</b><br>The psalmist envisions a scenario where God's blessings are so abundant that they overflow to future generations. This reflects the biblical value of stewardship and the responsibility to pass on both material and spiritual wealth. The idea of leaving an inheritance is deeply rooted in the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, where land and possessions were passed down as a sign of God's faithfulness and provision (<a href="/numbers/27-8.htm">Numbers 27:8-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of the Psalm, who is seeking deliverance from his enemies and expressing his trust in God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_the_world.htm">Men of the World</a></b><br>Refers to those who are focused on earthly, temporal gains and pleasures, contrasting with those who seek eternal treasures.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, whom David calls upon for deliverance and provision.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/treasured_ones.htm">Treasured Ones</a></b><br>Those who are faithful to God and whom He blesses, contrasting with the "men of the world."<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_and_children.htm">Sons and Children</a></b><br>Represents the future generations who benefit from the blessings and abundance provided by God to the faithful.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to focus on eternal treasures rather than temporary, worldly gains.

Verse 14 continues that plea and contrasts the destinies of two groups:<p>&#8226; &#8220;men of the world whose portion is in this life&#8221; (cf. <a href="/psalms/49-6.htm">Psalm 49:6&#8211;14</a>, <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16&#8211;21</a>)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Your treasured ones,&#8221; literally those whom God sees as His special possession (cf. <a href="/malachi/3-17.htm">Malachi 3:17</a>, <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p>David is not merely asking to escape danger; he is asking God to display the stark difference between those who live only for the present world and those who live for God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Men of the World and Their Portion</b><p>&#8220;From men of the world whose portion is in this life.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Their hopes, security, and satisfaction are limited to earthly success, possessions, and acclaim (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; They measure blessing by what can be banked, eaten, or flaunted&#8212;nothing beyond the grave (cf. <a href="/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; Their worldview ends at the cemetery; therefore, they oppose God&#8217;s righteous servant who lives for eternity (cf. <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Deliverance by God&#8217;s Hand</b><p>&#8220;Break the text from such men, O LORD, by Your hand.&#8221;<p>&#8226; David sees no human solution; only God&#8217;s direct intervention can sever him from their schemes (cf. <a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s &#8220;hand&#8221; pictures personal, decisive action&#8212;rescuing His servant while simultaneously judging the wicked (cf. <a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>, <a href="/psalms/37-12.htm">Psalm 37:12&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; The prayer rests on covenant confidence: the righteous can call on their Father to act for them (cf. <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Blessings for the Treasured Ones</b><p>&#8220;May You fill the bellies of Your treasured ones and satisfy their sons.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God is asked to meet every tangible need of His people, showing that true provision flows from Him, not from worldly striving (cf. <a href="/psalms/37-18.htm">Psalm 37:18&#8211;19</a>, <a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8226; The picture of full bellies portrays contentment and well-being (cf. <a href="/psalms/103-5.htm">Psalm 103:5</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Satisfy their sons&#8221; extends the blessing to immediate family, proving God&#8217;s goodness is not fleeting or sporadic.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Generational Overflow</b><p>&#8220;So they leave their abundance to their children.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Righteous people receive more than daily bread; they steward enough to pass on (cf. <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/9-8.htm">2 Corinthians 9:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The inheritance is both material and spiritual, demonstrating that those who trust God leave a lasting legacy (cf. <a href="/psalms/128-3.htm">Psalm 128:3&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast sharpens: worldly men may hoard yet perish empty-handed, while God&#8217;s people enjoy provision that multiplies beyond their own lifetimes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/17-14.htm">Psalm 17:14</a> sets two destinies side by side. The &#8220;men of the world&#8221; fix their hopes on temporary treasure and oppose God&#8217;s servant. David asks the LORD&#8217;s powerful hand to rescue him from their grasp. In contrast, those God calls His &#8220;treasured ones&#8221; experience overflowing provision that satisfies them and blesses their children after them. The verse reminds believers that real security, abundance, and legacy come not from this life&#8217;s portion but from the faithful, intervening hand of the living God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Of the world.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">of time. </span>Heb., <span class= "ital">cheled, </span>"that which creeps on," an expression anticipating the New Testament use of <span class= "ital">world. </span>(Comp. <a href="/context/job/21-7.htm" title="Why do the wicked live, become old, yes, are mighty in power?">Job 21:7-14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Their portion in this life</span>--contrasts with <a href="/psalms/16-5.htm" title="The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: you maintain my lot.">Psalm 16:5</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Thy hid treasure.</span>--<span class= "ital">That which thou hast stored up, </span>which is sometimes in a good sense (<a href="/psalms/31-19.htm" title="Oh how great is your goodness, which you have laid up for them that fear you; which you have worked for them that trust in you before the sons of men!">Psalm 31:19</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm" title="A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children: and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.">Proverbs 13:22</a>), sometimes in a bad (<a href="/job/21-19.htm" title="God lays up his iniquity for his children: he rewards him, and he shall know it.">Job 21:19</a>).
