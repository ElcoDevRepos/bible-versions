In the biblical context, arrows often symbolize God's judgment and wrath (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-23.htm">Deuteronomy 32:23</a>, <a href="/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>). The imagery of God shooting arrows suggests precision and inevitability, indicating that His justice is both targeted and unavoidable. Historically, arrows were a common weapon in ancient warfare, representing a swift and decisive action. This metaphor underscores God's active role in defending the righteous and punishing the wicked, aligning with the broader biblical theme of God as a warrior (<a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>). Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who will ultimately judge the world in righteousness (<a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>).<p><b>suddenly they will be wounded.</b><br>The suddenness of the action highlights the unexpected nature of divine intervention. In the cultural context of the Psalms, sudden calamity was often seen as a sign of divine displeasure or judgment. This phrase reassures the faithful that God's justice, though sometimes delayed, will come swiftly and unexpectedly upon the wicked. The wounding signifies not just physical harm but also a deeper spiritual or moral downfall. This connects to other scriptures where sudden destruction comes upon those who oppose God (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>). It serves as a warning and a comfort, affirming that God is in control and will act in His perfect timing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as the divine warrior who intervenes on behalf of the righteous.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Though not explicitly mentioned in this verse, the context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/64.htm">Psalm 64</a> describes the wicked as those who plot against the righteous.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/arrows.htm">Arrows</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's judgment and swift retribution against the wicked.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>Implicitly present as the ones whom God defends and vindicates.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sudden_wounding.htm">Sudden Wounding</a></b><br>Represents the unexpected and decisive nature of God's intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>God is actively involved in the affairs of humanity, ensuring that justice is served.

In the moment of their imagined success, their deeply-laid schemes just on the point of ripening, a sudden Divine retribution overtakes the wicked, and all their calumnies, invented with such cunning, fall back on their own heads. But the construction is most perplexing. The text presents a tangled maze of abrupt clauses, which, arranged according to the accents, run: <span class= "ital">And God shoots an arrow, sudden are their wounds, and they make it </span>(or <span class= "ital">him</span>)<span class= "ital"> fall on themselves their tongue. </span>The last clause seems to pronounce the law which obtains in Divine judgment. While God orders the retribution it is yet the recoil of their own evil on the guilty. In these cases,<p>"We still have judgment here, that we but teach<p>Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return<p>To plague the inventor; this evenhanded justice<p>Commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalice<p>To our own lips."<p>SHAKSPEARE: <span class= "ital">Macbeth.</span><p><span class= "bld">Flee away.</span>--The verb (<span class= "ital">n?dad</span>) properly means <span class= "ital">to flutter the wings like a bird </span>(<a href="/isaiah/10-14.htm" title="And my hand has found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathers eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.">Isaiah 10:14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/64.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But God shall shoot at them with an arrow.</span> But God <span class="accented">will</span> interpose.
