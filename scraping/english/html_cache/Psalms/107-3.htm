Historically, this can be seen in the context of the Babylonian exile, where the Israelites were scattered and later returned to their homeland. The gathering signifies God's faithfulness to His covenant promises, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3-4</a>, where God promises to restore His people from captivity. This gathering also prefigures the ultimate gathering of believers from all nations, as seen in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where a multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language stands before the throne of God.<p><b>from east and west</b><br>The mention of "east and west" indicates the vastness of God's reach and the inclusivity of His salvation. In biblical geography, the east often refers to regions like Babylon and Persia, while the west could refer to areas like Egypt and the Mediterranean. This phrase emphasizes that no matter how far God's people have been scattered, His power and grace are sufficient to bring them back. It also foreshadows the global nature of the Gospel, as Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>from north and south</b><br>The inclusion of "north and south" completes the compass directions, symbolizing the totality of God's gathering work. The north could refer to areas like Assyria, while the south might include regions like Cush or Egypt. This comprehensive gathering is a testament to God's sovereignty over all the earth and His ability to fulfill His promises despite geographical and political barriers. It also points to the eschatological hope found in <a href="/isaiah/43-5.htm">Isaiah 43:5-6</a>, where God promises to bring His sons and daughters from the ends of the earth, highlighting the ultimate restoration and unity of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of this Psalm, representing God's chosen people who have experienced exile and return.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lands.htm">The Lands</a></b><br>Refers to the various regions from which God gathers His people, symbolizing the dispersion and subsequent regathering of the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/east,_west,_north,_south.htm">East, West, North, South</a></b><br>Cardinal directions indicating the comprehensive nature of God's gathering, emphasizing His sovereignty over all the earth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/exile_and_return.htm">Exile and Return</a></b><br>The historical context of the Israelites being scattered due to disobedience and then regathered by God's mercy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_deliverance.htm">God's Deliverance</a></b><br>The overarching theme of the Psalm, highlighting God's power and faithfulness in rescuing His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_faithfulness.htm">God's Sovereignty and Faithfulness</a></b><br>God is sovereign over all the earth and faithful to His promises, gathering His people from every corner of the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_inclusivity_of_god's_call.htm">The Inclusivity of God's Call</a></b><br>The gathering from all directions signifies the inclusivity of God's call, extending His grace to all who will come to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_times_of_dispersion.htm">Hope in Times of Dispersion</a></b><br>Just as God gathered the Israelites, He offers hope and restoration to those who feel scattered or distant from Him today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_church's_mission.htm">The Church's Mission</a></b><br>The church is called to participate in God's gathering work, reaching out to all nations with the gospel message.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_reflection_on_god's_deliverance.htm">Personal Reflection on God's Deliverance</a></b><br>Reflect on personal experiences of feeling lost or scattered and how God has worked to bring you back to Himself.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_107_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 107:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_107_3_God_s_power_in_gathering.htm">How does Psalm 107:3 illustrate God's power in gathering His people together?

The verb pictures a shepherd bringing scattered sheep into one flock, much like <a href="/ezekiel/34-12.htm">Ezekiel 34:12</a> promises: &#8220;I will rescue My flock and they will no longer be prey.&#8221; Jesus echoes the same heart in <a href="/john/11-52.htm">John 11:52</a>, when He would &#8220;gather together into one the children of God.&#8221; In every age the Lord moves toward His people, never content to leave them dispersed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From the lands</b><p>The phrase confirms that the scattering was real geography, not mere metaphor. Israel&#8217;s exiles truly lived in &#8220;the lands&#8221; of their conquerors&#8212;Assyria, Babylon, Persia&#8212;yet God had pledged, &#8220;The LORD your God will restore you from captivity&#8230; and gather you again from all the peoples&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3-4</a>). Nehemiah claimed that promise when he prayed, &#8220;Even if your exiles are at the farthest horizon, I will gather them&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/1-8.htm">Nehemiah 1:8-9</a>). What God promises, He performs, proving both His faithfulness and His sovereignty over every nation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From east</b><p>East in Scripture often marks both exile and expectation. Adam and Eve went east of Eden; Judah was carried east to Babylon. Yet <a href="/isaiah/43-5.htm">Isaiah 43:5-6</a> reverses that tragedy: &#8220;I will bring your offspring from the east.&#8221; The sunrise in the east becomes a daily reminder that God&#8217;s mercies are new and that restoration is certain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And west</b><p>Pairing east with west shows the breadth of God&#8217;s reach. As <a href="/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a> celebrates, &#8220;As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.&#8221; He gathers from the same vast span. No boundary, no culture, no distance can frustrate His plan to reclaim His own.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From north</b><p>Historically, most invasions came from the north, so exile&#8217;s pain carried a northern accent (<a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>). Yet <a href="/jeremiah/16-15.htm">Jeremiah 16:15</a> reverses the threat: &#8220;As surely as the LORD lives&#8230; who brought the Israelites up from the land of the north.&#8221; The Redeemer doesn&#8217;t merely undo captivity; He transforms former corridors of judgment into highways of homecoming.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And south</b><p>The south (Negev) is arid, seemingly barren. <a href="/isaiah/43-6.htm">Isaiah 43:6</a> completes the compass: &#8220;I will say to the south, &#8216;Do not hold them back.&#8217;&#8221; Even the most inhospitable region must surrender the Lord&#8217;s people. <a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26</a> records the gospel reaching an Ethiopian official&#8212;proof that God&#8217;s gathering extends all the way to Africa&#8217;s deserts and beyond.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/107-3.htm">Psalm 107:3</a> describes a literal, worldwide regathering initiated by God, spanning every direction on the compass. The verse assures us that no distance is too great, no land too foreign, no circumstance too hard for the Lord to reclaim His redeemed people. What He promised through Moses, confirmed through the prophets, and fulfilled in Christ, He is still accomplishing today&#8212;drawing His people home, one life at a time, until every corner of creation resounds with His praise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/107.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Gathered them.</span>--The usual prophetic word for the Restoration.
