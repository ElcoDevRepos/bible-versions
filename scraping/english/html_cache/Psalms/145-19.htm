The concept of "fear" in this context is not about being afraid but rather having a deep respect and reverence for God. This reverence leads to a life aligned with His will, which in turn results in God fulfilling their desires. This is consistent with the biblical principle found in <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>, where seeking God's kingdom first leads to the fulfillment of needs. Historically, the Israelites experienced this during their journey to the Promised Land, where their needs were met as they followed God's commands. Theologically, this reflects the covenant relationship where God promises blessings to those who are faithful.<p><b>He hears their cry and saves them.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's responsiveness and deliverance. The act of crying out to God is a recurring theme in the Psalms, symbolizing a plea for help and trust in God's power to save. This is seen in the Exodus narrative, where God hears the cries of the Israelites in bondage and delivers them (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-8</a>). Theologically, this points to God's omnipresence and omnipotence, assuring believers that He is always attentive and capable of providing salvation. In the New Testament, this is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who offers ultimate salvation to those who call upon His name (<a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>). The phrase underscores the personal nature of God's salvation, emphasizing His willingness to intervene in the lives of those who seek Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>- The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/145.htm">Psalm 145</a>, King David, is known for his deep relationship with God and his role as a leader of Israel.
