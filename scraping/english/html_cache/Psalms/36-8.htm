The "house" can be understood as the temple, a central place of worship and God's dwelling among His people (<a href="/1_kings/8-13.htm">1 Kings 8:13</a>). The abundance signifies the spiritual blessings and sustenance that God provides, echoing the imagery of a banquet in <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>, where the Lord prepares a feast for all peoples. This abundance is not merely physical but also spiritual, reflecting the fullness of life found in God's presence (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>). The concept of feasting in God's house also points to the eschatological hope of the marriage supper of the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>), where believers will enjoy eternal fellowship with Christ.<p><b>and You give them drink from Your river of delights</b><br>The imagery of a river suggests a continuous and overflowing source of refreshment and joy. In biblical times, water was a precious commodity, especially in the arid regions of the Near East, making this metaphor particularly powerful. The "river of delights" can be connected to the river flowing from the throne of God in <a href="/revelation/22.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>, symbolizing the life-giving presence of God. This river is reminiscent of the Garden of Eden, where a river watered the garden and sustained life (<a href="/genesis/2-10.htm">Genesis 2:10</a>). The delights refer to the pleasures and joys found in a relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>, where it is stated that in God's presence there is fullness of joy. This phrase also typifies Jesus Christ, who offers living water to those who believe in Him, promising that they will never thirst again (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>- The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/36.htm">Psalm 36</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who often wrote about the nature of God and His relationship with humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_house.htm">God's House</a></b><br>- Symbolic of God's presence and provision, representing a place of spiritual abundance and blessing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/river_of_delights.htm">River of Delights</a></b><br>- A metaphor for the spiritual nourishment and joy that God provides to His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_abundance.htm">God's Abundance</a></b><br>God provides abundantly for His people, both physically and spiritually.

Far from nibbling, they &#8220;feast,&#8221; enjoying everything set before them. The psalmist presents intimate fellowship, much like <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, &#8220;You prepare a table before me&#8230; my cup overflows,&#8221; and <a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1-2</a>, where God invites the thirsty and hungry to come without cost. Here, eating is not a mere metaphor for information about God; it is a literal promise that the Lord satisfies every need&#8212;physical, emotional, and spiritual&#8212;so completely that His people can only describe the experience as a banquet.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On the Abundance</b><p>&#8220;Abundance&#8221; highlights limitless supply. God never rations grace or provision. Paul echoes this theme in <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7-8</a>, saying God lavishes His riches on us. Likewise, <a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a> illustrates windows of heaven opened until &#8220;no room remains&#8221; for the blessing. The word reassures believers that scarcity never characterizes life in a covenant relationship with the Almighty; His storehouses overflow.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Of Your House</b><p>The setting matters. The &#8220;house&#8221; points to God&#8217;s dwelling, first the tabernacle, then the temple, and now&#8212;through Christ&#8212;the gathering of believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>). <a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a> delights in beholding God&#8217;s beauty in His house, and <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a> urges confident access through Jesus&#8217; blood. The location conveys safety, belonging, and familial warmth. When we step inside, we are no longer strangers but cherished children seated at the family table.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And You Give Them Drink</b><p>God does not stop at feeding; He personally hands the cup to His own. <a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a> speaks of restful waters, and <a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-38</a> records Jesus crying, &#8220;If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink.&#8221; The verb &#8220;give&#8221; emphasizes that refreshment is not earned; it is gifted. Thirst is quenched because the Father is attentive to every dry place in the believer&#8217;s soul.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From Your River of Delights</b><p>The picture now widens from cup to river&#8212;a flowing, continual source. <a href="/psalms/46-4.htm">Psalm 46:4</a> celebrates &#8220;a river whose streams delight the city of God,&#8221; while <a href="/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a> shows the river of the water of life bright as crystal. Unlike earthly thrills that fade, these &#8220;delights&#8221; remain pure, holy, and deeply satisfying. <a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a> affirms, &#8220;In Your presence is fullness of joy; at Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.&#8221; The literal river in God&#8217;s future kingdom assures today&#8217;s saint of unstoppable joy, starting now and culminating in eternity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a> paints a lavish portrait of life with God. In His own house He spreads an abundant banquet, personally serves overflowing drink, and sustains us with an ever-fresh river of pure delight. Scarcity, fear, and thirst vanish where the Father welcomes His children. Confidence grows that every need&#8212;present and eternal&#8212;is met, because the Host Himself is our supply.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">They shall be abundantly satisfied.</span>--Better, in order to preserve the parallelism, literally, <span class= "ital">They shall drink to the full. </span>LXX. and Vulg., "They shall be intoxicated with," &c<p><span class= "bld">Fatness, </span>therefore, is not here the fat of the sacrificial offerings, but the stream of grace flowing from above, to enrich men as the rain enriches the earth.

The blessings intended are spiritual blessings; and the "house" is, primarily, "the place where God set his name," which at this time was the tabernacle. Faithful Israelites were to expect spiritual blessings through faithful attendance on the tabernacle worship, so far as it was accessible to them. The "house" typified heaven, whence, of course, the blessings really came. <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt make them drink</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the river of thy pleasures;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the river of thy Edens.</span> Thou shalt give them access to an exhaustless fountain of delight, a stream like that which watered Eden (comp. <a href="/isaiah/51-3.htm">Isaiah 51:3</a>;
