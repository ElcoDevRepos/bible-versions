The Israelites, after witnessing God's miraculous deliverance at the Red Sea, believed in the promises God had made to their forefathers, such as those given to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This belief is a pivotal moment, as it shows a temporary alignment with God's will and acknowledgment of His power and faithfulness. The promises referred to here include the covenantal assurances of land, descendants, and blessing (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). This moment of belief is significant in the narrative of Israel's history, as it contrasts with their frequent lapses into doubt and disobedience. It also prefigures the call to faith in the New Testament, where belief in God's promises is central to the Christian faith (<a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>).<p><b>and sang His praise.</b><br>The act of singing praise is a response to God's mighty acts and a form of worship that acknowledges His sovereignty and goodness. In the context of the Exodus, this refers to the song of Moses and Miriam found in <a href="/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>, where the Israelites celebrated their deliverance from Egypt. Singing was a common expression of worship in ancient Israel, often accompanied by instruments and dance, as seen in various Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/150.htm">Psalm 150</a>). This act of praise is not only a response to God's past actions but also an expression of trust in His future faithfulness. It is a reminder of the importance of worship in the life of believers, serving as both a declaration of God's glory and a reinforcement of communal faith.
