In biblical context, this is a common critique of idolatry found throughout the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/44-18.htm">Isaiah 44:18-20</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/10-5.htm">Jeremiah 10:5</a>). The inability of idols to hear emphasizes their lifelessness and the futility of worshiping them. This serves as a reminder of the living nature of God, who actively listens to the prayers of His followers (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>). The cultural context of ancient Israel involved surrounding nations that worshiped idols, making this a direct challenge to those practices. Theologically, this can be seen as a call to trust in God alone, who is not only alive but also sovereign and responsive.<p><b>nor is there breath in their mouths.</b><br>The absence of breath signifies the lack of life and spirit in idols. In the Hebrew language, the word for breath, "ruach," is also used for spirit, indicating life and vitality. This phrase underscores the lifelessness of idols, contrasting them with the God of Israel, who is the source of all life (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>). Theologically, this points to the uniqueness of God as the Creator, who alone has the power to give life. In the New Testament, this can be connected to the Holy Spirit, who is described as the breath of God, bringing life and renewal (<a href="/john/20-22.htm">John 20:22</a>). This also serves as a type of Christ, who is the living Word and through whom all things were made (<a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3-4</a>). Historically, the worship of idols was prevalent in the ancient Near East, and this verse serves as a polemic against such practices, urging the people to worship the one true God who is alive and active.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/135.htm">Psalm 135</a>, traditionally attributed to King David or another inspired writer, who composes this psalm as a hymn of praise and a call to worship the one true God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>The verse refers to idols, which are man-made objects of worship that are lifeless and powerless, often crafted from materials like wood, stone, or metal.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of Israel, God's chosen people, who are often warned against idolatry and encouraged to worship Yahweh alone.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_worship.htm">Temple Worship</a></b><br>The context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/135.htm">Psalm 135</a> includes temple worship, where the Israelites would gather to praise God and be reminded of His mighty acts and supremacy over idols.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pagan_nations.htm">Pagan Nations</a></b><br>The surrounding nations of Israel, who often worshipped idols and false gods, contrasting with Israel's worship of the living God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_idolatry.htm">The Futility of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idols are lifeless and powerless, unable to hear or respond to those who worship them.

By noting their ears, the text sets up a contrast with the living God, who both fashions ears and hears (<a href="/psalms/94-9.htm">Psalm 94:9</a>). Just as the prophet Isaiah mocks idols that must be fashioned by human craftsmen (<a href="/isaiah/44-13.htm">Isaiah 44:13&#8211;17</a>), this verse reminds us that similarity in appearance never equals true substance.<p>Key reminders:<p>&#8226; Idols mimic God&#8217;s creative work but do not replicate His life-giving power (<a href="/jeremiah/10-3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Their &#8220;ears&#8221; testify to the human longing for a deity who listens&#8212;yet idolatry satisfies only the eye, never the heart (<a href="/habakkuk/2-18.htm">Habakkuk 2:18&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But cannot hear</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;but cannot hear.&#8221; Here lies the crushing verdict: though shaped with ears, an idol is deaf. Scripture regularly drives this point home (<a href="/psalms/115-5.htm">Psalm 115:5&#8211;6</a>). The living God hears every cry (<a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-12.htm">1 Peter 3:12</a>); false gods, however, leave worshipers shouting into the void (<a href="/1_kings/18-26.htm">1 Kings 18:26&#8211;29</a>).<p>Consider the implications:<p>&#8226; Prayer to anything other than the LORD is wasted breath (<a href="/isaiah/45-20.htm">Isaiah 45:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Trust placed in powerless objects leaves hearts equally powerless (<a href="/jonah/2-8.htm">Jonah 2:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Real comfort comes only from the God who listens attentively (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nor is there breath in their mouths</b><p>Finally, &#8220;nor is there breath in their mouths.&#8221; Breath signifies life itself (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>). Without breath, idols are lifeless lumps&#8212;stone, wood, metal. They cannot speak truth (<a href="/jeremiah/10-14.htm">Jeremiah 10:14</a>), give counsel (<a href="/isaiah/41-28.htm">Isaiah 41:28&#8211;29</a>), or rescue anyone (<a href="/isaiah/46-7.htm">Isaiah 46:7</a>).<p>Practical takeaways:<p>&#8226; Any so-called god lacking breath is unworthy of awe or allegiance (<a href="/acts/14-15.htm">Acts 14:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Modern idols&#8212;careers, relationships, possessions&#8212;offer no life; they cannot breathe hope into a weary soul (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Only the LORD breathes new life into His people through His Spirit (<a href="/ezekiel/37-5.htm">Ezekiel 37:5&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/john/20-22.htm">John 20:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/135-17.htm">Psalm 135:17</a> exposes idols as ear-shaped but deaf, mouth-shaped but breathless. They tantalize the senses yet cannot sense; they promise but cannot perform. The verse invites us to abandon every non-living substitute and entrust ourselves to the one true God who both gives ears and hears, who both forms mouths and speaks, and who alone breathes life into all who call on Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/135-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They have ears</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1494;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1443;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;z&#601;&#183;na&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - fd<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_241.htm">Strong's 241: </a> </span><span class="str2">Broadness, the ear</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but cannot</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
