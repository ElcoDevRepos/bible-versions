In biblical terms, the "right hand" often symbolizes strength and authority (<a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>, <a href="/psalms/118-16.htm">Psalm 118:16</a>). The exaltation of the foes' right hand implies that God has permitted them to triumph over the psalmist, which can be seen as a form of judgment or discipline. Historically, Israel faced numerous adversaries, such as the Philistines, Assyrians, and Babylonians, who at times were allowed to prevail due to Israel's disobedience (<a href="/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18-20</a>). This can also be seen as a test of faith, where the psalmist is called to trust in God's ultimate plan despite current adversities. Theologically, this can be connected to the concept of God using even the actions of enemies to fulfill His purposes, as seen in the story of Joseph (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p><b>You have made all his enemies rejoice.</b><br>The rejoicing of the enemies indicates a complete reversal of fortune for the psalmist or the nation of Israel. In the ancient Near Eastern context, victory in battle was often attributed to the favor of one's deity, and thus the enemies' rejoicing could be seen as a sign of their perceived divine favor. This situation is reminiscent of times when Israel's enemies celebrated their victories, such as when the Philistines captured the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/1_samuel/4-5.htm">1 Samuel 4:5-7</a>). Theologically, this phrase can be understood as a temporary state allowed by God, who ultimately controls the fate of nations (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>). It also serves as a reminder of the transient nature of earthly power and the ultimate justice of God, who will vindicate His people in His timing (<a href="/psalms/37-12.htm">Psalm 37:12-13</a>). In a typological sense, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's apparent defeat at the crucifixion, which ultimately led to His victory over sin and death, causing His enemies' temporary rejoicing to turn into ultimate defeat (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ethan_the_ezrahite.htm">Ethan the Ezrahite</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, who is traditionally understood to be a wise man during the time of Solomon.

By saying, &#8220;You have exalted the right hand of his foes&#8221;, the psalmist recognizes that the LORD Himself has allowed enemy power to rise against the Davidic king.<p>&#8226; Similar moments appear when God disciplines His people:<p>&#8211; <a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a> &#8220;He sold them into the hands of their enemies round about.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/psalms/44-9.htm">Psalm 44:9-10</a> &#8220;You have rejected and humbled us&#8230;You give us as sheep to be devoured.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/lamentations/2-3.htm">Lamentations 2:3-4</a> &#8220;He has withdrawn His right hand&#8230;He has increased the strength of the enemy.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This does not cancel God&#8217;s covenant promises (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).
