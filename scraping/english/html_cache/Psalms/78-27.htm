The imagery of "raining" suggests an overwhelming abundance, emphasizing God's ability to provide beyond human expectation. The comparison to "dust" highlights the sheer quantity, indicating that the meat was as plentiful as the particles of dust, which are innumerable. This event underscores God's power and faithfulness in meeting the needs of His people, despite their complaints and lack of faith. It also serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over creation, as He commands the natural world to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>and winged birds like the sand of the sea</b><br>The "winged birds" specifically refer to quail, which were brought by a wind from the sea, as detailed in <a href="/numbers/11-31.htm">Numbers 11:31</a>. The comparison to "the sand of the sea" further emphasizes the vast number of birds provided, echoing the promise to Abraham about his descendants being as numerous as the sand (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>). This abundance is a testament to God's generosity and His ability to provide in ways that defy human logic. The quail episode also serves as a type of Christ, who is the true bread from heaven (<a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31-35</a>), providing spiritual sustenance to all who believe. The provision of quail, like manna, points to God's ultimate provision in Jesus, who satisfies the deepest needs of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, demonstrating His power and provision for the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of God's provision, who were wandering in the wilderness and in need of sustenance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites experienced God's miraculous provision of quail.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/q/quail.htm">Quail</a></b><br>The "winged birds" mentioned in the verse, provided by God to feed the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/exodus.htm">Exodus</a></b><br>The broader event during which this provision took place, as the Israelites journeyed from Egypt to the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_abundant_provision.htm">God's Abundant Provision</a></b><br>God provides for our needs abundantly, often beyond what we can imagine, as He did for the Israelites with quail.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>The Israelites' experience teaches us to trust in God's timing and provision, even when we are in a "wilderness" season of life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_over_grumbling.htm">Gratitude Over Grumbling</a></b><br>Instead of grumbling like the Israelites, we should cultivate a heart of gratitude for God's continuous provision in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_sustenance.htm">Spiritual Sustenance</a></b><br>Just as God provided physical sustenance, He also offers spiritual nourishment through Jesus Christ, the Bread of Life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_discontent.htm">Consequences of Discontent</a></b><br>The Israelites' discontent led to consequences;

the verb &#8220;rained&#8221; echoes <a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>, where He also says, &#8220;I will rain down bread from heaven for you.&#8221;<p>- This supernatural supply shows the Lord&#8217;s sovereign control over creation, just as in <a href="/numbers/11-31.htm">Numbers 11:31</a> He &#8220;brought quail from the sea.&#8221;<p>- By recounting the event, Asaph reminds Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;that divine generosity is not theoretical; it is tangible and historical.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on them like dust</b><p>- The simile magnifies quantity: dust is everywhere, impossible to count.<p>- In <a href="/exodus/16-13.htm">Exodus 16:13</a> the quail covered the camp; <a href="/psalms/105-40.htm">Psalm 105:40</a> adds, &#8220;They asked, and He brought quail and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.&#8221;<p>- The sheer abundance removes all doubt about God&#8217;s ability to meet needs, silencing complaints (<a href="/numbers/11-6.htm">Numbers 11:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and winged birds</b><p>- &#8220;Winged&#8221; highlights mobility; what normally escapes human grasp is effortlessly sent by God.<p>- <a href="/isaiah/46-11.htm">Isaiah 46:11</a> pictures the Lord summoning &#8220;a bird of prey from the east&#8221; to fulfill His purpose, underscoring that even the skies obey Him.<p>- The contrast is striking: Israel can&#8217;t muster food, yet God commands flocks of quail to descend right at their feet.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>like the sand of the sea</b><p>- Another image of incalculable multitude, recalling <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a> where Abraham&#8217;s offspring are compared to &#8220;the sand on the seashore.&#8221;<p>- The promise to Abraham finds provisional fulfillment here: His descendants are not only numerous but also nourished.<p>- <a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31</a> looks back on this scene when the crowd says, &#8220;Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness,&#8221; connecting physical provision to the ultimate Bread of Life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/78-27.htm">Psalm 78:27</a> records a factual moment when the Lord saturated Israel&#8217;s camp with quail. Each phrase layers evidence of His limitless power and generous heart: He personally acted, supplied in overwhelming measure, commanded otherwise untamable birds, and did so to a degree beyond counting. The verse assures believers that the God who once filled the wilderness with meat can still meet every need today, abundantly and faithfully.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/78.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) No doubt there is poetical hyperbole here, but for the enormous numbers of quails that are now caught, see the article quoted above.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/78.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He rained flesh also upon them</span>.
