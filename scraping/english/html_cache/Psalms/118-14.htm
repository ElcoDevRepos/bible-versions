In the context of ancient Israel, strength was often associated with military might and protection. The psalmist acknowledges that true strength comes from the LORD, not from human power or resources. This is a recurring theme in the Psalms and throughout the Old Testament, where God is depicted as a warrior and protector of His people (<a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>, <a href="/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a>). The phrase also reflects a personal relationship with God, indicating trust and dependence on Him in times of trouble.<p><b>and my song</b><br>The reference to "song" suggests a response of praise and worship. In biblical times, songs were a common way to express joy, gratitude, and remembrance of God's deeds. This phrase indicates that the LORD is not only the source of strength but also the reason for joy and celebration. The use of song in worship is seen throughout the Psalms and is a key element of Israelite worship practices. It also points to the joy of salvation and deliverance, themes that are central to the psalm.<p><b>and He has become my salvation</b><br>This phrase highlights the transformative work of God in the life of the believer. Salvation here can be understood both in a physical sense, as deliverance from enemies or danger, and in a spiritual sense, as deliverance from sin and death. The concept of God as Savior is foundational in the Old Testament and is fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ. The phrase "has become" suggests a personal experience of God's saving power, which is a testimony to His faithfulness and mercy. This connects to the broader biblical narrative of redemption and points to the ultimate salvation through Christ (<a href="/luke/2-30.htm">Luke 2:30</a>, <a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>).<div
