The testing of God refers to their continual questioning of His power and provision, as seen in events like the demand for water at Massah and Meribah (<a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>, <a href="/numbers/20-2.htm">Numbers 20:2-13</a>). This behavior reflects a pattern of unbelief and rebellion, despite witnessing numerous miracles. The testing of God is a theme that recurs throughout the Old Testament, illustrating the human tendency to doubt divine faithfulness. It serves as a warning against hardening one's heart, as emphasized in <a href="/hebrews/3-8.htm">Hebrews 3:8-9</a>, which references these events to caution believers.<p><b>and provoked the Holy One of Israel</b><br>The term "Holy One of Israel" is a title for God that underscores His purity, separateness, and covenant relationship with Israel. Provoking God indicates a deliberate act of defiance and disrespect towards His holiness and authority. This provocation is seen in the Israelites' idolatry, such as the worship of the golden calf (Exodus 32), and their frequent complaints against God's appointed leaders, Moses and Aaron. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of Israel's history, where their actions often led to divine judgment and discipline. The title "Holy One of Israel" is frequently used by the prophet Isaiah, emphasizing God's unique relationship with His people and His expectations of their faithfulness (<a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>, <a href="/isaiah/30-11.htm">Isaiah 30:11</a>). This phrase serves as a reminder of the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance and reverence towards God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

Mean</div><b>Again and again</b><p>The opening phrase highlights the tragic persistence of Israel&#8217;s unbelief. The psalmist is recalling a pattern, not a one-time lapse.<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a> is a long rehearsal of God&#8217;s mighty works (vv. 12&#8211;16; 23&#8211;25; 42&#8211;55) set against Israel&#8217;s repeated failings (vv. 17-19; 32-33).<p>&#8226; This repeated cycle mirrors the era of the judges: &#8220;Then the LORD raised up judges&#8230; yet they did not listen&#8221; (<a href="/judges/2-16.htm">Judges 2:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Nehemiah looks back and says, &#8220;Again they did evil before You&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/9-28.htm">Nehemiah 9:28-29</a>).<p>The phrase presses us to recognize that sin left unchecked grows habitual, dulling the conscience and multiplying offense.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they tested God</b><p>To &#8220;test&#8221; God means demanding proof of His power or goodness when He has already given ample revelation.<p>&#8226; At Massah the people quarreled with Moses, saying, &#8220;Is the LORD among us or not?&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/17-7.htm">Exodus 17:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Later they cried, &#8220;Can God spread a table in the wilderness?&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/78-19.htm">Psalm 78:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus rebuked Satan with <a href="/deuteronomy/6-16.htm">Deuteronomy 6:16</a>: &#8220;Do not test the LORD your God&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/4-7.htm">Matthew 4:7</a>).<p>Testing God reveals a heart of unbelief and ingratitude. Instead of trusting past mercies, Israel demanded fresh signs, shifting the burden of proof onto the faithful Creator.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and provoked</b><p>Testing quickly turns into provoking&#8212;arousing divine displeasure by obstinate rebellion.<p>&#8226; &#8220;How long will this people provoke Me?&#8221; the LORD asks after the spies&#8217; unbelief (<a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Moses reminds the nation, &#8220;From the day you left Egypt&#8230; you have been rebelling against the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-7.htm">Deuteronomy 9:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Hebrews draws the parallel for us: &#8220;Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt?&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16</a>).<p>Provoking God is not a momentary misstep; it is a conscious resistance to His authority, a refusal to submit to His revealed will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Holy One of Israel</b><p>This title underscores why their behavior was so grievous. He is utterly set apart, morally perfect, and covenant-keeping.<p>&#8226; Isaiah makes this name a refrain: &#8220;Woe to the sinful nation&#8230; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>).<p>&#8226; In the throne room vision the seraphim cry, &#8220;Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Hosts&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>), reminding us that holiness is His defining attribute.<p>&#8226; Leviticus grounds all commands in God&#8217;s character: &#8220;Be holy, because I, the LORD your God, am holy&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>).<p>To provoke the Holy One is to clash head-on with absolute purity and faithfulness. His holiness magnifies both His patient grace and His righteous judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/78-41.htm">Psalm 78:41</a> exposes a sobering pattern: habitual sin (&#8220;again and again&#8221;) leads to doubting God&#8217;s goodness (&#8220;they tested God&#8221;), hardens into open rebellion (&#8220;and provoked&#8221;), and ultimately offends the perfectly righteous Lord (&#8220;the Holy One of Israel&#8221;). The verse calls believers to break the cycle by remembering God&#8217;s past works, trusting His present faithfulness, and honoring His holy name with obedient hearts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/78.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">Limited.</span>--A verb used in <a href="/ezekiel/9-4.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Go through the middle of the city, through the middle of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the middle thereof.">Ezekiel 9:4</a> for putting a mark on the forehead, which has been very variously explained.
