In biblical times, sheep were common livestock, often used as sacrificial animals, symbolizing innocence and vulnerability. Sheol, in Hebrew thought, is the realm of the dead, a shadowy place where all go after death, regardless of their moral standing. This reflects the inevitability of death for all humanity, a theme echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:19-20</a>, where humans and animals share the same fate of returning to dust.<p><b>Death will be their shepherd.</b><br>Here, death is personified as a shepherd, a stark contrast to the Lord being the shepherd in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>. This imagery suggests that instead of being guided by God, the wicked are led by death itself, highlighting their ultimate separation from divine care and guidance. The shepherd metaphor is significant in the Bible, often representing leadership and care, as seen in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, where Jesus is the Good Shepherd. This phrase underscores the absence of such divine leadership for the wicked.<p><b>The upright will rule them in the morning,</b><br>This suggests a reversal of fortunes, where the righteous will ultimately triumph over the wicked. "In the morning" symbolizes a new beginning or resurrection, pointing to a future time when justice will be served. This aligns with the eschatological hope found in passages like <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, where the righteous are raised to everlasting life. The concept of the righteous ruling is also seen in <a href="/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>, where they reign with Christ.<p><b>and their form will decay in Sheol,</b><br>The physical decay of the wicked in Sheol emphasizes the temporary nature of earthly wealth and power. This decay contrasts with the hope of resurrection and eternal life for the righteous, as mentioned in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-42.htm">1 Corinthians 15:42-44</a>, where the perishable body is raised imperishable. The focus on physical decay serves as a reminder of the futility of trusting in material possessions.<p><b>far from their lofty abode.</b><br>This phrase highlights the separation between the wicked's earthly status and their ultimate fate. Their "lofty abode" refers to their wealth and high social standing, which cannot save them from death and decay. This echoes the parable of the rich man and Lazarus in <a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19-31</a>, where the rich man's earthly luxury is contrasted with his torment in the afterlife. It serves as a warning against placing trust in worldly achievements rather than in God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheep.htm">Sheep</a></b><br>Symbolically represents people who are following a path without understanding, often used to describe those who are spiritually lost or misguided.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheol.htm">Sheol</a></b><br>In Hebrew thought, Sheol is the realm of the dead, a place of darkness and separation from the living, often associated with the grave or the afterlife.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a></b><br>Personified as a shepherd in this verse, indicating the inevitability of death guiding those who are not aligned with God&#8217;s will.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upright.htm">The Upright</a></b><br>Refers to those who live righteously and in accordance with God&#8217;s commandments, who will ultimately triumph over the wicked.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/morning.htm">Morning</a></b><br>Symbolizes a new beginning or resurrection, representing the hope and victory of the righteous over death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_inevitability_of_death.htm">The Inevitability of Death</a></b><br>Recognize that death is a certainty for all, but the path we choose in life determines our eternal destiny.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_righteousness.htm">The Role of Righteousness</a></b><br>Living a life aligned with God&#8217;s will ensures that we are counted among the upright who will triumph over death.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_resurrection.htm">Hope in Resurrection</a></b><br>The "morning" symbolizes the hope of resurrection and eternal life for those who are faithful to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_earthly_wealth_and_status.htm">The Futility of Earthly Wealth and Status</a></b><br>Earthly achievements and possessions cannot prevent the decay of the body in Sheol; only a relationship with God offers true security.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Focus on living with an eternal perspective, prioritizing spiritual growth and alignment with God&#8217;s purposes over temporary worldly gains.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_49_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 49:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_49_14_on_wealth_s_fate.htm">How does Psalm 49:14 highlight the fate of those who trust in wealth?

Comp. Keble's paraphrase.<p>"Even as a flock arrayed are they<p>For the dark grave; Death guides their way,<p>Death is their shepherd now."<p>The rendering, "feed on them," is an error.

By a slight change of points and accents, and taking <span class= "ital">mizbul </span>as a derivative noun equivalent to <span class= "ital">zebul </span>(so also Gratz), we get, "Their beauty (is) for corruption; sheol (is) its dwelling," <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, all, wise and unwise, good and bad, must descend to the under world (<a href="/psalms/49-11.htm" title="Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.">Psalm 49:11</a>), so that the upright accompany the wicked thither, and it becomes the dwelling-place of their beauty, <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, their bodies. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">feed on them.</span> With the foolish fancies and vain conceits of the ungodly rich men, the psalmist now contrasts the reality.
