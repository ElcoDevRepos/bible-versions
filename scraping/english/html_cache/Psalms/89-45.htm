In the context of <a href="/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, which is a contemplation of the covenant with David, this could refer to the decline of a king or leader from David's line. Historically, the Davidic dynasty faced challenges and interruptions, particularly during the Babylonian exile, which could be seen as a cutting short of their reign. Theologically, this phrase may also symbolize the brevity of human life and the fleeting nature of earthly power, echoing themes found in other scriptures such as <a href="/job/14.htm">Job 14:1-2</a> and <a href="/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15-16</a>. The cutting short of youth can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, though He died young, fulfilled His purpose and established an eternal kingdom.<p><b>You have covered him with shame.</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to the disgrace and humiliation experienced by the king or the nation. In the ancient Near Eastern context, shame was a powerful social force, often associated with defeat or failure. The covering with shame could be linked to the loss of divine favor or protection, as seen in the history of Israel when they turned away from God and faced consequences. This theme of shame is also present in the prophetic literature, such as in <a href="/isaiah/47-3.htm">Isaiah 47:3</a>, where Babylon is shamed for its arrogance. In a messianic sense, Jesus Christ bore the shame of the cross (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>), transforming it into a symbol of victory and redemption.<p><b>Selah</b><br>The term "Selah" is often found in the Psalms and is thought to be a musical or liturgical pause, inviting the reader or listener to reflect on the preceding words. It emphasizes the gravity of the lament and encourages contemplation of the divine justice and mercy. In the broader context of <a href="/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, "Selah" serves as a moment to ponder the tension between God's promises to David and the apparent reality of their unfulfillment, urging faith in God's ultimate plan and sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ethan_the_ezrahite.htm">Ethan the Ezrahite</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, who is traditionally understood to be a wise man during the time of Solomon. He is credited with writing this psalm, which is a contemplation on God's covenant with David and the apparent failure of that covenant in light of Israel's circumstances.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/davidic_covenant.htm">Davidic Covenant</a></b><br>The promise made by God to King David, ensuring that his descendants would rule Israel forever.

The psalmist observes that the king&#8217;s vigorous period of leadership has been abruptly trimmed.<p>&#8226; Imagine the promise of &#8220;an enduring dynasty&#8221; in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a> suddenly colliding with the quick fall of young rulers like Jehoiachin, who was &#8220;eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Cutting short a reign or a life doesn&#8217;t mean God has abandoned His covenant; it highlights His right to discipline (<a href="/psalms/90-3.htm">Psalm 90:3-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Job captures the same brevity: &#8220;He comes forth like a flower, then withers; he flees like a shadow and does not remain&#8221; (<a href="/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reassures us that even what looks like divine reversal is still under God&#8217;s measured control (<a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have covered him with shame</b><p>&#8211; Public disgrace replaces royal honor, signaling covenant chastening rather than covenant cancellation.<p>&#8226; &#8220;My disgrace is before me all day long, and shame has covered my face&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/44-15.htm">Psalm 44:15-16</a>) mirrors the pain Ethan laments.<p>&#8226; Enemies gloat, thrones topple, and the nation feels the sting (<a href="/lamentations/5-15.htm">Lamentations 5:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a> reminds that &#8220;sin is a disgrace to any people,&#8221; so shame here exposes sin but also invites repentance and eventual restoration (<a href="/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s covering of shame is temporary discipline that preserves a future hope, much like <a href="/zechariah/3-3.htm">Zechariah 3:3-4</a> where filthy garments are replaced with clean ones.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Selah</b><p>&#8211; A purposeful pause.<p>&#8226; &#8220;The LORD of Hosts is with us&#8230; Selah&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>) shows how the pause invites worshipful reflection on God&#8217;s sovereignty even in turmoil.<p>&#8226; Stopping here urges us to weigh the tension between the apparent failure of the Davidic line and the unbreakable word of God (<a href="/psalms/89-34.htm">Psalm 89:34</a>).<p>&#8226; We&#8217;re prompted to remember that discipline is not the last word; resurrection and restoration are (<a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <a href="/acts/13-34.htm">Acts 13:34-37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/89-45.htm">Psalm 89:45</a> captures the shock of a youthful kingly line suddenly stripped of vigor and draped in shame. The verse is a lament over divine discipline, yet within the broader psalm it stands as a faith-filled reminder that every setback is still inside God&#8217;s covenant plan. The cut is controlled, the shame is measured, and both are designed to draw God&#8217;s people back to the certainty that His promises&#8212;ultimately fulfilled in the risen Son of David&#8212;remain unshaken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/89.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The days of his youth hast thou shortened.</span> This does not seem to mean an actual cutting short by death (since the Davidical king has been spoken of as alive in vers. 38, 41, 43), but rather a cutting short of youthful energy and vigour, a premature senescence, such as may well have fallen upon Jehoiachin or Zedekiah. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast covered him with shame;</span> or, "heaped shame upon him" - "covered him up with shame." The phrase would suit Jehoiachin, who was kept in prison by Nebuchadnezzar, and in "prison garments" (<a href="/2_kings/25-29.htm">2 Kings 25:29</a>), for the space of thirty-five years. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/89-45.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You have shortened</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1453;&#1511;&#1456;&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(hiq&#183;&#7779;ar&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7114.htm">Strong's 7114: </a> </span><span class="str2">To dock off, curtail, to harvest</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of his youth;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#363;&#183;m&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
