In ancient agricultural practices, chaff was the husk separated from the grain during the threshing process. It was light and easily carried away by the wind, symbolizing the fate of the wicked who are without substance or stability. This metaphor is also found in <a href="/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a>, where the wicked are compared to chaff blown away by the wind, emphasizing their lack of foundation and ultimate judgment. The use of chaff highlights the transient nature of those who oppose God's people, suggesting that their plans and efforts will ultimately come to nothing.<p><b>as the angel of the LORD drives them away</b><br>The "angel of the LORD" is a significant figure in the Old Testament, often seen as a divine messenger or a manifestation of God's presence and power. In some instances, the angel of the LORD is considered a theophany, a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ, as seen in encounters with figures like Hagar (<a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7-13</a>) and Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11-24</a>). The involvement of the angel of the LORD in driving away the wicked underscores the divine intervention and protection afforded to the righteous. This phrase suggests that the defeat of the wicked is not merely a natural consequence but a direct act of God, ensuring that justice is served. The imagery of being driven away by a divine force reinforces the idea of God's sovereignty and the futility of opposing His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/35.htm">Psalm 35</a>, David is seeking God's intervention against his enemies.

For they are like chaff driven off by the wind&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a>). <a href="/job/21-18.htm">Job 21:18</a> echoes the same image, underscoring utter worthlessness before God&#8217;s judgment.<p>&#8226; By choosing this metaphor, David affirms that the enemies&#8217; schemes have no lasting substance. They may look formidable for a moment, but in God&#8217;s eyes they are already judged and disposable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the wind</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;wind&#8221; signals the irresistible force of divine judgment. <a href="/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a> describes nations being &#8220;chased like chaff on the mountains before the wind,&#8221; showing that when God stirs, no human power can stand.<p>&#8226; The picture also carries a note of swiftness. Wind scatters chaff immediately; likewise, God can bring sudden reversal. <a href="/proverbs/10-25.htm">Proverbs 10:25</a> says, &#8220;When the whirlwind passes, the wicked are no more, but the righteous are secure forever.&#8221;<p>&#8226; For believers, this assures us that God&#8217;s timing may feel delayed, yet when He moves, deliverance is quick and decisive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as the angel of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; David does not rely on mere circumstances; he invokes the personal intervention of &#8220;the angel of the LORD.&#8221; This divine messenger safeguards God&#8217;s people (<a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>) and executes judgment (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>).<p>&#8226; The angel who shielded Israel at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19</a>) is the same One David trusts to defend him now.

Earthly enemies must reckon with supernatural authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>drives them away</b><p>&#8226; The verb pictures relentless pursuit until the threat is completely removed. <a href="/isaiah/41-16.htm">Isaiah 41:16</a> promises, &#8220;The wind will carry them away; a whirlwind will scatter them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Unlike the farmer who merely tosses chaff into the air, the angel deliberately &#8220;drives&#8221; it away, ensuring it cannot regroup or return.<p>&#8226; Jesus picks up this theme when He &#8220;will clear His threshing floor&#8230; burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>).
