In the historical context of ancient Israel, the sword often symbolized military defeat and divine judgment. The imagery of falling by the sword is frequently used in the Old Testament to describe the fate of those who oppose God's anointed or who live in rebellion against Him (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/31-4.htm">1 Samuel 31:4</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a>). The sword represents not only physical destruction but also the execution of divine justice. This phrase can be seen as a prophetic declaration of the downfall of David's enemies, who sought his life unjustly. It underscores the belief that God will ultimately vindicate the righteous and bring judgment upon the wicked.<p><b>they will become a portion for foxes.</b><br>In the cultural and geographical context of ancient Israel, foxes were often associated with desolation and ruin. The reference to becoming a portion for foxes suggests that the enemies will be left unburied, their bodies exposed to scavengers, which was considered a disgraceful end (<a href="/1_kings/14-11.htm">1 Kings 14:11</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/16-4.htm">Jeremiah 16:4</a>). This imagery conveys the totality of their defeat and the shame that accompanies it. Theologically, it emphasizes the futility of opposing God's will and the inevitable downfall of those who do. The mention of foxes also connects to the broader biblical theme of desolation, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/5-18.htm">Lamentations 5:18</a>, where foxes roam among the ruins of Jerusalem. This phrase serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of enmity against God's chosen ones and the ultimate triumph of divine justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/63.htm">Psalm 63</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who wrote this psalm during a time of distress, possibly when he was in the wilderness of Judah fleeing from his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_david.htm">Enemies of David</a></b><br>The individuals or groups who sought to harm David, representing those who oppose God's anointed and righteous followers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness_of_judah.htm">Wilderness of Judah</a></b><br>The geographical setting where David composed this psalm, symbolizing a place of trial and testing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jackals.htm">Jackals</a></b><br>Scavenger animals mentioned in the verse, symbolizing desolation and the fate of the wicked.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sword.htm">Sword</a></b><br>A symbol of divine judgment and the means by which the enemies of the righteous will meet their end.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's justice will ultimately prevail against those who oppose His people.

Such judgment is consistent with God&#8217;s past dealings: &#8220;Whoever seeks your life will himself be pursued by death&#8221; (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/25-29.htm">1 Samuel 25:29</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;sword&#8221; is Scripture&#8217;s ordinary emblem of divine retribution (<a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a>). David&#8217;s own history supplies vivid parallels&#8212;Absalom&#8217;s army fell &#8220;by the edge of the sword&#8221; in the forest of Ephraim (<a href="/2_samuel/18-6.htm">2 Samuel 18:6-8</a>), confirming this verse&#8217;s reliability.<p>&#8226; Notice the moral logic: the enemies&#8217; aggression provokes proportional justice&#8212;&#8220;Their swords will pierce their own hearts&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/37-14.htm">Psalm 37:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; This outcome assures God&#8217;s people that tyranny never gains the last word. <a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a> echoes the same principle: the sword is God&#8217;s minister &#8220;to bring wrath on the wrongdoer.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will become a portion for foxes</b><p>&#8226; After the sword comes disgrace; the fallen are left unburied, becoming &#8220;a portion&#8221; (prey) for scavengers. <a href="/psalms/79-2.htm">Psalm 79:2-3</a> describes the same humiliation when corpses are served &#8220;to the beasts of the earth.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Foxes (often understood as jackals in Israel&#8217;s wilderness) roam desolate places, signaling both physical decay and spiritual ruin. <a href="/lamentations/5-18.htm">Lamentations 5:18</a> pictures Zion desolate &#8220;with foxes prowling over it,&#8221; underscoring how judgment empties a land of its defenders.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly links unburied bodies with the curse of covenant breaking (<a href="/jeremiah/7-33.htm">Jeremiah 7:33</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/29-5.htm">Ezekiel 29:5</a>). David thus announces not a random fate but a covenant-sanctioned penalty.<p>&#8226; The picture is concrete: as surely as the sword strikes, carrion-eaters will arrive. <a href="/2_kings/9-35.htm">2 Kings 9:35-37</a> shows Jezebel&#8217;s remains consumed by dogs&#8212;another testimony that God&#8217;s verdict extends past death to final dishonor.<p>&#8226; For the righteous reader this is sobering yet comforting: God not only rescues His anointed but also publicly vindicates His justice by exposing evil to shame.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/63-10.htm">Psalm 63:10</a> gives a two-fold promise: enemies who raise the sword against God&#8217;s servant will die by that same sword, and their unburied bodies will feed the scavengers of the wilderness.
