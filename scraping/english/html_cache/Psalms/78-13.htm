This event is a pivotal moment in the history of Israel, marking their deliverance from Egyptian bondage. The act of splitting the sea demonstrates God's sovereign power over creation and His ability to intervene supernaturally on behalf of His people. The crossing of the Red Sea is often seen as a type of baptism, symbolizing the transition from slavery to freedom, from death to life. This event is also a foreshadowing of Christ's redemptive work, where believers are brought from the bondage of sin into the freedom of salvation.<p><b>He set the waters upright like a wall.</b><br>The imagery of waters standing upright like a wall emphasizes the miraculous nature of the event. This description highlights the divine intervention required to hold back the waters, allowing the Israelites to pass through on dry ground. The walls of water signify God's protection and provision, ensuring the safety of His people. This event is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/joshua/3.htm">Joshua 3</a>, where the Jordan River is parted for the Israelites to enter the Promised Land. The concept of water as a barrier and God making a way through it is a recurring theme, symbolizing His ability to overcome obstacles and fulfill His promises. This imagery also points to Christ, who calms the storm and walks on water, demonstrating His authority over the natural world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, demonstrating His power and faithfulness by performing a miraculous act for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of God's miraculous intervention, being led out of Egypt and through the Red Sea.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea.htm">The Red Sea</a></b><br>The body of water that God miraculously parted to allow the Israelites to escape from the pursuing Egyptian army.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>Though not mentioned directly in this verse, he is the leader through whom God worked to perform this miracle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a></b><br>The oppressors of the Israelites, whose pursuit led to the miraculous event of the sea parting.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>God has control over nature and can perform miracles to accomplish His purposes.<br><br>Reflect on God's power in your life and trust Him to make a way where there seems to be no way.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_deliverance.htm">Faith in God's Deliverance</a></b><br>The Israelites' passage through the sea required faith in God's promise and power.<br><br>In times of trial, remember that God is able to deliver you from seemingly impossible situations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/remembrance_of_god's_faithfulness.htm">Remembrance of God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Psalm 78 is a call to remember and teach the mighty works of God to future generations.<br><br>Make it a practice to recount and share testimonies of God's faithfulness in your life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_protection_and_guidance.htm">God's Protection and Guidance</a></b><br>Just as God set the waters upright like a wall, He provides protection and guidance for His people.<br><br>Seek God's guidance in your decisions and trust in His protective care.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_78_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 78:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_78_13_God_s_power_faithfulness.htm">How does Psalm 78:13 demonstrate God's power and faithfulness to His people?
