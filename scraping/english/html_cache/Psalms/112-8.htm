In biblical context, the heart often represents the center of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect. Assurance here implies a deep trust in God, reflecting the biblical theme of faith over fear. This assurance is reminiscent of the peace described in <a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>, which surpasses all understanding and guards the heart and mind. The assurance is not self-derived but rooted in the promises and faithfulness of God, as seen throughout the Psalms and other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>, which speaks of perfect peace for those whose minds are steadfast because they trust in God.<p><b>he does not fear,</b><br>Fear is a common human experience, yet the Bible frequently commands believers not to fear, as seen in passages like <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a> and <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>. The absence of fear in this context is a result of the assured heart mentioned earlier. This reflects a trust in God's sovereignty and protection, as well as a belief in His ultimate justice. The cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, often surrounded by hostile nations, underscores the significance of this fearlessness. It is a testament to the power of faith in God to overcome natural human anxieties and threats.<p><b>until he looks in triumph on his foes.</b><br>This phrase anticipates a future victory over adversaries, a common theme in the Psalms where the righteous are often depicted as ultimately prevailing over the wicked. The triumph is not necessarily immediate but is assured in God's timing. This reflects the biblical principle of divine justice, where God vindicates His people. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who, despite facing opposition and suffering, ultimately triumphed over sin and death. The imagery of looking in triumph is echoed in passages like <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, where God prepares a table in the presence of enemies, symbolizing victory and divine favor. This assurance of triumph is a source of hope and encouragement for believers facing trials and opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous_man.htm">The Righteous Man</a></b><br>The primary subject of <a href="/bsb/psalms/112.htm">Psalm 112</a>, representing those who live in accordance with God's commandments and are blessed with stability and fearlessness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/foes.htm">Foes</a></b><br>The adversaries or challenges faced by the righteous, symbolizing any opposition or trials that may arise in life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/triumph.htm">Triumph</a></b><br>The eventual victory or overcoming of adversaries, reflecting God's promise of deliverance and justice for the faithful.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/security_in_faith.htm">Security in Faith</a></b><br>The righteous person's heart is secure because it is anchored in faith and trust in God.
