The "sanctuary" refers to the tabernacle or temple, central places of worship for the Israelites where God's presence was believed to dwell. Historically, the sanctuary was the heart of Israelite worship, where sacrifices were made, and the Ark of the Covenant was housed. This setting underscores the importance of communal and personal worship in experiencing God's presence. The psalmist's recollection of seeing God in the sanctuary suggests a vivid memory of divine encounters, emphasizing the significance of sacred spaces in spiritual life. This can be connected to the New Testament understanding of believers as the temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>), where God's presence now dwells within His people.<p><b>and beheld Your power and glory.</b><br>The psalmist's experience of God's "power and glory" in the sanctuary highlights the manifestation of God's divine attributes. "Power" refers to God's might and ability to act, often demonstrated through miraculous events and deliverance, as seen throughout Israel's history. "Glory" signifies the visible and awe-inspiring presence of God, often associated with light and majesty, as described in the visions of prophets like Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1-4</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the revelation of God's glory in Jesus Christ, who is described as the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of His being (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>). The psalmist's reflection on God's power and glory serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the transformative impact of His presence in the lives of believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/63.htm">Psalm 63</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who wrote this psalm during a time of distress, possibly while in the wilderness of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanctuary.htm">Sanctuary</a></b><br>Refers to the holy place where God's presence dwells.

This is more than an abstract belief; it is conscious awareness.<p>- Scripture shows that God grants such &#8220;sight&#8221; to those who seek Him: &#8220;One thing I have asked of the LORD&#8230; to gaze on the beauty of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>).<p>- Even though David is physically in the wilderness (<a href="/bsb/psalms/63.htm">Psalm 63</a> superscription), he remembers moments when God made His presence unmistakable&#8212;moments that anchor his present faith.<p>- Isaiah had a similar revelation&#8212;&#8220;I saw the Lord sitting on a throne&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>). These experiences confirm that God chooses to reveal Himself personally, not merely conceptually.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the sanctuary</b><p>- The sanctuary points to the tabernacle/temple, the place God designated for His name to dwell (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>- David is likely recalling worship times when he stood before the ark, heard the priests chant, and smelled the incense rising&#8212;a multisensory environment that God filled with His presence.<p>- &#8220;Until I entered the sanctuary of God, then I perceived&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17</a>) shows that clarity and comfort flow from meeting God where He has placed His name.<p>- For believers today, Christ has opened the true and greater sanctuary: &#8220;We have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19</a>). The physical temple foreshadows the spiritual reality we now enjoy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and beheld Your power and glory</b><p>- Power: God&#8217;s ability to act; Glory: the radiant manifestation of who He is. David witnessed both.<p>&#8226; When the ark was returned to Jerusalem, &#8220;David danced before the LORD with all his might&#8221; as power and glory filled the city (<a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; At Solomon&#8217;s dedication, &#8220;the glory of the LORD filled the house of God&#8221; so that priests could not stand to minister (<a href="/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>- &#8220;Splendor and majesty are before Him; strength and glory are in His sanctuary&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/96-6.htm">Psalm 96:6</a>) links these attributes exactly as David does.<p>- God&#8217;s power and glory never fade.

He anchors present thirst in past experience, remembering real moments when God disclosed Himself. The sanctuary frames the meeting; the power and glory define the encounter. This verse invites every believer, regardless of circumstance, to recall and pursue those God-given times when His presence was unmistakable, confident that the same God still fills His sanctuary&#8212;now opened wide through Christ&#8212;with unchanging power and glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/63.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">To see thy power . . .</span>--The transposition of the clauses in the Authorised Version weakens the sense.
