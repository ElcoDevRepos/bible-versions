In ancient Near Eastern culture, fire often symbolized purification and judgment. The psalmist's plea for burning coals reflects a desire for God's justice against the wicked, aligning with <a href="/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22</a>, where coals are a metaphor for overcoming evil with good. The imagery also connects to the altar of incense in the tabernacle, where coals were used to burn incense, symbolizing prayers ascending to God (<a href="/exodus/30.htm">Exodus 30:1-10</a>).<p><b>may they be thrown into the fire,</b><br>Fire is a recurring symbol of God's judgment throughout Scripture, as seen in the destruction of Nadab and Abihu (<a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>) and the consuming fire on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>). This phrase suggests a complete and consuming judgment, akin to the lake of fire described in <a href="/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14-15</a>. The psalmist's call for the wicked to be thrown into the fire underscores the severity of divine justice and the ultimate fate of unrepentant sinners.<p><b>into the miry pits,</b><br>Miry pits evoke images of Sheol or the grave, places of entrapment and destruction (<a href="/psalms/40-2.htm">Psalm 40:2</a>). In ancient times, cisterns or pits were used as prisons or places of execution (<a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>). The psalmist's reference to miry pits suggests a desire for the wicked to be ensnared and rendered powerless, similar to the fate of Korah and his followers who were swallowed by the earth (<a href="/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31-33</a>). This imagery emphasizes the inescapable nature of divine judgment.<p><b>never to rise again.</b><br>This phrase indicates a final and irreversible judgment, echoing the fate of the wicked in <a href="/psalms/1-5.htm">Psalm 1:5</a>, where they will not stand in the judgment. It reflects the ultimate defeat and destruction of evil, as seen in the prophetic visions of <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>. The permanence of this judgment contrasts with the resurrection hope for the righteous, highlighting the psalmist's confidence in God's justice and the eventual triumph of righteousness over wickedness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of this psalm, David is expressing a plea for deliverance from evil men and seeking God's justice against his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_david.htm">Enemies of David</a></b><br>The psalm speaks against those who plot evil and violence, representing the broader theme of wickedness and opposition to God's anointed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/burning_coals_and_fire.htm">Burning Coals and Fire</a></b><br>Symbolic imagery used to describe divine judgment and retribution against the wicked.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/miry_pits.htm">Miry Pits</a></b><br>Represents a place of destruction and entrapment, emphasizing the finality of God's judgment on the wicked.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice.htm">God's Justice</a></b><br>The overarching theme of the psalm, highlighting God's role as the righteous judge who protects the innocent and punishes the wicked.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_righteous_judgment.htm">God's Righteous Judgment</a></b><br>God's justice is perfect and will ultimately prevail against all forms of wickedness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer_in_adversity.htm">The Power of Prayer in Adversity</a></b><br>Like David, believers are encouraged to bring their struggles and enemies before God, trusting in His deliverance and justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_wickedness.htm">The Consequences of Wickedness</a></b><br>The imagery of fire and miry pits serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of living in opposition to God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>While we may desire immediate justice, we must trust in God's perfect timing and His ultimate plan for justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_enemies_with_faith.htm">Responding to Enemies with Faith</a></b><br>Believers are called to respond to enemies with faith, leaving vengeance to God and seeking to live in peace and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_140_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 140:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_140_10_Trust_God_s_justice.htm">How does Psalm 140:10 inspire us to trust God's justice against evildoers?

Each escalating phrase&#8212;burning coals, the fire, the miry pits, final downfall&#8212;highlights God&#8217;s holy resolve to defend the righteous and eradicate persistent wickedness. Far from vindictive rage, the verse expresses confident faith that the Lord of justice will act, just as He always has, ensuring evil is ultimately silenced and His people are eternally secure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/140.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) In this verse too there is a grammatical difficulty, which the margin, "Let there fall on them," instead of "Let them bring upon them," does not remove, since the subject of the next verb is third person <span class= "ital">singular. </span>The first verb is usually taken impersonally, as by the LXX., which version is actually to be followed in rendering <span class= "ital">coals of fire </span>(literally, <span class= "ital">coals accompanied with fire, </span>or, <span class= "ital">coals as fire</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and we get the somewhat awkward, but intelligible--<p>"Let them bring upon them coals of fire;<p>Let him cast them into pits that they rise not again.'<p>But a very slight change gives a plain grammatical sentence with the subject carried on from the last verse:<p>"Let it (mischief) bring even upon themselves coals of fire;<p>Let it cast them into pits, so that they rise no more."<p>(Burgess.)<p>The word "pits" is peculiar to the passage. Gesenius, deriving from a root meaning "to boil up," renders, "whirlpools," which, as in <a href="/psalms/66-12.htm" title="You have caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but you brought us out into a wealthy place.">Psalm 66:12</a>, combines "water" with "fire," as joint emblems of <span class= "ital">perils </span>that cannot be escaped. But Symmachus, Theodotion, and Jerome render "ditches," which is supported by a Rabbinical quotation, given by Delitzsch: "first of all they burned them in pits; when the flesh was consumed they collected the bones, and burned them in coffins."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/140.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let burning coals fall upon them</span>, or, "burning coals shall be thrown upon them." <span class="cmt_word">Let them be cast</span> (or, "they shall be cast") <span class="cmt_word">into the fire, into deep pits, that they rise not up again.</span> The clauses are declaratory rather than optative. The psalmist sees the wrath of God poured out upon his enemies, who are at the same time God's enemies - they are cast into the fire prepared to receive the wicked - and plunged into deep pits whence they find it impossible to extricate themselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/140-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">May burning coals</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1469;&#1495;&#1464;&#1451;&#1500;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ge&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;l&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1513.htm">Strong's 1513: </a> </span><span class="str2">An ember</span><br /><br /><span class="word">fall</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(yim&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7789;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4131.htm">Strong's 4131: </a> </span><span class="str2">To waver, to slip, shake, fall</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on them;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
