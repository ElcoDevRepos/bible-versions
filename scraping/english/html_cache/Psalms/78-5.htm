The "testimony" refers to the divine laws and decrees given to the patriarchs, beginning with Jacob, as a witness to God's faithfulness and expectations. This covenant is foundational, as seen in <a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>, where God promises Jacob land, descendants, and blessings. The testimony serves as a perpetual reminder of God's promises and the responsibilities of His people.<p><b>and appointed a law in Israel</b><br>The "law" refers to the Torah, given to Moses on Mount Sinai, which includes the Ten Commandments and other statutes. This law was meant to set Israel apart as a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). It provided guidelines for worship, social justice, and personal conduct, reflecting God's character and will. The law's appointment signifies its divine origin and authority, underscoring Israel's unique role as God's chosen people.<p><b>which He commanded our fathers</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the generational transmission of God's commandments. The "fathers" refers to the patriarchs and leaders of Israel, such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses, who were entrusted with God's revelations. <a href="/deuteronomy/6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1-9</a> stresses the importance of teaching these laws diligently to one's children, ensuring that each generation remains faithful to the covenant.<p><b>to teach to their children</b><br>The responsibility to teach God's laws to children underscores the importance of family and community in faith formation.

In Jacob (another name for Israel), the Lord planted undeniable evidence of His character: the exodus, the covenant at Sinai, the manna in the wilderness&#8212;events every Israelite could point to and say, &#8220;God has spoken.&#8221; Cross references reinforce this idea: &#8220;These are the testimonies&#8230; which Moses spoke to the sons of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-45.htm">Deuteronomy 4:45</a>); &#8220;Remember the former things of old&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9</a>).<p>&#8226; A testimony is both historical and personal. It anchors faith to real acts of God, not human imagination.<p>&#8226; Because God Himself &#8220;cannot lie&#8221; (<a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>), His testimony is totally reliable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and appointed a law in Israel</b><p>The testimony flows into a clear, written law.
