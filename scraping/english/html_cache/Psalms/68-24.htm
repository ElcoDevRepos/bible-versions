In biblical times, processions were significant events, often associated with victory or religious ceremonies. The imagery here may evoke the memory of the Ark of the Covenant being brought into Jerusalem, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/6.htm">2 Samuel 6</a>. This procession signifies God's leadership and His active role in the life of His people. The "they" could refer to the nations or the people of Israel, witnessing God's majesty and divine intervention.<p><b>the march of my God and King&#8212;</b><br>The term "march" suggests a deliberate and authoritative movement, emphasizing God's sovereignty and kingship. In ancient Israel, God was recognized as the ultimate King, a theme prevalent throughout the Psalms. This phrase underscores the idea of God leading His people, much like a king leading his army. It also foreshadows the messianic expectation of a coming King, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the King of Kings in the New Testament (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>).<p><b>into the sanctuary.</b><br>The sanctuary refers to the holy place where God's presence dwells, initially the tabernacle and later the temple in Jerusalem. This movement into the sanctuary symbolizes God's dwelling among His people and His accessibility to them. It highlights the importance of worship and the centrality of God's presence in the life of Israel. Theologically, it points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who, through His sacrifice, made a way for believers to enter the heavenly sanctuary (<a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>). This also connects to the eschatological vision of God's eternal dwelling with His people in the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, depicted as leading a procession.

The conquest of Canaan is complete - God is gone up into his sanctuary. The nations are led captive or put to tribute Rebels are crushed; the last remnants of them sought out, brought back, and delivered into the hands of Israel. Now we have a description of God's "goings in the sanctuary" (ver. 24). Some critics suppose a particular occasion to be pointed at; but the expression "goings" rather indicates something habitual, or, at any rate, recurring. God is from time to time glorified in his sanctuary by ceremonies which the poet describes. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They have seen thy goings, O God;</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. <span class="accented">men</span> have seen - friends and foes alike - even <span class="cmt_word">the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary</span>.
