The role of the choirmaster was significant in ancient Israel, as music was a central part of worship. This suggests the psalm's communal and liturgical use, emphasizing its importance in the spiritual life of the community.<p><b>A Psalm of David.</b><br>Attributed to King David, this psalm reflects his experiences and insights. David, as a shepherd, warrior, and king, faced numerous challenges and often expressed his reliance on God. His authorship lends the psalm authority and authenticity, as David is a central figure in biblical history, known for his deep relationship with God and his role in establishing Jerusalem as the center of worship.<p><b>Blessed is the one who cares for the poor;</b><br>This phrase highlights a key biblical principle: the blessing associated with caring for the needy. The Hebrew concept of "blessed" implies a state of happiness and divine favor. Caring for the poor is a recurring theme in Scripture, reflecting God's heart for justice and mercy (<a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>, <a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>). It underscores the moral and ethical responsibility of believers to act with compassion and generosity.<p><b>the LORD will deliver him in the day of trouble.</b><br>This promise of divine deliverance connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's faithfulness to those who act righteously. The "day of trouble" can refer to any time of distress or adversity. The assurance of God's protection is a common theme in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>, <a href="/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who embodies God's salvation and deliverance for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/41.htm">Psalm 41</a>, David was the second king of Israel and a man after God's own heart. His life experiences often reflect themes of reliance on God and compassion for others.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor.htm">The Poor</a></b><br>In the context of this Psalm, the poor are those who are in need, vulnerable, and marginalized. The Hebrew word used here, "dal," refers to those who are weak or lowly.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His faithfulness and commitment to His people.

David consistently handed his songs to the chief musician (see <a href="/bsb/psalms/4.htm">Psalm 4, 8, 12</a>), and the Levites led Israel in joyful worship (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-22.htm">1 Chronicles 15:22</a>; 16:42).<p>- New-covenant believers continue the pattern: &#8220;Speak to one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>). Corporate praise cements truth in our hearts and unites the family of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A Psalm of David</b><p>- The superscription anchors the song in real history. David&#8212;shepherd, king, and &#8220;a man after My own heart&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22</a>)&#8212;knew both palace abundance and cave poverty. His experiences give weight to every line.<p>- Because Scripture is God-breathed (<a href="/2_samuel/23-1.htm">2 Samuel 23:1&#8211;2</a>), David&#8217;s words are not mere poetry; they are Spirit-delivered truth we can rely on today.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Blessed is the one who cares for the poor</b><p>&#8220;Blessed is the one who cares for the poor&#8221;.<p>- &#8220;Blessed&#8221; carries the idea of deep, settled happiness rooted in God&#8217;s favor (cf. <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3&#8211;12</a>).<p>- &#8220;Cares for&#8221; is more than a passing handout.

We mirror the King when we lift the needy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD will deliver him in the day of trouble</b><p>&#8220;The LORD will deliver him in the day of trouble&#8221;.<p>- God ties a promise to the prior command: compassionate living invites divine rescue when hardship hits.<p>- Scripture repeats this theme:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;The righteous cry out, and the LORD delivers them from all their troubles&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;If you pour yourself out for the hungry&#8230; the LORD will satisfy your desire&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/58-10.htm">Isaiah 58:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>- Deliverance may come as protection, provision, or strength to endure (<a href="/psalms/91-15.htm">Psalm 91:15</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a>). Whichever form it takes, God&#8217;s intervention is certain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/41-1.htm">Psalm 41:1</a> links compassion and deliverance. David signals that public worship should proclaim this truth: God smiles on those who look after the vulnerable, and He pledges real help when their own crises arise.
