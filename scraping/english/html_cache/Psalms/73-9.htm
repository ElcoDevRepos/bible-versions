In biblical context, "heavens" often symbolizes God's dwelling place and authority (<a href="/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>). The imagery of setting one's mouth against the heavens suggests blasphemy or speaking against divine authority. Historically, this reflects the attitude of the wicked who challenge God's sovereignty, similar to the Tower of Babel narrative (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>), where humanity sought to reach the heavens through their own efforts. This defiance is a recurring theme in Scripture, where the prideful are often depicted as opposing God (<a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13-14</a>).<p><b>and their tongues strut across the earth</b><br>The imagery of tongues strutting suggests boastfulness and pride. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, speech was a powerful tool, and the tongue is often associated with influence and authority (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>). This phrase highlights the pervasive influence of the wicked, whose words impact the earth, spreading their defiance and corruption. The strutting tongue can be seen as a metaphor for the spread of ungodly ideas and practices, reminiscent of the serpent's deceit in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. This also contrasts with the humble and truthful speech encouraged in the New Testament (<a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-6</a>), where believers are called to use their words to edify and glorify God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, Asaph was a prominent Levite singer and seer in David's court.

Their blasphemy mirrors Goliath&#8217;s taunts in <a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>, making themselves opponents of the Almighty.<p>- It shows deliberate rebellion; <a href="/psalms/12-4.htm">Psalm 12:4</a> captures their attitude: &#8220;With our tongues we will prevail; our lips are our own&#8212;who can be lord over us?&#8221;<p>- The setting of their mouths &#8220;against&#8221; heaven reveals a hostile posture, like shaking a fist at the sky, recalling <a href="/isaiah/37-23.htm">Isaiah 37:23</a>, &#8220;Whom have you insulted and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride?

Like the builders of Babel in <a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>, they want a name that reaches everywhere.<p>- Their speech becomes a tool of oppression; <a href="/proverbs/17-7.htm">Proverbs 17:7</a> warns that &#8220;arrogant lips&#8221; are unfitting, yet these people flaunt them.<p>- The verse exposes the scope of their arrogance: vertical (against heaven) and horizontal (across earth). <a href="/jude/1-15.htm">Jude 1:15-16</a> describes such people as &#8220;ungodly sinners who have spoken against Him&#8230; grumblers, malcontents&#8230; loud-mouthed boasters.&#8221;<p>- The imagery reinforces that wicked speech is never private; it roams the earth, infecting communities (<a href="/2_timothy/2-16.htm">2 Timothy 2:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/73-9.htm">Psalm 73:9</a> pictures the wicked unleashing boastful, blasphemous words upward toward God and outward toward humanity. Their speech is both a direct assault on the Creator and a proud parade before the created.
