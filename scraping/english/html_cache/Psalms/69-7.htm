In the biblical context, enduring scorn for God's sake is a recurring theme, seen in the lives of prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/20-8.htm">Jeremiah 20:8-9</a>) and Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>). The psalmist's suffering can be seen as a type of Christ, who endured mockery and scorn during His earthly ministry (<a href="/matthew/27-29.htm">Matthew 27:29-31</a>). This phrase also connects to the New Testament encouragement for believers to rejoice in suffering for Christ's sake (<a href="/1_peter/4-14.htm">1 Peter 4:14</a>).<p><b>and shame has covered my face</b><br>The imagery of shame covering one's face indicates deep humiliation and disgrace. In ancient Near Eastern culture, honor and shame were significant social values, and public disgrace was a severe affliction. This phrase can be linked to the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, who was "despised and rejected by men." It also foreshadows the humiliation of Jesus Christ, who bore the shame of the cross (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>). The psalmist's experience resonates with the call for believers to bear reproach for the sake of Christ (<a href="/hebrews/13-13.htm">Hebrews 13:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, David is expressing his deep distress and suffering, which he endures for the sake of his devotion to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure for whom David is enduring scorn and shame.

Hostility comes because allegiance to God collides with a world set against Him.<p>&#8226; This perspective transforms suffering into fellowship: we share in Christ&#8217;s reproach (<a href="/hebrews/13-13.htm">Hebrews 13:13</a>) and therefore share in His future glory (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and shame has covered my face</b><p>The final phrase reveals the emotional weight: public humiliation that feels like a cloak draped over one&#8217;s whole being.<p>&#8226; Isaiah foresaw Messiah saying, &#8220;I offered My back to those who struck Me&#8230; I did not hide My face from shame and spitting&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>).<p>&#8226; At Calvary that prophecy became visible reality (<a href="/matthew/27-29.htm">Matthew 27:29&#8211;30</a>). Jesus&#8217; face, once transfigured in glory, was covered with spit, blood, and mockery&#8212;fulfilling David&#8217;s words completely.<p>&#8226; For believers, Peter assures that &#8220;whoever believes in Him will never be put to shame&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6</a>). The shame we may feel now is temporary; honor in Christ is eternal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/69-7.htm">Psalm 69:7</a> paints a vivid picture of faithful suffering: enduring ridicule, doing so for God&#8217;s honor, and feeling the crushing weight of public shame. David&#8217;s experience anticipates the greater Son of David, Jesus, who bore scorn and disgrace for our salvation. When we face contempt for following Him, we stand in a long, honored line of God&#8217;s servants, knowing that present shame will one day give way to everlasting glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/69.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Because.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">for.</span><p><span class= "bld">For thy sake.</span>--It is plain from <a href="/psalms/69-9.htm" title="For the zeal of your house has eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached you are fallen on me.">Psalm 69:9</a> that these words can only mean that the reproach under which the psalmist (or the community of which he was the spokesman) laboured was borne in the cause of religion.
