Cymbals were part of the musical instruments used in the temple, as seen in <a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a>, where David appointed the Levites to play loud instruments, including cymbals, to accompany the Ark of the Covenant. The clashing cymbals signify a loud, joyful noise, emphasizing the exuberance and intensity of worship. This reflects the broader biblical theme of worshiping God with all one's might and resources, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a>, where David danced before the Lord with all his might. The clashing cymbals symbolize the call for all creation to join in the praise of God, echoing the universal call to worship found throughout the Psalms.<p><b>praise Him with resounding cymbals.</b><br>The repetition of cymbals, described here as "resounding," underscores the importance of using music to express the glory and majesty of God. Resounding cymbals produce a sustained, echoing sound, which can be seen as a metaphor for the enduring and far-reaching impact of true worship. This phrase highlights the idea that worship should not only be loud and joyful but also profound and lasting. The use of cymbals in this context can be connected to the worship practices in the temple, where music played a crucial role in the liturgical life of Israel. The resounding cymbals can also be seen as a type of the proclamation of the Gospel, which reverberates throughout the world, calling all nations to worship the one true God, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/42-10.htm">Isaiah 42:10-12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/150.htm">Psalm 150</a>, traditionally attributed to King David, who is known for his musical talents and deep devotion to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_worship.htm">Temple Worship</a></b><br>The setting for the use of musical instruments in worship, particularly in the Temple in Jerusalem, where music played a significant role in the liturgical practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/musicians_and_levites.htm">Musicians and Levites</a></b><br>The individuals responsible for playing instruments and leading worship in the Temple, often from the tribe of Levi.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_music_in_worship.htm">The Role of Music in Worship</a></b><br>Music is a powerful tool for expressing praise and adoration to God.
