In the biblical context, this can be seen as a reflection of the constant threats faced by King David from his enemies, both external and internal. The "lofty perch" symbolizes a place of authority or divine favor, which David often occupied as God's anointed king. This imagery can also be connected to the broader biblical theme of the righteous being targeted by the wicked, as seen in other Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/37-12.htm">Psalm 37:12-15</a>). The phrase may also foreshadow the ultimate rejection and crucifixion of Jesus Christ, who was cast down by those who opposed Him despite His divine authority.<p><b>they delight in lies;</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the deceitful nature of David's adversaries. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, truthfulness was a valued trait, and lying was seen as a serious moral failing. The delight in lies indicates a deep-seated corruption and a willingness to use falsehoods to achieve one's ends. This behavior is condemned throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>, where lying is listed among the things the Lord hates. The delight in lies can also be seen as a type of the false accusations and deceit faced by Jesus during His ministry and trial.<p><b>with their mouths they bless, but inwardly they curse.</b><br>This phrase describes the hypocrisy of David's enemies, who outwardly appear to offer blessings while secretly harboring ill intentions. This duplicity is a common theme in the Psalms, where the righteous often lament the deceitful nature of their foes (e.g., <a href="/psalms/55-21.htm">Psalm 55:21</a>). In the broader biblical narrative, this behavior is reminiscent of the Pharisees and religious leaders during Jesus' time, who outwardly appeared righteous but were inwardly corrupt (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>). The contrast between outward speech and inward intent underscores the biblical principle that God judges the heart, not just external actions (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><b>Selah</b><br>The term "Selah" is often used in the Psalms as a pause for reflection or emphasis. While its exact meaning is uncertain, it serves as an invitation for the reader or listener to contemplate the preceding words deeply. In this context, "Selah" encourages reflection on the nature of deceit and the challenges faced by the righteous, prompting a meditation on God's justice and faithfulness in the face of human treachery.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/62.htm">Psalm 62</a>, David is expressing his trust in God amidst adversaries.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/adversaries.htm">Adversaries</a></b><br>The unnamed individuals or groups who seek to bring down the psalmist, representing those who oppose the righteous.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/selah.htm">Selah</a></b><br>A term used in the Psalms, possibly indicating a pause for reflection or musical interlude.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_deception.htm">The Danger of Deception</a></b><br>Recognize the harm that deceitful words can cause, both to the speaker and the listener.<br><br>Be vigilant against those who may appear supportive but harbor ill intentions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_the_heart.htm">Guarding the Heart</a></b><br>Ensure that your words align with your heart's intentions, striving for integrity and sincerity.<br><br>Reflect on your motivations and seek to purify your heart through prayer and scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god_amidst_opposition.htm">Trust in God Amidst Opposition</a></b><br>Like David, place your trust in God when faced with adversaries who seek to harm you.<br><br>Remember that God is aware of the true intentions of the heart and will uphold the righteous.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_words.htm">The Power of Words</a></b><br>Understand the impact of your words and use them to bless genuinely, not to manipulate or deceive.<br><br>Encourage others to speak truthfully and with love, reflecting the character of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_62_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 62:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_62_4_Wicked_s_deceitful_nature.htm">How does Psalm 62:4 illustrate the deceitful nature of the wicked?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_resist_habitual_liars.htm">What strategies can we use to resist those who "delight in lies"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_62_4_Jesus_Truth_vs_Deception.htm">How does Psalm 62:4 connect with Jesus' teachings on truth and deception?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_flattery_and_deceit.htm">In what ways can we guard against flattery and deceit in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_62_4_Trust_God_amid_false_claims.htm">How can Psalm 62:4 encourage us to trust God amidst false accusations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_62_4_Insights_on_deceit.htm">How does Psalm 62:4 challenge our understanding of human deceit and falsehoods?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Psalm_62_4.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 62:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_62_4_Trust_in_God_vs_opposition.htm">How does Psalm 62:4 reflect the theme of trust in God despite opposition?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_62.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 62?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/will_you_follow_my_instructions.htm">What is the meaning of 'I shall not be moved'?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_does_suffering_exist_if_god_is_loving.htm">How can suffering exist with a loving, omnipotent God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_do_psalm_62_9_and_genesis_1_27_align.htm">Psalm 62:9 suggests all people are 'nothing' in comparison to God--how does this align with other passages like Genesis 1:27 that emphasize human value?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_is_atman_in_hinduism.htm">What do owls symbolize in the Bible?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 62:4 Mean</div><b>They fully intend to cast him down from his lofty perch</b><p>David pictures enemies bent on removing a man&#8212;likely himself&#8212;from a place of honor God has granted.<p>&#8226;
