In the ancient Near Eastern context, idols were often crafted with human-like features to symbolize their supposed powers. However, the psalmist emphasizes their inability to perform even basic functions. This critique of idolatry is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, where the prophet mocks the futility of worshiping man-made objects. The hands of idols, though crafted to appear powerful, are lifeless and incapable of action, unlike the hands of God, which are described as mighty and capable of delivering His people (<a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>).<p><b>they have feet, but cannot walk;</b><br>The imagery of feet that cannot walk further underscores the lifelessness of idols. In biblical times, the ability to walk symbolized life and agency. The God of Israel is often depicted as one who walks with His people, guiding and leading them (<a href="/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>). In contrast, idols are stationary and powerless, unable to accompany or assist their worshipers. This serves as a reminder of the futility of relying on anything other than the living God, who is described as a shepherd leading His flock (<a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1-3</a>).<p><b>they cannot even clear their throats.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the complete inability of idols to communicate or respond. In the cultural context of the psalm, the voice was a symbol of authority and presence. The God of Israel is a speaking God, who communicates with His people through His word and prophets (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>). The inability of idols to clear their throats or speak highlights their impotence and the absurdity of attributing divine power to them. This is contrasted with the voice of God, which is powerful and creative, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God speaks the world into existence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/115.htm">Psalm 115</a>, traditionally attributed to David or another psalmist, who contrasts the living God with lifeless idols.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>The focus of this verse, representing man-made objects of worship that are powerless and lifeless.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the psalm is addressed, often tempted by idolatry and called to trust in the living God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pagan_nations.htm">Pagan Nations</a></b><br>Surrounding cultures that worshipped idols, influencing Israel and providing a backdrop for the psalmist's message.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_worship.htm">Temple Worship</a></b><br>The context in which this psalm would have been used, emphasizing the worship of the one true God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_idolatry.htm">The Futility of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idols are powerless and cannot interact with the world.

Only the God who &#8220;stretches out His hand&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>) truly acts on behalf of His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They Have Feet, but Cannot Walk</b><p>- The verse continues: &#8220;they have feet, but cannot walk.&#8221;<p>- Mobility speaks of presence&#8212;being able to go with, lead, or rescue. Idols cannot move toward anyone in compassion or judgment.<p>- Consider <a href="/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3-4</a>, where Dagon falls before the Ark of the Covenant; the idol is literally immobile while the living God actively displays His supremacy.<p>- The Lord, by contrast, &#8220;walks in the midst&#8221; of His people (<a href="/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>) and &#8220;goes before&#8221; them (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-8.htm">Deuteronomy 31:8</a>).<p>- Practical takeaway: Depending on anything other than the Lord&#8212;whether material wealth, status, or human wisdom&#8212;is to lean on what has feet yet remains stuck.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They Cannot Even Clear Their Throats</b><p>- <a href="/psalms/115-7.htm">Psalm 115:7</a> finishes: &#8220;they cannot even clear their throats.&#8221;<p>- Speech signifies life, relationship, and authority. The idols cannot utter a sound, not even a cough.<p>- <a href="/jeremiah/10-5.htm">Jeremiah 10:5</a> reinforces this: &#8220;Like scarecrows in a cucumber patch, they cannot speak.&#8221;<p>- By contrast, our God speaks creation into existence (<a href="/bsb/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>), sustains all things &#8220;by the word of His power&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>), and answers when His children call (<a href="/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4</a>).<p>- The inability of idols to speak underscores their worthlessness and magnifies the glory of the Lord who &#8220;inclines His ear&#8221; to us (<a href="/psalms/116-2.htm">Psalm 116:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/115-7.htm">Psalm 115:7</a> exposes the impotence of idols through vivid imagery: lifeless hands, paralyzed feet, and mute throats.
