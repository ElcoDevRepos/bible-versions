The shepherd-flock relationship is a recurring theme in Scripture, illustrating God's leadership and provision for His people. This imagery is seen in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where the Lord is described as a shepherd who provides for all needs. The shepherd metaphor also foreshadows Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the "Good Shepherd" in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, highlighting His role in leading and sacrificing for His people.<p><b>by the hand of Moses and Aaron</b><br>Moses and Aaron were chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt and through the wilderness to the Promised Land. This phrase underscores the importance of divinely appointed leadership and the role of human agents in God's plan. Moses, as a prophet and lawgiver, and Aaron, as the first high priest, were instrumental in guiding the Israelites, performing miracles, and establishing the covenantal relationship between God and His people. Their leadership is a type of Christ, who fulfills the roles of prophet, priest, and king. The mention of Moses and Aaron also connects to the broader narrative of the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history that symbolizes deliverance and redemption, themes central to the Christian faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage.
