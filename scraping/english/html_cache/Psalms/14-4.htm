In biblical context, "workers of iniquity" refers to individuals who actively engage in sinful behavior, often in defiance of God's laws. The rhetorical question implies a sense of frustration and disbelief at their continued rebellion. This theme is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>, which speaks of fools who hate knowledge. The phrase suggests a moral and spiritual dullness, highlighting the need for divine intervention to open their eyes to truth.<p><b>They devour my people like bread;</b><br>This imagery of devouring suggests a predatory and consuming nature of the wicked towards the righteous. In ancient Near Eastern culture, bread was a staple food, symbolizing sustenance and daily life. The comparison indicates that the oppression and exploitation of God's people are as routine and thoughtless to the wicked as eating bread. This reflects the historical context of Israel's enemies who often sought to destroy or subjugate them, as seen in the repeated invasions and captivities. The phrase also foreshadows the persecution of believers, a theme that continues into the New Testament, where Jesus warns of persecution in <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a>.<p><b>they refuse to call upon the LORD.</b><br>This refusal signifies a deliberate rejection of God and His authority. In the biblical narrative, calling upon the LORD is an act of worship, dependence, and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty. The refusal to do so indicates a hardened heart and a willful choice to live independently of God's guidance and provision. This is reminiscent of the Israelites' repeated cycles of rebellion and repentance throughout the Old Testament, as seen in the Book of Judges. The phrase underscores the spiritual pride and self-sufficiency that leads to downfall, contrasting with the humility and faithfulness that God desires, as exemplified by figures like King David and ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who perfectly called upon and obeyed the Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/workers_of_iniquity.htm">Workers of Iniquity</a></b><br>This term refers to those who commit evil acts and live in opposition to God's will.

Yet the verse also reassures the faithful: God sees the oppression, calls the hurting His own, and sets a clear moral dividing line.

Some, however, prefer to divide the two clauses, "Ah, they shall see--all the workers of iniquity who eat my people--they eat bread (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>live) regardless of Jehovah." This makes a better parallelism. A comparison with <a href="/context/micah/3-3.htm" title="Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.">Micah 3:3-4</a>, suggests that this verse of the psalm was a proverbial saying.
