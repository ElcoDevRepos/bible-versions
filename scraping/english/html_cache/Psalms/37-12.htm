The term "wicked" refers to those who live in opposition to God's laws and principles. In biblical history, figures like Cain, who plotted against Abel, exemplify this behavior. The scheming of the wicked is often characterized by deceit and malice, as seen in the actions of figures like Haman in the Book of Esther. This conflict is not only physical but spiritual, reflecting the broader battle between good and evil. The righteous, those who follow God's ways, are often targets of such schemes, as their lives stand in contrast to the wicked. This tension is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus warns His followers of persecution for righteousness' sake (<a href="/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10-12</a>).<p><b>and gnash their teeth at them</b><br>Gnashing of teeth is a biblical expression of intense anger or frustration. In the cultural context of the Bible, it signifies a deep-seated animosity and a desire to harm. This imagery is used in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/acts/7-54.htm">Acts 7:54</a>, where the crowd gnashes their teeth at Stephen before stoning him. It conveys the idea of the wicked being consumed by their hatred for the righteous. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and separation of the wicked from the righteous, as described in <a href="/matthew/13-41.htm">Matthew 13:41-42</a>, where gnashing of teeth is associated with the fate of those who reject God. The righteous, however, are called to respond with patience and trust in God's justice, as seen in the life of Jesus, who, despite being reviled, did not retaliate but entrusted Himself to God (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Refers to those who live in opposition to God's ways, often characterized by their sinful actions and intentions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>Those who strive to live according to God's commandments and seek to follow His will.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/37.htm">Psalm 37</a>, providing wisdom and guidance through his experiences.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_israel.htm">Ancient Israel</a></b><br>The cultural and historical context in which this Psalm was written, reflecting the struggles between those who follow God and those who do not.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment.htm">God's Judgment</a></b><br>An underlying theme in the Psalm, where God ultimately judges the wicked and vindicates the righteous.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_conflict.htm">Understanding the Conflict</a></b><br>Recognize that the tension between the wicked and the righteous is a recurring theme in Scripture, reflecting the spiritual battle between good and evil.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_justice.htm">Trust in God's Justice</a></b><br>Despite the schemes of the wicked, believers are called to trust in God's ultimate justice and timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_persecution.htm">Responding to Persecution</a></b><br>Christians are encouraged to respond to persecution with faith and patience, knowing that God sees and will act.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_righteously.htm">Living Righteously</a></b><br>The call to live righteously remains, even in the face of opposition, as a testimony to God's transformative power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_god's_promises.htm">Hope in God's Promises</a></b><br>Hold onto the promises of God for deliverance and vindication, which provide hope and strength in difficult times.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_37_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 37:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Response_to_wicked_schemes_in_Psalm_37_12.htm">How can we respond when "the wicked scheme against the righteous" in Psalm 37:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_37_12_Wickedness_vs_Righteousness.htm">What does Psalm 37:12 reveal about the nature of wickedness and righteousness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_37_12_Jesus_Love_enemies_link.htm">How does Psalm 37:12 connect with Jesus' teachings on loving our enemies?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_vs_foes_in_Psalm_37.htm">In what ways can we trust God when facing adversaries, as seen in Psalm 37?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_37_12_Praying_for_opponents.htm">How can Psalm 37:12 guide our prayers for those who oppose us?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_37_12_on_the_wicked_s_nature.htm">What does Psalm 37:12 reveal about the nature of the wicked?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_37_12_s_role_in_divine_justice.htm">How does Psalm 37:12 fit into the overall theme of divine justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Psalm_37_12.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 37:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_37.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 37?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'gnashing_of_teeth'_mean.htm">What does "gnashing of teeth" mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/does_numbers_5_show_god_ordering_abortion.htm">Why worry about those who do wrong?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_evil_people.htm">What is the Bible's view on evil people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_use_evil_for_judgment,_god.htm">If God is &#8220;too pure to look on evil&#8221; (Habakkuk 1:13), why does He use a ruthless nation as His instrument of judgment?
