The term "daughter" can be understood as addressing the bride in the psalm, symbolizing the church or the people of God. In biblical times, daughters were often seen as representatives of their families, and this call to listen signifies a shift in allegiance and identity.<p><b>Consider and incline your ear:</b><br>The call to "consider" and "incline your ear" suggests a deliberate and thoughtful response. It implies a need for discernment and understanding, urging the listener to be receptive to divine wisdom. This echoes <a href="/proverbs/2-2.htm">Proverbs 2:2</a>, where inclining the ear to wisdom is encouraged, highlighting the importance of being attentive to God's guidance.<p><b>Forget your people and your father&#8217;s house,</b><br>This directive to "forget" one's people and father's house signifies a transition from old allegiances to a new commitment. In the context of a royal wedding, it reflects the bride's need to leave her family and fully embrace her new life with the king. Spiritually, it can be seen as a call to forsake former ways and fully commit to a relationship with God, reminiscent of Abraham's call to leave his country and family in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>. This also prefigures the call of Christ to His followers to prioritize their relationship with Him above all else, as seen in <a href="/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_daughter.htm">The Daughter</a></b><br>Symbolically represents the bride, often interpreted as the Church or the people of God, called to a new identity and relationship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Implied in the context of the Psalm, representing Christ as the bridegroom to whom the daughter is being united.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/father's_house.htm">Father&#8217;s House</a></b><br>Represents the old life, past allegiances, and former ways that the daughter is called to leave behind.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_royal_wedding.htm">The Royal Wedding</a></b><br>The broader context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/45.htm">Psalm 45</a> is a royal wedding, symbolizing the union between Christ and His Church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of the Psalm, traditionally attributed to the sons of Korah, who provides a prophetic and poetic vision of this union.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_new_allegiance.htm">Call to New Allegiance</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to prioritize our relationship with Christ above all earthly ties and past identities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_listening_and_obedience.htm">Spiritual Listening and Obedience</a></b><br>The verse emphasizes the importance of listening and inclining our hearts to God's call, requiring active engagement and response.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_and_renewal.htm">Transformation and Renewal</a></b><br>Leaving behind the "father&#8217;s house" symbolizes a transformation into a new creation in Christ, shedding old ways and embracing a new life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_christ.htm">Identity in Christ</a></b><br>Our primary identity is found in our relationship with Christ, which redefines our purpose and direction.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_christ.htm">Commitment to Christ</a></b><br>Just as a bride commits to her husband, we are called to a deep, committed relationship with Christ, marked by love and devotion.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_45_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 45:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_45_10_God_over_ties_things.htm">How does Psalm 45:10 encourage prioritizing God over earthly relationships and possessions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_forget_your_people_in_Ps_45_10.htm">What does "forget your people and your father's house" signify in Psalm 45:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Psalm_45_10_to_Matthew_6_33.htm">How can Psalm 45:10 be connected to Matthew 6:33 about seeking God's kingdom?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_Psalm_45_10_guide_decisions.htm">In what ways can Psalm 45:10 guide us in our daily decision-making?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_45_10_s_role_in_modern_faith.htm">How does Psalm 45:10 inspire commitment to Christ in modern Christian life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_45_10_s_ancient_Israelite_context.htm">What is the historical context of Psalm 45:10 in ancient Israelite culture?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_45_10_Women_s_role_in_Bible.htm">How does Psalm 45:10 reflect the role of women in biblical times?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_45_10_s_marriage_significance.htm">What theological significance does Psalm 45:10 hold in the context of marriage?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_45.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 45?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/does_hebrews_10_5-7_alter_psalm_40.htm">Hebrews 10:5-7 quotes Psalm 40 differently than the Hebrew text ('a body you prepared' vs. 'my ears you have opened');

(<a href="/psalms/45-10.htm">Psalm 45:10</a>)<p>&#8226; The psalmist addresses the bride, calling her &#8220;daughter,&#8221; a term of affection that establishes intimacy and identity.<p>&#8226; In its immediate setting the bride is a royal princess marrying the king of Israel; prophetically it portrays Christ taking His Church as bride (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The imperative &#8220;listen&#8221; underscores that a word from the King demands undivided attention, just as Israel was told, &#8220;Hear, O Israel&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, listening means receiving the Word as absolute truth, because &#8220;faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ&#8221;

Like Mary who &#8220;treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-19.htm">Luke 2:19</a>), the bride is to weigh every word.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Incline your ear&#8221; calls for active submission&#8212;bowing the head toward the Speaker. <a href="/proverbs/4-20.htm">Proverbs 4:20-22</a> echoes, &#8220;My son, pay attention to my words&#8230;for they are life to those who find them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/55-2.htm">Isaiah 55:2-3</a> links listening with covenant blessing: &#8220;Listen carefully to Me&#8230;Incline your ear and come to Me; listen, that your soul may live.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s instructions carry promise and protection; obedience secures the favor described in the following verses (<a href="/psalms/45-11.htm">Psalm 45:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Forget your people and your father&#8217;s house</b><p>&#8220;Forget your people and your father&#8217;s house&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/45-10.htm">Psalm 45:10</a>)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Forget&#8221; here means a decisive break with former loyalties. <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a> sets the pattern: a man &#8220;leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife.&#8221; Likewise the bride&#8217;s primary allegiance now belongs to the king.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, coming to Christ requires renouncing past identities and securities. Jesus said, &#8220;Anyone who comes to Me and does not hate father and mother&#8230;cannot be My disciple&#8221; (<a href="/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul modeled this abandonment: &#8220;Forgetting what is behind and reaching forward to what is ahead&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; This call is not a rejection of family affection but a reordering of priorities. The bride&#8217;s wholehearted devotion will elicit the king&#8217;s desire&#8212;&#8220;the king will desire your beauty&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/45-11.htm">Psalm 45:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/45-10.htm">Psalm 45:10</a> summons the royal bride&#8212;and ultimately every believer&#8212;to listen attentively, ponder deeply, and sever competing allegiances so that undivided love and loyalty are given to the King.
