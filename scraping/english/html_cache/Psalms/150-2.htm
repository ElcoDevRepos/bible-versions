The "mighty acts" refer to God's interventions and miracles, such as the creation of the world (Genesis 1), the deliverance of Israel from Egypt (Exodus 14), and the numerous victories in battles (Joshua 6). These acts demonstrate God's sovereignty and power over nature and nations. In the New Testament, the ultimate mighty act is the resurrection of Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/28-6.htm">Matthew 28:6</a>), which signifies victory over sin and death. This phrase encourages reflection on God's past faithfulness and His ongoing work in the world.<p><b>praise Him for His excellent greatness.</b><br>This part emphasizes the inherent and incomparable greatness of God. "Excellent greatness" suggests a quality that surpasses all human understanding and comparison. It points to God's attributes such as omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence. Scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a> highlight God's everlasting nature and unsearchable understanding. The phrase also connects to the worship scenes in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>), where God's greatness is celebrated eternally. This calls believers to recognize and honor God's supreme nature, which is evident in His creation, providence, and redemptive work through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/150.htm">Psalm 150</a>, traditionally attributed to King David, who is calling the congregation to worship and praise God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure of the Psalm, whose mighty acts and excellent greatness are the focus of praise.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_worship.htm">Temple Worship</a></b><br>While not explicitly mentioned in this verse, the context of the Psalms often relates to worship practices in the Temple in Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_mighty_acts.htm">Understanding God's Mighty Acts</a></b><br>Reflect on the historical and personal acts of God in your life and in the Bible.

His &#8220;mighty acts&#8221; are His unmistakable interventions in history&#8212;moments when His power breaks in and leaves no doubt about who is in control.<p>&#8226; Think of the deliverance at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-29.htm">Exodus 14:29&#8211;31</a>); Israel praised, saying, &#8220;The LORD is my strength and my song&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Recall the sun standing still for Joshua (<a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12&#8211;14</a>); Scripture plainly states, &#8220;There has been no day like it before or since.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Consider the rescue of Daniel from the lions (<a href="/daniel/6-21.htm">Daniel 6:21&#8211;23</a>) or Peter from prison (<a href="/acts/12-6.htm">Acts 12:6&#8211;11</a>). In every era, God&#8217;s acts announce His sovereignty.<p>&#8226; Even creation itself is counted among His mighty deeds: &#8220;By the word of the LORD the heavens were made&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>).<p>When we praise Him for these acts, we acknowledge that the same God who parted seas and raised the dead (<a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43&#8211;44</a>) is present and active today (<a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>). Our worship becomes a testimony: &#8220;Come and see what God has done, how awesome His works on behalf of mankind&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/66-5.htm">Psalm 66:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Praise Him for His excellent greatness</b><p>The second line shifts from what God does to who God is. His &#8220;excellent greatness&#8221; speaks of His character&#8212;perfect, infinite, and unrivaled.<p>&#8226; Holiness: &#8220;Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Hosts&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Love: &#8220;God is love&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/4-8.htm">1 John 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Faithfulness: &#8220;Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/36-5.htm">Psalm 36:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Wisdom: &#8220;Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!&#8221; (<a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>).<p>Unlike human greatness, which fades, God&#8217;s greatness is &#8220;from everlasting to everlasting&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>). Because His nature never changes (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>), our reasons to praise never run out. Praising Him for His essence elevates our focus beyond temporary blessings to the eternal reality of who He is.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/150-2.htm">Psalm 150:2</a> invites us to a well-rounded worship life: celebrate God&#8217;s mighty acts&#8212;His tangible, historical interventions&#8212;and celebrate His excellent greatness&#8212;His unchanging, perfect character.
