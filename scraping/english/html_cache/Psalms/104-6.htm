The "deep" signifies the primordial waters, a common motif in ancient Near Eastern creation myths, symbolizing chaos before divine order. The imagery of a garment suggests God's sovereign control and intentional design, as garments are crafted and fitted. This covering can also be seen as a type of baptism, symbolizing cleansing and renewal, prefiguring the waters of baptism in the New Testament.<p><b>the waters stood above the mountains.</b><br>This part of the verse evokes the imagery of the Flood narrative in <a href="/genesis/7-19.htm">Genesis 7:19-20</a>, where the waters rose and covered the highest mountains. It underscores God's power over creation, as even the mighty mountains are submerged under His command. Theologically, it reflects God's judgment and mercy, as the Flood was both a means of purging wickedness and preserving righteousness through Noah. The waters standing above the mountains can also be seen as a type of Christ's burial and resurrection, where the old is submerged and the new emerges, pointing to the transformative power of God's salvation plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_deep.htm">The Deep</a></b><br>Refers to the primordial waters, often associated with chaos in ancient Near Eastern cosmology.

But here it is beyond its right, and the Divine rebuke forces it to retire within narrower limits. It is noticeable that the idea of a chaos finds no place in the poetic conception of the world's genesis. The primitive world is not formless, but has its mountains and valleys already existing, though merged beneath the sea.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/104.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou coveredst it with the deep, as with a garment</span> (see <a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>).
