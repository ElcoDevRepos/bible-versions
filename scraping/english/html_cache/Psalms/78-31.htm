Throughout the Old Testament, God's anger is often depicted as a reaction to idolatry, rebellion, and covenant unfaithfulness (e.g., <a href="/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>, <a href="/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11:1</a>). The anger of God is not arbitrary but is a just response to sin, reflecting His holiness and righteousness. In the context of <a href="/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>, this anger is a result of Israel's repeated testing of God despite His continuous provision and miracles, such as the parting of the Red Sea and the provision of manna.<p><b>and He put to death their strongest</b><br>This phrase suggests a specific judgment upon the most capable or prominent members of the community, possibly referring to warriors or leaders. In the historical context of Israel, strength was often associated with military prowess and leadership (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/2-4.htm">1 Samuel 2:4</a>). The death of the strongest serves as a severe warning and a demonstration of God's power and authority over life and death. It echoes other instances in Scripture where God directly intervenes to remove those who lead or embody rebellion (e.g., <a href="/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31-35</a> with Korah's rebellion).<p><b>and subdued the young men of Israel</b><br>The subduing of the young men indicates a broader impact on the community, affecting the future generation and their potential. Young men in Israelite society were often seen as the hope for the future, responsible for carrying on the legacy and traditions of the people. This subduing could imply a loss of vitality, morale, or even a reduction in numbers due to divine judgment. It reflects the consequences of collective disobedience and serves as a reminder of the importance of faithfulness to God. This theme is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as in the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> about the consequences of turning away from God.<div

flared against them</b><p>The verse opens with a vivid picture of the LORD&#8217;s righteous displeasure. After abundant grace&#8212;manna each morning and quail each evening&#8212;the people still craved more and doubted His care (<a href="/psalms/78-17.htm">Psalm 78:17-20</a>). Scripture never portrays God&#8217;s anger as a sudden outburst; it is a measured, moral response to persistent rebellion (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>). <a href="/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33</a> records the companion event: &#8220;While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of the LORD burned against the people, and the LORD struck the people with a severe plague.&#8221; <a href="/psalms/106-40.htm">Psalm 106:40</a> adds, &#8220;The LORD&#8217;s anger burned against His people, and He abhorred His own inheritance.&#8221; His wrath is not opposed to His love; it defends His holiness and protects His covenant purposes (<a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He put to death their strongest</b><p>The text moves from attitude to action. &#8220;Their strongest&#8221; points to the fittest warriors, the very ones Israel might have trusted for security. Yet physical vigor could not shield them from divine judgment. Paul looks back on this episode: &#8220;God was not pleased with most of them; their bodies were scattered in the wilderness&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-5.htm">1 Corinthians 10:5</a>). The plague was literal, swift, and selective, underscoring that sin&#8217;s wages are death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). <a href="/numbers/14-37.htm">Numbers 14:37</a> speaks of those who spread a bad report: &#8220;These men who had spoken badly about the land were struck down by a plague before the LORD.&#8221; By taking the strongest, God demonstrated that no human strength can stand against His holiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and subdued the young men of Israel</b><p>After the initial deaths, the surviving young men were &#8220;subdued,&#8221; a term that carries the idea of being bowed down or restrained. <a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a> describes a similar consequence: &#8220;He sold them into the hands of their enemies around them, so that they could no longer stand against their foes.&#8221; <a href="/psalms/107-12.htm">Psalm 107:12</a> echoes the theme: &#8220;He bowed their hearts with hard labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help.&#8221; The vigor of youth became impotence under the disciplining hand of God. The lesson is unmistakable: continued rebellion leads to loss of strength, purpose, and freedom, even for those in the prime of life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/78-31.htm">Psalm 78:31</a> recounts a historical moment when God&#8217;s righteous anger erupted against persistent unbelief. He struck down the strongest and humbled the rest to teach Israel&#8212;and every generation&#8212;that no amount of human power can outmatch His holiness. The verse stands as a sober reminder: the God who graciously provides is also the God who justly disciplines, calling His people to wholehearted trust and obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/78.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">Slew the fattest.</span>--This may mean either the <span class= "ital">strongest </span>or the <span class= "ital">noblest.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/78.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them (</span>comp. <a href="/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33</a>, "While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague").
