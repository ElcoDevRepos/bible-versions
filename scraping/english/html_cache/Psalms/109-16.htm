In the cultural context of ancient Israel, kindness (Hebrew: "chesed") was a covenantal loyalty expected among God's people. The absence of kindness here contrasts with God's character, who is often described as merciful and gracious (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>). This lack of kindness is a hallmark of the wicked, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21-10.htm">Proverbs 21:10</a>, where the wicked have no compassion.<p><b>but pursued the poor and needy</b><br>The pursuit of the poor and needy indicates a deliberate and aggressive action against those who are vulnerable. In biblical law, the poor and needy were to be protected and provided for (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>). This pursuit is a direct violation of God's commands and reflects a societal injustice that prophets like Amos and Isaiah frequently condemned. The poor and needy are often seen as under God's special care, and their oppression is a serious offense (<a href="/psalms/72-4.htm">Psalm 72:4</a>).<p><b>and brokenhearted</b><br>The brokenhearted are those who are crushed in spirit, often due to oppression or personal loss. In the Psalms, God is depicted as close to the brokenhearted (<a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>), offering comfort and healing. The mention of the brokenhearted here underscores the depth of the wicked's cruelty, as they target those who are already suffering. This phrase also foreshadows the ministry of Jesus, who proclaimed His mission to bind up the brokenhearted (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>).<p><b>even to their death</b><br>The ultimate consequence of this relentless pursuit is death, highlighting the severity of the wicked's actions. In biblical terms, death is not only a physical end but can also signify spiritual separation from God. This phrase echoes the fate of the wicked as described in <a href="/proverbs/11-19.htm">Proverbs 11:19</a>, where pursuing evil leads to death. It also serves as a stark contrast to the life-giving nature of God's kingdom, where the righteous find refuge and life (<a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/109.htm">Psalm 109</a>, David is expressing a deep lament and plea for justice against his adversaries.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked_man.htm">The Wicked Man</a></b><br>The subject of David's imprecation, characterized by his lack of kindness and pursuit of the vulnerable.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor_and_needy.htm">The Poor and Needy</a></b><br>Represents those who are marginalized and oppressed, whom the wicked man targets.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_brokenhearted.htm">The Brokenhearted</a></b><br>Individuals who are emotionally or spiritually crushed, further victimized by the wicked.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and deliverer whom David appeals to for justice and vindication.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_kindness.htm">The Call to Kindness</a></b><br>As followers of Christ, we are called to show kindness and mercy, especially to the poor and needy.
