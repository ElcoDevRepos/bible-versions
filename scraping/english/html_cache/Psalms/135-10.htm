The historical context includes the conquest of Canaan, where God led the Israelites to victory over various peoples. This action demonstrates God's fulfillment of His promises to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). Theologically, it underscores God's role as a divine warrior, a motif seen in <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>, where God is described as a "man of war." This also prefigures the ultimate victory of Christ over the spiritual forces of evil, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>.<p><b>and slaughtered mighty kings:</b><br>The mention of "mighty kings" highlights the formidable opponents Israel faced, such as Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan (<a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-35</a>). These kings were known for their strength and the size of their armies, yet they were defeated by God's intervention. This serves as a reminder of God's ability to overcome any earthly power, no matter how great. Theologically, it points to the ultimate kingship of Jesus Christ, who is described as the "King of kings and Lord of lords" (<a href="/1_timothy/6-15.htm">1 Timothy 6:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>). Historically, these victories were crucial for Israel's establishment in the Promised Land, fulfilling God's covenant promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the various groups and peoples that opposed Israel throughout its history.
