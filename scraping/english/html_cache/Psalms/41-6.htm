In the cultural context of ancient Israel, hospitality was a sacred duty, and a visitor was expected to be truthful and respectful. The act of speaking falsehood would have been a grave violation of trust. This can be connected to the betrayal of Jesus by Judas Iscariot, who, despite being a close companion, ultimately deceived Him (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>). The theme of betrayal by a close associate is a recurring motif in the Bible, emphasizing the pain of treachery from those who are expected to be allies.<p><b>he gathers slander in his heart;</b><br>The imagery of gathering slander in one's heart suggests a premeditated and malicious intent. In biblical terms, the heart is often seen as the center of thought and intention (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>). This phrase indicates that the visitor is not only deceitful in speech but also harbors ill will internally. The act of gathering slander implies a deliberate collection of false information or accusations, which is condemned in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). This behavior contrasts with the biblical call to love one's neighbor and to speak truthfully (<a href="/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25</a>).<p><b>he goes out and spreads it abroad.</b><br>The act of spreading slander abroad signifies the transition from internal malice to external action. This reflects the destructive power of words and the impact of gossip and false accusations within a community. In the historical context, such actions could lead to social discord and damage reputations, which were highly valued in ancient societies. This behavior is warned against in <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>, where sowing discord among brethren is listed as one of the things the Lord hates. The spreading of falsehoods can also be seen as a type of the false accusations Jesus faced from the Pharisees and other religious leaders, ultimately leading to His crucifixion (<a href="/mark/14-55.htm">Mark 14:55-59</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/41.htm">Psalm 41</a>, David is expressing his experience of betrayal and deceit by those who visit him under false pretenses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/v/visitors.htm">Visitors</a></b><br>These are individuals who come to David, pretending to be concerned, but their true intention is to gather information to slander him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/heart.htm">Heart</a></b><br>In Hebrew thought, the heart ("lev") is the center of thought, emotion, and intention.
