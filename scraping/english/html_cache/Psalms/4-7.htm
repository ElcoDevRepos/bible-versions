In biblical context, joy is often associated with God's presence and blessings (<a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>). The heart, in Hebrew thought, represents the center of emotions and will, indicating a deep, internalized joy. This joy surpasses any earthly pleasure, reflecting the peace and contentment found in a relationship with God (<a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>).<p><b>than when grain and new wine abound.</b><br>Grain and new wine symbolize prosperity and abundance in ancient Israelite culture. These were staples of sustenance and celebration, often associated with God's provision and blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-13.htm">Deuteronomy 7:13</a>). The mention of grain and wine also connects to the covenant blessings promised to Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>). However, the psalmist contrasts these temporal blessings with the superior joy found in God, suggesting that spiritual fulfillment transcends material wealth. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who offers living water and the bread of life, fulfilling spiritual needs beyond physical sustenance (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>, <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/4.htm">Psalm 4</a>, David is expressing his trust and joy in God despite external circumstances.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of Israel, often experiencing agricultural cycles, would understand the significance of grain and new wine as symbols of prosperity and blessing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/harvest_time.htm">Harvest Time</a></b><br>A period of joy and celebration in ancient Israel, representing God's provision and abundance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/true_joy_comes_from_god.htm">True Joy Comes from God</a></b><br>The joy that God provides surpasses any material wealth or abundance.

David is not crediting circumstances, positive thinking, or self-effort, but the covenant God who hears and answers prayer (<a href="/psalms/4-1.htm">Psalm 4:1</a>; cf. <a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>).<p>- Scripture consistently presents God as the direct source of every good gift (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>) and the defender of His people (<a href="/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>).<p>- The intimacy of addressing God as &#8220;You&#8221; echoes the shepherd-sheep relationship Jesus affirms: &#8220;I know My sheep and My sheep know Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Have Filled</b><p>- The verb is perfect and emphatic&#8212;God has already completed the action. David&#8217;s cup is not merely sprinkled; it is filled to the brim (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>).<p>- Paul celebrates the same reality: believers &#8220;may be filled with all the fullness of God&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/3-19.htm">Ephesians 3:19</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s filling always satisfies; &#8220;You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/145-16.htm">Psalm 145:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My Heart</b><p>- Joy that only reaches the lips fades; joy planted in the heart endures. &#8220;Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>).<p>- God promised a new heart to His people (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>), a promise fulfilled through the indwelling Spirit who &#8220;pours out His love into our hearts&#8221; (<a href="/romans/5-5.htm">Romans 5:5</a>).<p>- David&#8217;s inner life, not merely his external life, is the focus. Scripture&#8217;s priority is always transformation from the inside out (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With More Joy</b><p>- Joy is a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>) and the intended atmosphere of Christian life: &#8220;I have told you these things so that My joy may be in you and your joy may be complete&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-11.htm">John 15:11</a>).<p>- It is deeper than emotion and stronger than circumstance, echoing Nehemiah&#8217;s declaration, &#8220;The joy of the LORD is your strength&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/8-10.htm">Nehemiah 8:10</a>).<p>- Because it is God-given, this joy is secure: &#8220;No one will take your joy from you&#8221; (<a href="/john/16-22.htm">John 16:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Than When Grain and New Wine Abound</b><p>- Grain and new wine represent the height of material plenty in an agrarian society (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>; <a href="/joel/2-24.htm">Joel 2:24</a>).<p>- David asserts that spiritual joy eclipses even bumper crops and overflowing vats. Habakkuk offers the same conclusion: &#8220;Though the fig tree does not bud&#8230; yet I will rejoice in the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/3-17.htm">Habakkuk 3:17-18</a>).<p>- Jesus warns, &#8220;Life does not consist in the abundance of possessions&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15</a>), and Paul instructs the wealthy to set their hope &#8220;on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>).<p>- Material blessings are good gifts, yet they are temporal.

David affirms that genuine, lasting satisfaction is rooted not in prosperity but in personal fellowship with God, whose presence produces an overflowing, incomparable gladness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Thou hast.</span>--Either "Thou hast put a gladness in my heart more than when their corn and new wine are much," or, "More than when one has much corn," &c. The expression is one of pregnant brevity for, "A gladness greater than that when corn and wine are plentiful."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast put gladness in my heart</span>. David is an example to the de-spending ones. Notwithstanding his sufferings and calamities, God has looked on him, and so "put gladness in his heart" - a gladness which far exceeds that of his adversaries. Though they are in prosperity, and have their corn and wine increased, and enjoy all the "outward material blessings promised to Israel - the wheat and the grape - for a supply of which he is indebted to the generosity of friends" (Kay), yet he would not change places with them. The spiritual joy which fills his own heart is preferable to any amount of material comforts and pleasures. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/4-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You have filled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1443;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7791;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my heart</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;lib&#183;b&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
