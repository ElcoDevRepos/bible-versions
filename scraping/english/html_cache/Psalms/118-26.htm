In the context of ancient Israel, to come "in the name of the LORD" signifies acting as a representative of God, carrying His authority and message. This verse is often associated with the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, as recorded in the Gospels (<a href="/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>, <a href="/mark/11-9.htm">Mark 11:9</a>, <a href="/luke/19-38.htm">Luke 19:38</a>, <a href="/john/12-13.htm">John 12:13</a>), where the crowds welcomed Him with similar words, recognizing Him as the Messiah. The phrase also echoes the priestly blessing found in <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>, where invoking the name of the LORD brings divine favor and protection. Theologically, it underscores the importance of divine endorsement and the fulfillment of messianic prophecy, as Jesus is seen as the ultimate fulfillment of this blessing.<p><b>From the house of the LORD we bless you.</b><br>This part of the verse indicates a communal blessing originating from the temple, the central place of worship in Jerusalem. The "house of the LORD" refers to the temple, which was the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. In ancient Israel, blessings pronounced from the temple carried significant weight, as the temple was the heart of religious life and the center of God's covenant with Israel. This phrase suggests a corporate act of worship and blessing, emphasizing the role of the community in acknowledging and supporting those who come in God's name. It also reflects the unity of the people in their worship and recognition of God's chosen representatives. In the New Testament context, the church, as the body of Christ, becomes the spiritual house from which blessings are pronounced, continuing the tradition of communal worship and support for God's work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to King David, the psalmist is the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/118.htm">Psalm 118</a>, expressing gratitude and praise to God for His enduring love and deliverance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, central to the worship and identity of Israel, representing His eternal presence and faithfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_lord.htm">The House of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's dwelling among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_coming_one.htm">The Coming One</a></b><br>Prophetically, this refers to the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who is recognized as the one who comes in the name of the LORD.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The original audience of the psalm, who would have sung this as part of their worship, especially during festivals.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognition_of_the_messiah.htm">Recognition of the Messiah</a></b><br>Understand that <a href="/psalms/118-26.htm">Psalm 118:26</a> is a prophetic acknowledgment of Jesus as the Messiah.
