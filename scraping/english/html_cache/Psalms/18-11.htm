In biblical context, darkness often symbolizes the unknown or the divine presence that is beyond human comprehension. In <a href="/exodus/20-21.htm">Exodus 20:21</a>, Moses approaches the thick darkness where God was, indicating that God's presence is often shrouded in mystery. This imagery can also be seen in <a href="/1_kings/8-12.htm">1 Kings 8:12</a>, where Solomon acknowledges that God has said He would dwell in thick darkness. Theologically, this can be understood as God&#8217;s way of concealing His full glory, which is too overwhelming for humans to behold directly. It also reflects the idea that God is sovereign and operates beyond human understanding.<p><b>and storm clouds a canopy around Him</b><br>Storm clouds as a canopy emphasize God's majesty and power. In ancient Near Eastern culture, storm imagery was often associated with divine power and authority. This is evident in the depiction of deities like Baal, who was considered a storm god. However, the Bible reclaims this imagery to demonstrate Yahweh's supremacy over creation. In <a href="/job/38.htm">Job 38:1</a>, God speaks to Job out of the whirlwind, showcasing His control over the natural elements. The canopy of storm clouds also signifies protection and the impenetrable nature of God's presence. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/psalms/97-2.htm">Psalm 97:2</a>, where clouds and thick darkness surround Him, righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne. The storm clouds can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, in His first coming, veiled His divine nature in human form, and in His second coming, will return with power and great glory, as described in <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David is expressing his gratitude and awe for God's deliverance and protection.
