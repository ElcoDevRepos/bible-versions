The mention of "tens of thousands" and "thousands of thousands" suggests an innumerable and overwhelming force, highlighting God's supreme authority and might. This imagery is reminiscent of the heavenly hosts described in <a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>, where Elisha's servant's eyes are opened to see the mountain full of horses and chariots of fire. It also connects to <a href="/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11</a>, where John describes the voice of many angels numbering "myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands," indicating the vastness of God's heavenly army. The use of chariots can also be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory and return, as depicted in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>, where Christ is portrayed as a conquering king.<p><b>the Lord is in His sanctuary</b><br>This phrase signifies God's presence among His people, specifically in the sanctuary, which in the Old Testament context refers to the tabernacle or temple. The sanctuary was the designated holy place where God's presence dwelled, and where the Israelites came to worship and offer sacrifices. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God promises to dwell among them (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>). The sanctuary also serves as a type of Christ, who is the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>) and through whom believers have access to God's presence (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>). The concept of God being in His sanctuary underscores His holiness and the reverence due to Him.<p><b>as He was at Sinai.</b><br>This phrase recalls the theophany at Mount Sinai, where God revealed Himself to the Israelites after their exodus from Egypt. At Sinai, God gave the Law to Moses, establishing the covenant with Israel (Exodus 19-20). The reference to Sinai evokes the awe and fear associated with God's presence, as the mountain was covered with smoke, and there were thunder and lightning (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a>). It serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the foundational moment of Israel's identity as God's chosen people. The Sinai event also prefigures the new covenant established through Christ, who fulfills the Law and the prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>) and mediates a better covenant (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>). The mention of Sinai in this context reinforces the continuity of God's redemptive plan from the Old Testament to the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, depicted as a mighty warrior with an innumerable host of chariots.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/chariots_of_god.htm">Chariots of God</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's power and majesty, representing His divine presence and might.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_sanctuary.htm">The Lord's Sanctuary</a></b><br>Refers to the holy dwelling place of God, emphasizing His presence among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sinai.htm">Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where God gave the Law to Moses, symbolizing God's covenant and revelation to Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The people of God, who experienced His presence and power at Sinai and continue to be under His protection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omnipotence.htm">God's Omnipotence</a></b><br>Recognize the vastness of God's power and His ability to protect and guide His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_presence.htm">Divine Presence</a></b><br>Understand that God's presence is not limited to a physical location but is with His people wherever they are.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_faithfulness.htm">Covenant Faithfulness</a></b><br>Reflect on God's faithfulness to His covenant promises, as demonstrated at Sinai and throughout Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Be aware of the spiritual realities and the unseen forces that God commands for the protection and aid of His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/worship_and_reverence.htm">Worship and Reverence</a></b><br>Approach God with reverence, acknowledging His holiness and the majesty of His heavenly host.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_68_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 68:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_68_17_God_s_power_and_presence.htm">How does Psalm 68:17 highlight God's power and presence in our lives?

Picture the scene: a limitless heavenly cavalry surrounding the Almighty. Scripture often pulls back the curtain to reveal this reality. &#8226; Elisha&#8217;s servant saw &#8220;horses and chariots of fire all around&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>), reminding us that God&#8217;s armies are already in place even when we do not see them. &#8226; <a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a> assures us &#8220;the angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11</a> speaks of &#8220;myriads of myriads&#8221; of angels encircling the throne. The point? God&#8217;s resources are never limited. When He moves for His people, He moves with overwhelming strength.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Thousands of thousands are they</b><p>The verse doubles down: &#8220;&#8212;thousands of thousands are they.&#8221; The psalmist heaps number upon number to say, &#8220;You can&#8217;t count them.&#8221; <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a> echoes this language: &#8220;a river of fire was flowing&#8230; thousands upon thousands attended Him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him.&#8221; <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a> describes believers coming &#8220;to innumerable angels in joyful assembly.&#8221; &#8226; This staggering scale encourages us: God never runs out of help. &#8226; It also humbles us: the Lord of hosts commands forces beyond human comprehension. &#8226; Most importantly, it magnifies His glory&#8212;He is worthy of trust because nothing can oppose Him successfully.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Lord is in His sanctuary</b><p>Next, the psalm shifts from army to address: &#8220;the LORD is in His sanctuary.&#8221; In David&#8217;s day that pointed to the tabernacle on Zion; for us it points both to heaven&#8217;s temple (<a href="/revelation/11-19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>) and to Christ&#8217;s finished work that grants us direct access (<a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>). Consider: &#8226; <a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>&#8212;God desired to &#8220;dwell among&#8221; His people. &#8226; <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>&#8212;His glory filled Solomon&#8217;s temple. &#8226; <a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13-14</a>&#8212;Zion was chosen as His resting place forever. This line reminds us that the God of angelic multitudes is also near, gladly residing with His covenant family. Majesty does not cancel intimacy; it guarantees it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As He was at Sinai</b><p>The verse closes, &#8220;as He was at Sinai.&#8221; Sinai was where God thundered, the mountain trembled, and Israel saw holiness vividly displayed (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a>). <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a> recalls Him coming &#8220;from Sinai&#8230; with myriads of holy ones.&#8221; By linking Zion&#8217;s worship to Sinai&#8217;s awe, <a href="/bsb/psalms/68.htm">Psalm 68</a> declares: &#8226; The same God who shook the mountain still reigns. &#8226; His covenant faithfulness has not changed from wilderness to promised land. &#8226; The presence that once terrified now secures and stabilizes us in worship (<a href="/hebrews/12-18.htm">Hebrews 12:18-24</a> contrasts Sinai&#8217;s fear with the joyful assembly in Christ). In other words, the God of yesterday&#8217;s wonders is active in today&#8217;s sanctuary life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a> paints a sweeping panorama: innumerable angelic chariots, God enthroned among His people, the memory of Sinai&#8217;s splendor&#8212;all converging to assure us that the Lord who once shook a mountain now stands guard over His saints with limitless power. Trust Him; His armies are vast, His presence is real, and His faithfulness is unchanged.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/68.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">The chariots.</span>--As the text stands, this verse can only be brought into harmony with the context by a certain violence to grammar. Its literal reading is, <span class= "ital">God's chariots, two myriads of thousands, and again myriads of thousands </span>(literally, <span class= "ital">of repetition</span>)<span class= "ital">, the Lord among them, Sinai in holiness; </span>which, by strict rule, must mean: "God's chariots are innumerable, and the Lord rides in them to Sinai, into the holy place." But this rendering is quite against the whole tenor of the passage, which is descriptive of a march <span class= "ital">from</span>, not <span class= "ital">to, </span>Sinai. Hence some suggest the rendering, "The Lord is among them--a Sinai in holiness," meaning that Zion has become <span class= "ital">Sinai, </span>a common enough figure in poetry (comp. <span class= "ital">In medio Tibure Sardinia est</span>--Mart. 4:60), but only discovered here by a roundabout process. There can hardly be a question as to the propriety of the emendation suggested by Dr. Perowne, <span class= "ital">The Lord is with them; He has come from Sinai into the holy place. </span>(Comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-2.htm" title="My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain on the tender herb, and as the showers on the grass:">Deuteronomy 32:2</a>, which was undoubtedly in the poet's mind.)<p><span class= "bld">Of</span> <span class= "bld">angels.</span>--This rendering arose from a confusion of the word which means <span class= "ital">repetition </span>with a word which means <span class= "ital">shining. </span>LXX., "of flourishing ones"; Vulg., "of rejoicing ones." But the mistake is a happy one, and Milton's sonorous lines have well caught the feeling and music of the Hebrew:--<p>"About His chariots numberless were poured<p>Cherub and seraph, potentates and thrones,<p>And virtues, winged spirits and chariots winged,<p>From the armoury of God, where stand of old<p>Myriads." <span class= "ital">Paradise Lost, </span>vii. 196.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/68.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels.</span> Another abrupt transition. The psalmist sees God move from Sinai, where he had represented him as present in ver. 8, into the sanctuary of Mount Zion. He is, of course, accompanied by his angelic host. This is described as a host of chariots (comp. <a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>) -twenty thousand in number, and "thousands of repetition" - or thousands multiplied by thousands, as Hengstenberg understands the phrase (comp. <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord</span> (Jehovah) <span class="cmt_word">is among them;</span> or, "in their midst." <span class="cmt_word">As in Sinai, in the holy place;</span> rather, <span class="accented">Sinai is in the sanctuary</span>.
