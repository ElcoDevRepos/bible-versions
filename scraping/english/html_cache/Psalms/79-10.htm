Historically, Israel's defeats and suffering often led other nations to doubt the sovereignty of Yahweh. This echoes the taunts found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/42-3.htm">Psalm 42:3</a> and <a href="/2_kings/18-35.htm">2 Kings 18:35</a>, where foreign powers challenge the efficacy of Israel's God. Theologically, this question underscores the tension between God's promises to Israel and their current suffering, prompting a plea for divine intervention to uphold His name and reputation among the nations.<p><b>Before our eyes,</b><br>The psalmist's plea for God to act "before our eyes" indicates a desire for a visible and undeniable demonstration of God's power and justice. This reflects a longing for immediate and tangible evidence of God's intervention, similar to the miraculous acts witnessed by the Israelites during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/14-31.htm">Exodus 14:31</a>). It emphasizes the need for reassurance of God's presence and action in the midst of adversity.<p><b>make known among the nations Your vengeance</b><br>The call for God to "make known" His vengeance is a request for divine justice to be evident to all. This reflects the biblical theme of God as a righteous judge who avenges the wrongs done to His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>). The concept of divine vengeance is not merely about retribution but also about restoring justice and demonstrating God's holiness and sovereignty to the world. It aligns with prophecies in Isaiah and Jeremiah where God's judgment on nations serves as a testament to His power.<p><b>for the bloodshed of Your servants.</b><br>The reference to "the bloodshed of Your servants" highlights the persecution and martyrdom of God's faithful followers. Historically, this could refer to the suffering of the Israelites at the hands of foreign oppressors, such as during the Babylonian exile. It also foreshadows the New Testament theme of the persecution of Christians, as seen in <a href="/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9-10</a>, where the martyrs cry out for justice. This phrase underscores the biblical principle that God is attentive to the suffering of His people and will ultimately vindicate them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the Gentile nations surrounding Israel, often seen as adversaries or oppressors of God's people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in the Psalm, whose presence and justice are called into question by the nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants.htm">Servants</a></b><br>The faithful followers of God, likely referring to the Israelites who have suffered or been martyred.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bloodshed.htm">Bloodshed</a></b><br>The violence and persecution experienced by God's people, prompting a plea for divine justice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/vengeance.htm">Vengeance</a></b><br>The divine retribution or justice that the Psalmist is asking God to display against the oppressors.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_is_certain.htm">God's Justice is Certain</a></b><br>The Psalmist's plea for vengeance reminds us that God's justice, though sometimes delayed, is inevitable.

Earlier laments echo this cry (<a href="/psalms/115-2.htm">Psalm 115:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/42-3.htm">Psalm 42:3</a>), yet each time the complaint reflects confidence that the Lord will soon vindicate His name. The question underscores God&#8217;s covenant commitment&#8212;He has joined His honor to His people, so any insult against them is an insult against Him (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Where is their God?&#8221;</b><p>Pagans taunt, presuming Israel&#8217;s recent suffering means the Lord has abandoned them. Such mockery was heard when Jerusalem fell (<a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15&#8211;16</a>) and when enemies surrounded Jesus on the cross (<a href="/matthew/27-43.htm">Matthew 27:43</a>). Scripture takes these jeers seriously; God will not allow His reputation to be permanently besmirched (<a href="/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20&#8211;23</a>). The psalm therefore calls on Him to act so the nations see that He truly lives and reigns (<a href="/1_samuel/17-46.htm">1 Samuel 17:46</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Before our eyes</b><p>The writer asks the Lord to act &#8220;before our eyes,&#8221; longing for a tangible, present-tense display. This parallels Moses&#8217; plea, &#8220;Show me Your glory&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/33-18.htm">Exodus 33:18</a>), and Habakkuk&#8217;s request, &#8220;In our time revive Your work&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/3-2.htm">Habakkuk 3:2</a>). The faithful desire not abstract justice but visible intervention that strengthens faith and removes reproach (<a href="/psalms/71-11.htm">Psalm 71:11-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Make known among the nations Your vengeance</b><p>Vengeance belongs to the Lord alone (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>; <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>). Here the psalmist calls for that rightful, covenant-based retribution to be public, instructive, and unmistakable. Such divine acts:<p>&#8226; Defend God&#8217;s holiness (<a href="/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>)<p>&#8226; Protect His people (<a href="/psalms/94-1.htm">Psalm 94:1-2</a>)<p>&#8226; Warn the watching world (<a href="/revelation/15-4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a>)<p>This is not personal vindictiveness but a plea for God to uphold His moral order.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the bloodshed of Your servants</b><p>The immediate cause is spilled blood&#8212;faithful servants murdered for their loyalty (<a href="/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9-11</a>). Scripture treats the blood of the innocent as a cry that reaches heaven (<a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>). God promises to avenge every drop (<a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:6-7</a>). The psalmist therefore anchors his petition in divine justice: because God is righteous, He must answer the violence done to His people (<a href="/psalms/116-15.htm">Psalm 116:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/79-10.htm">Psalm 79:10</a> moves from anguished question to confident appeal. The nations scornfully ask, &#8220;Where is their God?&#8221; but faith responds by urging the Lord to act, openly and decisively, to vindicate His name and repay the bloodshed of His servants. The verse invites believers to trust that God sees every injustice, treasures every faithful life, and will, in His perfect timing, demonstrate His righteous vengeance before a watching world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/79.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Wherefore.</span>--Taken from <a href="/joel/2-17.htm" title="Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare your people, O LORD, and give not your heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: why should they say among the people, Where is their God?">Joel 2:17</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Let him be known.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Let it be known, i.e., </span>where God is.
