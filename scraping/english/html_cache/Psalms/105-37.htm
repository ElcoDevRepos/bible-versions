The silver and gold were given to the Israelites by the Egyptians, as described in <a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>, where the Israelites asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold, and the Lord made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward them. This act fulfilled God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-14.htm">Genesis 15:14</a> that his descendants would come out of bondage with great possessions. The wealth given to the Israelites can be seen as a form of recompense for their years of slavery. It also prefigures the spiritual riches believers receive in Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>.<p><b>and none among His tribes stumbled</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine protection and strength given to the Israelites during their journey. Despite the harsh conditions of the wilderness, God ensured that none of the tribes faltered or were weakened. This can be connected to <a href="/deuteronomy/8-4.htm">Deuteronomy 8:4</a>, where it is noted that their clothes did not wear out, nor did their feet swell during the forty years in the desert. It signifies God's sustaining power and faithfulness. Spiritually, it can be seen as a type of Christ's sustaining grace for believers, as He promises to uphold and strengthen His followers, ensuring they do not stumble in their spiritual journey, as seen in <a href="/jude/1-24.htm">Jude 1:24</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure who delivers the Israelites from Egypt, demonstrating His power and faithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were enslaved in Egypt and were brought out with wealth and health.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place of bondage for the Israelites, from which God delivered them.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/exodus.htm">Exodus</a></b><br>The event of the Israelites' departure from Egypt, marked by God's miraculous interventions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_abundance.htm">God's Provision and Abundance</a></b><br>God not only delivers but also provides abundantly for His people, as seen in the wealth given to the Israelites.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_protection_and_health.htm">Divine Protection and Health</a></b><br>The fact that "none among His tribes stumbled" signifies God's protection and the health He granted them, a reminder of His care for our physical and spiritual well-being.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_promises.htm">Faithfulness to Promises</a></b><br>God's actions in the Exodus demonstrate His faithfulness to His promises, encouraging us to trust in His word and timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_deliverance.htm">Spiritual Deliverance</a></b><br>The physical deliverance of the Israelites is a foreshadowing of the spiritual deliverance we receive through Christ, who frees us from the bondage of sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_and_remembrance.htm">Gratitude and Remembrance</a></b><br>Reflecting on God's past faithfulness should lead us to gratitude and a deeper trust in His future provision and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_105_37_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 105:37?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_105_37_God_s_provision_proof.htm">How does Psalm 105:37 demonstrate God's provision for His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_He_brought_them_out_show.htm">What does "He brought them out" reveal about God's deliverance in Exodus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_for_provision_now.htm">How can we trust God for provision in our current circumstances?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_105_37_and_NT_God_s_faithfulness.htm">How does Psalm 105:37 connect to God's faithfulness in the New Testament?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_honor_God_s_provision_daily.htm">In what ways can we celebrate God's provision in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_105_37_and_God_s_Exodus_provision.htm">How does Psalm 105:37 relate to God's provision for the Israelites during the Exodus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Psalm_105_37_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in Psalm 105:37?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_105_37_God_s_promise_kept.htm">How does Psalm 105:37 demonstrate God's faithfulness to His promises?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_105.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 105?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_no_egyptian_records_of_exodus.htm">Psalm 105:37 describes the Israelites leaving Egypt with silver and gold, yet Egyptian records of a mass exodus are scarce.
