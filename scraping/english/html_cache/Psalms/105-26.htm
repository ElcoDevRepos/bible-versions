His role as a servant underscores his obedience and dedication to God's commands. The term "servant" is often used in the Bible to denote someone who is faithful and obedient to God's will, highlighting Moses' humility and submission. Moses' life is marked by significant events such as the burning bush encounter (Exodus 3), the plagues of Egypt, and the parting of the Red Sea. His leadership is a type of Christ, as both are deliverers of God's people. Moses' mission was divinely appointed, emphasizing God's sovereignty in choosing and sending leaders for His purposes.<p><b>and Aaron, whom He had chosen</b><br>Aaron, the brother of Moses, was chosen by God to be the first high priest of Israel. His role was crucial in establishing the priesthood and the sacrificial system, which pointed to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Aaron's selection highlights the importance of divine election and the establishment of a mediatory role between God and His people. The priesthood of Aaron is a foreshadowing of Christ's eternal priesthood, as described in the book of Hebrews. Aaron's involvement in the Exodus narrative, including his role in speaking to Pharaoh and performing miracles, demonstrates the collaborative leadership God established through Moses and Aaron. This partnership illustrates the necessity of unity and cooperation in fulfilling God's plans.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage.
