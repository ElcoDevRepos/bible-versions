In biblical context, mockery is often associated with those who reject God's wisdom and authority (<a href="/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>). The Psalms frequently contrast the righteous, who speak truth and wisdom, with the wicked, whose words are harmful and deceitful (<a href="/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2-4</a>). The use of "malice" indicates a deep-seated intent to harm others, reflecting a heart that is far from God (<a href="/matthew/15-19.htm">Matthew 15:19</a>). This behavior is reminiscent of the enemies of Israel who often taunted and ridiculed God's people (<a href="/nehemiah/4.htm">Nehemiah 4:1-3</a>).<p><b>with arrogance they threaten oppression.</b><br>Arrogance in the Bible is often linked to pride, which is considered a grave sin because it elevates oneself above others and, ultimately, above God (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). The wicked's arrogance leads them to believe they are untouchable and can oppress others without consequence. This reflects a common theme in Scripture where the powerful exploit the weak, a situation God consistently condemns (<a href="/isaiah/10.htm">Isaiah 10:1-2</a>). The threat of oppression is not just physical but can also be social and economic, as seen in the practices of unjust rulers and corrupt leaders throughout Israel's history (<a href="/amos/8-4.htm">Amos 8:4-6</a>). This behavior is antithetical to the character of Christ, who embodies humility and justice (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, Asaph was a prominent Levite singer and seer in David's court.
