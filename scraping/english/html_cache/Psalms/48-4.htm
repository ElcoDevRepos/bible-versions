In the context of ancient Israel, such assemblies often occurred during times of war or when forming alliances. The historical backdrop could be linked to various instances in the Old Testament where surrounding nations conspired against Israel, such as in <a href="/2_chronicles/20.htm">2 Chronicles 20</a>, where multiple nations came against Jehoshaphat. The assembly of kings can also symbolize the collective opposition of worldly powers against God's chosen people, reflecting the spiritual battles faced by believers.<p><b>they all advanced together.</b><br>The unity in their advance suggests a coordinated effort, emphasizing the seriousness of the threat. This could be seen as a foreshadowing of the end times, where nations will unite against God's kingdom, as described in <a href="/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19</a>. The phrase also highlights the futility of human efforts against divine protection, as seen in the subsequent verses of the psalm where God intervenes. This can be typologically connected to Jesus Christ, who, despite opposition from earthly powers, triumphed through His resurrection, ensuring victory for His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings.htm">Kings</a></b><br>The verse mentions "kings" who assembled together.

Their forward surge collapses under the weight of God&#8217;s presence, much like the Assyrians woke to find 185,000 dead (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35-36</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast is deliberate: human advance versus divine defense.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>together</b><p>&#8220;together&#8221; stresses unity.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/17-13.htm">Revelation 17:13</a> speaks of ten kings who &#8220;have one purpose&#8221; but ultimately perish at the Lamb&#8217;s appearing.
