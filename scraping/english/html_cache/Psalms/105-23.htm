This event is detailed in <a href="/genesis/46.htm">Genesis 46</a>, where God reassures Jacob in a vision not to fear going down to Egypt, promising to make him a great nation there. The term "Israel" here refers to Jacob, whose name was changed to Israel after wrestling with God (<a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>). This migration was prompted by a severe famine in Canaan, and Joseph, Jacob's son, who had risen to power in Egypt, provided a refuge for his family. This move set the stage for the Israelites' eventual enslavement and subsequent Exodus, a foundational narrative for the Jewish people and a foreshadowing of redemption themes in Christian theology.<p><b>Jacob dwelt in the land of Ham.</b><br>The "land of Ham" is a poetic reference to Egypt, as Ham is traditionally considered one of the sons of Noah, whose descendants are believed to have settled in Africa, including Egypt (<a href="/genesis/10-6.htm">Genesis 10:6</a>). This phrase emphasizes the sojourn of Jacob and his family in a foreign land, highlighting themes of exile and divine providence. The dwelling of Jacob in Egypt signifies a period of growth and multiplication for the Israelites, as they became a numerous people, fulfilling part of God's promise to Abraham. This period also prefigures the later bondage and deliverance of the Israelites, drawing parallels to the Christian understanding of spiritual bondage and salvation through Christ. The use of "Ham" connects to the broader biblical narrative of nations and God's sovereignty over all peoples and lands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the descendants of Jacob, also known as the Israelites.
