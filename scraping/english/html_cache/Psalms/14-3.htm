In biblical context, "turning away" signifies a deliberate departure from God's ways, echoing the rebellion seen in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a> with Adam and Eve. The Hebrew term used here implies a willful deviation from the path of righteousness. This concept is reinforced in <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>, which states, "We all, like sheep, have gone astray." The idea of turning away is not just a physical act but a spiritual and moral one, indicating a heart that has rejected God's authority.<p><b>they have together become corrupt</b><br>The term "corrupt" suggests moral decay and is often associated with the imagery of something spoiled or ruined. This collective corruption points to the pervasive nature of sin affecting all of humanity, reminiscent of the days of Noah in <a href="/genesis/6-12.htm">Genesis 6:12</a>, where "all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth." The communal aspect ("together") underscores the shared guilt and fallen state of mankind, emphasizing that this is not an isolated issue but a universal condition.<p><b>there is no one who does good</b><br>This phrase underscores the total depravity of humanity, a key theological concept that suggests every aspect of human nature is tainted by sin. The assertion that no one does good aligns with <a href="/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-12</a>, where Paul reiterates this psalm to emphasize the need for divine grace. The biblical standard of "good" is rooted in God's perfect holiness, and this statement highlights the inability of humans to achieve righteousness on their own.<p><b>not even one</b><br>The emphatic repetition here serves to eliminate any exceptions, reinforcing the comprehensive nature of human sinfulness. This absolute statement is a sobering reminder of the need for a savior, pointing to the necessity of Jesus Christ's redemptive work. In the New Testament, Christ is presented as the only one who is truly good (<a href="/mark/10-18.htm">Mark 10:18</a>), fulfilling the law perfectly and offering His righteousness to those who believe. This phrase ultimately points to the hope found in the gospel, where through Christ, believers are made righteous before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14</a>, David was the second king of Israel and a man after God's own heart. He often wrote about the human condition and the need for God's intervention.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the Psalms were originally addressed. Israel's history is marked by cycles of faithfulness and rebellion, reflecting the themes of turning away from God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fool.htm">The Fool</a></b><br>Mentioned earlier in <a href="/bsb/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14</a>, the fool is a person who denies God and lives in moral corruption, setting the stage for the universal declaration of human sinfulness in verse 3.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/universal_sinfulness.htm">Universal Sinfulness</a></b><br>The verse highlights the universal nature of sin. Every person has turned away from God, emphasizing the need for divine grace and redemption.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/moral_corruption.htm">Moral Corruption</a></b><br>The Hebrew word for "corrupt" (shachath) implies moral decay and destruction. This corruption affects all aspects of human life and relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/n/need_for_a_savior.htm">Need for a Savior</a></b><br>Recognizing our inability to do good on our own points us to the necessity of a Savior, Jesus Christ, who redeems us from our sinful state.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/self-examination.htm">Self-Examination</a></b><br>Believers are called to examine their own lives for areas where they have turned away from God and seek His forgiveness and guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_accountability.htm">Community Accountability</a></b><br>The phrase "together become corrupt" suggests a collective responsibility.

By that measure, every human effort falls short (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase does not deny that people perform socially commendable acts; it declares that no deed, untouched by sin, meets God&#8217;s holy benchmark (<a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>).<p>&#8226; This prepares the ground for grace, revealing our need for a righteousness outside ourselves (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>not even one</b><p>The closing words slam shut any remaining loophole: &#8220;not even one.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The repetition underscores the point&#8212;no hidden exception, no secret saint (<a href="/1_kings/8-46.htm">1 Kings 8:46</a>).<p>&#8226; By eliminating the &#8220;one,&#8221; the psalm levels us all before God, so salvation must be entirely His initiative (<a href="/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44</a>).<p>&#8226; The absolute language magnifies the sufficiency of Christ, the only &#8220;Righteous One&#8221; who fulfills what no human could (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>, <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/14-3.htm">Psalm 14:3</a> paints a sobering, universal portrait: every person has turned from God, corruption is collective, genuine goodness (by God&#8217;s standard) is absent, and there are zero exceptions.
