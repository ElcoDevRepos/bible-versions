In biblical times, the concept of being "cast upon" God implies a total dependence and surrender, akin to a child being placed in the care of a parent. This reflects the cultural understanding of God as a nurturing and protective figure. The imagery here can be connected to the story of Samuel, who was dedicated to the Lord from a young age (<a href="/1_samuel/1-27.htm">1 Samuel 1:27-28</a>). It also foreshadows the life of Jesus Christ, who was dedicated to God from birth, as seen in the accounts of His presentation at the temple (<a href="/luke/2-22.htm">Luke 2:22-24</a>).<p><b>from my mother&#8217;s womb You have been my God.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the intimate relationship between the psalmist and God, established even before birth. It underscores the belief in God's sovereignty and involvement in the life of an individual from the earliest moments. This idea is echoed in <a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>, where God tells Jeremiah that He knew him before he was formed in the womb. The phrase also points to the divine nature of Jesus Christ, who, according to Christian belief, was recognized as the Son of God from conception (<a href="/luke/1-35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>). The cultural context of the time placed great importance on lineage and heritage, and this statement affirms a spiritual heritage that transcends physical birth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, David is expressing a deep, personal relationship with God that began from birth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is portrayed as a constant presence and protector from the very beginning of life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mother's_womb.htm">Mother's Womb</a></b><br>This phrase emphasizes the intimate and personal nature of God's relationship with the psalmist, highlighting God's sovereignty and care from the earliest moments of existence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_care.htm">God's Sovereignty and Care</a></b><br>Recognize that God's involvement in our lives begins even before birth.

David echoes the same testimony later: &#8220;From birth I have relied on You; You brought me from my mother&#8217;s womb&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/71-6.htm">Psalm 71:6</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/46-3.htm">Isaiah 46:3-4</a> extends the thought: God carries His people &#8220;from birth&#8221;

Jeremiah heard a similar assurance: &#8220;Before I formed you in the womb I knew you&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Even John the Baptist, still unborn, responded to Christ&#8217;s presence (<a href="/luke/1-41.htm">Luke 1:41-44</a>).<p>These passages underline the sacredness of life in the womb and God&#8217;s intimate craftsmanship long before anyone else sees us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have been my God</b><p>David moves from history to relationship, declaring the covenant name of the Lord as his own refuge.<p>&#8226;

It is exclusive: no other gods vie for David&#8217;s loyalty, fulfilling the First Commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; On the cross Jesus quotes <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> (<a href="/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>), showing that even in agony the Son entrusts Himself to the Father who has always been His God.<p>For every believer this becomes a present-tense confession: the One who authored our lives remains our God through every season.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/22-10.htm">Psalm 22:10</a> traces an unbroken line of divine involvement&#8212;placed in God&#8217;s hands at birth, crafted in His care before birth, and bound to Him by a personal covenant ever since.
