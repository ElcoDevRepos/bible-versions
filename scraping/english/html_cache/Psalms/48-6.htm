In the biblical context, Zion often represents the city of Jerusalem, a symbol of God's presence and protection. The imagery of trembling suggests a divine intervention that causes fear among those who oppose God's people. This can be connected to various instances in the Old Testament where God instills fear in the hearts of Israel's enemies, such as in <a href="/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14-16</a>, where the nations tremble at the power of God displayed during the Exodus. The "there" indicates a specific location, likely referring to the site of God's deliverance or judgment, emphasizing the tangible reality of God's protection over His people.<p><b>Anguish like a woman in labor</b><br>This simile draws on the universal and intense experience of childbirth to describe the depth of the enemies' distress. In ancient Near Eastern culture, labor pain was a common metaphor for extreme fear or distress, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a>. The use of this imagery highlights the inevitability and intensity of the anguish faced by those who oppose God. It also reflects the suddenness and inescapability of divine judgment. This phrase can be seen as a type of prophetic warning, illustrating the ultimate futility of resisting God's will. The comparison to labor pains also subtly points to the idea of new beginnings or transformations, as labor results in birth, suggesting that God's deliverance of His people may lead to a new era or phase in their history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion/jerusalem.htm">Zion/Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city of God, often symbolizing God's presence and protection.
