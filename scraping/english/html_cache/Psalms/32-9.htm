In biblical times, horses and mules were common animals used for labor and transportation, known for their strength but also for their stubborn nature. The comparison suggests that believers should not be obstinate or resistant to God's guidance. This imagery is consistent with other biblical references to animals, such as in <a href="/proverbs/26-3.htm">Proverbs 26:3</a>, where a whip is for the horse and a bridle for the donkey, emphasizing the need for control over willful creatures.<p><b>which have no understanding</b><br>The lack of understanding in animals is used metaphorically to describe a spiritual condition. In the Bible, understanding is often linked to wisdom and the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The absence of understanding implies a deficiency in spiritual insight and discernment. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that true wisdom comes from God and is characterized by a heart that seeks Him (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p><b>they must be controlled with bit and bridle</b><br>The bit and bridle are tools used to direct and control horses and mules. This imagery suggests that without internal guidance, external measures are necessary to direct one's path. In a spiritual context, it implies that those who lack understanding may require external discipline or correction to follow God's will. This can be related to <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>, where God disciplines those He loves, indicating that divine correction is a form of guidance for those who are not spiritually attuned.<p><b>to make them come to you</b><br>The purpose of the bit and bridle is to bring the animal to the owner or master. Spiritually, this reflects God's desire for His people to come to Him willingly, not out of compulsion. The call to come to God is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>, where Jesus invites the weary to come to Him for rest. This phrase underscores the importance of a willing heart that seeks God, contrasting with the stubbornness of the horse or mule.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/32.htm">Psalm 32</a>, King David, is reflecting on the importance of understanding and obedience to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/horses_and_mules.htm">Horses and Mules</a></b><br>These animals are used metaphorically to illustrate stubbornness and lack of understanding.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bit_and_bridle.htm">Bit and Bridle</a></b><br>Tools used to control horses and mules, symbolizing external control necessary for those who lack internal guidance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_and_obedience.htm">Understanding and Obedience</a></b><br>God desires His people to have understanding and willingly follow His guidance, rather than needing external control.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_stubbornness.htm">The Danger of Stubbornness</a></b><br>Like horses and mules, stubbornness can lead to a lack of spiritual growth and missed opportunities for God's blessings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_discipline.htm">The Role of Discipline</a></b><br>Discipline is necessary for those who resist understanding, but God prefers willing obedience from a heart of understanding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_maturity.htm">Spiritual Maturity</a></b><br>Spiritual maturity involves moving from external control to internal guidance by the Holy Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_on_personal_stubbornness.htm">Reflecting on Personal Stubbornness</a></b><br>Believers should examine areas of their lives where they may be resisting God's guidance and seek to cultivate a heart of understanding.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_32_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 32:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_not_be_like_the_horse_or_mule.htm">How can we avoid being like the "horse or mule" in Psalm 32:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_32_9_Why_understand_God_s_guidance.htm">What does Psalm 32:9 teach about the importance of understanding God's guidance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_32_9_Prov_3_5-6_Trust_God_link.htm">How does Psalm 32:9 connect with Proverbs 3:5-6 on trusting God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_nurture_a_spirit_for_God_s_will.htm">In what ways can we cultivate a willing spirit to follow God's will?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Psalm_32_9_guide_decisions.htm">How can Psalm 32:9 encourage us to seek God's wisdom in decision-making?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_not_like_horse_or_mule.htm">What does Psalm 32:9 mean by "do not be like the horse or mule"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_32_9_s_impact_on_free_will.htm">How does Psalm 32:9 challenge our understanding of free will and divine guidance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_prioritize_understanding_in_Psalm_32_9.htm">Why does Psalm 32:9 emphasize the need for understanding over mere obedience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_32.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 32?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_did_jesus_ride_a_donkey.htm">Why did Jesus enter Jerusalem on a donkey?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_is_god's_judgment_reconciled.htm">Psalm 98:9 promises judgment with equity, but other biblical passages show God permitting destruction and violence--how are these reconciled?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_ezekiel_38_4_with_modern_tech.htm">How do we reconcile the literal mention of horses and ancient weaponry in Ezekiel 38:4 with modern warfare technology?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_genesis_5_and_psalm_90_10.htm">How do we reconcile the extraordinarily long lifespans in Genesis 5 with the more typical human lifespan suggested in Psalm 90:10?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 32:9 Mean</div><b>Do not be like the horse or mule</b><p>&#8220;Do not be like the horse or mule&#8230;&#8221;
