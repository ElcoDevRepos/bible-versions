This behavior is condemned throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, which warns that pride precedes destruction. The cultural context of ancient Israel emphasized community and care for the poor, as outlined in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>). The pursuit of the needy by the wicked contrasts with God's command to protect and provide for the less fortunate. This pursuit is not merely physical but can also be seen in economic and social oppression, reflecting a heart far from God.<p><b>let them be caught in the schemes they devise.</b><br>This phrase is a call for divine justice, echoing the biblical principle of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). The psalmist desires that the wicked fall into their own traps, a theme also found in <a href="/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a>. This reflects a belief in God's sovereignty and justice, where the wicked's plans ultimately lead to their downfall. Historically, this can be seen in the fate of figures like Haman in the Book of Esther, whose plot against the Jews led to his own demise. Theologically, it points to the ultimate justice of God, where evil will not prevail, and serves as a reminder of the moral order established by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Individuals characterized by pride and malice, often oppressing the vulnerable.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_needy.htm">The Needy</a></b><br>Those who are vulnerable, poor, or oppressed, often the target of the wicked's schemes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/schemes.htm">Schemes</a></b><br>The plans or plots devised by the wicked to exploit or harm others.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pride.htm">Pride</a></b><br>A central theme in this verse, representing the arrogance and self-centeredness of the wicked.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>The implied event where God allows the wicked to be ensnared by their own schemes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride.htm">The Danger of Pride</a></b><br>Pride leads to a false sense of security and moral blindness, causing individuals to exploit others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_prevails.htm">God's Justice Prevails</a></b><br>Despite the temporary success of the wicked, God's justice ensures that they will ultimately face the consequences of their actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_for_the_needy.htm">Compassion for the Needy</a></b><br>Believers are called to protect and support the needy, standing against the schemes of the wicked.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/self-examination.htm">Self-Examination</a></b><br>Reflect on personal attitudes and actions to ensure they align with humility and righteousness, avoiding the pitfalls of pride.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Trust that God sees the oppression and will act in His perfect timing to bring justice.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_10_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 10:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_10_2_Wicked_oppress_the_poor.htm">How does Psalm 10:2 describe the behavior of the wicked towards the poor?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_can_Christians_aid_the_oppressed.htm">What actions can Christians take to protect the oppressed, as seen in Psalm 10:2?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_10_2_Proverbs_on_justice_link.htm">How does Psalm 10:2 connect with Proverbs' teachings on justice and righteousness?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_believers_combat_pride.htm">In what ways can believers confront arrogance and pride in their own lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Pray_for_oppressed_inspired_by_Psalm_10_2.htm">How can we pray for those suffering from oppression, inspired by Psalm 10:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_God_permit_evil_to_harm_poor.htm">Why does God allow the wicked to oppress the poor, as stated in Psalm 10:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_10_2_A_challenge_to_God_s_justice.htm">How does Psalm 10:2 challenge the belief in a just and loving God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_explains_Psalm_10_2_s_oppression.htm">What historical context explains the oppression described in Psalm 10:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_10.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_does_god_let_the_wicked_thrive.htm">Why does a just God allow the wicked to thrive openly without immediate consequence?

Not to be taken of indignation felt by the sufferers, but literally of the afflictions they endure. The Authorised Version rendering of the next clause takes the wicked as the subject of the verb; but it preserves the parallelism better, and is more in accordance with the rest of the psalm (<a href="/context/psalms/10-8.htm" title="He sits in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places does he murder the innocent: his eyes are privately set against the poor.">Psalm 10:8-10</a>), to understand it of the "humble," the singular changing to the plural in the subject when supplied: "they (the sufferers) are taken (the verb is in the present) in the plot which they (the wicked) have devised."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor</span>. Dr. Kay translates, "Through the pride of the wicked man the poor is set on fire;" and our Revisers, "In the pride of the wicked, the poor is hotly pursued;" and so (nearly) the LXX., the Vulgate, Aquila, Symmachus, Kohler, Hengstenberg, and others.

Some, however, translate, "They (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the poor) are ensnared in the devices which they (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the wicked) have imagined;" and this is certainly a possible rendering.
