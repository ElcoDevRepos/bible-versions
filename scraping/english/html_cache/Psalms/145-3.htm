In the biblical context, the greatness of the LORD is a recurring theme, highlighting His sovereignty and majesty. The Hebrew word for "great" (gadol) conveys a sense of magnitude and importance. Throughout the Old Testament, God's greatness is demonstrated through His creation, His acts of deliverance, and His covenant faithfulness. In <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>, the greatness of God is celebrated in the song of Moses after the crossing of the Red Sea, illustrating His power over creation and His enemies.<p><b>and greatly to be praised;</b><br>The call to praise God greatly underscores the appropriate response to His greatness. Praise in the biblical sense involves both verbal expression and a lifestyle that honors God. The Psalms frequently call for exuberant and wholehearted worship, as seen in <a href="/psalms/150.htm">Psalm 150</a>, which lists various instruments and actions in worship. The cultural context of ancient Israel included communal worship at the temple, where God's people gathered to offer sacrifices and sing praises. This phrase also connects to the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to offer a sacrifice of praise (<a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>).<p><b>His greatness is unsearchable.</b><br>This statement acknowledges the infinite and incomprehensible nature of God's greatness. The term "unsearchable" suggests that human understanding is limited and cannot fully grasp the extent of God's majesty. <a href="/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7-9</a> echoes this sentiment, questioning whether humans can fathom the mysteries of God. Theologically, this points to the doctrine of God's transcendence, which asserts that while God is knowable, He is beyond complete human comprehension. This concept is also reflected in <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>, where Paul marvels at the depth of God's wisdom and knowledge.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/145.htm">Psalm 145</a>, King David, is known for his deep relationship with God and his role as a leader of Israel. This psalm is a hymn of praise, reflecting David's heart for worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Yahweh is the covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature. The verse highlights His greatness and worthiness of praise.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of Israel, to whom the psalm was originally addressed, is called to recognize and declare the greatness of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_incomparable_greatness_of_god.htm">The Incomparable Greatness of God</a></b><br>God's greatness is beyond human comprehension.
