The term "great salvation" refers to the comprehensive deliverance from enemies and adversities that David experienced throughout his life. This salvation is not just physical but also spiritual, as it signifies God's favor and covenantal faithfulness. The concept of God as a deliverer is a recurring theme in the Psalms and is seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22</a>, which parallels <a href="/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>. The king here is a type of Christ, the ultimate King, who brings salvation to His people. The deliverance of David foreshadows the greater salvation brought by Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the King of Kings.<p><b>He shows loving devotion to His anointed,</b><br>The term "anointed" refers to someone chosen and consecrated by God for a specific purpose. In the Old Testament, kings, priests, and prophets were anointed with oil as a sign of God's selection and empowerment. David was anointed by the prophet Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>), marking him as God's chosen king. The phrase "loving devotion" translates the Hebrew word "chesed," which encompasses God's steadfast love, mercy, and faithfulness. This covenantal love is a key attribute of God, ensuring His promises are fulfilled. The anointing of David is a precursor to the anointing of Jesus, the Messiah (meaning "Anointed One"), who fulfills the ultimate purpose of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>to David and his descendants forever.</b><br>This phrase underscores the Davidic Covenant, where God promises David that his throne will be established forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). This covenant is unconditional and eternal, pointing to the lineage of David through which Jesus Christ would come. The promise of an everlasting dynasty is fulfilled in Christ, who is a descendant of David (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>) and whose kingdom is eternal. The phrase "forever" emphasizes the perpetual nature of God's promises, which are not limited by time. This assurance of a lasting dynasty is a testament to God's faithfulness and His sovereign plan for salvation history, culminating in the reign of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David was the second king of Israel, known for his deep relationship with God and his role as a warrior and leader.

At the cross and resurrection God gave &#8220;great salvation&#8221; to His King once for all (<a href="/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32&#8211;36</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>).<p>&#8226;Those who trust the King share in that same deliverance (<a href="/hebrews/2-3.htm">Hebrews 2:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He shows loving devotion to His anointed</b><p>&#8220;He shows loving devotion to His anointed&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/18-50.htm">Psalm 18:50</a>b) highlights the covenant love (<a href="/psalms/89-24.htm">Psalm 89:24, 28</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8220;Loving devotion&#8221; (steadfast love) is covenant language&#8212;unchanging, loyal, purposeful. God&#8217;s relationship with His anointed isn&#8217;t fickle; it is pledged (<a href="/2_samuel/7-15.htm">2 Samuel 7:15</a>).<p>&#8226;The term &#8220;anointed&#8221; points first to David, literally anointed with oil by Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). But it also points forward to the Messiah, the Anointed One par excellence (<a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>; <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>).<p>&#8226;God&#8217;s loving devotion is seen in the way He bore with David&#8217;s sins yet never withdrew the throne (<a href="/psalms/89-33.htm">Psalm 89:33&#8211;34</a>), and in the way He confirmed Jesus&#8217; kingship by raising Him from the dead (<a href="/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226;Because the Father&#8217;s love for His Anointed is secure, every promise bound up in that love is secure for us who are &#8220;in Christ&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20&#8211;22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to David and his descendants forever</b><p>&#8220;To David and his descendants forever&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/18-50.htm">Psalm 18:50</a>c) ties the whole verse to the Davidic covenant (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226;God swore that David&#8217;s line would endure; <a href="/psalms/89-35.htm">Psalm 89:35&#8211;37</a> calls the promise as certain as the rising sun.<p>&#8226;Historically, that line continued through Solomon, fell into exile, yet never disappeared (<a href="/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27&#8211;30</a>; <a href="/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2</a>).<p>&#8226;The New Testament traces the genealogy straight to Jesus (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32&#8211;33</a>; <a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22&#8211;23</a>).

The change to the third person is certainly somewhat suggestive of this, but by no means conclusive.<p>The question of the relation of the two copies of this hymn to each other is far too complicated and difficult for discussion here. Each has been again and again claimed as the original. The best explanation of the variations is that the compositions were independent copies of some original, and that the psalm, like many others, was altered in preparation for the choir use.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Great deliverance giveth he to his king</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he magnifies salutations to his king.</span> The primary reference seems to be to the gracious message which God sent to David by Nathan when he had brought the tabernacle into Jerusalem, and purposed to build a "house" worthy of it (see <a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8-16</a>). God had then "saluted" David as "his servant" (ver. 5), and sent him a message of the most gracious character, even promising the kingdom to him and to his seed "for ever" (vers. 13, 16). <span class="cmt_word">And showeth mercy to his anointed, to David</span>. No doubt David is primarily intended, both by the "king" of the first clause, and by the "anointed" of the second; but the combination of the two, and the immediate mention of the "seed" which is to reign "for ever," carry the passage beyond the psalmist individually, and give to the conclusion of the psalm, at any rate, a semi-Messianic character. As Hengstenberg says, "Psalms of this kind are distinguished from those which may more strictly be called Messianic, only by this - that in the latter the Messiah <span class="accented">exclusively</span> is brought into view, while here he is presented to our notice only as a member of the seed of David" ('Commentary on the Psalms,' vol. 1. p. 324, Engl. trans.). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/18-50.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">{He brings}</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7713;&#183;d&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">great</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1490;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#7713;&#183;d&#238;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2167.htm">Strong's 2167: </a> </span><span class="str2">Play, to make music, celebrate in song and music</span><br /><br /><span class="word">salvation</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1450;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#353;&#363;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3444.htm">Strong's 3444: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something saved, deliverance, aid, victory, prosperity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to His king.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1451;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
