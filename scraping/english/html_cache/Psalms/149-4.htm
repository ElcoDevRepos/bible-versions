The concept of God taking pleasure in His people is rooted in the covenant relationship established with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>) and reaffirmed through Moses (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). This pleasure is not based on human merit but on God's sovereign choice and love (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a>). The idea of divine pleasure is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are described as God's treasured possession (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). This pleasure is also seen in the joy of the Father over the return of the prodigal son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>), illustrating God's heart for His people.<p><b>He adorns the afflicted with salvation.</b><br>The term "adorns" suggests a transformation from a state of suffering to one of honor and beauty. In the historical context, the afflicted often referred to those who were oppressed or marginalized within society. God's salvation is not merely spiritual but encompasses deliverance from physical and social afflictions. This is seen in the Exodus narrative, where God delivers Israel from slavery in Egypt (Exodus 14). The adornment with salvation can also be seen as a type of Christ, who brings ultimate salvation and adorns believers with righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). The afflicted receiving salvation points to the Beatitudes, where Jesus blesses the poor in spirit and those who mourn (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-4</a>), promising them the kingdom of heaven and comfort.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal, self-existent nature and His relationship with His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_people.htm">His People (Israel)</a></b><br>Refers to the nation of Israel, God's chosen people, but by extension, it can also apply to all who are in covenant with God through faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_afflicted.htm">The Afflicted (Anavim)</a></b><br>Those who are humble, meek, or oppressed.
