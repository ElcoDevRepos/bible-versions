The expression "in their hearts" indicates a deep-seated determination, not just a passing thought. Historically, this could refer to various periods of Israel's history when foreign nations sought to utterly destroy them, such as during the Babylonian invasion. The phrase "crush them completely" suggests total annihilation, echoing the threats faced by Israel from surrounding nations. This sentiment is reminiscent of the threats from Assyria and Babylon, who sought to obliterate Israel's identity and faith. Theologically, this reflects the spiritual warfare against God's people, a theme seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where believers are reminded of the spiritual battle against evil forces.<p><b>They burned down every place where God met us in the land.</b><br>This phrase highlights the destruction of sacred spaces, specifically the places where God was worshiped and where His presence was manifested. Historically, this likely refers to the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and other local sanctuaries during invasions. The burning of these places signifies not just a physical destruction but an attack on the spiritual life of the nation. In the Old Testament, the Temple was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). The destruction of these places was a profound loss for the Israelites, symbolizing a severance from God's presence. This act of burning sacred sites is a tactic used by conquerors to demoralize and subjugate a people by eradicating their religious and cultural identity. Prophetically, this foreshadows the ultimate desecration and restoration of the Temple, pointing to Jesus Christ, who referred to His body as the Temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), indicating that true worship and God's presence would be found in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/74.htm">Psalm 74</a>, Asaph was a Levite and a chief musician during the time of King David.

Buildings, and these places of worship, must be meant, and it is implied that they are scattered over the land, and can therefore mean nothing but synagogues. The "high places" would' not be called God's, nor would Bethel and Dan have been so called, being connected with irregular and unorthodox worship. Thus we have a clear note of time, indicating a period not only later than the rise of the synagogue in Ezra's time, but <span class= "ital">much </span>later, since it takes time for a new institution to spread over a country. Aquila and Symmachus actually render "synagogues." Possibly the LXX. are right in putting the latter clause into the mouth of the enemies, "let us burn," &c<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/74.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them altogether</span>. It was, no doubt, the intention of Nebuchadnezzar to destroy Israel as a nation. Hence the complete destruction of the city and temple (<a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9, 10</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-19.htm">2 Chronicles 36:19</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-1.htm">Lamentations 2:1-9</a>, etc.); hence the deportation of all the <span class="accented">strength</span> of the nation (<a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14-16</a>; <a href="/2_kings/25-11.htm">2 Kings 25:11</a>), and their settlement in the far off region of Babylonia; hence the desolation, not only of Jerusalem, but of "all the habitations of Jacob" (<a href="/lamentations/2-2.htm">Lamentations 2:2</a>), all the "strongholds of the daughter of Judah" (<a href="/lamentations/2-2.htm">Lamentations 2:2, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They have burnt up all the synagogues of God in the land.</span> The synagogue system was first introduced by Ezra, according to Jewish tradition; and it has been argued that the mention of "synagogues" here - literally, "sacred meeting places" - proves the psalm to be Maccabean. But meeting places for worship, other than the temple, always existed in Palestine, both before and after its erection. Mesha speaks of having plundered a "house of Jehovah" in his war with Ahab ('Records of the Past,' vol. 11:p. 167); and it is plain from <a href="/2_kings/4-23.htm">2 Kings 4:23</a> that religious meetings were held by the prophets, probably in houses devoted to the purpose, during the period of the divided monarchy. Hezekiah's destruction of the high places (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>) is not likely to have interfered with the use of these buildings, to which no savour of idolatry can have attached in the mind of the most violent iconoclast. I should therefore believe, with Leopold Low, that buildings existed before the Exile, in which religious instruction was given by authorized teachers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/74-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in their hearts,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1453;&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;lib&#183;b&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
