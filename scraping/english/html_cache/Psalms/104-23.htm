The concept of work is rooted in <a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>, where Adam is placed in the Garden of Eden to work and take care of it. Work is seen as a divine mandate, not a result of the Fall, but rather a part of God's original design for mankind. The idea of going forth suggests a purposeful departure from one's home or place of rest to engage in productive activity. This aligns with the cultural context of ancient Israel, where agriculture and manual labor were common, and each day began with the rising of the sun, symbolizing a new opportunity to fulfill one's duties.<p><b>and to his labor</b><br>Labor here emphasizes the effort and diligence required in fulfilling one's responsibilities. In the biblical context, labor is often associated with toil and perseverance, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:13</a>, which acknowledges the satisfaction found in labor as a gift from God. The Hebrew culture valued hard work, and this is reflected in the Proverbs, which frequently commend diligence and warn against laziness (<a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-11</a>). Labor is also a reminder of the curse in <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>, where work becomes toilsome due to sin, yet it remains a means through which God provides for His people.<p><b>until evening</b><br>The mention of evening signifies the completion of a day's work, aligning with the natural rhythm of day and night established in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. This cycle underscores the balance between work and rest, a principle further emphasized by the Sabbath commandment in <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>. Evening marks a time of rest and reflection, a pause to acknowledge God's provision and faithfulness throughout the day. It also points to the eschatological rest promised in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>, where believers anticipate eternal rest in Christ.
