The imagery of a "phantom" suggests something that is fleeting and lacks substance. In biblical context, this reflects the wisdom literature's frequent emphasis on the brevity of life, as seen in <a href="/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2</a> and <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, where life is compared to a mist or shadow. The Hebrew word for "phantom" can also be translated as "image" or "shadow," emphasizing the temporary and illusory nature of human existence. This aligns with the biblical theme that life on earth is temporary and that true substance is found in the eternal.<p><b>surely he bustles in vain;</b><br>The phrase underscores the futility of human efforts when they are disconnected from eternal purposes. The word "bustles" suggests frantic activity, yet it is described as "in vain," echoing the sentiments of Ecclesiastes, where the Preacher declares that all is vanity. This reflects the cultural context of ancient Israel, where wisdom literature often critiqued the pursuit of wealth and status as ultimately meaningless without a relationship with God. The New Testament echoes this in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where Jesus teaches about storing treasures in heaven rather than on earth.<p><b>he heaps up riches not knowing who will haul them away.</b><br>This phrase points to the uncertainty and impermanence of material wealth. The act of "heaping up riches" is portrayed as futile because the individual has no control over what happens to their wealth after death. This is reminiscent of the parable of the rich fool in <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>, where Jesus warns against storing up earthly treasures without being rich toward God. Historically, this reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of wealth as a temporary and unreliable source of security. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the biblical principle that true security and inheritance are found in God, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/23-4.htm">Proverbs 23:4-5</a> and <a href="/1_timothy/6-7.htm">1 Timothy 6:7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/39.htm">Psalm 39</a>, David is expressing his reflections on the brevity and futility of life without God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom David belonged and often addressed in his psalms, providing a cultural and religious context for his writings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in the psalm, to whom David directs his thoughts and prayers, seeking understanding and purpose.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mankind.htm">Mankind</a></b><br>Represented in the psalm as transient and often misguided in their pursuits, highlighting the universal human condition.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/riches.htm">Riches</a></b><br>Symbolic of earthly pursuits and material wealth, which are ultimately temporary and uncertain.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_transience_of_life.htm">The Transience of Life</a></b><br>Life is fleeting, like a phantom or shadow, reminding us to focus on eternal rather than temporary pursuits.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_earthly_pursuits.htm">The Futility of Earthly Pursuits</a></b><br>Human efforts and the accumulation of wealth are ultimately in vain if not aligned with God's purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_eternal_perspective.htm">The Importance of Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>We should prioritize spiritual riches and eternal values over material wealth, as earthly possessions are uncertain and temporary.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognizing the limitations of human control, we should trust in God's plan and provision for our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_with_purpose.htm">Living with Purpose</a></b><br>Our lives should be directed by God's will, seeking to fulfill His purposes rather than our own ambitions.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_39_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 39:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_39_6_on_life_s_brevity.htm">How does Psalm 39:6 emphasize the fleeting nature of human life?

Thus Sophocles, "I see that we who live are nothing else but images and vain shadows;" Horace, "<span class= "ital">Pulvis et umbra sumus; </span>Burke, "What shadows we are, and what shadows we pursue."<p>The above rendering treats the preposition as the <span class= "ital">beth essentiae. </span>If, however, we keep the Authorised Version, the thought is of man's life, not as a reality, but as a show, a picture, a phantasma (see margin), and himself only an imaginary actor. But this seems modern for the psalms. Shakespeare, no doubt with this passage in his mind, has combined it with the more obvious image:--<p>"Out, out, brief candle,<p>Life's but a walking shadow; a poor player<p>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,<p>And then is heard no more."<p><span class= "bld">Surely they . . . </span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Only for a breath they make a stir.</span><p><span class= "bld">He heapeth up.</span>--The substantive is left by the Hebrew to be supplied.
