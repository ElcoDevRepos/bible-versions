Sheep are known for their tendency to wander, which makes them dependent on the shepherd for guidance and protection. This metaphor highlights human vulnerability and the propensity to deviate from God's path. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, shepherding was a familiar occupation, making this imagery relatable to the original audience. The concept of straying is also seen in <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>, where it states, "We all, like sheep, have gone astray," emphasizing the universal nature of sin and the need for divine guidance.<p><b>seek Your servant,</b><br>The plea for God to seek the psalmist underscores the belief in God's active role in pursuing those who are lost. This reflects the shepherd's responsibility to search for and rescue lost sheep, as seen in the parable of the lost sheep in <a href="/luke/15-3.htm">Luke 15:3-7</a>. The psalmist's use of "Your servant" indicates a relationship of submission and devotion to God, acknowledging His authority and the psalmist's dependence on Him. This request for divine intervention is a testament to the psalmist's faith in God's mercy and willingness to restore those who have strayed.<p><b>for I have not forgotten Your commandments.</b><br>Despite the admission of straying, the psalmist affirms a continued commitment to God's commandments. This suggests an internal conflict between the psalmist's actions and their desire to remain faithful to God's law. The commandments refer to the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, which were central to Jewish life and worship. This phrase indicates that the psalmist's straying is not due to a rejection of God's law but rather a lapse in adherence. It echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>, "I have hidden Your word in my heart that I might not sin against You," highlighting the importance of internalizing God's word as a guide for righteous living.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who expresses a deep longing for God's guidance and a commitment to His commandments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheep.htm">Sheep</a></b><br>A metaphor for the believer, illustrating vulnerability and the tendency to stray without the shepherd's guidance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Shepherd, who seeks out His lost sheep and provides guidance through His commandments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_straying.htm">The Nature of Straying</a></b><br>Recognize that even the most devout believers can stray from God's path.

That parable assures us that our Lord notices when even one of His own drifts.<p>&#8226; By likening himself to a sheep, the psalmist acknowledges vulnerability&#8212;sheep cannot rescue themselves. Dependence on the Shepherd is essential.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>seek Your servant</b><p>&#8226; Having admitted his failure, the writer pleads for divine pursuit: &#8220;seek Your servant.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11</a> promises, &#8220;Behold, I Myself will search for My flock and seek them out.&#8221; God does not delegate this rescue mission; He takes it on personally.<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a> confirms the same heart in Christ: &#8220;For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-15</a> paints the Shepherd who lays down His life.

The psalmist says, in effect, &#8220;Your truth still grips me; bring me fully back so I can obey it.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This shows genuine repentance: not mere regret over consequences but a longing to live under God&#8217;s commands again.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/119-176.htm">Psalm 119:176</a> closes the longest psalm with a picture of honest repentance and confident hope.

But while this may be a legitimate application of the close of this remarkable composition, and while the LXX. suggest a comparison with our Lord's parable by their rendering (comp. <a href="/matthew/18-11.htm" title="For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.">Matthew 18:11</a>; <a href="/luke/19-10.htm" title="For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.">Luke 19:10</a>), this could hardly have been the intention of the words of this verse. More likely there is a reference to the condition of the community, for the word rendered "lost" (literally, <span class= "ital">perishing</span>) is used in <a href="/isaiah/27-13.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem.">Isaiah 27:13</a> of the exiled Hebrews, and is rendered "outcasts;" the emphatic "I do not forget Thy commandments," which is the real close of the psalm, seems to make this view imperative.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/119.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 176.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have gone astray like a lost sheep</span> (comp. ver. 67). Some see in this verse nothing but a reference to the outward circumstances of the psalmist's life. But this is certainly not the idea generally attached in Scripture to the image of the "lost sheep" (see <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6</a>; <a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4-7</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-25.htm">1 Peter 2:25</a>).

"Seek him, lest he be not able of himself to seek thee; and bring him again to thy fold." <span class="cmt_word">For I do not forget thy commandments</span>. In my worst wanderings I have not fallen away wholly from thee. Thy Law has been ever in my thoughts.
