The word "distress" indicates a situation of extreme pressure or adversity, which is a recurring experience for David, the attributed author of this psalm. This act of calling upon the LORD signifies a deep trust and reliance on God, a practice encouraged throughout the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>). It also highlights the personal relationship between the psalmist and God, emphasizing that God is approachable and responsive to those who seek Him.<p><b>I cried to my God for help.</b><br>The repetition of calling and crying out underscores the urgency and desperation of the situation. The use of "my God" indicates a personal and covenantal relationship, reflecting the intimate bond between David and the LORD. This personal appeal is consistent with the covenant promises made to Israel, where God is seen as a protector and deliverer (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-8</a>). The act of crying out is not just a physical act but a spiritual one, demonstrating faith in God's ability to intervene.<p><b>From His temple He heard my voice,</b><br>The reference to "His temple" can be understood in several ways. Historically, during David's time, the physical temple in Jerusalem had not yet been built, suggesting that this may refer to God's heavenly dwelling. This aligns with the understanding that God is enthroned in the heavens (<a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>). Theologically, it signifies that God is sovereign and omnipresent, able to hear the cries of His people from His holy abode. This assurance that God hears from His temple is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_kings/8-30.htm">1 Kings 8:30</a>, where Solomon prays for God to hear from heaven.<p><b>and my cry for His help reached His ears.</b><br>This phrase confirms that God is attentive and responsive to the prayers of His people. The imagery of the cry reaching God's ears suggests that God is not distant or indifferent but is actively listening and ready to respond. This assurance is a source of comfort and hope, reinforcing the belief that God is a refuge and strength (<a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of Jesus as the intercessor who hears and responds to the cries of believers (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David is expressing his personal experience of calling upon God in times of distress.

The superscription of <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a> ties the psalm to the years he was hunted by Saul, so &#8220;distress&#8221; includes fear, fatigue, and seeming impossibility (see <a href="/bsb/1_samuel/23.htm">1 Samuel 23</a>).<p>- Scripture treats distress as a normal part of the righteous life: &#8220;Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him from them all&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>).<p>- Acknowledging distress is itself an act of faith; it admits we do not save ourselves. Compare Jonah&#8217;s confession from the fish: &#8220;In my distress I called to the LORD, and He answered me&#8221; (<a href="/jonah/2-2.htm">Jonah 2:2</a>).<p>- For us, distress can be physical illness, relational conflict, financial strain, or spiritual warfare. The verse invites us to label it honestly and take it where David took it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I called upon the LORD</b><p>- The first response to pressure is prayer, not panic. &#8220;Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>).<p>- &#8220;The LORD&#8221; (YHWH) highlights covenant faithfulness. David reaches for the One who bound Himself to His people at Sinai&#8212;a God who cannot lie.<p>- <a href="/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a> echoes the same invitation: &#8220;Call to Me, and I will answer you.&#8221;<p>- New-Testament believers share the privilege: &#8220;Whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>).<p>- The verse assumes audibility&#8212;David vocalizes the prayer. Spoken prayer disciplines the heart to trust what the lips confess.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I cried to my God for help</b><p>- The language intensifies from &#8220;called&#8221; to &#8220;cried.&#8221; This is not polite recitation but urgent pleading. Jesus met similar passion in Bartimaeus, who &#8220;cried out, &#8216;Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-47.htm">Mark 10:47</a>).<p>- &#8220;My God&#8221; underscores relationship. David is not addressing a distant deity but the One who has personally shepherded him (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>).<p>- <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a> invites the same boldness: &#8220;Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence&#8230; to find grace to help in time of need.&#8221;<p>- The structure&#8212;distress &#8594; cry &#8594; help&#8212;forms a biblical pattern (<a href="/psalms/86-7.htm">Psalm 86:7</a>). God delights to answer cries that recognize His sufficiency.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From His temple He heard my voice</b><p>- David lifts his gaze from caves and battlefields to God&#8217;s &#8220;temple.&#8221; Since Solomon&#8217;s temple was not yet built, the reference is to the heavenly sanctuary where God reigns (<a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>).<p>- The statement is literal: God truly hears. Distance is no barrier; &#8220;Heaven is My throne&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>) yet He bends to earth.<p>- <a href="/revelation/7-15.htm">Revelation 7:15</a> pictures redeemed saints serving &#8220;in His temple,&#8221; confirming that the throne room is real and active right now.<p>- Knowing God hears from His throne breeds confidence that earth&#8217;s crises are governed from heaven&#8217;s control center.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My cry for His help reached His ears</b><p>- The last line assures reception. The prayer did not bounce back unheard. &#8220;Because He has inclined His ear to me, I will call on Him as long as I live&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/116-2.htm">Psalm 116:2</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s hearing is covenantal: &#8220;I have surely seen the affliction of My people&#8230; and I have heard their cry&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>).<p>- <a href="/1_john/5-14.htm">1 John 5:14-15</a> ties the promise to believers today: when we pray according to His will, &#8220;He hears us&#8230; we know that we have what we asked of Him.&#8221;<p>- The verse underscores that God&#8217;s ear is more sensitive than our shout is loud; every whispered plea in Christ is guaranteed audience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>- Distress is real, but so is God&#8217;s deliverance.<p>- The right response is to call&#8212;then cry&#8212;directly to the LORD, confident of His covenant loyalty.<p>- God rules from His heavenly temple and literally hears every prayer of faith.<p>- Because our cries reach His ears, we can face any trouble with assurance that help is already on the way.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Out Of his temple.</span>--Rather, Place--plainly, as in <a href="/psalms/11-4.htm" title="The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/29-9.htm" title="The voice of the LORD makes the hinds to calve, and discovers the forests: and in his temple does every one speak of his glory.">Psalm 29:9</a>, the heavenly abode of Jehovah.<p><span class= "bld">My cry.</span>--In Samuel only, "my cry in his ears."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In my distress I called upon the Lord,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and cried unto my God.</span> At this supreme moment, when he is entangled in the snares, and on the point of being slain, the psalmist represents himself as invoking the aid of the Almighty.
