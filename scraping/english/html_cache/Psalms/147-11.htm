In biblical context, "fear" often denotes a deep respect and acknowledgment of God's power and authority. <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a> states, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom," highlighting that true understanding starts with recognizing God's majesty. Historically, the Israelites were taught to fear God as part of their covenant relationship, which included obedience to His commandments. This fear is not about terror but about a profound respect that leads to worship and obedience. The concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to work out their salvation with fear and trembling (<a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a>), indicating a life lived in reverence to God.<p><b>who hope in His loving devotion</b><br>This phrase underscores the trust and expectation believers place in God's steadfast love. The term "loving devotion" is often translated from the Hebrew word "chesed," which conveys God's covenantal faithfulness and mercy. Throughout the Old Testament, God's loving devotion is a recurring theme, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, where His mercies are described as new every morning. This hope is not wishful thinking but a confident expectation based on God's unchanging character. In the New Testament, this hope is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who embodies God's love and faithfulness (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). The hope in God's loving devotion assures believers of His continual presence and care, as seen in <a href="/romans/5-5.htm">Romans 5:5</a>, where the love of God is poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and faithfulness to His promises.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_fear_him.htm">Those who fear Him</a></b><br>Refers to individuals who have a reverent awe and respect for God, acknowledging His power and authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_his_loving_devotion.htm">Hope in His loving devotion</a></b><br>This phrase highlights the trust and expectation believers place in God's steadfast love and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_and_relationship.htm">Reverence and Relationship</a></b><br>The fear of the LORD is not about being afraid but about having a deep respect and awe for God.

He is not indifferent; He &#8220;takes pleasure in His people&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/149-4.htm">Psalm 149:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse comes on the heels of v. 10, where the psalmist notes that the LORD &#8220;takes no pleasure in the strength of the horse.&#8221; Human power, talent, or achievement do not draw divine delight; instead, the very next words show what does.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently portrays God&#8217;s pleasure as a settled covenant commitment, not a fickle mood (<a href="/isaiah/62-4.htm">Isaiah 62:4</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>).<p>&#8226; This means believers can actually live in a way that blesses the Father&#8217;s heart (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with those who fear Him</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;with those who fear Him&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Fear&#8221; in this context speaks of reverent awe, the posture that recognizes God&#8217;s absolute holiness and authority (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>).<p>&#8226; It is a learned, deliberate orientation: <a href="/psalms/34-11.htm">Psalm 34:11</a>&#8212;&#8220;Come, children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Such fear is never terror for the believer; it is covenant loyalty that keeps the heart soft, obedient, and worshipful (<a href="/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Because God &#8220;opposes the proud&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>) but draws near to the humble, holy fear becomes the gateway to intimacy with Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who hope in His loving devotion</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;who hope in His loving devotion.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Hope&#8221; is confident expectation grounded in God&#8217;s unchanging character. <a href="/psalms/33-18.htm">Psalm 33:18</a> links the same two ideas: &#8220;Behold, the eye of the LORD is on those who fear Him, on those who hope in His loving devotion.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Loving devotion&#8221; translates the rich covenant word that highlights God&#8217;s steadfast, loyal love (<a href="/psalms/103-17.htm">Psalm 103:17</a>). It reminds us that our hope doesn&#8217;t float on circumstances; it rests on His proven faithfulness (<a href="/lamentations/3-21.htm">Lamentations 3:21-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, this means:<p>&#8211; We look beyond present trials, knowing &#8220;those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>).<p>&#8211; We resist despair, for &#8220;Christ Jesus is our hope&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/1-1.htm">1 Timothy 1:1</a>), guaranteeing every promise of God (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<p>&#8211; We cultivate expectant prayer, echoing David: &#8220;O LORD, in You I put my trust; let me never be put to shame&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/31-1.htm">Psalm 31:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/147-11.htm">Psalm 147:11</a> teaches that God&#8217;s delight rests not on human power but on hearts that revere Him and confidently expect His steadfast love.
