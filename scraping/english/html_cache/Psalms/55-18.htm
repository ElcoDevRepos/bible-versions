Redemption in the Old Testament often refers to God's deliverance of His people from physical danger or bondage, as seen in the Exodus narrative. The concept of peace here is not merely the absence of conflict but a holistic sense of well-being and restoration. This peace is reminiscent of the Hebrew word "shalom," which encompasses completeness and harmony. Theologically, this redemption foreshadows the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the Prince of Peace in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>. The peace that God provides is not just external but internal, affecting the soul, which aligns with the New Testament teaching in <a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a> about the peace of God guarding hearts and minds.<p><b>from the battle waged against me</b><br>The imagery of battle is a common metaphor in the Psalms, reflecting the struggles and adversities faced by the psalmist. Historically, David, the attributed author of this psalm, faced numerous battles, both literal and figurative, including conflicts with Saul, his own son Absalom, and various external enemies. This phrase can also be understood spiritually, representing the internal and external struggles believers face, such as temptation, persecution, and spiritual warfare. <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a> speaks of the spiritual battle against "the rulers, the authorities, the powers of this dark world," highlighting the ongoing nature of such conflicts. The assurance of God's deliverance from these battles is a recurring theme, providing comfort and hope.<p><b>even though many oppose me</b><br>This part of the verse acknowledges the reality of opposition and adversity. In David's life, opposition came from various sources, including political rivals, personal betrayals, and foreign enemies. The mention of "many" underscores the overwhelming nature of the opposition, yet it also highlights God's power to save despite the odds. This is echoed in <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>, which states, "If God is for us, who can be against us?" Theologically, this opposition can be seen as a type of the opposition Jesus faced during His earthly ministry, culminating in His crucifixion. Despite the multitude of adversaries, God's plan prevails, offering a message of hope and perseverance for believers facing their own trials.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/55.htm">Psalm 55</a>, David is expressing his distress and seeking God's deliverance from his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies/opponents.htm">Enemies/Opponents</a></b><br>The psalm speaks of those who are against David, representing any adversaries or trials believers face.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Redeemer who provides peace and deliverance from conflict.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/battle.htm">Battle</a></b><br>Symbolic of the spiritual and physical struggles believers encounter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, it is often the backdrop for David's psalms, representing a place of both conflict and divine presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_redeemer.htm">God as Redeemer</a></b><br>Trust in God's ability to redeem and bring peace, even in the midst of life's battles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/peace_in_adversity.htm">Peace in Adversity</a></b><br>Seek God's peace, which is not dependent on external circumstances but is a gift from Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Recognize the spiritual nature of our battles and rely on God's strength and deliverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_opposition.htm">Faith in Opposition</a></b><br>Maintain faith and confidence in God, even when faced with numerous adversaries.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_and_deliverance.htm">Prayer and Deliverance</a></b><br>Engage in prayer as a means to experience God's peace and redemption from life's struggles.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_55_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 55:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_55_18_God_s_power_for_peace.htm">How does Psalm 55:18 demonstrate God's power to bring peace amid conflict?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lesson_on_God_s_peaceful_deliverance.htm">What does "redeems my soul in peace" teach about God's deliverance?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Psalm_55_18_to_adversity.htm">How can we apply Psalm 55:18 when facing overwhelming adversities today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/What_scriptures_show_God_saves_in_battle.htm">Which other scriptures emphasize God's ability to save from battles?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_Psalm_55_18_daily_strengthens_faith.htm">How can trusting God's redemption in Psalm 55:18 strengthen our faith daily?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_55_18_God_s_role_in_deliverance.htm">How does Psalm 55:18 reflect God's role in delivering believers from conflict?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Historical_context_of_Psalm_55_18.htm">What historical context surrounds the writing of Psalm 55:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_55_18_on_divine_intervention.htm">How does Psalm 55:18 address the theme of divine intervention?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_55.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 55?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_little_evidence_for_psalm_71_events.htm">Why is there little historical or archaeological evidence for the divine interventions described in Psalm 71?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_skeptical_theism_say_on_divine_hiddenness.htm">What does the Bible say about mental health?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_do_disasters_occur_if_god_is_awake.htm">Psalm 121:4 - If God 'never slumbers nor sleeps,' why do disasters and injustices seemingly go unchecked?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_kingdom_of_god_like.htm">How should we respond to betrayal and deceit?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 55:18 Mean</div><b>He redeems</b><p>&#8226;
