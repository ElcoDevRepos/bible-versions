In biblical context, self-reflection is a common theme, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-40.htm">Lamentations 3:40</a>, "Let us examine our ways and test them, and let us return to the LORD." The act of considering one's ways implies a recognition of one's actions and their alignment with God's will. This introspection is crucial for repentance, a central theme in both the Old and New Testaments. The Hebrew culture placed a strong emphasis on the heart and mind as the seat of moral and spiritual life, making this consideration a deeply personal and spiritual act.<p><b>and turned my steps</b><br>The turning of one's steps signifies repentance and a deliberate change in direction. In the Hebrew language, the concept of "turning" is often associated with repentance, as seen in the word "shuv," which means to return or turn back. This action is not merely a mental decision but involves a tangible change in behavior and lifestyle. The historical context of ancient Israel involved a covenant relationship with God, where turning back to God was a return to covenant faithfulness. This idea is echoed in the New Testament, where repentance is a turning away from sin and towards God, as seen in <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>, "Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out."<p><b>to Your testimonies</b><br>The term "testimonies" refers to God's laws and decrees, which are a witness to His character and will. In the context of <a href="/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, the psalmist frequently uses various terms like "law," "statutes," "commandments," and "testimonies" to describe God's Word. The testimonies are seen as divine instructions that guide the believer's life. Historically, the testimonies were given to Israel as part of the covenant at Sinai, serving as a guide for righteous living. This phrase underscores the importance of aligning one's life with God's revealed Word, which is a consistent theme throughout Scripture. The testimonies are not just rules but are seen as life-giving and protective, pointing ultimately to Jesus Christ, who is the fulfillment of the law and the embodiment of God's Word (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who is expressing a deep personal reflection and commitment to God's Word.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine being to whom the psalmist is directing his thoughts and actions, seeking alignment with His testimonies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/testimonies.htm">Testimonies</a></b><br>Refers to God's laws, decrees, and commandments as revealed in the Scriptures, which the psalmist aims to follow.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/self-examination.htm">Self-Examination</a></b><br>The psalmist's consideration of his ways encourages believers to regularly reflect on their own lives and actions in light of God's Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_realignment.htm">Repentance and Realignment</a></b><br>Turning one's steps to God's testimonies involves repentance and a conscious decision to align one's life with biblical principles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_scripture.htm">Commitment to Scripture</a></b><br>The verse underscores the importance of a committed relationship with Scripture, viewing it as the ultimate guide for life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_obedience.htm">Active Obedience</a></b><br>The psalmist's action of turning his steps signifies the necessity of active obedience to God's commands, not just passive acknowledgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_growth.htm">Spiritual Growth</a></b><br>Regular reflection and alignment with God's Word are essential for spiritual growth and maturity in the Christian faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_119_59_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 119:59?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_119_59_Reflect_on_life_s_path.htm">How can Psalm 119:59 inspire personal reflection on your life's direction?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_considered_my_ways_teach_self-exam.htm">What does "considered my ways" teach about self-examination in a Christian life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_between_God_s_word_repentance.htm">How does turning to God's testimonies relate to repentance in Psalm 119:59?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Other_scriptures_on_aligning_with_God.htm">Which other scriptures emphasize the importance of aligning life with God's Word?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_follow_God_s_commands_daily_4.htm">How can you practically "turn my steps" toward God's commands daily?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_119_59_s_role_in_self-reflection.htm">How does Psalm 119:59 encourage self-reflection and repentance in one's spiritual journey?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Psalm_119_59.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 119:59?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_119_59_s_link_to_obedience_theme.htm">How does Psalm 119:59 relate to the overall theme of obedience in Psalm 119?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_119.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 119?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_hope_an_anchor_for_the_soul.htm">How does a lamp guide my path?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/are_wealth_and_fame_suitable_for_christians.htm">What defines being spiritually lost?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_is_reality_shifting.htm">What does 'delight in the Law of the Lord' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_feel_abandoned_if_god_is_with_you.htm">Why do you feel abandoned when God is with you?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 119:59 Mean</div><b>I considered my ways</b><p>&#8220;I considered my ways&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/119-59.htm">Psalm 119:59</a>) shows the psalmist stopping to take honest stock of his life.
