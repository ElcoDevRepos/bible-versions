The troubles and misfortunes can be seen as part of the human experience, often used by God to refine and strengthen faith. Biblically, this echoes the experiences of figures like Job, who faced severe trials yet remained faithful. Theologically, it suggests that God allows challenges for a greater purpose, aligning with <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>, which assures believers that all things work together for good for those who love God.<p><b>You will revive me once again</b><br>Here, the psalmist expresses hope and trust in God's power to restore and renew. This revival can be understood both physically and spiritually. Historically, Israel experienced cycles of sin, punishment, and restoration, as seen in the Book of Judges. Spiritually, this points to the concept of spiritual renewal and resurrection, a theme prevalent in the New Testament, particularly in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which assures believers of their own future resurrection (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>).<p><b>Even from the depths of the earth</b><br>This phrase can be interpreted as a metaphor for extreme despair or death. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the "depths of the earth" often symbolized Sheol, the realm of the dead. Theologically, it signifies that no situation is beyond God's reach. This is reminiscent of Jonah's prayer from the belly of the fish (<a href="/jonah/2-2.htm">Jonah 2:2</a>), where he calls out from the depths and is delivered. It also prefigures Christ's descent into the grave and His victorious resurrection, offering hope of deliverance from death for all believers.<p><b>You will bring me back up</b><br>The assurance of being brought back up signifies restoration and deliverance. This can be seen as a promise of God's faithfulness to His covenant people, as He repeatedly delivered Israel from their enemies. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Christ's resurrection, which is the cornerstone of Christian hope. This promise is echoed in passages like <a href="/psalms/30-3.htm">Psalm 30:3</a>, where God is praised for lifting the psalmist from the grave, and in the New Testament, where believers are assured of eternal life through Christ (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to David, the psalmist is a figure who has experienced significant trials and is expressing trust in God's deliverance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in the psalm, depicted as the one who allows trials but also promises restoration and revival.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/depths_of_the_earth.htm">Depths of the Earth</a></b><br>Symbolic of extreme adversity or even death, from which the psalmist believes God will rescue him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Even in the midst of severe trials, believers are called to trust in God's ultimate control and purpose.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_restoration.htm">Hope in Restoration</a></b><br>The promise of revival and restoration is a recurring theme in Scripture, encouraging believers to maintain hope.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_trials.htm">God's Faithfulness in Trials</a></b><br>Reflect on past experiences of God's faithfulness as a source of strength during current adversities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_resurrection.htm">Spiritual Resurrection</a></b><br>The imagery of being brought up from the depths can also symbolize spiritual renewal and resurrection, pointing to the hope of eternal life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_through_suffering.htm">Perseverance through Suffering</a></b><br>Suffering is not without purpose; it can lead to a deeper reliance on God and a stronger faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_71_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 71:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_71_20_Trust_in_God_s_restoration.htm">How does Psalm 71:20 encourage trust in God's restoration after trials?
