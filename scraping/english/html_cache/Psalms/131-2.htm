In biblical context, the soul often represents the whole person, including emotions and desires. The psalmist, traditionally believed to be David, expresses a conscious effort to find peace and contentment. This mirrors the biblical theme of trusting in God rather than being consumed by pride or ambition, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>, which encourages believers to present their requests to God with thanksgiving to receive peace. The act of stilling and quieting the soul can be seen as a form of spiritual discipline, akin to practices such as meditation and prayer, which are emphasized throughout the Psalms.<p><b>like a weaned child with his mother,</b><br>The imagery of a weaned child suggests a transition from dependency on the mother for sustenance to a state of contentment and trust. In ancient Near Eastern culture, weaning was a significant milestone, often celebrated with a feast, as seen in <a href="/genesis/21-8.htm">Genesis 21:8</a> with Isaac. This metaphor indicates a mature faith that no longer demands immediate gratification but rests in the assurance of God's provision. The weaned child symbolizes a believer who has moved beyond spiritual infancy, characterized by constant neediness, to a deeper, more trusting relationship with God.<p><b>like a weaned child is my soul within me.</b><br>Reiterating the metaphor, the psalmist emphasizes the internalization of this peace and contentment. The repetition underscores the completeness of this transformation. In the broader biblical narrative, this reflects the journey of faith where believers are called to grow in spiritual maturity, as encouraged in <a href="/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12-14</a>. The soul's contentment is a testament to the psalmist's trust in God's sovereignty and goodness, echoing themes found in other wisdom literature, such as <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which advises trust in the Lord with all one's heart. This state of inner peace is a type of Christ's own trust and submission to the Father's will, exemplified in His earthly ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/131.htm">Psalm 131</a>, David is a central figure in the Bible known for his deep relationship with God, his role as the second king of Israel, and his authorship of many psalms.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, Jerusalem is often the backdrop for David's life and psalms, symbolizing the spiritual center of Israel and the place where David established his kingdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/weaned_child.htm">Weaned Child</a></b><br>The imagery of a weaned child is used to convey a sense of peace and contentment, illustrating a mature and trusting relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/cultivating_contentment.htm">Cultivating Contentment</a></b><br>Just as a weaned child rests in the presence of their mother, believers are called to find contentment and peace in God's presence, trusting in His provision and timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_maturity.htm">Spiritual Maturity</a></b><br>The imagery of a weaned child suggests a move from dependency on immediate gratification to a deeper, more mature reliance on God.

Just as <a href="/psalms/62-1.htm">Psalm 62:1</a> says, &#8220;In God alone my soul finds rest,&#8221; the stillness here is rooted in confidence that God truly reigns.<p>&#8226; The verb tense is important&#8212;&#8220;have stilled.&#8221; The calm has already been received; it is not a wish but a reality, reflecting <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>, where prayerful trust brings &#8220;the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This quieting echoes the call of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>: &#8220;Come to Me&#8230; and I will give you rest.&#8221; The shepherd&#8217;s voice steadies the sheep.<p>&#8226; Practically, it means we discipline our thoughts, surrender anxieties (<a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>), and refuse the restlessness that springs from self-reliance (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like a weaned child with his mother</b><p>&#8220;like a weaned child with his mother,&#8221;<p>&#8226; A weaned child is no longer frantic for milk; he stays close to mom simply because he trusts her.<p>&#8226; The picture highlights maturity. Earlier dependence was noisy; now the child rests content. Likewise, believers grow from clamoring for immediate answers to resting in the Giver Himself.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/66-12.htm">Isaiah 66:12-13</a> offers the same maternal image: &#8220;As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you.&#8221; God&#8217;s nurture is tender, personal, and sufficient.<p>&#8226; Unlike a newborn always reaching for sustenance (<a href="/1_peter/2-2.htm">1 Peter 2:2</a>), the weaned child enjoys relationship more than provision. True worship seeks God&#8217;s face, not merely His hand (<a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>).<p>&#8226; This calm confidence stands in contrast to the agitated heart Jesus rebuked in <a href="/luke/10-41.htm">Luke 10:41-42</a>; Mary chose the &#8220;one thing needed,&#8221; sitting quietly at the Lord&#8217;s feet.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like a weaned child is my soul within me</b><p>&#8220;like a weaned child is my soul within me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The repetition drives the point home: David&#8217;s soul now mirrors that serene child. The calm is internal, not circumstantial.<p>&#8226; Such inner rest frees us from comparison and ambition; <a href="/bsb/psalms/131.htm">Psalm 131</a> begins, &#8220;My heart is not proud, O LORD, my eyes are not haughty.&#8221; Humility and contentment walk hand in hand (<a href="/1_timothy/6-6.htm">1 Timothy 6:6</a>).<p>&#8226; This settled spirit trusts God&#8217;s timing and methods, echoing <a href="/psalms/37-7.htm">Psalm 37:7</a>: &#8220;Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for Him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; It also points forward to Jesus, who slept in the storm because His soul was perfectly at rest in the Father (<a href="/mark/4-38.htm">Mark 4:38-40</a>).<p>&#8226; When the soul is &#8220;weaned,&#8221; praise flows naturally (<a href="/psalms/34-1.htm">Psalm 34:1</a>) and anxiety loses its grip (<a href="/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/131-2.htm">Psalm 131:2</a> paints a vivid portrait of mature faith: a soul intentionally silenced, resting in God&#8217;s care like a calm, satisfied child leaning against a loving mother. It calls us to lay down restless striving, bow to God&#8217;s perfect sufficiency, and enjoy the quiet confidence that comes from humble, childlike trust.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/131.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Surely.</span>--This seems the best way of rendering the phrase, which literally is <span class= "ital">if not, </span>and is plainly elliptical, being commonly used to express strong asseveration after an oath.<p><span class= "bld">I have behaved . . .</span>--The figure here is plain. It is taken from a baby's first real sorrow when he not merely feels pain, but is allowed no access to that which was his solace hitherto. He moans, and frets, and sobs, but at last is quieted by the love which is powerful to soothe, even when it must deny. So, as George Herbert says of man, "If goodness lead him not, then weariness may toss him to God's breast." But the exact rendering is matter of difference and difficulty. The verb rendered "behave" means <span class= "ital">to make equal or like. </span>This is its meaning, even in <a href="/isaiah/38-13.htm" title="I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night will you make an end of me.">Isaiah 38:13</a>, which is the only place referred to by Gesenius in support of his translation here "calmed." We cannot, therefore, render, as many critics, "I calmed and quieted my soul." But, as in Hebrew, it is common to express one idea by the combination of two verbs, so "I made like, and I quieted my soul," is really an idiomatic way of saying "I made as quiet as." The redundancy of the sign of comparison <span class= "ital">as </span>after verbs of likening may be illustrated by <a href="/psalms/49-12.htm" title="Nevertheless man being in honor stays not: he is like the beasts that perish.">Psalm 49:12</a>, as well as by the passage in Isaiah referred to above. We thus get: "Surely I made my soul as quiet as a weaned child upon his mother, as a weaned child upon me, my soul." Instead of fretting after what is too great for him, he quiets his ambition, and his spirit lies calm and gentle, like a child in its mother's arms, that after the first trouble of weaning is over is soothed and lulled by the maternal caress. Perhaps the opposite idea, expressed by the common phrase, "to <span class= "ital">nurse </span>ambitious thoughts," may serve to illustrate this somewhat unwonted image. For Israel as a "weaned child," comp. <a href="/isaiah/28-9.htm" title="Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts.">Isaiah 28:9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/131.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely I have behaved and quieted myself</span>; rather, I <span class="accented">have stilled and quieted my soul</span>.
