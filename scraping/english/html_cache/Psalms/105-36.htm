This plague was a direct judgment against Pharaoh and the Egyptian gods, demonstrating God's supreme power. The firstborn held a place of prominence in ancient cultures, often seen as the primary heir and the one who carried on the family lineage. The striking of the firstborn was a devastating blow to Egyptian society and a fulfillment of God's promise to deliver His people from bondage. This act also prefigures the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, the "firstborn over all creation" (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>), who would ultimately deliver humanity from the bondage of sin.<p><b>the firstfruits of all their vigor</b><br>The term "firstfruits" is significant in biblical theology, often representing the best and the first portion of a harvest offered to God (<a href="/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>). In this context, it underscores the magnitude of the loss experienced by Egypt, as the firstborn were considered the strength and future of the nation. The use of "vigor" highlights the vitality and potential that was cut off through this divine judgment. This concept of firstfruits is later fulfilled in Christ, who is described as the "firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep" (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>), indicating His resurrection as the first of many who will be raised to eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who executes judgment and delivers His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved and where God demonstrated His power through plagues.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/firstborn_of_egypt.htm">Firstborn of Egypt</a></b><br>The firstborn sons of the Egyptians, representing the culmination of God's plagues against Egypt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who were enslaved in Egypt and later delivered by God's mighty acts.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/plagues_of_egypt.htm">Plagues of Egypt</a></b><br>A series of divine judgments, including the death of the firstborn, that God sent upon Egypt to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>God's actions in Egypt demonstrate His ultimate authority and justice.
