This fear is not about being afraid but about recognizing God's power and majesty. In the Old Testament, the fear of the LORD is often associated with wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>) and obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>). It is a foundational principle for a righteous life, guiding believers to live in a way that honors God.<p><b>you His saints,</b><br>The term "saints" refers to those set apart for God, His holy people. In the Old Testament, this often referred to the Israelites, God's chosen people. In the New Testament, it extends to all believers in Christ, who are sanctified through faith. The call to fear the LORD is directed specifically to these individuals, highlighting their special relationship with God and their responsibility to live according to His will.<p><b>for those who fear Him lack nothing.</b><br>This phrase promises provision and sufficiency for those who fear the LORD. It echoes other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>, "The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want," and <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>, where Jesus teaches that seeking God's kingdom first ensures that all necessary things will be provided. This assurance is rooted in God's faithfulness and His covenant relationship with His people, demonstrating that He cares for and sustains those who honor Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, who wrote this psalm as a song of praise and instruction after being delivered from his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal, self-existent nature and His relationship with His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/saints.htm">Saints</a></b><br>Refers to the faithful followers of God, those set apart for His purposes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_the_lord.htm">Fear of the LORD</a></b><br>A reverential awe and respect for God, recognizing His power, holiness, and authority.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/provision.htm">Provision</a></b><br>The promise that those who fear the LORD will lack nothing, highlighting God's provision and care for His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_and_relationship.htm">Reverence and Relationship</a></b><br>The fear of the LORD is not about terror but about a deep respect and awe that comes from knowing His character and His love for us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_obedience.htm">Holiness and Obedience</a></b><br>Fearing the LORD leads to a life of holiness and obedience, as we align our actions with His will and purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_and_provision.htm">Trust and Provision</a></b><br>Trusting in God's provision means believing that He will meet our needs as we prioritize our relationship with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_of_saints.htm">Community of Saints</a></b><br>As part of the community of saints, we are encouraged to support one another in our walk with God, sharing testimonies of His faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/contentment_and_gratitude.htm">Contentment and Gratitude</a></b><br>Recognizing God's provision should lead to contentment and gratitude, acknowledging that He knows what is best for us.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_34_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 34:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_fear_the_LORD_today.htm">How can we "fear the LORD" as instructed in Psalm 34:9 today?
