In biblical times, oral tradition was common, but written records ensured accuracy and longevity. The psalmist's intention is to preserve the message for those who have not yet been born, highlighting the enduring nature of God's truth. This reflects the biblical principle of teaching future generations, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where parents are instructed to teach God's commandments to their children. The idea of writing for future generations also connects to the prophetic tradition, where messages were often recorded for fulfillment in later times.<p><b>so that a people not yet created</b><br>This phrase points to the foresight and divine inspiration behind the scriptures. It suggests that God's plan includes those who are not yet in existence, indicating His omniscience and eternal perspective. The concept of a "people not yet created" can be seen as a reference to the inclusion of the Gentiles in God's redemptive plan, as later revealed in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>). It also underscores the continuity of God's covenant promises, which extend beyond the immediate audience to future believers.<p><b>may praise the LORD</b><br>The ultimate purpose of recording God's deeds and words is to inspire worship and praise. This aligns with the overarching biblical theme that all creation is meant to glorify God (<a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>). The call to praise is a recurring motif in the Psalms, reflecting the belief that recognizing God's greatness leads to worship. This phrase also anticipates the eschatological vision where all nations will come to worship the Lord, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/66-23.htm">Isaiah 66:23</a> and fulfilled in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9-10</a>. The act of praising God is both a present duty and a future hope, uniting believers across time in a shared purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/102.htm">Psalm 102</a>, traditionally believed to be David or another figure experiencing deep affliction, who seeks God's intervention and deliverance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/future_generations.htm">Future Generations</a></b><br>The "generation to come" refers to those who will live in the future, emphasizing the enduring nature of God's works and the importance of recording His deeds for posterity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, central to the Psalm, highlighting His eternal nature and worthiness of praise.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, Zion is a recurring theme in <a href="/bsb/psalms/102.htm">Psalm 102</a>, symbolizing God's presence and the place where His glory will be revealed to future generations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_afflicted.htm">The Afflicted</a></b><br>The context of the Psalm includes the afflicted, whose cries and prayers are heard by God, underscoring His compassion and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_legacy.htm">The Importance of Legacy</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to ensure that the knowledge of God's works and His faithfulness is passed down to future generations.
