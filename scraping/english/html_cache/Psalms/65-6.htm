The formation of mountains is a testament to His creative power, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9-10</a>, where God commands the dry land to appear. Mountains often symbolize stability and permanence in Scripture, reflecting God's unchanging nature (<a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>). The imagery of mountains also points to God's sovereignty over creation, as seen in <a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4-6</a>, where God questions Job about the foundations of the earth. The mountains serve as a reminder of God's majesty and the awe-inspiring nature of His works.<p><b>having girded Yourself with might</b><br>This phrase portrays God as a warrior prepared for action, a common biblical motif. The imagery of girding oneself is associated with readiness and strength, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a>, where believers are instructed to gird themselves with truth. God's might is a recurring theme throughout the Psalms, emphasizing His ability to protect and deliver His people (<a href="/psalms/24-8.htm">Psalm 24:8</a>). The concept of divine might is also linked to God's role as the ultimate judge and ruler, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10</a>, where God comes with power to rule and reward. This phrase underscores God's active involvement in sustaining and governing the world, reflecting His omnipotence and authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as the Creator and Sustainer of the universe, demonstrating His power and might.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountains.htm">Mountains</a></b><br>Symbolic of strength, stability, and permanence, the mountains represent God's creation and His ability to shape and sustain the natural world.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The act of forming the mountains is part of the broader account of creation, showcasing God's sovereign power over the earth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Creation</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the ultimate Creator and Sustainer of all things.

This is no poetic exaggeration; Scripture consistently teaches that the same Lord &#8220;laid the foundations of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4-6</a>) and that &#8220;the mountain peaks belong to Him&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/95-4.htm">Psalm 95:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; The mountains stand as silent testimonies to His craftsmanship&#8212;majestic, immovable, and ancient. When <a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9-10</a> records the emergence of dry land, it is describing the literal moment God shaped the very landmasses that would rise into ranges and peaks.<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/psalms/65.htm">Psalm 65</a>, as a whole, praises God for His providential care over creation (vv. 9-13). Verse 6 zooms in on the mountains as Exhibit A of that care. Their sheer size and permanence shout that the universe is not random; it is the deliberate work of a personal Creator.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by Your power</b><p>&#8226; The verse grounds the formation of mountains in divine power, not natural forces acting on their own. <a href="/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12</a> echoes the thought: &#8220;The LORD made the earth by His power.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Power here is more than raw force; it is the sovereign ability to bring matter, order, and beauty into existence. As <a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a> notes, &#8220;For He spoke, and it came to be; He commanded, and it stood firm.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This same power sustains creation moment by moment (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>). When we see a mountain range, we are looking at an ongoing display of God&#8217;s might, a daily reminder that &#8220;nothing will be impossible with God&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-37.htm">Luke 1:37</a>).<p>&#8226; Because that power is personal, believers can trust Him for both cosmic and everyday needs. <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a> affirms that creation reveals &#8220;His eternal power and divine nature,&#8221; leaving humanity without excuse.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>having girded Yourself with might</b><p>&#8226; The picture is of God arming or clothing Himself as a warrior. <a href="/psalms/93-1.htm">Psalm 93:1</a> says, &#8220;The LORD reigns! He is robed in majesty; the LORD has clothed and armed Himself with strength.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Girding highlights readiness and intentionality. God does not merely possess strength; He actively prepares and applies it for His purposes&#8212;whether shaping continents or upholding His people.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10</a> links this readiness to His reign: &#8220;Behold, the Lord GOD comes with power, and His arm rules for Him.&#8221; The same arm that carved mountains is stretched out to protect, guide, and redeem.<p>&#8226; For the worshiper, the line encourages reverent confidence. The One who belts Himself with might is never caught off guard. Life&#8217;s upheavals may feel like shifting ground, but the God who established mountains cannot be shaken.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/65-6.htm">Psalm 65:6</a> celebrates the Lord as the intentional Creator who physically formed the mountains, did so by His unmatched power, and continues to rule with self-girded strength. The verse calls us to marvel at the grandeur of His handiwork and to rest in the assurance that the God who shaped the world&#8217;s highest peaks is both able and willing to sustain those who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/65.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Girded.</span>--We see the Divine Architect of the world, girt for his labours in the Oriental fashion (see Note, <a href="/psalms/18-32.htm" title="It is God that girds me with strength, and makes my way perfect.">Psalm 18:32</a>), setting the mountains firm on their bases (comp. <a href="/psalms/75-3.htm" title="The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it.
