The "roaring" suggests a loud, aggressive presence, indicating desecration and disrespect. Historically, this could be linked to events such as the Babylonian destruction of the temple in 586 BC. The meeting place, or sanctuary, was where God&#8217;s presence dwelled among His people, making this invasion not just a physical attack but a spiritual affront. Theologically, this reflects the ongoing battle between the forces of God and those opposed to Him, a theme seen throughout Scripture, such as in the desecration of the temple by Antiochus IV Epiphanes, which is a type of the Antichrist's future actions as prophesied in <a href="/daniel/11-31.htm">Daniel 11:31</a>.<p><b>they have unfurled their banners as signs,</b><br>The unfurling of banners signifies a claim of victory and dominion. In ancient warfare, banners were used to rally troops and signify control over a territory. Here, the enemies of God are asserting their dominance over His sacred space. This act of unfurling banners in the temple can be seen as a direct challenge to God's sovereignty. Biblically, banners often symbolize identity and allegiance, as seen in <a href="/numbers/2-2.htm">Numbers 2:2</a>, where the tribes of Israel camped under their banners. Theologically, this act of unfurling enemy banners in the temple can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate desecration of the holy place, as mentioned in <a href="/matthew/24-15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>, where Jesus refers to the "abomination of desolation" spoken of by the prophet Daniel.
