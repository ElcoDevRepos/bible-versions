In biblical times, idol-making was a common practice among pagan nations surrounding Israel. The craftsmen who created these idols often imbued them with attributes of the gods they represented, yet these idols were lifeless and powerless. The Bible frequently warns against idolatry, emphasizing that those who create and worship idols become spiritually dead and morally blind, just like the idols themselves. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, where the futility of idol-making is mocked. The spiritual principle here is that people become like what they worship, a theme that resonates throughout the Bible.<p><b>as do all who trust in them</b><br>This part of the verse extends the warning to those who place their trust in idols, not just those who make them. Trusting in idols leads to a spiritual deadness and separation from the living God. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, idolatry was a constant temptation due to the influence of neighboring nations. The Israelites were repeatedly warned by prophets to remain faithful to Yahweh, the one true God. This phrase underscores the biblical teaching that reliance on anything other than God leads to spiritual ruin. The New Testament reiterates this principle, urging believers to place their trust solely in Christ (1 <a href="/john/5-21.htm">John 5:21</a>). The prophetic and typological significance points to Jesus Christ as the true image of God, contrasting the lifeless idols with the living Savior who brings life and transformation to those who trust in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/135.htm">Psalm 135</a>, traditionally attributed to King David or another Israelite worship leader, who composed this psalm as a hymn of praise and a call to worship the one true God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/idol_makers.htm">Idol Makers</a></b><br>Refers to those who craft idols, which are man-made objects of worship, often representing false gods in ancient cultures.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/worshipers_of_idols.htm">Worshipers of Idols</a></b><br>Individuals or groups who place their trust in idols, believing these objects have power or divine attributes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, often warned against idolatry and called to worship Yahweh alone.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_worship.htm">Temple Worship</a></b><br>The context of worship in the temple, where the psalm would have been sung, emphasizing the contrast between the living God and lifeless idols.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_idolatry.htm">The Futility of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idols are lifeless and powerless, and those who create and trust in them become spiritually dead and ineffective, just like the idols themselves.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_transformation.htm">Spiritual Transformation</a></b><br>We become like what we worship.

In <a href="/isaiah/2-8.htm">Isaiah 2:8</a>, the prophet laments, &#8220;Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their hands.&#8221; What we create to adore will, in turn, exert power over us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>become like them</b><p>&#8226; Lifeless idols produce lifeless worshipers. As <a href="/psalms/115-8.htm">Psalm 115:8</a> echoes, &#8220;Those who make them will be like them.&#8221; The lifelessness is moral and spiritual: hearts become unfeeling, eyes blind to truth, ears deaf to God&#8217;s voice (<a href="/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/1-23.htm">Romans 1:23&#8211;25</a> shows the same pattern&#8212;people exchange &#8220;the glory of the immortal God for images,&#8221; then slide into futility and darkness. Idolatry is not merely wrong belief; it reshapes character until the worshiper mirrors the impotence and emptiness of the idol.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as do all</b><p>&#8226; The phrase widens the circle: it is not only the craftsmen but &#8220;all&#8221; who are caught in the same snare (<a href="/2_kings/17-15.htm">2 Kings 17:15</a>). Idolatry is contagious; family, culture, and even nations absorb the values embodied in their false gods.<p>&#8226; This collective drift explains why societies stagnate morally when they replace God&#8217;s glory with substitutes (<a href="/psalms/96-5.htm">Psalm 96:5</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/2-18.htm">Habakkuk 2:18&#8211;19</a>). The verse underscores a universal principle: whatever occupies the center of our devotion will eventually define us, for good or ill.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who trust in them</b><p>&#8226; Trust is the heart&#8217;s leaning, the place where hope rests (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3&#8211;5</a>). When that hope settles on an idol&#8212;whether carved wood, wealth, status, or self&#8212;spiritual paralysis follows (<a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; In contrast, those who trust the LORD &#8220;are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/125-1.htm">Psalm 125:1</a>). The stark difference urges believers to keep themselves &#8220;from idols&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/5-21.htm">1 John 5:21</a>), guarding their allegiance so that their lives reflect the living God rather than lifeless substitutes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/135-18.htm">Psalm 135:18</a> teaches that idolatry is self-corrupting. The craftsman who makes an idol, the community that normalizes it, and every person who relies on it will all take on its lifeless, powerless qualities. What we worship shapes who we become; therefore, trusting the living God is both our safeguard and our path to vibrant, transformed life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/135-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Those who make them</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1465;&#1513;&#1474;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;&#347;&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will be</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(yih&#183;y&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">like them,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1453;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3644.htm">Strong's 3644: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like, as, when</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as will all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1453;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">trust in them.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1496;&#1461;&#1443;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#333;&#183;&#7789;&#234;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_982.htm">Strong's 982: </a> </span><span class="str2">To trust, be confident, sure</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/psalms/135-18.htm">Psalm 135:18 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/psalms/135-18.htm">Psalm 135:18 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/psalms/135-18.htm">Psalm 135:18 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/psalms/135-18.htm">Psalm 135:18 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/psalms/135-18.htm">Psalm 135:18 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/psalms/135-18.htm">Psalm 135:18  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/psalms/135-18.htm">Psalm 135:18 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/psalms/135-18.htm">Psalm 135:18 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/psalms/135-18.htm">Psalm 135:18 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/psalms/135-18.htm">Psalm 135:18 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/psalms/135-18.htm">OT Poetry: Psalm 135:18 Those who make them will be like (Psalm Ps Psa.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/psalms/135-17.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Psalm 135:17"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 135:17" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/psalms/135-19.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Psalm 135:19"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 135:19" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
