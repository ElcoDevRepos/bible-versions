Throughout biblical history, Israel faced numerous adversaries who plotted against them, often using deceitful tactics. The term "cunning" suggests a level of craftiness and intelligence in their schemes, reminiscent of the serpent in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>, who was described as more cunning than any other beast. This reflects the ongoing spiritual warfare against God's chosen people, a theme that runs throughout the Bible. The enemies' schemes can be seen in various historical contexts, such as the plots of Haman in the Book of Esther or the Philistines' strategies against Israel. These adversaries often sought to undermine Israel's covenant relationship with God, which is a recurring theme in the Old Testament.<p><b>and conspire against those You cherish</b><br>The word "conspire" indicates a secretive and collaborative effort to harm. This reflects the unity among the enemies of Israel, who often formed alliances to oppose God's people. The phrase "those You cherish" underscores the special relationship between God and Israel, His chosen nation. This covenant relationship is central to the Old Testament narrative, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>, where God expresses His love and choice of Israel. The conspiracies against Israel can be seen as direct challenges to God's sovereignty and His promises to His people. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of the Church as the cherished bride of Christ, who faces spiritual opposition in the world. The ultimate fulfillment of God's protection and love for His cherished ones is seen in Jesus Christ, who embodies God's covenant faithfulness and love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/83.htm">Psalm 83</a>, Asaph was a prominent Levite singer and seer in David's court, known for his role in leading worship and composing psalms.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_people.htm">God's People (Israel)</a></b><br>The primary focus of the conspiracies mentioned in the verse, representing the nation of Israel, whom God has chosen and cherished.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_israel.htm">Enemies of Israel</a></b><br>The adversaries who plot against Israel, representing various nations and groups historically opposed to God's people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cherished_ones.htm">The Cherished Ones</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Israel, whom God holds dear and protects, highlighting their special covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cunning_schemes_and_conspiracies.htm">Cunning Schemes and Conspiracies</a></b><br>The actions of Israel's enemies, characterized by deceit and strategic planning to harm God's people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_protection_over_his_people.htm">God's Protection Over His People</a></b><br>Despite the cunning schemes of their enemies, God's people are under His divine protection.

Scripture consistently warns that evil often masks itself:<p>&#8226; <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a> speaks of &#8220;cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming,&#8221; reminding us that manipulation is a hallmark of spiritual opposition.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a> ties cunning directly to attempts to lead God&#8217;s people astray.<p>By highlighting the hidden nature of the threat, the psalmist calls believers to spiritual alertness rather than na&#239;vet&#233;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they scheme</b><p>The next phrase underlines deliberate planning: evil does not merely arise; &#8220;they scheme.&#8221; <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-2</a> describes nations that &#8220;plot in vain,&#8221; echoing the same calculated hostility. Such scheming shows:<p>&#8226; Intentionality&#8212;<a href="/psalms/37-12.htm">Psalm 37:12</a> says, &#8220;The wicked plot against the righteous.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Persistence&#8212;<a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a> lists &#8220;a heart that devises wicked plans&#8221; among things the Lord hates.<p>God&#8217;s people should therefore expect strategy from opposition, yet trust that every hidden plan remains fully exposed to the Lord (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against Your people</b><p>The target is clear: &#8220;Your people.&#8221; In its immediate context, that is Israel, the covenant nation (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>). Yet by extension it applies to all who belong to God through Christ (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).

Plotting in isolation is one thing; forming alliances multiplies the threat.
