Thanksgiving sacrifices, specifically, were offerings made to express gratitude to God for His blessings and deliverance. This phrase emphasizes the importance of acknowledging God's provision and mercy. The concept of thanksgiving sacrifices can be seen in <a href="/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12-15</a>, where peace offerings included expressions of gratitude. In a broader sense, this foreshadows the New Testament teaching of offering spiritual sacrifices, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>, where believers are encouraged to continually offer a sacrifice of praise.<p><b>and declare His works with rejoicing</b><br>Declaring God's works involves testifying to His mighty deeds and faithfulness. This was a common practice in Israel's worship, as seen in the Psalms, where recounting God's acts was a way to build faith and community. The call to declare His works with rejoicing highlights the joy that comes from recognizing God's intervention and blessings. This aligns with the New Testament encouragement found in <a href="/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>, where believers are urged to rejoice in the Lord always. The act of rejoicing in God's works not only strengthens personal faith but also serves as a witness to others, drawing them to the knowledge of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/107.htm">Psalm 107</a>, traditionally attributed to King David, who calls the people to worship and thank God for His deliverance and steadfast love.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_redeemed.htm">The Redeemed</a></b><br>The people of Israel who have experienced God's deliverance from various troubles and are called to respond with gratitude and praise.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrifices_of_thanksgiving.htm">Sacrifices of Thanksgiving</a></b><br>A practice in ancient Israel where offerings were made to express gratitude to God, symbolizing a heart of thankfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_works.htm">God's Works</a></b><br>The mighty acts and deeds of God, including creation, deliverance, and provision, which are to be declared with joy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rejoicing.htm">Rejoicing</a></b><br>The act of expressing joy and gladness, particularly in response to God's goodness and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_thanksgiving.htm">The Importance of Thanksgiving</a></b><br>Thanksgiving is not just a ritual but a heartfelt response to God's goodness.
