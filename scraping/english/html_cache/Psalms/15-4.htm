In biblical context, "vile" refers to those who are morally corrupt or wicked. The Hebrew culture placed a strong emphasis on community purity and holiness, as seen in the laws given in Leviticus. The righteous person is called to reject and distance themselves from evil influences, aligning with passages like <a href="/proverbs/8-13.htm">Proverbs 8:13</a>, which states, "To fear the LORD is to hate evil." This reflects a commitment to God's standards and a rejection of sin, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture.<p><b>but honors those who fear the LORD</b><br>Honoring those who fear the LORD signifies recognizing and valuing individuals who live in reverence and obedience to God. This aligns with the biblical principle of community and mutual encouragement found in <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>. In the historical context of Israel, fearing the LORD was synonymous with living according to His commandments and statutes. This phrase also echoes the wisdom literature, such as <a href="/proverbs/31-30.htm">Proverbs 31:30</a>, which praises the woman who fears the LORD. It underscores the importance of surrounding oneself with godly influences and respecting those who uphold God's covenant.<p><b>who does not revise a costly oath</b><br>This phrase highlights the integrity and faithfulness expected of the righteous. In ancient Israel, oaths were serious commitments made before God, as seen in <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>, which states that a man must not break his word. The cultural context emphasized the sanctity of one's word, and breaking an oath was seen as a grave offense. This principle is further reinforced by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>, where He teaches that one's "yes" should be "yes," and "no," "no." The phrase suggests a type of Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises and who exemplifies perfect faithfulness and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/15.htm">Psalm 15</a>, King David, is traditionally understood to have written this psalm as a reflection on the character of those who may dwell in the presence of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The central figure in the psalm, representing the holy and righteous God whom the psalmist seeks to honor and serve.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vile.htm">The Vile</a></b><br>Refers to those who are morally corrupt or wicked, whom the righteous person despises.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_fear_the_lord.htm">Those Who Fear the LORD</a></b><br>Individuals who live in reverence and awe of God, demonstrating obedience and respect for His commandments.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/oath.htm">Oath</a></b><br>A solemn promise or commitment, often made in the presence of God, which the righteous person does not break even when it is costly.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_relationships.htm">Integrity in Relationships</a></b><br>The righteous person maintains integrity by despising evil and honoring those who live in reverence to God.

The subject and predicate are not clearly marked; but the Authorised Version gives the right sense. It is quite out of keeping with the context to make both verbs predicates, and to translate, "He is despised and rejected in his own eyes," <span class= "ital">i.e., thinks humbly of himself. </span>The meaning is, "Those deserving contempt are contemned; but the good who fear Jehovah are honoured."<p><span class= "bld">To his own hurt.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">to do evil, i.e., </span>to him-self (see <a href="/leviticus/5-4.htm" title="Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knows of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these.">Leviticus 5:4</a>). The LXX., by transposing the letters, read, "to his neighbour;" and the English Prayer Book version has apparently combined the two thoughts: "Who sweareth to his neighbour, and dis-appointeth him not, even though it were to his own hindrance."<p>"His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,<p>His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate;<p>His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,<p>His heart is far from fraud as heaven from earth."<p>SHAKSPEARE: <span class= "ital">Two Gentlemen of Verona.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In whose eyes a vile person is contemned</span>. So the LXX., the Vulgate, Ewald, Hupfeld, Hengstenberg, and the Revised Version. Others prefer to translate, "He is despised in his own eyes, [and] worthless" (Abort Ezra, Hitzig, Delitzsch, Kay, 'Speaker's Commentary'). Either rendering furnishes a good sense; but the law of parallelism is very decidedly in favour of the former. As the righteous man honors those who fear God, so he contemns those who are vile or worthless. He is no respecter of persons. Men's outward circumstances are nothing to him. He awards honour or contempt according to men's moral qualities. But he honoreth them that fear the Lord. "It is no common virtue," says Calvin, "to honour pious and godly men, since in the opinion of the world they are often as the offscouring of all things (1 Corinthans 4:13)? He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. The righteous man, if he happens to have sworn to do something which it turns out will be to his own hurt, nevertheless keeps his engagement (comp <a href="/leviticus/5-4.htm">Leviticus 5:4</a>, where <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> is used in the same sense). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/15-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">who despises</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1494;&#1462;&#1444;&#1492;
