Visions were often given to prophets like Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, serving as a means to convey God's will and future plans. The use of "once" suggests a specific, memorable instance of divine communication. This aligns with the biblical pattern where God reveals His plans to His servants (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p><b>to Your godly ones You said,</b><br>The "godly ones" refers to those who are faithful and devoted to God, often identified as the saints or the faithful in Israel. This could include figures like Samuel, Nathan, or other prophets who were recipients of God's messages. The communal aspect of this phrase suggests that the message was intended for the benefit of the entire covenant community, not just an individual.<p><b>I have bestowed help on a warrior;</b><br>The "warrior" here is likely a reference to King David, who was known for his military prowess and leadership in battle. This phrase underscores God's active role in empowering and supporting His chosen leaders. The historical context of David's life, including his battles against the Philistines and other enemies of Israel, illustrates how God provided assistance and victory. This also foreshadows the ultimate warrior, Jesus Christ, who battles spiritual forces and secures victory for His people.<p><b>I have exalted one chosen from the people.</b><br>This phrase highlights God's sovereign choice in elevating David from among the people of Israel to be king. David was chosen not because of his status or lineage but because of his heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). This act of divine election is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God often chooses the unlikely or humble to fulfill His purposes. The exaltation of David prefigures the exaltation of Christ, who, though humble and of no worldly status, is raised to the highest place of honor (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in the vision, who communicates His divine will and purpose.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/godly_ones.htm">Godly Ones</a></b><br>The recipients of the vision, likely referring to the faithful or holy people of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/warrior.htm">Warrior</a></b><br>The individual upon whom God has bestowed help, symbolizing strength and divine support.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/chosen_one.htm">Chosen One</a></b><br>The person exalted by God, often interpreted as King David, representing God's anointed leader.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/vision.htm">Vision</a></b><br>The means through which God communicates His message, indicating divine revelation and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_selection_and_purpose.htm">Divine Selection and Purpose</a></b><br>God chooses individuals for specific purposes, and His selection is based on His wisdom and plan, not human merit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_empowerment.htm">God's Empowerment</a></b><br>When God calls someone, He also equips and empowers them for the task, as seen in the help bestowed upon the warrior.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_leadership.htm">Faithfulness in Leadership</a></b><br>Those chosen by God, like David, are called to lead with integrity and faithfulness, serving as examples for others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/vision_and_revelation.htm">Vision and Revelation</a></b><br>God communicates His will through visions and revelations, emphasizing the importance of being attentive to His guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_the_fulfillment.htm">Christ as the Fulfillment</a></b><br>Jesus Christ is the ultimate fulfillment of God's promise to exalt a chosen one, serving as the perfect leader and Savior.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_89_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 89:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_89_19_God_s_leader_choice.htm">How does Psalm 89:19 reveal God's choice of a leader for His people?
