Throughout the Bible, God consistently shows His care for the oppressed, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-9</a>, where He hears the cries of the Israelites in Egypt. The oppressed often include widows, orphans, and foreigners, as mentioned in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>. This reflects God's character as a defender of the weak and a just ruler.<p><b>and for the groaning of the needy,</b><br>The groaning of the needy signifies the deep distress and suffering experienced by those lacking basic necessities. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, the needy were often those without land or means of support, such as widows and orphans. The Psalms frequently echo this theme, as in <a href="/psalms/9-18.htm">Psalm 9:18</a>, where God promises that the hope of the needy will not perish. This phrase underscores God's attentiveness to human suffering and His promise to respond.<p><b>I will now arise,&#8221; says the LORD.</b><br>This declaration of divine action indicates God's readiness to intervene. The phrase "I will now arise" suggests an immediate and decisive response, reminiscent of God's interventions in history, such as delivering Israel from Egypt. It reflects His sovereignty and power to act on behalf of His people. The assurance of God's action is a recurring theme in the Psalms, providing comfort and hope to believers.<p><b>&#8220;I will bring safety to him who yearns.&#8221;</b><br>The promise of safety to those who yearn implies a deep longing for deliverance and protection. This yearning is a form of faith, trusting in God's ability to save. The concept of safety can be linked to the Hebrew word "shalom," which encompasses peace, completeness, and welfare. This promise is fulfilled in the ultimate safety and salvation found in Jesus Christ, who offers rest to the weary and heavy-laden (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>). The assurance of divine protection is a cornerstone of biblical hope, as seen in <a href="/psalms/91-14.htm">Psalm 91:14-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oppressed.htm">The Oppressed</a></b><br>Individuals who are suffering under unjust treatment or hardship.
