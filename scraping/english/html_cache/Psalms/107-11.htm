The Israelites frequently turned away from God's commandments, as seen in the wilderness wanderings (<a href="/numbers/14-9.htm">Numbers 14:9</a>) and during the period of the Judges (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-19</a>). Rebellion against God's word is not merely disobedience but a rejection of His authority and wisdom. This rebellion often led to consequences such as exile or oppression, as seen in the Babylonian captivity (<a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a>). The phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's word, which is a central tenet of faith and practice.<p><b>and despised the counsel of the Most High</b><br>Despising the counsel of the Most High indicates a willful disregard for God's guidance and wisdom. The term "Most High" emphasizes God's supreme authority and sovereignty, a title used to denote His ultimate power (<a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a>). This phrase suggests a deeper level of contempt, not just ignoring but actively rejecting divine guidance. Historically, this can be seen in the actions of kings like Saul, who disregarded God's instructions through the prophet Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>). The wisdom literature, particularly Proverbs, frequently warns against despising wisdom and instruction (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). This rejection of divine counsel is contrasted with the life of Jesus Christ, who perfectly submitted to the Father's will (<a href="/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>), serving as the ultimate example of obedience and reverence for God's counsel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rebellious_people.htm">The Rebellious People</a></b><br>This refers to those who have turned away from God's commands and guidance.
