The concept of redemption is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, where God repeatedly rescues His people from bondage, most notably in the Exodus from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). Redemption involves a price being paid, which in the New Testament is fulfilled through Jesus Christ, who is seen as the ultimate Redeemer (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>). The historical context of this phrase reflects God's ongoing commitment to save and restore His people, a theme that resonates throughout the Psalms and the prophetic books. The idea of redemption also connects to the Year of Jubilee (Leviticus 25), where debts were forgiven, and slaves were freed, symbolizing spiritual liberation.<p><b>He has ordained His covenant forever;</b><br>This phrase underscores the eternal nature of God's covenant with His people. The covenant refers to the solemn agreement God made with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>), which was reaffirmed with Isaac, Jacob, and later with the nation of Israel at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). The everlasting nature of this covenant is emphasized throughout Scripture, indicating God's unchanging faithfulness and commitment. In the New Testament, this is seen as fulfilled in the New Covenant through Jesus Christ (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>), who provides a permanent relationship with God. The use of "ordained" suggests a divine decree, highlighting God's sovereign authority in establishing and maintaining His promises.<p><b>holy and awesome is His name.</b><br>This phrase reflects the reverence and awe due to God's character and reputation. In biblical times, a name was more than a label; it represented one's essence and authority. God's holiness signifies His absolute purity and separation from sin, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>). The term "awesome" conveys a sense of fear and wonder, acknowledging God's power and majesty. This reverence is echoed in the Lord's Prayer, where Jesus teaches His disciples to hallow God's name (<a href="/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>). The holiness and awesomeness of God's name call believers to worship and live in a manner that honors Him, recognizing His supreme authority and glory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is the one who sends redemption and ordains His covenant.

We did not climb up to Him; He reached down to us (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>).<p>- &#8220;Redemption&#8221; speaks of a price paid to set captives free. In the Exodus, the Lord &#8220;redeemed you with a mighty hand&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-8.htm">Deuteronomy 7:8</a>); in the Gospel, &#8220;in Him we have redemption through His blood&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>).<p>- &#8220;His people&#8221; reminds us that redemption is personal and covenantal. Just as Zacharias blessed God who &#8220;has visited and redeemed His people&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68</a>), every believer today can say the same.<p>- Practical take-away: confidence. If God already paid the highest price (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>), He will not abandon those He purchased.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He has ordained His covenant forever</b><p>- &#8220;Ordained&#8221; conveys firmness. God&#8217;s promises are fixed, not tentative (<a href="/2_samuel/23-5.htm">2 Samuel 23:5</a>).<p>- &#8220;His covenant&#8221; recalls the unbreakable bond He established&#8212;first pictured with Noah (<a href="/genesis/9-16.htm">Genesis 9:16</a>), then Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>), fulfilled in Christ, &#8220;the Mediator of a better covenant&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>).<p>- &#8220;Forever&#8221; settles any doubt. The everlasting nature of the covenant mirrors the eternal life bestowed through Jesus (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28</a>) and the &#8220;eternal covenant&#8221; sealed by His blood (<a href="/hebrews/13-20.htm">Hebrews 13:20</a>).<p>- Practical take-away: security. Salvation rests on God&#8217;s sworn oath (<a href="/jeremiah/32-40.htm">Jeremiah 32:40</a>), not on our fluctuating performance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>holy and awesome is His name</b><p>- &#8220;Holy&#8221; sets God apart in moral perfection (<a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>). His actions in redemption and covenant flow from this flawless character.<p>- &#8220;Awesome&#8221; invites reverent wonder. The same Lord who dwells &#8220;in unapproachable light&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>) also draws near to bless.<p>- &#8220;His name&#8221; encompasses His revealed character. &#8220;Give thanks to His holy name&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/105-1.htm">Psalm 105:1</a>), because every attribute&#8212;love, justice, mercy&#8212;shines without contradiction.<p>- Practical take-away: worship. A right view of His holiness fuels grateful obedience (<a href="/revelation/15-4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/111-9.htm">Psalm 111:9</a> paints a sweeping portrait of God&#8217;s saving work. He actively sent redemption, permanently secured His covenant, and stands in unrivaled holiness that commands awe.
