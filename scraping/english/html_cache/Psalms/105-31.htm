In the biblical context, God's speech is an act of creation and command, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a> where God speaks the world into existence. The divine word is effective and accomplishes what it intends, reflecting God's sovereignty over creation. This aligns with passages like <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, which speaks of God's word not returning void.<p><b>and insects swarmed</b><br>The swarming of insects is a direct result of God's command, illustrating His control over nature. This event is part of the plagues of Egypt, specifically the plague of gnats or lice, as described in <a href="/exodus/8-16.htm">Exodus 8:16-19</a>. The plagues were judgments against the gods of Egypt, demonstrating the futility of their deities and the supremacy of the God of Israel. The swarming insects can also symbolize chaos and disorder, which God uses to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>gnats throughout their country</b><br>The mention of "gnats" connects to the third plague in Egypt, where Aaron struck the dust of the ground, and it became gnats. This plague was significant because the Egyptian magicians could not replicate it, acknowledging it as "the finger of God" (<a href="/exodus/8-19.htm">Exodus 8:19</a>). The phrase "throughout their country" indicates the widespread impact of the plague, affecting all of Egypt and demonstrating God's power over the entire land. This event foreshadows the ultimate deliverance of Israel from bondage, a type of Christ's deliverance of humanity from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is the one who speaks and commands nature, demonstrating His sovereignty and power over creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The country referred to in this verse, where the plagues, including the plague of gnats, took place as a demonstration of God's power and judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>Though not mentioned directly in this verse, they were God's chosen leaders who conveyed His commands to Pharaoh during the plagues.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who hardened his heart against God, leading to the plagues as a form of divine judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plagues.htm">The Plagues</a></b><br>A series of divine judgments on Egypt, of which the gnats were one, intended to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites from slavery.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Creation</a></b><br>God&#8217;s command over nature is absolute.
