In the historical context, David often faced threats from enemies, including King Saul and foreign nations. The request for disgrace and shame aligns with the biblical principle of divine retribution, where God vindicates the righteous and brings dishonor to the wicked (<a href="/psalms/31-17.htm">Psalm 31:17</a>). The cultural context of honor and shame in ancient Israel underscores the severity of this curse, as public disgrace was a significant social penalty. This plea can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, though innocent, faced persecution and prayed for God's justice (<a href="/john/17.htm">John 17:1-5</a>).<p><b>may those who plan to harm me be driven back and confounded.</b><br>The imagery of being "driven back" suggests a military defeat, common in the psalms where David, a warrior king, often sought God's intervention in battles (<a href="/2_samuel/5-19.htm">2 Samuel 5:19-25</a>). The term "confounded" implies confusion and disarray, a common theme in biblical narratives where God intervenes to protect His people, such as the confusion of languages at Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-7.htm">Genesis 11:7</a>) or the panic among enemy armies (<a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>). This reflects the belief in God's sovereignty over human affairs and His ability to thwart the plans of the wicked. Theologically, it points to the ultimate victory of God's justice, as seen in the eschatological defeat of evil (<a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this psalm, David is seeking God's intervention against his enemies.

This is not spite but a cry for divine justice, echoing <a href="/psalms/25-2.htm">Psalm 25:2</a>: &#8220;In You, my God, I trust. Do not let me be put to shame; let my enemies not exult over me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Disgraced and put to shame&#8221; points to public exposure of evil motives. When God steps in, wrongdoers lose both credibility and honor (<a href="/psalms/6-10.htm">Psalm 6:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-11.htm">Isaiah 41:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The request assumes God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness&#8212;He promised to protect His anointed king (<a href="/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>). If David falls, God&#8217;s reputation among the nations would suffer, so David confidently asks for visible vindication.<p>&#8226; The prayer also models reliance on God&#8217;s justice rather than personal revenge, in harmony with <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>, where believers are told, &#8220;Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, says the Lord.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>may those who plan to harm me be driven back and confounded</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Plan to harm&#8221; shows premeditated evil.

God&#8217;s light exposes darkness, scattering it (<a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, this verse reinforces the assurance that no weapon formed against God&#8217;s people will ultimately prosper (<a href="/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>). We can pray confidently, trusting the Lord to thwart evil designs in His timing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/35-4.htm">Psalm 35:4</a> is David&#8217;s heartfelt appeal for God&#8217;s visible, decisive justice: expose those hunting him, reverse their advance, and unravel their schemes.
