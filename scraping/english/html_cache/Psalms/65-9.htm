In the ancient Near Eastern context, agriculture was central to life, and water was a precious resource. The imagery of God attending to the earth suggests a personal and attentive involvement in the natural world, reminiscent of <a href="/genesis/2-5.htm">Genesis 2:5-6</a>, where God causes a mist to water the ground. This care reflects God's ongoing relationship with His creation, as seen in <a href="/job/38-25.htm">Job 38:25-27</a>, where God is depicted as providing rain to satisfy the desolate wasteland.<p><b>with abundance You enrich it.</b><br>The concept of abundance here emphasizes God's generosity and the overflowing nature of His blessings. In <a href="/deuteronomy/28-12.htm">Deuteronomy 28:12</a>, God promises to open the heavens and bless the work of His people's hands, indicating that abundance is a sign of divine favor. This enrichment is not just physical but also spiritual, as seen in <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>, where Jesus speaks of giving life abundantly. The earth's enrichment can be seen as a type of the spiritual enrichment believers receive through Christ.<p><b>The streams of God are full of water,</b><br>This phrase underscores the sufficiency and provision of God. In a land where water scarcity was common, the image of full streams would be a powerful symbol of God's provision. <a href="/isaiah/41-17.htm">Isaiah 41:17-18</a> speaks of God opening rivers on barren heights, symbolizing hope and sustenance. The "streams of God" can also be seen as a metaphor for the Holy Spirit, who is often associated with water (<a href="/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38-39</a>), providing spiritual nourishment and life.<p><b>for You prepare our grain by providing for the earth.</b><br>This part of the verse connects God's provision directly to human sustenance. The preparation of grain signifies the cycle of sowing and reaping, which is dependent on God's provision of rain and fertile soil. In <a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>, Jesus teaches His disciples to pray for daily bread, acknowledging God's role in providing for physical needs. The preparation of grain can also be seen as a type of Christ, the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), who provides spiritual nourishment and sustenance to believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The primary actor in this verse, God is depicted as the caretaker and provider for the earth, ensuring its fertility and abundance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/earth.htm">Earth</a></b><br>The recipient of God's care and provision, representing the physical world and its ecosystems.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/streams_of_god.htm">Streams of God</a></b><br>Symbolic of divine provision and abundance, these streams are full of water, signifying God's overflowing blessings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/grain.htm">Grain</a></b><br>Represents sustenance and provision for humanity, prepared by God through His care for the earth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_provision.htm">God's Sovereignty in Provision</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the ultimate provider of all resources and sustenance.

According to some, the whole poem is essentially a harvest thanksgiving, and the poet now "comes at last to the point aimed at from the first." He traces the whole process by which the glorious termination is arrived at. First, the "early rain" descending from "the river of God," or the reservoir for rain which God guards in the heavens (<a href="/job/38-37.htm">Job 38:37</a>), moistening the furrows, softening the ridges, and preparing the land for the seed-corn. Then the sowing, which, being man's work, is but just touched on (ver. 9, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>). After that, the "latter rain" - the gentle showers of March and April - which cause the grain to burst and the blade to spring, and the ear to form itself, and turn the dull fallow into a mass of greenery (vers. 10, 12). At last, the full result - pastures clothed with flocks; valleys, the "long broad sweeps between parallel ranges of hills," covered over with corn; all nature laughing and shouting for joy (ver. 13). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it (comp. <a href="/job/36-27.htm">Job 36:27, 28</a>; <a href="/job/37-6.htm">Job 37:6</a>; <a href="/job/38-26.htm">Job 38:26-28</a>; <a href="/psalms/147-18.htm">Psalm 147:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>).
