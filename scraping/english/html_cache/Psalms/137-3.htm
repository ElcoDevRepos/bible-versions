The captors, likely Babylonians, requested songs from the Israelites, possibly as a form of mockery or to entertain themselves. The request for a song highlights the cultural practice of music and singing in ancient times, often used in worship and celebration. The captors' request can be seen as a way to further humiliate the Israelites by asking them to perform songs that were deeply tied to their identity and worship of God, now in a foreign land.<p><b>our tormentors demanded songs of joy:</b><br>The term "tormentors" suggests a relationship of oppression and cruelty. The demand for "songs of joy" is particularly ironic and painful, as the Israelites were in mourning over their lost homeland and temple. This demand underscores the insensitivity and cruelty of the captors, who were oblivious or indifferent to the Israelites' suffering. The phrase also highlights the deep connection between music and emotion in Hebrew culture, where songs of joy were typically associated with worship and celebration in the presence of God, now turned into a tool of torment.<p><b>&#8220;Sing us a song of Zion.&#8221;</b><br>Zion refers to Jerusalem, the spiritual and cultural heart of the Israelite people. The request for a "song of Zion" is significant because it points to the captors' awareness of the importance of Jerusalem to the Israelites. This request could be seen as a mockery of their faith and longing for their homeland. Zion is often used in the Bible as a symbol of God's presence and the ultimate hope for restoration and redemption. The captors' demand for a song of Zion can be seen as a foreshadowing of the eventual return and restoration of the Israelites, as prophesied in scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8-9</a>, where Zion is promised future joy and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/captors.htm">Captors</a></b><br>These are the Babylonians who took the Israelites into exile after the destruction of Jerusalem.

Their oppressors&#8217; demand turned sacred joy into public humiliation, highlighting the exile&#8217;s physical bondage and spiritual grief. The verse underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness to judge disobedience while preserving hope&#8212;because the songs of Zion, though silenced for a season, would one day rise again in a restored Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/137.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">A song.</span>--See margin.

The captives had, no doubt, spoken of the joyous strains which they had been wont to pour forth in their own city upon festive occasions.
