The Israelites, unlike their neighboring nations, were not known for their cavalry, as God instructed them not to rely on horses for military might (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>). This phrase emphasizes that God's favor and delight are not in human military power or physical strength. Instead, it reflects a broader biblical theme that God values faith and reliance on Him over human capabilities (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>). The horse, often associated with Egyptian and Assyrian armies, represents reliance on worldly power, which God consistently warns against.<p><b>He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.</b><br>The "legs of a man" symbolize human strength and physical prowess. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, physical strength was highly valued, especially in warriors and athletes. However, this phrase underscores that God does not find pleasure in human physical abilities or achievements. Instead, it aligns with the biblical teaching that God values the heart and character over outward appearances (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). This can also be seen as a reminder of the limitations of human strength compared to divine power, as echoed in <a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29-31</a>, where God gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak. This phrase points to the futility of relying on human strength and the importance of trusting in God's power and provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/147.htm">Psalm 147</a>, traditionally attributed to David, who is expressing praise and insights about God's character and actions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, whose preferences and delights are being described.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/horse.htm">Horse</a></b><br>Symbolic of military strength and power in ancient times, often used in warfare.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/man.htm">Man</a></b><br>Represents human strength and ability, particularly in physical prowess or military might.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the Psalm is addressed, often relying on God's strength rather than their own.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_values_vs._human_values.htm">God's Values vs. Human Values</a></b><br>God does not measure worth by physical strength or military power, but by faithfulness and reliance on Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_divine_power.htm">Trust in Divine Power</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to place their trust in God's power rather than their own abilities or resources.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_strength_over_physical_strength.htm">Spiritual Strength Over Physical Strength</a></b><br>Spiritual strength, characterized by faith and obedience, is more valuable to God than physical prowess.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_and_dependence.htm">Humility and Dependence</a></b><br>Recognizing our limitations and depending on God cultivates humility and aligns us with His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reassurance_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Reassurance in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>In times of uncertainty, believers can find reassurance in God's control and His preference for spiritual over physical strength.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_147_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 147:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_147_10_Limits_of_human_strength.htm">How does Psalm 147:10 challenge reliance on human strength and abilities?

Nations amassed cavalry to intimidate enemies, yet the Lord makes clear that massed horsepower never impresses Him.<p>&#8226; He created the horse itself (<a href="/job/39-19.htm">Job 39:19-25</a>), so its strength is hardly a surprise to Him. What matters to God is the heart that trusts Him more than any war-machine (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>).<p>&#8226; By denying delight in horses, God exposes the futility of relying on human arsenals instead of His sovereign care (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man</b><p>&#8226; Powerful legs picture the finest athlete or warrior&#8212;skill, agility, endurance.
