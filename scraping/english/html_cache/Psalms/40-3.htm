In biblical context, a "new song" often represents a fresh expression of worship and gratitude, reflecting a personal experience of God's deliverance or blessing. This concept is seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3</a> and <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>, where new songs are sung in response to God's mighty acts. The idea of God placing a song in one's mouth emphasizes that true worship originates from God&#8217;s work in a believer's life, not merely human effort.<p><b>a hymn of praise to our God</b><br>A hymn of praise is a structured form of worship that acknowledges God's attributes and deeds. In ancient Israel, hymns were integral to worship, often sung in the temple or during religious festivals. This phrase underscores the communal aspect of worship, as "our God" indicates a shared faith among the people of Israel. The use of "hymn" connects to the rich tradition of Hebrew poetry and music, which played a crucial role in expressing devotion and teaching theology.<p><b>Many will see and fear</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the evangelistic impact of personal testimony. When others witness God's transformative work in an individual's life, it can lead to reverence and awe. The word "fear" in this context is not about terror but a profound respect and recognition of God's power and holiness. This concept is echoed in <a href="/acts/2-43.htm">Acts 2:43</a>, where the early church's actions led to awe among the people. The visibility of God's work in believers serves as a testament to His reality and sovereignty.<p><b>and put their trust in the LORD</b><br>The ultimate goal of witnessing God's work is to lead others to trust in Him. Trust in the LORD is a central theme throughout scripture, emphasizing reliance on God's faithfulness and promises. <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a> encourages believers to trust in the LORD with all their heart, highlighting the importance of faith in the life of a believer. This trust is not passive but involves active dependence and obedience, reflecting a relationship built on confidence in God's character and His covenant with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/40.htm">Psalm 40</a>, David is expressing his personal experience of deliverance and the resulting praise to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is the one who delivers and inspires the new song of praise.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_community.htm">The Community</a></b><br>The "many" who will see, fear, and trust in the LORD as a result of witnessing God's work in David's life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_a_new_song.htm">The Power of a New Song</a></b><br>A new song signifies a fresh experience of God's grace and deliverance.
