In the Old Testament, the heart is often seen as the center of one's being, encompassing mind, will, and emotions. This internalization reflects the promise of the New Covenant found in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, where God declares He will put His law within His people and write it on their hearts. This is fulfilled in the New Testament through the work of the Holy Spirit, who indwells believers and guides them in truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>). The phrase also echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6</a>, where God commands His people to keep His words in their hearts, indicating a life lived in accordance with divine principles.<p><b>his steps do not falter.</b><br>This part of the verse suggests stability and guidance in one's life journey. The imagery of walking and steps is common in biblical literature, often symbolizing one's conduct or way of life. <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a> describes God's word as a lamp to one's feet and a light to one's path, reinforcing the idea that adherence to God's law provides direction and prevents stumbling. In a historical context, the metaphor of walking without faltering would resonate with the Israelites, who often faced literal and spiritual journeys through challenging terrains. This assurance of stability is also seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, where trust in the Lord leads to straight paths. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who perfectly walked in God's law and provides believers with the strength to follow His example.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/37.htm">Psalm 37</a>, David was the second king of Israel, known for his deep relationship with God and his role as a psalmist.
