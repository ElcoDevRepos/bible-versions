Listening to God requires a posture of humility and readiness to obey. In the historical context, the Israelites often heard God's voice through prophets, priests, and sacred texts. The phrase underscores the personal responsibility of each believer to seek divine guidance. The use of "God the LORD" highlights the covenant relationship between God and His people, reminding them of His authority and faithfulness. This call to listen is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, where the Shema instructs Israel to hear and love the LORD.<p><b>for He will surely speak peace to His people and His saints;</b><br>The promise of peace is central to God's message. In the Old Testament, peace (shalom) signifies completeness, welfare, and harmony, not merely the absence of conflict. This peace is a covenantal blessing, often associated with obedience and faithfulness to God. The term "His people" refers to Israel, God's chosen nation, while "His saints" can be understood as those set apart for His purposes, emphasizing holiness and dedication. This assurance of peace is prophetic, pointing to the ultimate peace brought by Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), who reconciles humanity to God.<p><b>He will not let them return to folly.</b><br>Folly in biblical terms often denotes moral and spiritual foolishness, a departure from God's wisdom and commands. Historically, Israel's repeated cycles of sin and repentance illustrate this folly. The assurance that God will not let His people return to folly suggests divine intervention and guidance to prevent backsliding. This reflects God's commitment to sanctification, ensuring His people grow in righteousness. It aligns with New Testament teachings, such as <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>, which assures believers that God will complete the good work He began in them. This phrase also highlights God's protective and redemptive nature, ensuring His people remain on the path of wisdom and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_lord.htm">God the LORD</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing the divine authority and source of peace.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_people.htm">His People</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites, God's chosen people, who are recipients of His promises and peace.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_saints.htm">His Saints</a></b><br>Those who are set apart for God, often seen as the faithful within the community of believers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/folly.htm">Folly</a></b><br>Represents the sinful or foolish actions that lead people away from God's will.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of the Psalm, traditionally attributed to the sons of Korah, who expresses a desire to hear God's voice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/listening_to_god.htm">Listening to God</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of being attentive to God's voice through prayer, Scripture, and the Holy Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/peace_as_a_divine_gift.htm">Peace as a Divine Gift</a></b><br>Highlight that true peace comes from God and is a promise to His people and saints.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_folly.htm">Avoiding Folly</a></b><br>Encourage believers to seek wisdom and avoid returning to sinful behaviors that separate them from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_the_community.htm">Role of the Community</a></b><br>Stress the importance of being part of a faith community that listens to God and supports one another in pursuing peace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_promises.htm">Trust in God's Promises</a></b><br>Reinforce the assurance that God will fulfill His promises, including the promise of peace.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_85_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 85:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_hear_God_s_voice_daily_10.htm">How can we "listen to what God the LORD will say" daily?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_peace_to_His_people_today.htm">What does "peace to His people" mean in our current context?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_85_8_and_Jesus_on_peace.htm">How does Psalm 85:8 connect to Jesus' teachings on peace?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_returning_to_folly.htm">What steps ensure we "do not turn back to folly"?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_85_8_s_role_in_community_prayers.htm">How can Psalm 85:8 guide our prayers for community and nation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_85_8_Listening_to_God_today.htm">How does Psalm 85:8 encourage listening to God in today's noisy world?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_85_8_God_s_peace_promise.htm">What does Psalm 85:8 reveal about God's promise of peace to His people?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Psalm_85_8_today.htm">How can Psalm 85:8 be applied to modern Christian life and decision-making?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_85.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 85?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_psalm_85_8-9_align_with_history.htm">Psalm 85:8&#8211;9 &#8211;
