The term "works" encompasses everything God has made, reflecting the biblical theme of creation's testimony to God's glory (<a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>). The call to bless the Lord is an invitation for all created things to acknowledge God's sovereignty and goodness. This echoes the creation narrative in Genesis, where God saw that everything He made was "very good" (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>).<p><b>in all places of His dominion.</b><br>God's dominion is universal, extending over all the earth and the heavens. This phrase emphasizes God's omnipresence and omnipotence, reminding believers that there is no place beyond His rule. The concept of God's dominion is a recurring theme in the Psalms, highlighting His authority over nations and nature (<a href="/psalms/47-2.htm">Psalm 47:2</a>). It also points to the future establishment of God's kingdom on earth, as prophesied in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>.<p><b>Bless the LORD, O my soul!</b><br>The psalmist concludes with a personal exhortation, urging his own soul to bless the Lord. This reflects a deep, personal commitment to worship and gratitude. The repetition of this phrase from the beginning of the psalm (<a href="/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103:1</a>) underscores the importance of individual devotion. It serves as a reminder that worship is not only a communal activity but also a personal responsibility. This personal call to worship is seen throughout the Psalms, where the psalmist often speaks to his own soul, encouraging faith and trust in God (<a href="/psalms/42-11.htm">Psalm 42:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal, self-existent nature and His relationship with His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/all_his_works.htm">All His Works</a></b><br>Refers to all of creation, both animate and inanimate, that God has made and sustains.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/places_of_his_dominion.htm">Places of His Dominion</a></b><br>Encompasses the entire universe, as God&#8217;s dominion is limitless and extends over all creation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist (David)</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to King David, who is expressing a personal and communal call to worship and bless the LORD.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_soul.htm">The Soul</a></b><br>Represents the innermost being of a person, emphasizing a deep, heartfelt worship and blessing of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/universal_call_to_worship.htm">Universal Call to Worship</a></b><br>All of creation is called to bless the LORD, reminding us that worship is not limited to humans but is a cosmic activity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_responsibility_in_worship.htm">Personal Responsibility in Worship</a></b><br>The psalmist&#8217;s call to his own soul emphasizes personal responsibility in worship.

Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/106-1.htm">Psalm 106:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Such blessing is never empty ritual; it springs from grateful hearts that know the Lord personally (<a href="/psalms/34-1.htm">Psalm 34:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-12.htm">Revelation 7:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All His works</b><p>&#8226; The scope widens from individual worshipers to everything God has made.

Even the fields, trees, and seas are pictured rejoicing before Him (<a href="/psalms/96-11.htm">Psalm 96:11-12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-12.htm">Isaiah 55:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In all places of His dominion</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s reign is absolute and universal, reaching &#8220;from everlasting to everlasting&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/103-17.htm">Psalm 103:17</a>).

After summoning creation, the psalmist again speaks to his own soul, modeling personal responsiveness.<p>&#8226; This mirrors the psalm&#8217;s beginning (<a href="/psalms/103-1.htm">Psalm 103:1</a>), bookending the whole song with private devotion inside public praise.<p>&#8226; Mary&#8217;s Magnificat shows the same inward overflow: &#8220;My soul magnifies the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-46.htm">Luke 1:46</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine praise starts deep within&#8212;mind, will, emotions&#8212;then flows outward to join the universal chorus.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/103-22.htm">Psalm 103:22</a> is a sweeping call for universal praise that moves from personal worship to cosmic adoration and back again. Every creature, in every corner of God&#8217;s boundless kingdom, is summoned to bless the LORD for who He is and all He has done. The psalmist&#8217;s final self-address reminds us that lofty theology must land in humble, heartfelt thanksgiving: &#8220;Bless the LORD, O my soul!&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/103.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">All his works.</span>--Not only the heavens and their hosts, but<p>"Earth with her thousand voices praises God."<p>Nor can the psalmist himself remain silent, but must repeat the self-dedication with winch he began his song.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/103.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bless the Lord, all his works in all places of his dominion</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1-4</a>; <a href="/psalms/145-10.htm">Psalm 145:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/148-7.htm">Psalm 148:7-13</a>).
