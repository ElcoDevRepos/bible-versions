In biblical context, David often faced enemies, but the betrayal by a friend or close associate is more personal and painful. This reflects the experience of Jesus Christ, who was betrayed by Judas, one of His own disciples. The emotional weight of betrayal by a trusted companion is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing the depth of human relationships and the potential for hurt within them.<p><b>that I could endure.</b><br>David expresses that if the insult had come from an enemy, he could have borne it. This suggests a level of expectation and preparedness for attacks from known adversaries. Historically, David was a warrior king, accustomed to facing external threats. The endurance mentioned here implies a resilience built through experience with external conflicts, contrasting with the unexpected nature of betrayal from within one's circle.<p><b>It is not a foe who rises against me;</b><br>The term "foe" indicates an adversary or opponent, typically someone with whom there is open conflict. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, enemies were often external nations or groups. The rising against implies an active opposition, which David would have been prepared to face in battle. This phrase underscores the shock and dismay of facing opposition from someone who was not considered an enemy, highlighting the theme of unexpected betrayal.<p><b>from him I could hide.</b><br>David suggests that if the threat were from a known enemy, he could take measures to protect himself, such as hiding or seeking refuge. This reflects the strategic and tactical mindset of a leader like David, who often sought God's guidance for protection against his enemies. The ability to hide from a foe implies a level of control and predictability in dealing with known threats, contrasting with the vulnerability felt when betrayal comes from a trusted friend. This also connects to the broader biblical theme of God as a refuge and hiding place for His people, offering protection and solace in times of trouble.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of this Psalm, David is expressing his deep personal anguish over betrayal by a close companion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of David's life and reign often centers around Jerusalem, the city of David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/betrayal.htm">Betrayal</a></b><br>The event of betrayal is central to this verse, highlighting the pain of being wronged by someone close rather than a known enemy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_pain_of_betrayal.htm">The Pain of Betrayal</a></b><br>Betrayal by a friend or loved one can be more painful than attacks from an enemy.

He is not lamenting attacks from outsiders, but from someone inside the circle of trust. Scripture repeatedly shows that close betrayal cuts deepest&#8212;<a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a> speaks of a &#8220;close friend&#8221; lifting his heel, and Jesus applies that verse to Judas in <a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>. We feel the same sting today: conflict within the family of faith or within a marriage hurts precisely because love and loyalty were expected.<p>Key takeaways<p>&#8226; Hurtful words from strangers may bruise, but betrayal by a companion strikes at the soul (<a href="/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; The believer is invited to bring such pain honestly to God, following David&#8217;s example of transparent lament (<a href="/psalms/142-1.htm">Psalm 142:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that I could endure</b><p>If the insult had come from an acknowledged adversary, David could have borne it more easily. The shock factor is missing when hostility comes from hostile people&#8212;<a href="/1_samuel/24-11.htm">1 Samuel 24:11</a> shows David sparing Saul even while Saul pursued him, illustrating a threat he had already learned to face. Endurance is possible when the conflict follows expected lines.<p>Key takeaways<p>&#8226; Knowing the source prepares the heart; unexpected betrayal shakes the foundation (<a href="/job/19-19.htm">Job 19:19</a>).<p>&#8226; God equips His children to endure every trial (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>), yet candid lament is still appropriate when pain feels overwhelming.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It is not a foe who rises against me</b><p>The verse parallels the first line, emphasizing that the assailant is not a recognized enemy. David&#8217;s language echoes <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where enmity is declared between the serpent and the woman; enmity is normal in spiritual warfare. What is abnormal here is treachery within friendship.<p>Key takeaways<p>&#8226; Spiritual battles often come from expected directions (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>), but internal betrayal signals disordered relationships within God&#8217;s people.<p>&#8226; The psalm calls us to watch our own hearts so we do not become that unexpected foe to another believer (<a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from him I could hide</b><p>Had the attacker been an outright enemy, David could have used conventional defenses or physical distance. He had eluded Saul in the wilderness (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>), demonstrating tactical skill. Betrayal by a friend eliminates those options; you can&#8217;t hide from someone who already knows your hiding places.<p>Key takeaways<p>&#8226; Betrayal invades the places that should be safe (<a href="/psalms/55-14.htm">Psalm 55:14</a> describes walking &#8220;in the house of God&#8221; together).<p>&#8226; Christ experienced this at its fullest&#8212;Judas knew Jesus&#8217; private retreat at Gethsemane (<a href="/john/18-2.htm">John 18:2</a>). Jesus, like David, entrusted Himself to the Father rather than seeking earthly refuge (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/55-12.htm">Psalm 55:12</a> exposes the agony of betrayal by a trusted companion. David&#8217;s honesty validates our own grief when wounds come from friends or fellow believers. While opposition from known enemies can be faced head-on, treachery from within dismantles usual defenses and pierces the heart. The passage urges us to pour out our pain to the Lord, rely on His sustaining grace, guard our own loyalty, and remember that our Savior endured the same sorrow, proving He is the perfect refuge when trust is shattered.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/55.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">For.</span>--The ellipse must be supplied from <a href="/psalms/55-9.htm" title="Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.">Psalm 55:9</a>, <span class= "ital">I invoke destruction for, </span>&c<p><span class= "bld">Then I could . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">then </span>(or <span class= "ital">else</span>)<span class= "ital"> I might bear it.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/55.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For it was not an enemy that</span> <span class="cmt_word">reproached me; then I could have borne it.</span> The psalmist passes from the general to the particular - from the great mass of his opponents to one special individual. Even Professor Cheyne allows this, and suggests that we have here Jeremiah inveighing against Pashur. But the general sentiment of commentators has always been that Ahithophel is intended. And, if we allow the psalm to be David's, we can scarcely give any other explanation. Ahithophel was known as "David's counsellor" (<a href="/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his chief adviser, his "grand vizier," his "prime minister? What he counselled was considered as a sort of "oracle of God" (<a href="/2_samuel/16-23.htm">2 Samuel 16:23</a>). His defection was the bitterest drop in the cup of the unhappy king. Anything else he "could have borne;" but this was too much. Neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me. It was not one among my professed and open enemies - not one of those whose hatred I had long known and reckoned on. Then I would have hid myself from him.
