Bashan was part of the territory that the Israelites conquered before entering the Promised Land. Og is mentioned in several places in the Old Testament, including <a href="/numbers/21-33.htm">Numbers 21:33-35</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/3.htm">Deuteronomy 3:1-11</a>, where his defeat is recounted. He was one of the last of the Rephaim, a group of giants, which made his defeat significant for the Israelites. The victory over Og demonstrated God's power and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises to Israel. The archaeological evidence of fortified cities in Bashan supports the biblical account of a well-defended region.<p><b>His loving devotion endures forever.</b><br>This phrase is a recurring refrain throughout <a href="/psalms/136.htm">Psalm 136</a>, emphasizing God's steadfast love and faithfulness. The Hebrew word for "loving devotion" is "chesed," which conveys a sense of covenant loyalty and mercy. The repetition of this phrase in the psalm serves to remind the reader of God's unchanging nature and His commitment to His people. The enduring nature of God's love is a central theme in Scripture, seen in passages like <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/16-34.htm">1 Chronicles 16:34</a>. This enduring love is ultimately fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ, whose sacrificial death and resurrection provide the ultimate demonstration of God's love for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/og,_king_of_bashan.htm">Og, King of Bashan</a></b><br>Og was a king of the Amorites, ruling over Bashan, a region east of the Jordan River.
