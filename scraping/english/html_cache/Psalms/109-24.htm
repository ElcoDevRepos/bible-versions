Fasting in biblical times was often associated with mourning, repentance, or seeking God's intervention. The weakening of the knees symbolizes the toll that prolonged fasting can take on the body, indicating a sincere and earnest plea to God. In the context of <a href="/psalms/109.htm">Psalm 109</a>, David is expressing his desperation and reliance on God amidst persecution. Fasting is a common biblical practice seen in figures like Moses (<a href="/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>) and Jesus (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>), highlighting its importance in seeking divine guidance and strength.<p><b>and my body grows lean and gaunt</b><br>This imagery conveys the physical depletion resulting from extended fasting and emotional turmoil. The description of becoming lean and gaunt suggests a state of vulnerability and frailty. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, physical appearance often reflected one's social and spiritual condition. The psalmist's condition can be seen as a type of Christ, who also experienced physical suffering and deprivation (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3-5</a>). This phrase underscores the depth of the psalmist's affliction and his dependence on God for sustenance and deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/109.htm">Psalm 109</a>, David is expressing his deep distress and physical weakness due to fasting and prayer.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The psalm is a plea for deliverance from adversaries who are unjustly attacking David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/fasting.htm">Fasting</a></b><br>A spiritual discipline practiced by David, indicating his earnestness in seeking God's intervention.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate source of strength and deliverance whom David is appealing to in his time of need.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_fasting.htm">The Power of Fasting</a></b><br>Fasting is a powerful spiritual discipline that can bring us closer to God and demonstrate our dependence on Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/physical_weakness_and_spiritual_strength.htm">Physical Weakness and Spiritual Strength</a></b><br>Our physical limitations can highlight our need for God's strength and provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_prayer.htm">Perseverance in Prayer</a></b><br>Despite physical weakness, we are called to persevere in prayer, trusting that God hears and responds.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/empathy_for_the_suffering.htm">Empathy for the Suffering</a></b><br>Recognizing our own vulnerabilities can increase our empathy and compassion for others who are suffering.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_deliverance.htm">Trust in God's Deliverance</a></b><br>Even when we feel weak and vulnerable, we can trust in God's ability to deliver and sustain us.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_109_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 109:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_109_24_Fasting_s_bodily_impact.htm">How does Psalm 109:24 illustrate the impact of fasting on the body?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Perseverance_lessons_in_Psalm_109_24.htm">What can we learn about perseverance from Psalm 109:24's depiction of weakness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_109_24_and_Matthew_4_2_link.htm">How does Psalm 109:24 connect to Jesus' fasting in Matthew 4:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_believers_fast_today.htm">How can believers apply the discipline of fasting in their spiritual lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_weakness_aid_spiritual_growth.htm">What role does physical weakness play in spiritual growth, according to Psalm 109:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_109_24_historical_context.htm">What is the historical context of Psalm 109:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_109_24_and_biblical_suffering.htm">How does Psalm 109:24 reflect the theme of suffering in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_is_Psalm_109_24_s_theological_message.htm">What theological message is conveyed in Psalm 109:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_109.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 109?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_to_stay_faithful_amid_challenges.htm">How can we remain faithful amidst challenges and false teachings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_can_david_mourn_and_curse_foes.htm">Psalm 35:13-14 - How can David both mourn for his foes and call down curses on them without contradiction?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_psalm_109_17-18_contradict_forgiveness.htm">In Psalm 109:17-18, does the invocation of curses contradict teachings elsewhere in Scripture promoting forgiveness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what's_holy_saturday's_significance.htm">What is the significance of Holy Saturday?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 109:24 Mean</div><b>My knees are weak from fasting</b><p>&#8226; The psalmist&#8217;s knees&#8212;symbolic of stability and strength&#8212;have literally given way. The language underscores genuine physical frailty, not mere metaphor.<p>&#8226; Fasting here is voluntary self-denial before God, echoing <a href="/psalms/35-13.htm">Psalm 35:13</a>, &#8220;I humbled myself with fasting,&#8221; and <a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12</a>, &#8220;Return to Me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The picture is one of earnest, extended prayer. Like <a href="/ezra/8-23.htm">Ezra 8:23</a>, fasting accompanies urgent petition.<p>&#8226; Weak knees also point to utter dependence on the Lord, paralleling <a href="/hebrews/12-12.htm">Hebrews 12:12</a>&#8217;s call to &#8220;strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees&#8221;. The psalmist confesses he has no strength left but trusts God will provide it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and my body grows lean and gaunt</b><p>&#8226; The words paint a vivid portrait of emaciation. The psalmist&#8217;s frame has wasted away, reflecting prolonged distress. Compare <a href="/psalms/102-4.htm">Psalm 102:4-5</a>, &#8220;My heart is afflicted and withered like grass&#8230; my bones cling to my flesh,&#8221; and <a href="/job/19-20.htm">Job 19:20</a>, &#8220;My skin and flesh cling to my bones&#8221;.<p>&#8226; This leanness is both the result of fasting and the pressure of relentless opposition (see <a href="/psalms/109-1.htm">Psalm 109:1-5</a>). Physical suffering displays the depth of affliction, much like Paul&#8217;s catalog of hardships in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-27.htm">2 Corinthians 11:27</a>, &#8220;in labor and toil and often without sleep, in hunger and thirst, frequently without food&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Yet even this gaunt condition testifies that God sustains the psalmist&#8217;s life. <a href="/psalms/22-14.htm">Psalm 22:14-17</a> shows a similar tension: extreme weakness paired with unwavering faith that God sees and delivers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/109-24.htm">Psalm 109:24</a> presents a literal snapshot of the psalmist&#8217;s worn-out body&#8212;knees buckling from prolonged fasting, flesh reduced to skin and bone&#8212;highlighting deep humility, earnest prayer, and total dependence on God.
