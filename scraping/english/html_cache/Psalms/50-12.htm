In the ancient Near Eastern context, gods were often thought to require sustenance from their worshippers, but the God of Israel is distinct in that He does not depend on human offerings. This reflects the theological truth that God is not like the pagan deities who needed to be fed by their followers. The rhetorical nature of the statement underscores God's sovereignty and the futility of thinking that human actions can fulfill any divine need. This is consistent with other scriptures, such as <a href="/acts/17-24.htm">Acts 17:24-25</a>, where Paul declares that God is not served by human hands as if He needed anything.<p><b>for the world is Mine</b><br>This phrase asserts God's ownership and dominion over all creation. It echoes the creation narrative in Genesis, where God is depicted as the Creator of the heavens and the earth. The idea of divine ownership is a recurring theme in the Psalms, as seen in <a href="/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>, which states, "The earth is the LORD&#8217;s, and the fullness thereof." This ownership implies that God has authority over all things and does not require anything from His creation to sustain Himself. It also serves as a reminder of humanity's role as stewards rather than owners of the earth.<p><b>and the fullness thereof</b><br>The term "fullness" refers to everything that the world contains, including its resources, creatures, and inhabitants. This comprehensive view of God's ownership extends to all aspects of creation, reinforcing the idea that nothing is outside of His control or possession. Theologically, this speaks to God's providence and the abundance of His creation, which He provides for His creatures. This concept is also reflected in the New Testament, where Jesus is described as the one through whom all things were created and in whom all things hold together (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>). The fullness of the world is a testament to God's creative power and His ongoing involvement in the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this Psalm, emphasizing His sovereignty and self-sufficiency.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The primary audience of the Psalm, representing God's chosen people who are being reminded of His greatness and their relationship with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The attributed author of the Psalm, a Levite and one of David's chief musicians, who conveys God's message to the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>Often referenced in Psalms as the spiritual center of God's presence and His covenant with Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Represents all of creation, which belongs to God, underscoring His ownership and authority over everything.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_ownership.htm">God's Sovereignty and Ownership</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the ultimate owner of all creation.
