The rebellion against God's Spirit is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, highlighting the Israelites' frequent resistance to divine guidance (<a href="/numbers/20-10.htm">Numbers 20:10-13</a>). The Spirit of God is often associated with His presence and guidance, as seen in the pillar of cloud and fire that led the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>). This rebellion can be seen as a rejection of God's authority and a failure to trust in His provision and promises. The rebellion at Meribah, where the people quarreled with Moses and doubted God's ability to provide water, is a specific instance of this broader pattern of disobedience (<a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>).<p><b>and Moses spoke rashly with his lips</b><br>Moses, the leader chosen by God to deliver His people, succumbed to frustration and anger, leading him to speak rashly. This incident is recorded in <a href="/numbers/20-10.htm">Numbers 20:10-12</a>, where Moses, instead of speaking to the rock as God commanded, struck it twice with his staff. His words, "Listen, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?" reflect a moment of human weakness and a lapse in faith, as he took credit for the miracle instead of attributing it to God. This act of disobedience resulted in severe consequences for Moses, as he was not permitted to enter the Promised Land. This serves as a sobering reminder of the importance of obedience and humility before God. Moses' experience is a type of Christ, who, unlike Moses, perfectly obeyed the Father and spoke only what He was commanded (<a href="/john/12-49.htm">John 12:49-50</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.

Moses, being provoked, made his rash utterance (<a href="/numbers/20-10.htm">Numbers 20:10</a>). He was vexed, impatient, carried away by a gust of passion, and made the unfitting speech, "Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of the rock?" speaking as if the power were his own. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/106-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they rebelled against</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(him&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4784.htm">Strong's 4784: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be contentious or rebellious</span><br /><br /><span class="word">His Spirit,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#363;&#183;&#7717;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7307.htm">Strong's 7307: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wind, breath, exhalation, life, anger, unsubstantiality, a region of the sky, spirit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and [Moses] spoke rashly</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1437;&#1497;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1461;&#1431;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7687;a&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_981.htm">Strong's 981: </a> </span><span class="str2">To babble, to vociferate angrily</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with his lips.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1469;&#1497;&#1493;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#347;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - fdc &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8193.htm">Strong's 8193: </a> </span><span class="str2">The lip, language, a margin</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/psalms/106-33.htm">Psalm 106:33 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/psalms/106-33.htm">Psalm 106:33 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/psalms/106-33.htm">Psalm 106:33 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/psalms/106-33.htm">Psalm 106:33 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/psalms/106-33.htm">Psalm 106:33 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/psalms/106-33.htm">Psalm 106:33  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/psalms/106-33.htm">Psalm 106:33 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/psalms/106-33.htm">Psalm 106:33 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/psalms/106-33.htm">Psalm 106:33 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/psalms/106-33.htm">Psalm 106:33 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/psalms/106-33.htm">OT Poetry: Psalm 106:33 Because they were rebellious against his spirit (Psalm Ps Psa.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/psalms/106-32.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Psalm 106:32"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 106:32" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/psalms/106-34.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Psalm 106:34"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 106:34" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
