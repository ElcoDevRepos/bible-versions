In biblical context, hearing is often associated with understanding and responding (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, "Hear, O Israel"). The inability of idols to hear emphasizes their lifelessness and futility. This is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where the prophets often mock the senselessness of idol worship (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/44-18.htm">Isaiah 44:18-20</a>). The phrase also serves as a warning against spiritual deafness, urging believers to be attentive to God's voice, as seen in Jesus' teachings (e.g., <a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>, "He who has ears, let him hear").<p><b>they have noses, but cannot smell;</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the sense of smell was associated with the acceptance of sacrifices. The inability of idols to smell signifies their incapacity to engage in a relationship with worshippers or to accept offerings. This contrasts with the God of Israel, who is described as being pleased with the aroma of sacrifices (e.g., <a href="/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>, "The LORD smelled the pleasing aroma"). The phrase underscores the futility of idol worship and the superiority of worshipping a living God who interacts with His creation. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to be a "fragrant offering" to God (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>), symbolizing a life pleasing to Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/115.htm">Psalm 115</a>, traditionally attributed to David or another Israelite leader, who contrasts the living God with lifeless idols.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>The focus of this verse, representing man-made objects of worship that are powerless and senseless.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the Psalm is addressed, often tempted by idolatry and called to worship the one true God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pagan_nations.htm">Pagan Nations</a></b><br>Surrounding cultures that worshipped idols, influencing Israel and providing a backdrop for the Psalmist's warnings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_worship.htm">Temple Worship</a></b><br>The context in which the Psalm would be sung, emphasizing the worship of Yahweh over idols.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_idolatry.htm">The Futility of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idols are powerless and senseless, unable to respond to human needs.

The living God &#8220;smelled the pleasing aroma&#8221; of Noah&#8217;s sacrifice (<a href="/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>) and responded with covenant grace.
