It echoes the sentiments found in <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>, which Jesus quotes on the cross, highlighting a moment of deep distress and perceived divine abandonment. Historically, this reflects the trials faced by David, who often felt pursued by enemies and isolated. Theologically, it underscores the testing of faith and the human experience of feeling distant from God, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture.<p><b>pursue him and seize him,</b><br>This part of the verse captures the aggressive intent of the psalmist's enemies. In the historical context of David's life, he was frequently pursued by King Saul and later by his own son Absalom. The language of pursuit and capture is reminiscent of military tactics in ancient Israel, where enemies would relentlessly chase their targets. This phrase also typifies the spiritual warfare believers face, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where the forces of evil seek to capture and destroy the faithful.<p><b>for there is no one to rescue him.&#8221;</b><br>The assertion that there is no one to rescue the psalmist highlights a moment of vulnerability and desperation. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, community and kinship were vital for protection and support. The absence of a rescuer implies a complete isolation, which is a powerful image of despair. This phrase can be seen as a type of Christ, who, during His crucifixion, was seemingly abandoned and without rescue, fulfilling the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. It also points to the ultimate reliance on God as the true deliverer, as seen in the eventual vindication and deliverance of the psalmist in the broader context of the Psalm.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/71.htm">Psalm 71</a>, traditionally attributed to David, who is expressing a plea for God's protection and deliverance in the face of adversaries.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/adversaries.htm">Adversaries</a></b><br>The unnamed enemies who are speaking against the psalmist, claiming that God has abandoned him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure whom the psalmist trusts for deliverance and protection, despite the claims of his enemies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_presence.htm">Trust in God's Presence</a></b><br>Despite the claims of adversaries, believers can trust that God has not forsaken them.

Throughout Scripture the Lord repeatedly promises, &#8220;I will never leave you nor forsake you&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>), and &#8220;Even if my father and mother forsake me, the LORD will receive me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/27-10.htm">Psalm 27:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Suffering can look like abandonment, yet the psalmist knows God&#8217;s faithfulness &#8220;from my youth&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/71-5.htm">Psalm 71:5&#8211;6</a>). Enemies misread hardship as divine rejection, but Job&#8217;s story (<a href="/job/2-9.htm">Job 2:9&#8211;10</a>) shows that adversity does not equal abandonment.<p>&#8226; Jesus Himself endured the mockery, &#8220;He trusts in God; let God rescue Him&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/27-43.htm">Matthew 27:43</a>), modeling how the righteous are sometimes thought forsaken while actually being upheld by the Father (<a href="/john/16-32.htm">John 16:32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>pursue him and seize him</b><p>&#8226; Believing the Lord has stepped away, adversaries feel emboldened to hunt the psalmist down, echoing, &#8220;The wicked watches the righteous and seeks to slay him&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/37-32.htm">Psalm 37:32</a>).<p>&#8226; David experienced this when Saul &#8220;pursued him every day, yet God did not deliver David into his hand&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>). The Lord&#8217;s hidden presence still guarded His servant.<p>&#8226; New-covenant believers face a similar dynamic: &#8220;Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>), yet God sets limits (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>) and works deliverance in His time (<a href="/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; Key takeaway: hostile pursuit does not mean God&#8217;s absence; it often becomes the stage for God&#8217;s protective intervention (<a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for there is no one to rescue him</b><p>&#8226; The enemies conclude the psalmist is isolated, but &#8220;God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Elijah felt alone&#8212;&#8220;I am the only one left&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/19-14.htm">1 Kings 19:14</a>)&#8212;yet the Lord had preserved thousands and personally sustained him. Spiritual isolation is frequently more perception than reality.<p>&#8226; Scripture counters the lie of helplessness: &#8220;Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him from them all&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>). Even a final enemy like death bows to the Rescuer who &#8220;has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and He will deliver us again&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-10.htm">2 Corinthians 1:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers today lean on the same promise voiced in <a href="/psalms/91-14.htm">Psalm 91:14&#8211;15</a>&#8212;&#8220;Because he loves Me&#8230; I will rescue him and honor him.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/71-11.htm">Psalm 71:11</a> records the scorn of foes who interpret the psalmist&#8217;s trials as evidence that God has abandoned him. Their three-part accusation&#8212;God has forsaken, enemies may pursue, no rescuer remains&#8212;exposes a worldview where power triumphs when divine protection seems absent. Scripture answers each charge: God never forsakes His people, hostile pursuit is bounded by His sovereignty, and He always remains the unfailing Deliverer. The verse therefore highlights not God&#8217;s withdrawal but the false confidence of the wicked, underscoring the believer&#8217;s assurance that the Lord&#8217;s steadfast presence endures in every crisis.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/71.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him.</span> Compare the words of Ahithophel, "Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue alter David this night; and I will come upon him while he is <span class="accented">weary and weak handed</span>; and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only" (<a href="/2_samuel/17-1.htm">2 Samuel 17:1, 2</a>).
