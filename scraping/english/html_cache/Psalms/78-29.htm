God provided manna and quail to satisfy their hunger, demonstrating His provision and care. The miraculous feeding is a testament to God's ability to meet the physical needs of His people. This event is recorded in <a href="/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a> and <a href="/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11</a>, where God responds to the Israelites' complaints about the lack of food. The phrase "well filled" indicates not just sufficiency but abundance, highlighting God's generosity. This provision prefigures the feeding of the 5,000 by Jesus in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>), where He also provides abundantly for the physical needs of the people, pointing to His divine nature and compassion.<p><b>for He gave them what they craved</b><br>This part of the verse underscores God's response to the Israelites' desires, even when those desires were driven by discontent and lack of faith. The craving for meat, as opposed to the manna God initially provided, reflects a deeper spiritual issue of ingratitude and rebellion against God's plan. In <a href="/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4-6</a>, the Israelites express their longing for the food they had in Egypt, showing a lack of trust in God's provision. This craving led to God's judgment, as seen in <a href="/numbers/11-31.htm">Numbers 11:31-34</a>, where the quail brought a plague upon those who ate greedily. This serves as a warning about the dangers of coveting and the consequences of prioritizing fleshly desires over spiritual obedience. Theologically, it points to the human tendency to seek satisfaction outside of God's will, a theme echoed in <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>, which discusses the progression from desire to sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and wandered in the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert area where the Israelites wandered for 40 years after their exodus from Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>The miraculous supply of food (manna and quail) provided by God to sustain the Israelites in the wilderness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/q/quail.htm">Quail</a></b><br>The birds that God sent to the Israelites in response to their craving for meat, as described in the context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_human_desire.htm">God's Provision and Human Desire</a></b><br>God is faithful to provide for our needs, but we must be cautious of our desires.

The phrase opens with the simple fact that the people actually ate the food God sent&#8212;quail in this case (<a href="/numbers/11-31.htm">Numbers 11:31-32</a>). Their eating was not symbolic; it was a literal meal provided by the LORD, just as He had earlier supplied manna (<a href="/exodus/16-13.htm">Exodus 16:13-15</a>). By emphasizing &#8220;they ate,&#8221; the psalm reminds us:<p>&#8226; God meets concrete, practical needs&#8212;not merely spiritual ones (<a href="/psalms/104-27.htm">Psalm 104:27-28</a>).<p>&#8226; His provisions arrive precisely when and where He decrees (<a href="/exodus/16-35.htm">Exodus 16:35</a>).<p>This same God still sees every genuine need of His people today (<a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31-33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and were well filled</b><p>The supply was abundant, not rationed. <a href="/numbers/11-32.htm">Numbers 11:32</a> notes that each person gathered at least ten homers of quail&#8212;far more than enough. The wording &#8220;well filled&#8221; underscores:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s generosity exceeds basic survival; He delights to satisfy fully (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1, 5</a>).<p>&#8226; Nothing is too hard for Him, whether sustaining millions in a desert or feeding thousands with a few loaves and fish (<a href="/john/6-11.htm">John 6:11-13</a>).<p>Yet abundance can become a test: will the people respond with gratitude or with entitlement? (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for He gave them</b><p>The psalmist points directly to the Giver. Israel did not stumble upon a natural windfall; &#8220;He gave&#8221; stresses divine initiative. Cross references reinforce this truth:<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>&#8212;&#8220;I will rain down bread from heaven for you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/105-40.htm">Psalm 105:40</a>&#8212;&#8220;They asked, and He brought quail.&#8221;<p>God&#8217;s hand is both the source and the security of every blessing (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). Recognizing Him as Giver leads to worship rather than presumption (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-17.htm">Deuteronomy 8:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what they craved</b><p>Here the tone turns sober. The people&#8217;s craving was self-focused, expressed with complaint (<a href="/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4-6</a>). God granted the request, but <a href="/psalms/106-15.htm">Psalm 106:15</a> warns, &#8220;He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.&#8221; Lessons surface:<p>&#8226; God may permit what we insist on, even when it is not best (<a href="/1_samuel/8-19.htm">1 Samuel 8:19-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Craving without submission can bring discipline instead of delight (<a href="/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33-34</a>).<p>&#8226; True satisfaction is found not in the gift but in the Giver (<a href="/psalms/37-4.htm">Psalm 37:4</a>; <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/78-29.htm">Psalm 78:29</a> records a literal event that doubles as a timeless mirror. God faithfully provided an overflowing feast of quail; Israel literally ate and was stuffed. Yet the same verse hints at the danger of unchecked craving. The Lord&#8217;s provision is lavish, but when hearts fixate on the gift rather than the Giver, abundance can harden rather than humble. Receiving with gratitude and obedience turns every provision into a fresh reminder of His steadfast love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/78.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Desire.</span>--See <a href="/numbers/11-34.htm" title="And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.">Numbers 11:34</a>, margin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/78.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So they did eat, and were well filled;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> sated (comp. <a href="/numbers/11-19.htm">Numbers 11:19, 20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For he gave them their own desire;</span> or, <span class="accented">their own lust</span> - <span class="accented">that they lusted after</span> (Revised Version). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/78-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So they ate</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1499;&#1456;&#1500;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
