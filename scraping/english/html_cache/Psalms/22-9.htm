It reflects the belief that God is the creator and sustainer of life, a theme consistent throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8-12</a>, <a href="/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>). The psalmist's recognition of God's role in his birth underscores a deep trust in God's providence and care. This can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the incarnation of Christ, who was brought forth into the world by divine intervention, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>.<p><b>You made me secure at my mother&#8217;s breast.</b><br>This phrase highlights the nurturing and protective care provided by God, akin to the safety and nourishment a child receives from its mother. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the bond between a mother and her nursing child was a powerful symbol of trust and dependence. This imagery is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe God's care for His people (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a>, <a href="/hosea/11-4.htm">Hosea 11:4</a>). The security mentioned here can also be seen as a type of Christ's reliance on the Father during His earthly life, emphasizing His humanity and the fulfillment of His role as the suffering servant, as depicted in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, David is expressing a deep sense of trust and reliance on God from his earliest moments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as the one who brings life and provides security and care from birth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mother.htm">Mother</a></b><br>Represents the nurturing and protective environment God provides, symbolized through the imagery of a mother&#8217;s care.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/womb.htm">Womb</a></b><br>A metaphor for the beginning of life, emphasizing God&#8217;s role in creation and sustenance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/breast.htm">Breast</a></b><br>Symbolizes nourishment and safety, highlighting God&#8217;s provision and care from the earliest stages of life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_creation.htm">God&#8217;s Sovereignty in Creation</a></b><br>Recognize that God is intimately involved in our lives from the very beginning.

This echoes <a href="/psalms/71-6.htm">Psalm 71:6</a>, &#8220;From birth I have relied on You; You brought me forth from my mother&#8217;s womb.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;Yet&#8221; signals a turn from the surrounding distress of <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> to confidence in God&#8217;s past faithfulness. Even in the midst of the prophetic suffering described in verses 1-8&#8212;fulfilled ultimately in Christ (<a href="/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>)&#8212;David remembers God&#8217;s sovereign care at his first breath.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently affirms God&#8217;s involvement in every conception and birth (<a href="/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8-12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/46-3.htm">Isaiah 46:3</a>). Life is sacred because God Himself fashions it.<p>&#8226; For the believer, this verse encourages a settled assurance: if God has been personally involved since the womb, He will not abandon His child now (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You made me secure at my mother&#8217;s breast</b><p>&#8220;You made me secure at my mother&#8217;s breast&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/22-9.htm">Psalm 22:9</a>)<p>&#8226; The picture shifts from birth to infancy. Safety, nourishment, and comfort&#8212;all come from the Lord, even while an infant rests in its mother&#8217;s arms. Compare <a href="/isaiah/66-12.htm">Isaiah 66:12-13</a>, where God promises, &#8220;You will nurse and be carried on her arm&#8230; As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s confidence parallels the calm trust of <a href="/psalms/131-2.htm">Psalm 131:2</a>&#8212;&#8220;I have calmed and quieted my soul like a weaned child with its mother.&#8221; God not only initiates life but sustains it with tender, parental care.<p>&#8226; This security is not merely physical; it foreshadows spiritual nurture. Just as a baby instinctively trusts its mother, believers are called to depend wholly on God&#8217;s provision (<a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-34</a>).<p>&#8226; Because God made the psalmist &#8220;secure,&#8221; fear gives way to peace. The eternal arms are &#8220;underneath&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-27.htm">Deuteronomy 33:27</a>), and that truth remains unshaken when trials come.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/22-9.htm">Psalm 22:9</a> reminds us that God&#8217;s personal care began before we could utter a word.
