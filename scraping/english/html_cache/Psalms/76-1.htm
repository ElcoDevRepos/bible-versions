The role of the choirmaster was crucial in organizing and leading the musical aspects of worship, which were an integral part of Israelite religious life.<p><b>With stringed instruments.</b><br>The use of stringed instruments suggests a rich musical tradition in ancient Israel. Instruments like the harp and lyre were commonly used in temple worship, enhancing the emotional and spiritual experience of the psalm.<p><b>A Psalm of Asaph.</b><br>Asaph was one of David's chief musicians, and several psalms are attributed to him or his descendants. This attribution connects the psalm to a tradition of Levitical musicianship and prophetic insight, as Asaph was known for both.<p><b>A song.</b><br>This designation emphasizes the psalm's lyrical and musical nature, meant to be sung as part of worship. It highlights the importance of music in expressing theological truths and communal identity.<p><b>God is known in Judah;</b><br>Judah, the southern kingdom, was the center of worship with Jerusalem as its capital. This phrase underscores the special revelation and relationship God had with Judah, where His presence was most intimately experienced in the temple.<p><b>His name is great in Israel.</b><br>The name of God represents His character and deeds.

God values ordered, public praise; He appointed such leaders in David&#8217;s day (see <a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16, 25</a>:1). Placing this psalm in the choirmaster&#8217;s care signals that its message about God&#8217;s greatness is meant for the gathered people, not private devotion alone (cf. <a href="/psalms/4-1.htm">Psalm 4:1</a>; 5:1; 45:1).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With stringed instruments.</b><p>Worship here is accompanied by lyres and harps, instruments long associated with rejoicing before the LORD (<a href="/psalms/33-2.htm">Psalm 33:2</a>; 81:2; 150:3-4). Music engages both mind and heart, underscoring that God deserves beautiful, skillful praise (<a href="/1_samuel/16-23.htm">1 Samuel 16:23</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>). The psalmist wants every strum to echo the truth soon declared: God is known and His name is great.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A Psalm of Asaph.</b><p>Asaph, a Levite appointed by David (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-17.htm">1 Chronicles 15:17-19</a>), penned many psalms that celebrate God&#8217;s power and justice (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-30.htm">2 Chronicles 29:30</a>). His role as a worship leader lends weight to the theme; he writes from inside the sanctuary, testifying to what he has seen God do for His covenant people (<a href="/nehemiah/12-46.htm">Nehemiah 12:46</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A song.</b><p>Calling it a &#8220;song&#8221; signals congregational participation. Like <a href="/bsb/psalms/48.htm">Psalm 48</a> or <a href="/bsb/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46</a>, this piece invites Israel to sing aloud the reality of God&#8217;s reputation. It is theology set to melody so the truth will lodge in memory (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-19.htm">Deuteronomy 31:19-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God is known in Judah</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Known&#8221; is experiential: the tribe of Judah houses Jerusalem, the ark, and later the temple (<a href="/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8-10</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-9</a>).<p>&#8226; The LORD made His dwelling there&#8212;&#8220;I will dwell among the Israelites&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45</a>).<p>&#8226; Historic acts&#8212;from the plagues to victories like against Sennacherib (<a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>)&#8212;proved His presence.<p>In short, anyone looking at Judah&#8217;s history could see a God who intervenes, protects, and reveals Himself (<a href="/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His name is great in Israel</b><p>&#8226; Name points to character and fame (<a href="/exodus/34-5.htm">Exodus 34:5-7</a>). Within the whole nation, His reputation stands unrivaled.<p>&#8226; Moses declared, &#8220;What nation has a god so near?&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>). Samuel echoed, &#8220;The LORD will not forsake His people for His great name&#8217;s sake&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/12-22.htm">1 Samuel 12:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The psalm celebrates that from Dan to Beersheba every tribe can recount mighty works: Red Sea crossing, Jordan River piling up, Jericho&#8217;s walls falling (<a href="/psalms/98-2.htm">Psalm 98:2-3</a>; 99:3).<p>The verse assures worshipers that the God who is personally &#8220;known&#8221; in Judah is publicly &#8220;great&#8221; throughout Israel, inviting trust and joyful praise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/76-1.htm">Psalm 76:1</a> declares that the covenant God has unmistakably revealed Himself among His people. Entrusted to the choirmaster, set to strings, authored by Asaph, and meant for congregational singing, the verse proclaims two parallel truths: Judah has experienced God&#8217;s nearness, and all Israel recognizes His unrivaled greatness. The history of salvation has etched His name in national memory, calling every believer to confident, wholehearted worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/76.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Judah . . .
