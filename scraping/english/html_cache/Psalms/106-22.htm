The "wondrous works" allude to the miraculous events God performed during the Israelites' time in Egypt, particularly the ten plagues. These plagues demonstrated God's power over the Egyptian gods and were a direct challenge to Pharaoh's authority. The plagues served as a means of liberation for the Israelites, showcasing God's faithfulness to His covenant with Abraham. This phrase connects to the broader narrative of the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing deliverance and redemption. The miracles in Egypt prefigure the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who frees believers from the bondage of sin.<p><b>and awesome deeds by the Red Sea</b><br>The "awesome deeds by the Red Sea" refer to the parting of the Red Sea, a pivotal miracle in the Exodus story. This event is recorded in <a href="/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>, where God parted the waters to allow the Israelites to escape from the pursuing Egyptian army. The crossing of the Red Sea is a powerful demonstration of God's sovereignty and protection over His people. It is a testament to His ability to make a way where there seems to be none, reinforcing the theme of divine deliverance. The Red Sea crossing is often seen as a type of baptism, symbolizing the believer's passage from death to life, from slavery to freedom. This event is frequently referenced throughout Scripture as a reminder of God's mighty acts and His faithfulness to His promises, serving as an encouragement for believers to trust in God's power and provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_ham.htm">The Land of Ham</a></b><br>Refers to Egypt, as Ham is traditionally considered the ancestor of the Egyptians.
