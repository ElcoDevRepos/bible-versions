The "house of the LORD" is the temple in Jerusalem, which was the focal point of Jewish religious life. Standing in the temple signifies a position of service and worship, highlighting the role of the priests as mediators between God and the people. This service is a precursor to the New Testament understanding of believers as a "royal priesthood" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), serving God through Christ. The temple itself is a type of Christ, who referred to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), indicating that He is the ultimate meeting place between God and humanity.<p><b>in the courts of the house of our God</b><br>The "courts" refer to the various sections within the temple complex, including the Court of the Gentiles, the Court of Women, and the Court of Israel. These areas were designated for different groups, reflecting the structure and order of worship in ancient Israel. The phrase emphasizes the accessibility of God's presence to those who are called to serve Him. The courts were places of gathering, teaching, and prayer, symbolizing the communal aspect of worship. This setting foreshadows the gathering of believers in the New Testament church, where all are invited to draw near to God through Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>). The temple courts also remind us of the future promise of God's dwelling with His people in the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>), where there will be no temple because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_lord.htm">The House of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship for the Israelites where God's presence was believed to dwell.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_courts_of_the_house_of_our_god.htm">The Courts of the House of our God</a></b><br>These are the outer areas of the temple where worshippers, including priests and Levites, would gather to perform their duties and offer sacrifices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests_and_levites.htm">Priests and Levites</a></b><br>The individuals who served in the temple, responsible for maintaining the worship practices and rituals as prescribed in the Law of Moses.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_privilege_of_service.htm">The Privilege of Service</a></b><br>Serving in the house of the Lord is a high calling and privilege.
