In the context of ancient Israel, such language often described the experience of being besieged by enemies or facing overwhelming odds. The psalmist's use of "pushed" suggests external forces or adversaries, which could be literal enemies or metaphorical challenges. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where God's people face trials, such as in <a href="/psalms/3.htm">Psalm 3:1-2</a>, where David speaks of his many foes. The idea of falling indicates a near-defeat or collapse, a common theme in the Psalms where the psalmist often finds themselves in dire situations, only to be delivered by divine intervention.<p><b>but the LORD helped me</b><br>This phrase highlights the intervention of God as a deliverer and protector. The use of "the LORD" (Yahweh) emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and His people, underscoring His faithfulness and power to save. This divine assistance is a recurring theme throughout the Psalms, where God is depicted as a refuge and strength (<a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>). The help of the LORD is not just a physical rescue but also a spiritual and emotional support, reinforcing the idea that God is intimately involved in the lives of His followers. This phrase can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate help provided through Jesus Christ, who delivers believers from sin and death, as seen in the New Testament (<a

described being &#8220;surrounded &#8230; like bees&#8221; and &#8220;consumed as burning thorns&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10-12</a>). The pressure is relentless&#8212;an intentional, forceful shove meant to unseat him.<p>&#8226; Similar moments of hostile pressure appear throughout Scripture:<p>&#8211; &#8220;Many a time they have persecuted me from my youth, yet they have not prevailed&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/129-2.htm">Psalm 129:2</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8220;We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8-9</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8220;When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD will lift up a standard against him&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that hardship is no accident; it is the normal experience of God&#8217;s people in a fallen world. Yet the adversity does not get the last word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I was falling</b><p>&#8226; The resistance worked&#8212;he was &#8220;falling.&#8221; The language pictures feet slipping out from under him, echoing &#8220;If I say, &#8216;My foot is slipping,&#8217; Your loving devotion, O LORD, supports me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/94-18.htm">Psalm 94:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often shows saints on the brink:<p>&#8211; &#8220;But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled; my steps nearly slipped&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8220;I am about to fall, and my pain is ever with me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/38-17.htm">Psalm 38:17</a>).<p>&#8226; These moments expose human frailty.
