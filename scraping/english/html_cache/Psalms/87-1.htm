Despite Korah's rebellion, his descendants were spared and became prominent in temple worship (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-31.htm">1 Chronicles 6:31-38</a>). This background highlights themes of redemption and grace, as God used the descendants of a rebel to lead in worship. The Psalms attributed to them often focus on the majesty of God and the beauty of His dwelling place.<p><b>A song.</b><br>This designation indicates that the Psalm was intended to be sung, reflecting its use in worship and liturgical settings. Songs in ancient Israel were a means of teaching theology, expressing communal identity, and reinforcing cultural values. The musical aspect underscores the joy and celebration associated with the themes of the Psalm.<p><b>He has founded His city on the holy mountains.</b><br>The "city" refers to Jerusalem, often called Zion, which holds a central place in biblical theology as the chosen dwelling place of God (<a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13-14</a>). The "holy mountains" emphasize the city's divine selection and sanctity. Geographically, Jerusalem is situated on a series of hills, with Mount Zion being one of the most significant. This location is not only strategic but also symbolic of God's protection and presence. Theologically, the founding of the city on holy mountains signifies God's sovereign choice and the establishment of His kingdom on earth. This phrase also connects to prophecies about the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>), symbolizing the ultimate fulfillment of God's plan for His people. The mountains can be seen as types of Christ, representing strength, stability, and the place where God meets humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion (Jerusalem)</a></b><br>The city of God, often referred to as the holy mountain, is central to this verse.

Though Korah perished for rebellion (<a href="/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31-33</a>), his offspring were preserved (<a href="/numbers/26-11.htm">Numbers 26:11</a>) and later served in the house of the LORD.<p>&#8226; By attaching their name to the psalm, the writers humbly acknowledge that God redeems and re-commissions even the line of a fallen ancestor&#8212;proof that His mercy endures forever (<a href="/psalms/103-17.htm">Psalm 103:17</a>).<p>&#8226; This backdrop prepares us to hear the psalm as worship led by servants who know firsthand the seriousness of sin and the wonder of forgiveness (<a href="/psalms/42-4.htm">Psalm 42:4</a>; 84:1-2).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A song</b><p>&#8226; The label signals a piece designed to be sung, not merely recited. Melody helps truth settle into the heart (<a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Calling it a &#8220;song&#8221; underscores joy. The psalm that follows celebrates Zion&#8217;s glory and God&#8217;s global plan; naturally it bursts into music.<p>&#8226; By preserving the musical notation, Scripture reminds today&#8217;s believers that worship is both doctrinal and doxological&#8212;truth married to delight (<a href="/psalms/33-1.htm">Psalm 33:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He has founded His city on the holy mountains</b><p>&#8226; The declarative &#8220;He has founded&#8221; points to God Himself as the architect of Zion.

Of all places, He chose that ridge of hills to set His Name (<a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13-14</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/6-6.htm">2 Chronicles 6:6</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;On the holy mountains&#8221; highlights separation and stability:<p>&#8209; Mountains convey permanence (<a href="/psalms/125-1.htm">Psalm 125:1-2</a>), portraying God&#8217;s unshakable covenant with His people (<a href="/isaiah/54-10.htm">Isaiah 54:10</a>).<p>&#8209; &#8220;Holy&#8221; marks the site as set apart for God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>). Holiness is not merely moral purity but distinctiveness&#8212;God dwelling with men.<p>&#8226; The statement also anticipates a broader fulfillment. <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a> speaks of &#8220;Mount Zion&#8230;the heavenly Jerusalem,&#8221; and <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a> shows the city&#8217;s ultimate unveiling. The earthly Zion foreshadows the eternal dwelling God is preparing for all who are in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the foundation is the LORD&#8217;s doing, assurance flows to every believer. What God establishes, no power can overturn (<a href="/psalms/46-4.htm">Psalm 46:4-5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/87-1.htm">Psalm 87:1</a> anchors hope in the God who sovereignly chose, founded, and sanctified Zion.
