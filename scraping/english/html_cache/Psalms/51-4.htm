David acknowledges that his sin, though it affected others, is ultimately an offense against God Himself. This reflects the biblical understanding that all sin is a violation of God's holy law (<a href="/genesis/39-9.htm">Genesis 39:9</a>, when Joseph resists Potiphar's wife, he states that sinning would be against God). The repetition of "You" underscores the gravity of the offense and the personal relationship between the sinner and God. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, sin was not just a legal or social issue but a spiritual one, affecting one's covenant relationship with God.<p><b>and done what is evil in Your sight</b><br>David recognizes that his actions are not just mistakes or errors in judgment but are inherently evil. This aligns with the biblical teaching that God is the ultimate judge of what is right and wrong (<a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>). The phrase "in Your sight" indicates that God's perspective is the ultimate standard, and nothing is hidden from Him (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). This acknowledgment of evil in God's sight is crucial for genuine repentance, as it aligns the sinner's view with God's view of sin.<p><b>so that You may be proved right when You speak</b><br>Here, David admits that God's judgments are just and righteous. This echoes the theme found in <a href="/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>, where Paul quotes this verse to affirm God's truthfulness and justice. The phrase suggests that God's declarations and judgments are vindicated by the acknowledgment of sin. In the historical context, this reflects the understanding that God's words and actions are always consistent with His character, and human acknowledgment of sin serves to affirm His righteousness.<p><b>and blameless when You judge</b><br>David concludes by affirming God's blamelessness in His judgments. This is a recognition of God's perfect justice and fairness (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>). In the cultural and historical context of the ancient Near East, kings and judges were often seen as representatives of divine justice. However, unlike human judges, God's judgments are without error or partiality. This phrase underscores the belief that God's judgments are not only right but also beyond reproach, serving as a model for human justice systems.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>, King David wrote this psalm as a confession after being confronted by the prophet Nathan regarding his sin with Bathsheba.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure to whom David is confessing his sin, acknowledging God's righteousness and justice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan_the_prophet.htm">Nathan the Prophet</a></b><br>The prophet who confronted David about his sin, leading to David's repentance and the writing of this psalm.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The woman with whom David committed adultery, which is the sin he is confessing in this psalm.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/uriah_the_hittite.htm">Uriah the Hittite</a></b><br>Bathsheba's husband, whom David had killed to cover up his sin, further compounding his guilt.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledgment_of_sin.htm">Acknowledgment of Sin</a></b><br>True repentance begins with acknowledging our sin against God.

Though he betrayed Bathsheba, Uriah, and his nation (<a href="/bsb/2_samuel/11.htm">2 Samuel 11</a>), he acknowledges that sin is ultimately an offense against God Himself.<p>&#8226; Scripture echoes this priority: Joseph resisted temptation because &#8220;How then could I do this great wickedness and sin against God?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/39-9.htm">Genesis 39:9</a>). The prodigal son rehearsed, &#8220;Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you&#8221; (<a href="/luke/15-18.htm">Luke 15:18&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; When we grasp that every transgression strikes at God&#8217;s holiness, repentance becomes heartfelt, not merely horizontal damage control.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and done what is evil in Your sight</b><p>&#8226; David calls the act &#8220;evil,&#8221; not a lapse, mistake, or weakness. He aligns his evaluation with God&#8217;s, refusing to soften the verdict (<a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s &#8220;sight&#8221; reminds us that nothing is hidden (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). Sin exposed by Nathan (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>) had long been open to the Lord.<p>&#8226; Honest confession means seeing our deeds the way God sees them, anchoring our moral compass to His unchanging character (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that You may be proved right when You speak</b><p>&#8226; David&#8217;s confession vindicates God&#8217;s word of judgment delivered through Nathan: &#8220;You are the man!&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>).<p>&#8226; By agreeing with God, David affirms the righteousness of divine warnings such as <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>&#8212;&#8220;All His ways are justice.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Our willingness to admit guilt showcases God&#8217;s truthfulness (<a href="/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>). Each confession testifies that the Lord&#8217;s assessments are flawless.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and blameless when You judge</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s verdict against sin stands unassailable. David submits to the coming consequences&#8212;the child&#8217;s death, national upheaval&#8212;without accusing God of unfairness (<a href="/psalms/119-75.htm">Psalm 119:75</a>).<p>&#8226; This posture anticipates the final judgment where every mouth will be silenced (<a href="/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19</a>).<p>&#8226; When we humble ourselves, we declare that God&#8217;s justice is perfect, yet we lean on His mercy displayed later at the cross (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a> shows genuine repentance: recognizing sin as chiefly against God, naming it for what it is, justifying God&#8217;s verdict, and submitting to His righteous judgment. Such confession opens the door to cleansing (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>) and restores fellowship with the One whose holiness we honor and whose mercy we trust.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/51.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Against thee, thee only . . .</span>--This can refer to nothing but a breach of the covenant-relation by the nation at large. An individual would have felt his guilt against the nation or other individuals, as well as against Jehovah. The fact that St. Paul quotes (from the LXX.) part of the verse in <a href="/romans/3-4.htm" title="God forbid: yes, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That you might be justified in your sayings, and might overcome when you are judged.">Romans 3:4</a> (see Note, <span class= "ital">New Testament Commentary</span>) has naturally opened up an avenue for discussion on the bearing of the words on the doctrines of free-will and predestination. But the immediate object of his quotation appears to be to contrast the <span class= "ital">faithfulness </span>of the God of the covenant with the <span class= "ital">falsehood </span>of the covenant people ("Let God be true, and every man a liar"). The honour of God, as God of the covenant, was at stake. It is this thought which appears in the last clauses of this verse.<p><span class= "bld">That . . .</span>--<span class= "ital">So that </span>(or, <span class= "ital">in order that</span>)<span class= "ital"> thou art </span>(or <span class= "ital">mayest be</span>)<span class= "ital"> justified in thy cause, and clear in thy judgment. </span>The Hebrew, rendered in the Authorised Version <span class= "ital">when thou speakest, </span>is often used of a cause or suit (see (<a href="/context/exodus/18-16.htm" title="When they have a matter, they come to me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.">Exodus 18:16-22</a>, "matter," &c), and it is here plainly used in this sense and is parallel to judgment. The clause seems to imply not only a sense of <span class= "bld">a </span>breach of the covenant, but some manifest judgment from Jehovah in consequence; and, as usual, it is of its effect on the heathen that the psalmist thinks. The Divine honour would be justified when the suffering nation confessed that condemnation and punishment had been deserved. This was apparently the meaning read in the words by the LXX.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Against thee, thee only, have I sinned</span>. Though no sins could be more directly against man than adultery and murder, yet David feels that that aspect of them shrinks away into insignificance, and is as if it were not, when they are viewed in their true and real character, as offences against the majesty of God. Every sin is mainly against God; and the better sort of men always feel this. "How can I do this great wickedness," says Joseph, when tempted by Potiphar's wife, "<span class="accented">and sin against God</span>?" And so David to Nathan, when he was first rebuked by him, "I have sinned <span class="accented">against the Lord"</span> (<a href="/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And done this evil in thy sight;
