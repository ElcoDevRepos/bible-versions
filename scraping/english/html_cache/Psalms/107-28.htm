Throughout the Old Testament, crying out to the LORD is a common response to distress, seen in the lives of figures like Moses (<a href="/exodus/15-25.htm">Exodus 15:25</a>) and David (<a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>). The act of crying out signifies a recognition of human limitation and a dependence on God's power. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, calling upon the LORD was an acknowledgment of His sovereignty and covenant relationship with His people. This cry is not just a plea for help but an act of faith, trusting that God hears and responds to His people.<p><b>and He brought them out of their distress</b><br>This phrase underscores God's faithfulness and ability to deliver. The deliverance from distress is a central theme in the Psalms and reflects God's role as a redeemer. Historically, this can be connected to the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, a foundational event that shaped their identity as God's chosen people (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>). Theologically, this deliverance prefigures the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ, who delivers humanity from the bondage of sin (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13-14</a>). The phrase also emphasizes God's compassion and mercy, as He responds to the cries of His people, bringing them relief and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is faithful to deliver His people when they call upon Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_distressed_people.htm">The Distressed People</a></b><br>The psalm speaks of those who find themselves in dire situations, often due to their own actions, and who turn to God for help.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea</a></b><br>While not explicitly mentioned in this verse, the context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/107.htm">Psalm 107</a> includes imagery of sailors in a storm, representing life's tumultuous challenges.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/deliverance.htm">Deliverance</a></b><br>The act of God rescuing His people from their troubles, a recurring theme throughout the psalm.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/crying_out.htm">Crying Out</a></b><br>The act of prayer and supplication, a sincere plea for divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer.htm">The Power of Prayer</a></b><br>When in distress, our first response should be to cry out to God.
