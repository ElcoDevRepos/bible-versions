In the context of the Exodus, it refers to the miraculous acts God performed to free the Israelites from Egyptian bondage. The "mighty hand" symbolizes divine intervention and authority, often associated with God's ability to perform wonders and execute judgment. This imagery is consistent throughout the Old Testament, where God's hand is depicted as a source of deliverance and protection (<a href="/exodus/3-19.htm">Exodus 3:19-20</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>).<p><b>and an outstretched arm</b><br>The "outstretched arm" further illustrates God's active involvement in the salvation of His people. It conveys the idea of God reaching out to rescue and support His chosen ones. This expression is used in various passages to describe God's readiness to act on behalf of Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/32-21.htm">Jeremiah 32:21</a>). The imagery of an outstretched arm also foreshadows the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who extends His grace and salvation to all humanity.<p><b>His loving devotion endures forever</b><br>This phrase highlights the central theme of <a href="/psalms/136.htm">Psalm 136</a>, which is the enduring and steadfast love of God. The Hebrew word "hesed" is often translated as "loving devotion" or "steadfast love," and it signifies God's covenantal faithfulness and mercy. This refrain is repeated throughout the psalm, underscoring the eternal nature of God's love and commitment to His people. It connects to the New Testament revelation of God's love through Christ (<a href="/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38-39</a>), affirming that His love is unchanging and everlasting.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, demonstrating His power and enduring love through His actions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of God's mighty acts, particularly in the context of their deliverance from Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place of bondage from which God delivered the Israelites, showcasing His power and faithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, often associated with God's mighty hand and outstretched arm.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/exodus.htm">Exodus</a></b><br>The event of deliverance from Egypt, symbolizing God's intervention and faithfulness to His covenant people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_power_in_deliverance.htm">God's Power in Deliverance</a></b><br>God's "mighty hand and outstretched arm" symbolize His unparalleled power and authority.
