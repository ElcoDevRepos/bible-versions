It reflects the biblical theme of God's kingship, seen throughout the Psalms and the Old Testament. The phrase echoes the enthronement psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/47.htm">Psalm 47, 95</a>-99) and affirms God's ultimate authority, contrasting with earthly rulers. It also anticipates the New Testament revelation of Christ as King of Kings (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>).<p><b>He is robed in majesty;</b><br>The imagery of God being "robed in majesty" conveys His splendor and glory. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, a king's robe symbolized his power and status. This phrase highlights God's divine nature and the honor due to Him. It parallels descriptions of Christ's transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>) and His glorious return (<a href="/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13-16</a>).<p><b>the LORD has clothed and armed Himself with strength.</b><br>This emphasizes God's omnipotence and readiness to act. The clothing and arming with strength suggest preparation for battle, reflecting God's role as a divine warrior who protects and delivers His people. This is seen in the Exodus narrative (<a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>) and in Christ's victory over sin and death (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>).<p><b>The world indeed is firmly established;</b><br>This phrase underscores the stability and order of creation, attributed to God's sovereign will. It reflects the Genesis creation account, where God brings order out of chaos (Genesis 1). The stability of the world is a testament to God's faithful governance and is echoed in the New Testament assurance of Christ sustaining all things (<a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>).<p><b>it cannot be moved.</b><br>This affirms the permanence and reliability of God's creation, symbolizing His unchanging nature. It reassures believers of God's steadfastness and the security found in Him. This immovability is echoed in the promise of an unshakeable kingdom through Christ (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>) and the eternal nature of God's word (<a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing the sovereign God of Israel, who reigns over all creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Refers to the earth and all of creation, which is firmly established by God's power and authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The LORD's reign is absolute and unchallenged.
