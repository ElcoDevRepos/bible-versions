In the historical context of ancient Israel, kings often represented the pinnacle of earthly power and authority. Binding them with chains symbolizes the subjugation of those who oppose God's will. This imagery is reminiscent of the fate of defeated kings in the ancient Near East, where captured rulers were often paraded in chains as a sign of victory. Biblically, this can be connected to the prophetic visions in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>, where God's kingdom crushes all other kingdoms, and <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>, where Christ returns as the conquering King. The binding of kings also foreshadows the ultimate defeat of Satan and his forces, as seen in <a href="/revelation/20.htm">Revelation 20:1-3</a>, where Satan is bound for a thousand years.<p><b>and their nobles with shackles of iron</b><br>Nobles, as the ruling class, were often seen as the enforcers of a king's decrees and policies. Binding them with shackles of iron signifies the complete overthrow of oppressive systems and the establishment of God's justice. Iron, being a strong and durable metal, emphasizes the permanence and strength of this divine judgment. This imagery can be linked to the Psalms' frequent theme of God as the defender of the oppressed and the bringer of justice (<a href="/psalms/72-4.htm">Psalm 72:4</a>, <a href="/psalms/82-3.htm">Psalm 82:3-4</a>). The use of iron shackles also echoes the biblical narrative of God's deliverance of His people from bondage, as seen in the Exodus story, where God liberates the Israelites from Egyptian slavery. In a typological sense, this deliverance prefigures Christ's redemptive work, freeing humanity from the bondage of sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings_and_nobles.htm">Kings and Nobles</a></b><br>These represent the earthly rulers and authorities who often stand in opposition to God's will and His people.

Even royal captives were thus treated in the ancient world. Assyrian and Babylonian monarchs always represent their captives, even when kings, as fettered. Nebuchadnezzar "bound Zedekiah with fetters of brass" (<a href="/2_kings/25-7.htm">2 Kings 25:7</a>). Parthia, and later Persia, and even Rome, followed the same practice. And their nobles with fetters of iron. On the monuments, cap-fives below the rank of kings are not often seen "fettered." Their arms, however, are frequently tied together with a cord, and they are fastened one to another by a stout rope. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/149-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">to bind</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1462;&#1488;&#1456;&#1505;&#1465;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(le&#8217;&#183;s&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
