In the context of <a href="/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David speaks of his deliverance from his enemies, attributing it to his righteousness. This righteousness is not self-proclaimed but is seen in light of his covenant relationship with God. The concept of righteousness in the Old Testament often involves living in accordance with God's laws and commands. This phrase can be connected to other scriptures such as <a href="/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22</a>, where David's song of deliverance is also recorded, and to the broader biblical theme of God rewarding the faithful, as seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/11-18.htm">Proverbs 11:18</a> and <a href="/matthew/5-6.htm">Matthew 5:6</a>.<p><b>according to the cleanness of my hands</b><br>The imagery of "clean hands" is symbolic of innocence and purity in actions. In ancient Israel, ritual cleanliness was a significant aspect of worship and daily life, as seen in the Levitical laws. This phrase suggests that David's actions were free from guilt or wrongdoing, particularly in the context of his conflicts with Saul and other adversaries. The idea of clean hands is echoed in <a href="/psalms/24-4.htm">Psalm 24:4</a>, which describes those who may stand in God's holy place as having clean hands and a pure heart. This concept is also seen in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to live blamelessly (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>).<p><b>in His sight</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that the evaluation of righteousness and cleanness is ultimately determined by God, who sees and knows all. It underscores the belief that God's judgment is based on His perfect knowledge and understanding, rather than human perception. The idea of living "in His sight" is a call to integrity and accountability before God, who is omniscient. This aligns with the biblical teaching that God examines the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>) and that nothing is hidden from His sight (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). It also points to the ultimate judgment where God will assess each person's life (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David is expressing gratitude and recognition of God's deliverance and justice in his life.
