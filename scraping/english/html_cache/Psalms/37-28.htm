Throughout the Bible, God's love for justice is a recurring theme, seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/61-8.htm">Isaiah 61:8</a>, where God declares His love for justice and His hatred for robbery and wrongdoing. The Hebrew word for justice, "mishpat," implies fairness and the right ordering of society according to God's standards. This reflects God's character and His desire for His people to live in a way that mirrors His justice. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, justice was not merely a legal concept but a divine mandate that governed social and religious life.<p><b>and will not forsake His saints.</b><br>The term "saints" refers to those who are set apart for God, often translated from the Hebrew word "chasidim," meaning faithful ones or godly people. This assurance of God's faithfulness to His people is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>, where God promises never to leave nor forsake His people. The historical context of Israel's covenant relationship with God underscores this promise, as God consistently demonstrated His faithfulness despite Israel's frequent unfaithfulness. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament promise in <a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>, where believers are assured of God's constant presence.<p><b>They are preserved forever,</b><br>This promise of eternal preservation highlights the security of those who belong to God. The concept of being preserved forever is not only a promise of physical protection but also spiritual security, as seen in <a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28-29</a>, where Jesus speaks of giving eternal life to His followers, ensuring that no one can snatch them from His hand. This eternal perspective is crucial in understanding the biblical narrative of redemption and the ultimate hope of resurrection and eternal life with God.<p><b>but the offspring of the wicked will be cut off.</b><br>This phrase contrasts the fate of the wicked with that of the righteous. The "offspring of the wicked" can be understood both literally and metaphorically, referring to the descendants of those who live in opposition to God's ways and the continuation of their wickedness. The idea of being "cut off" is a common biblical expression for judgment and destruction, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/34-16.htm">Psalm 34:16</a>, where the face of the LORD is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth. This serves as a warning of the consequences of living contrary to God's justice and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature. He is the central figure in this verse, highlighting His love for justice and faithfulness to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_saints.htm">His Saints</a></b><br>Refers to the faithful followers of God, those who are set apart for His purposes. In the Hebrew context, this term often denotes those who are in a covenant relationship with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Represents those who live in opposition to God's ways.
