In biblical times, ropes or cords were often used to bind or capture, symbolizing a lack of freedom and impending doom. The psalmist's use of "ropes of death" indicates a profound sense of being overwhelmed by mortal peril. This can be connected to other scriptures such as <a href="/psalms/18-4.htm">Psalm 18:4-5</a>, where similar imagery is used to describe being surrounded by death. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who faced the ultimate entanglement of death on the cross, yet overcame it through His resurrection.<p><b>the anguish of Sheol overcame me;</b><br>Sheol in the Hebrew Bible is often understood as the realm of the dead, a place of darkness and separation from the living. The term "anguish" here conveys intense emotional and spiritual distress. In the ancient Near Eastern context, Sheol was not just a physical place but also a state of being cut off from God's presence. This phrase reflects the psalmist's deep despair and fear of death. It can be compared to Jonah's experience in <a href="/jonah/2-2.htm">Jonah 2:2</a>, where he cries out from the depths of Sheol. Theologically, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's descent into the grave, where He experienced separation from the Father but ultimately triumphed over death.<p><b>I was confronted by trouble and sorrow.</b><br>This phrase highlights the personal and immediate nature of the psalmist's suffering. "Trouble and sorrow" encompass both external afflictions and internal emotional turmoil. In the historical context, such expressions of lament were common in the Psalms, reflecting the human condition and the struggles faced by the faithful. This can be linked to the broader biblical theme of suffering and deliverance, as seen in Job's trials or the lamentations of Jeremiah. In the New Testament, Jesus Himself is described as a "man of sorrows" in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, identifying with human suffering and providing comfort through His own experiences of trouble and sorrow.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of the psalm, traditionally believed to be King David, who often wrote about his personal experiences with distress and deliverance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a></b><br>Personified as having ropes or cords, symbolizing the inescapable grip and power it holds over life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheol.htm">Sheol</a></b><br>In Hebrew thought, the realm of the dead, often depicted as a place of darkness and separation from God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/trouble_and_sorrow.htm">Trouble and Sorrow</a></b><br>Represents the emotional and spiritual turmoil faced by the psalmist, indicative of life's trials and tribulations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_reality_of_death_and_suffering.htm">Understanding the Reality of Death and Suffering</a></b><br>Recognize that the Bible does not shy away from the reality of death and suffering.

He is not exaggerating; he believes he was on the brink of death.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/18-4.htm">Psalm 18:4-5</a>, &#8220;The cords of death encompassed me&#8230;,&#8221; echoes the same experience, underscoring how real and terrifying such moments can be for God&#8217;s people.<p>&#8226; We see in <a href="/jonah/2-5.htm">Jonah 2:5-6</a> another servant of the Lord describing watery &#8220;bars&#8221; closing in while sinking&#8212;different circumstances, same sense of unavoidable danger.<p>&#8226; In each case, the physical peril drives the believer to cling to God as the only Deliverer, reinforcing the truth of <a href="/psalms/116-1.htm">Psalm 116:1-2</a> that the Lord &#8220;heard my voice.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the anguish of Sheol overcame me</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Sheol&#8221; refers to the realm of the dead. The psalmist feels its shadow pressing in, as if the grave is already laying claim to him.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/30-3.htm">Psalm 30:3</a> celebrates rescue from this very brink: &#8220;You brought me up from Sheol, O LORD; You spared me from descending into the Pit.&#8221;<p>&#8226; For New Testament believers, Christ&#8217;s victory over death fulfills the hope hinted at here (<a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14-15</a>). The psalmist&#8217;s near-death deliverance previews our ultimate deliverance through Jesus.<p>&#8226; The anguish is emotional and spiritual as well as physical; facing death exposes every heart-level fear and forces a choice: despair or trust.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I was confronted by trouble and sorrow</b><p>&#8226; The trial is comprehensive&#8212;external &#8220;trouble&#8221; and internal &#8220;sorrow.&#8221; Nothing feels secure.<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/3-24.htm">Job 3:24-26</a> offers a similar testimony of crushing grief. Yet, like the psalmist, Job eventually confesses God&#8217;s faithfulness.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8-10</a> shows Paul describing a sentence of death that taught him &#8220;not to rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.&#8221; The pattern is consistent: God allows overwhelming distress to spotlight His power to save.<p>&#8226; For the believer today, this verse invites a frank acknowledgment of our own crises and a deliberate pivot to the Lord who hears, just as He did for the psalmist.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/116-3.htm">Psalm 116:3</a> records a genuine brush with death that thrust the writer into spiritual, physical, and emotional crisis. Like cords tightening, death drew near; like a wave, Sheol&#8217;s terror swept over him; like an enemy, trouble and sorrow blocked every escape. Yet these pressures became the stage for God&#8217;s deliverance, reinforcing His character as the One who answers when His people call. Our takeaway: when death or any lesser threat closes in, we can trust the same Lord who rescued the psalmist, confident He still saves all who rely on Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/116.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">The pains of hell.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">oppressions of Sheol, </span>if we retain the text.
