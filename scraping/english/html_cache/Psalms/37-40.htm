Throughout the Old Testament, God is depicted as a deliverer, as seen in the Exodus narrative where He delivers the Israelites from Egyptian bondage (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>). The Hebrew word for "helps" (&#1506;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1512;, 'azar) implies assistance and support, indicating God's ongoing involvement in the believer's life. The concept of deliverance is central to the Psalms, reflecting God's power to save His people from physical and spiritual threats. This deliverance is not just a past event but a continual promise, as seen in the lives of figures like David, who experienced God's deliverance from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>).<p><b>He rescues and saves them from the wicked,</b><br>The wicked are often portrayed in the Psalms as those who oppose God's people and His ways. This phrase reassures believers of God's protection against such adversaries. The terms "rescues" and "saves" suggest a divine intervention that is both immediate and eternal. In the historical context, this could refer to deliverance from literal enemies, such as foreign nations or internal oppressors. Spiritually, it points to salvation from sin and evil influences. The ultimate rescue and salvation are fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who delivers believers from the power of sin and death (<a href="/romans/7-24.htm">Romans 7:24-25</a>).<p><b>because they take refuge in Him.</b><br>Taking refuge in God is a recurring theme in the Psalms, symbolizing trust and reliance on His protection and provision. The imagery of God as a refuge is akin to a fortress or a stronghold, offering safety and security (<a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>). This act of taking refuge is a conscious decision to trust in God's sovereignty and goodness, often in the face of adversity. It reflects a covenant relationship where God promises to be the protector of those who seek Him. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to find their security in Christ, who is described as a cornerstone and a foundation (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal, self-existent nature and His faithfulness to His promises.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>Those who trust in the LORD and live according to His ways, often contrasted with the wicked in the Psalms.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Individuals who oppose God and His people, often characterized by their unrighteous actions and intentions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/refuge.htm">Refuge</a></b><br>A place of safety and protection, symbolizing trust and reliance on God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/deliverance.htm">Deliverance</a></b><br>The act of being rescued or saved, often used in the context of God saving His people from danger or oppression.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_deliverance.htm">Trust in God's Deliverance</a></b><br>Believers are called to trust in God's ability to deliver them from trials and adversities.
