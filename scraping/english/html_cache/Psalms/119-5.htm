The psalmist acknowledges human frailty and the tendency to stray from God's path. This sentiment echoes the biblical theme of repentance and the need for divine guidance, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which emphasizes trusting in the Lord and not relying on one's own understanding. The use of "ways" suggests a comprehensive lifestyle, indicating that the psalmist seeks total dedication to God's direction.<p><b>to keeping Your statutes!</b><br>"Statutes" refers to the decrees or laws given by God, often associated with the Torah, the first five books of the Bible. The psalmist's desire to keep these statutes highlights the importance of obedience and reverence for God's commandments. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1-9</a>, where the Israelites are instructed to love the Lord and keep His commandments diligently. The longing to keep God's statutes also points to the transformative power of God's Word, which is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who perfectly kept the law and enables believers to live righteously through the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, though the exact authorship is uncertain.
