Biblically, lying is condemned as it goes against the nature of God, who is truth (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The context of this psalm suggests a time of moral decline, possibly during David's reign when he faced betrayal and falsehood from those around him. The act of lying is often associated with the influence of Satan, the "father of lies" (<a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>), indicating a spiritual battle against truth.<p><b>they speak with flattering lips</b><br>Flattery is insincere praise, often used to manipulate or gain favor. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, flattery was a common tactic in political and social interactions, but it was viewed negatively in the biblical context. <a href="/proverbs/26-28.htm">Proverbs 26:28</a> warns against the dangers of a flattering mouth, as it can lead to ruin. Flattery contrasts with the biblical call for honesty and integrity in speech (<a href="/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25</a>). This behavior reflects a heart not aligned with God's truth, as genuine love and respect do not require deceitful words.<p><b>and a double heart.</b><br>A "double heart" suggests duplicity and inconsistency in one's intentions and actions. Biblically, a divided heart is unstable and untrustworthy (<a href="/james/1-8.htm">James 1:8</a>). This phrase implies a lack of sincerity and commitment to truth, as individuals may present one face while harboring different motives. The call for a pure heart is echoed throughout scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>, where David asks God to create a clean heart within him. A double heart is contrary to the wholehearted devotion God desires from His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/12.htm">Psalm 12</a>, David is expressing his lament over the deceitfulness and corruption he observes in society.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_faithful.htm">The Faithful</a></b><br>The psalm contrasts the faithful, who are disappearing, with the deceitful, who are prevalent.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Those who speak with flattering lips and a double heart, representing the moral decay in society.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and protector of the faithful, who hears the cries of the oppressed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oppressed.htm">The Oppressed</a></b><br>Those who suffer under the deceit and lies of the wicked, whom God promises to protect.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_deceitful_speech.htm">The Danger of Deceitful Speech</a></b><br>Deceitful speech is a reflection of a corrupt heart.
