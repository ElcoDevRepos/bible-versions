In the context of the Psalms, it often refers to the trials faced by Israel, such as military defeat, exile, or divine judgment. Historically, Israel experienced numerous periods of hardship, including the Babylonian exile, which serves as a backdrop for many lament psalms. This phrase underscores the reality of suffering even for those who are in a covenant relationship with God, highlighting the mystery of divine providence and the testing of faith.<p><b>though we have not forgotten You</b><br>The assertion of not forgetting God indicates a maintained faithfulness and remembrance of God's laws and deeds. In the Old Testament, forgetting God often led to idolatry and sin (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11-14</a>). This phrase suggests a plea of innocence, where the people claim to have remained true to their worship and acknowledgment of God. It reflects a deep sense of confusion and distress, as the people do not understand why they suffer despite their faithfulness.<p><b>or betrayed Your covenant</b><br>The covenant refers to the solemn agreement between God and Israel, established through figures like Abraham, Moses, and David. Betraying the covenant would involve idolatry, disobedience, or moral failure. This phrase emphasizes the people's commitment to uphold their part of the covenant, which included following the Law and worshiping Yahweh alone. Theologically, it raises questions about the nature of suffering and divine justice, as the people assert their innocence. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who also suffered despite being sinless, fulfilling the ultimate covenant through His sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_korah.htm">The Sons of Korah</a></b><br>The authors of <a href="/bsb/psalms/44.htm">Psalm 44</a>, a group of Levitical singers and musicians who served in the temple.

There are not many periods of Israelite history at which such a description could have been given without manifest untruth, and the time of David is certainly more suitable for it than almost any other. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant</span>. Israel had neither put aside the thought of religion, and given herself up to wordliness, nor yet, while still professedly religious, transgressed habitually God's commandments. She maintained "thorough sincerity in religion, and consistent integrity of life." Yet "all this" - all that has been described in vers. 9-16 - had come upon her. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/44-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2063.htm">Strong's 2063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hereby in it, likewise, the one other, same, she, so much, such deed, that, </span><br /><br /><span class="word">has come upon us,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1453;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#8217;a&#7791;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular &#124;
