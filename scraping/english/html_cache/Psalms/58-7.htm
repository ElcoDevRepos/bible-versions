In the arid climate of ancient Israel, water was a precious resource, and its rapid disappearance would be a familiar sight. The psalmist is invoking a curse upon the wicked, desiring that their influence and power dissipate quickly and without effect. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where water symbolizes transience and futility (e.g., <a href="/job/14-11.htm">Job 14:11</a>). Theologically, it reflects the belief in divine justice, where the wicked will ultimately face consequences for their actions.<p><b>when they draw the bow,</b><br>The act of drawing a bow is a metaphor for preparing to attack or cause harm. In ancient warfare, the bow was a common weapon, and its use here symbolizes the readiness and intent of the wicked to inflict damage. This imagery is found throughout the Psalms and other biblical texts, often representing the threats and dangers faced by the righteous (e.g., <a href="/psalms/11-2.htm">Psalm 11:2</a>). The psalmist's plea is for divine intervention to thwart these hostile intentions.<p><b>may their arrows be blunted.</b><br>Blunted arrows are ineffective and unable to penetrate or cause harm. This request for the arrows of the wicked to be blunted is a call for their plans and attacks to fail. In a broader biblical context, this reflects the theme of God protecting the righteous and ensuring that the schemes of the wicked do not succeed (e.g., <a href="/psalms/37-15.htm">Psalm 37:15</a>). Theologically, it underscores the belief in God's sovereignty and His ability to render the efforts of the wicked futile. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, in His ultimate victory, renders the power of sin and death ineffective for those who trust in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of this psalm, David is expressing a plea for divine justice against the wicked.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>The psalm addresses those who are unjust and corrupt, often seen as oppressors or enemies of righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and deliverer, to whom David appeals for justice and vindication.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bow_and_arrows.htm">The Bow and Arrows</a></b><br>Symbolic of the power and threats of the wicked, which David prays will be rendered ineffective.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/water.htm">Water</a></b><br>Used metaphorically to describe the fleeting and ineffective nature of the wicked's plans when God intervenes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>Trust in God's ultimate justice, even when human systems fail.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer.htm">The Power of Prayer</a></b><br>David's prayer is a model for seeking God's intervention against evil.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_wickedness.htm">The Futility of Wickedness</a></b><br>The plans of the wicked are ultimately ineffective against God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Recognize the spiritual battle and rely on God's strength to blunt the enemy's attacks.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_timing.htm">Faith in God's Timing</a></b><br>Be patient and trust that God will act in His perfect timing to bring justice.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_58_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 58:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_58_7_Trust_God_s_justice_in_trials.htm">How can Psalm 58:7 inspire us to trust God's justice in adversity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Fate_of_wicked_in_flow_away_like_water.htm">What does "flow away like water" teach about the fate of the wicked?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_58_7_and_Romans_12_19_link.htm">How does Psalm 58:7 connect with Romans 12:19 on vengeance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_use_Psalm_58_7_in_prayer.htm">In what ways can we apply Psalm 58:7 to our prayer life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_58_7_s_impact_on_faith_in_judgment.htm">How does understanding Psalm 58:7 deepen our faith in God's righteous judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_58_7_on_God_s_justice_judgment.htm">What does Psalm 58:7 reveal about God's justice and judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_58_7_and_divine_retribution.htm">How does Psalm 58:7 align with the concept of divine retribution?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_vivid_imagery_in_Psalm_58_7.htm">Why does Psalm 58:7 use vivid imagery to describe the fate of the wicked?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_58.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 58?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_does_psalm_58_6_invoke_violence.htm">Why does David, in Psalm 58, invoke violent divine judgment (verse 6) when other passages emphasize mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/psalm_87_7__how_are_all_'springs'_in_zion.htm">Psalm 87:7 - In what sense are all 'springs' in Zion, given that historically rivers and water sources are not exclusive to Jerusalem?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_is_god_both_loving_and_vengeful.htm">How can Psalm 64:7's portrayal of God shooting enemies with arrows be reconciled with a God described as loving in other scriptures?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_steadfastness.htm">What defines being steadfast and unmovable?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 58:7 Mean</div><b>May they vanish like water that runs off</b><p>&#8226;

The first of these compares him to water, which, spilt on a sandy soil, sinks into it and melts away. (Comp. <a href="/2_samuel/14-14.htm" title="For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither does God respect any person: yet does he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.">2Samuel 14:14</a>.) Perhaps a phenomenon, often described by travellers, was in the poet's mind, the disappearance of a stream which, after accompanying the track for some time, suddenly sinks into the sand. The words <span class= "ital">which run continually, </span>even if the Hebrew can bear this meaning, only weaken the figure. The verb is in the reflexive conjugation, and has "to" or "for themselves" added, and seems to be exactly equivalent to our, <span class= "ital">they walk themselves off. </span>This certainly should be joined to the clause following. Here, too, we must suppose that the sign of comparison, <span class= "ital">khemo, </span>was dropped out by the copyist in consequence of the <span class= "ital">l?mo</span> just written, and afterwards being inserted in the margin, got misplaced. We must bring it back, and read:<p>They are utterly gone, as when<p>One shoots his arrows.<p>This figure thus becomes also clear and striking. The arrow once shot is irrevocably gone, probably lost, fit emblem of the fate of the wicked. For the ellipse in <span class= "ital">bend </span>(literally, <span class= "ital">tread, </span>see <a href="/psalms/7-12.htm" title="If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he has bent his bow, and made it ready.">Psalm 7:12</a>), comp. <a href="/psalms/64-3.htm" title="Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words:">Psalm 64:3</a>, where also the action properly belonging to the <span class= "ital">bow </span>is transferred to the <span class= "ital">arrow.</span><p>The words, "Let them be as cut in pieces," must be carried on to the following verse, which contains two fresh images: <span class= "ital">So they are cut off </span>(LXX., "are weak ") <span class= "ital">as shabl-l melts; </span>(<span class= "ital">as</span>)<span class= "ital"> the abortion of a woman passes away without seeing the sun. </span>The word <span class= "ital">shabl-l, </span>by its derivation (<span class= "ital">b?lal = to pour out</span>) may mean any <span class= "ital">liquid </span>or <span class= "ital">moist </span>substance. Hence some understand <span class= "ital">a watercourse, </span>others (LXX. and Vulg.) <span class= "ital">wax. </span>The first would weaken the passage by introducing a bald repetition of a previous image. The second is quite intelligible. But the Talmud says <span class= "ital">shabl-l </span>is a <span class= "ital">slug </span>or <span class= "ital">shelless snail, </span>and there may be a reference in the passage to the popular notion derived from the slimy track of the creature, that the slug dissolves as it moves, and eventually melts away. Dr. Tristram, however (<span class= "ital">Nat. Hist. Bib., </span>p. 295), finds scientific support for the image in the myriads of snail shells found in the Holy Land, still adhering, by the calcareous exudation round the orifice, to the surface of the rock, while the animal itself is utterly shrivelled and wasted. The last image presents no difficulty either in language or form, except that the form of the noun <span class= "ital">woman </span>is unusual.<p><span class= "bld">That they may not.</span>--That this refers to the abortion which <span class= "ital">passed away without seeing the sun, </span>is certain. The grammatical difficulty of want of concord may be got over by taking <span class= "ital">abortion </span>as a collective noun. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/58.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let them melt away as waters which run continually;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "let them waste away, and go to naught, like water, that runs off and accomplishes nothing."
