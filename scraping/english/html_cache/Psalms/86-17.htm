In biblical times, signs were often sought as confirmation of God's favor or presence, as seen in Gideon's request for a sign in <a href="/judges/6-36.htm">Judges 6:36-40</a>. The psalmist's request for a sign of goodness underscores a deep reliance on God's benevolence and faithfulness, echoing the covenantal promises made to Israel. It also points to the human desire for tangible evidence of God's care, which is fulfilled ultimately in the person of Jesus Christ, who is the embodiment of God's goodness and grace.<p><b>that my enemies may see and be ashamed</b><br>The psalmist desires not only personal reassurance but also a public vindication that would cause adversaries to recognize God's power and justice. This reflects the cultural context of honor and shame prevalent in ancient Near Eastern societies, where public perception was crucial. The theme of enemies being put to shame is recurrent in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/25-2.htm">Psalm 25:2-3</a>) and highlights the belief that God's intervention would lead to the defeat and humiliation of those who oppose His people. This anticipates the ultimate victory over spiritual enemies through Christ's resurrection.<p><b>for You, O LORD, have helped me and comforted me</b><br>The psalmist acknowledges past experiences of God's help and comfort, which serve as a foundation for present faith and future hope. This reflects a common biblical pattern of recalling God's past faithfulness as a basis for trust in current trials, as seen in the narratives of the Exodus and the Psalms. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and His people. The dual mention of help and comfort points to God's comprehensive care, which is fully realized in the New Testament through the Holy Spirit, referred to as the Comforter in <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/86.htm">Psalm 86</a>, David is seeking God's intervention and assurance in the face of his adversaries.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The unspecified adversaries of David, representing those who oppose the righteous.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His faithfulness and relationship with His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_assurance_from_god.htm">Seeking Assurance from God</a></b><br>David's request for a sign of God's goodness is a model for believers to seek divine assurance in times of trouble.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>The verse emphasizes God's role as a helper and comforter, encouraging believers to trust in His faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witness_to_others.htm">Witness to Others</a></b><br>The desire for enemies to see and be ashamed suggests that God's work in our lives can serve as a testimony to others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_in_adversity.htm">Prayer in Adversity</a></b><br>David's prayer demonstrates the importance of turning to God in difficult times, seeking His intervention and comfort.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/confidence_in_god's_character.htm">Confidence in God's Character</a></b><br>The verse reflects confidence in God's character, encouraging believers to rely on His goodness and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_86_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 86:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_86_17_Trust_God_s_power_over_foes.htm">How does Psalm 86:17 encourage trust in God's power over adversaries?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_sign_of_goodness_show.htm">What does "a sign of Your goodness" reveal about God's character?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_86_17_Confidence_in_trials.htm">How can Psalm 86:17 inspire confidence during personal trials and challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Psalm_86_17_to_God_s_faithfulness.htm">Connect Psalm 86:17 with another verse showing God's faithfulness to His servants.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_do_believers_find_God_s_signs_today.htm">How can believers today seek and recognize God's signs of goodness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_86_17_s_context_in_David_s_life.htm">What is the historical context of Psalm 86:17 in David's life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_86_17_God_s_favor_signs.htm">How does Psalm 86:17 demonstrate God's power to provide signs of favor?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_86_17_s_reassurance_for_believers.htm">What theological significance does Psalm 86:17 hold for believers seeking reassurance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_86.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 86?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_reconcile_david's_faith_with_history.htm">How do we reconcile David's confidence in divine intervention (Psalm 5:3, 8) with known historical conflicts where God's protection was not apparent?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_reconcile_psalm_115_17_with_afterlife.htm">Psalm 115:17 -- If the dead cannot praise the Lord, how do we address biblical passages suggesting continued consciousness or spiritual existence after death?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_does_god_swear_by_himself.htm">If God is omnipotent, why does He need to swear by Himself to carry out judgment (Amos 6:8)?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_is_god_loving_yet_jealous.htm">In Nahum 1:2, how can God be both loving and yet described as jealous and avenging?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 86:17 Mean</div><b>Show me a sign of Your goodness</b><p>&#8226; David longs for a clear, tangible marker that God is actively for him.

Every believer can look to the cross and the empty tomb as the decisive sign, yet we may still pray for daily tokens&#8212;opened doors, unexpected provisions, quiet assurances&#8212;remembering that &#8220;every good and perfect gift is from above&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that my enemies may see and be ashamed</b><p>&#8226; The prayer moves from private assurance to public vindication. David wants God&#8217;s intervention to silence opposition, much like &#8220;None who wait for You will be put to shame, but those who are treacherous&#8230; will be&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/25-3.htm">Psalm 25:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Shame here is redemptive: it exposes rebels to truth so they might repent (<a href="/psalms/83-16.htm">Psalm 83:16-18</a>). When God defends His people, scoffers are &#8220;ashamed and confounded&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/35-26.htm">Psalm 35:26</a>), and even in the New Testament &#8220;those who slander your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/3-16.htm">1 Peter 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers are not told to retaliate; we trust God&#8217;s justice: &#8220;Vengeance is Mine; I will repay&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).

Rehearsing God&#8217;s track record keeps our petitions from unbelief; we are simply asking the Helper to be Himself once more.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/13-6.htm">Hebrews 13:6</a> applies the same logic: &#8220;So we say with confidence: &#8216;The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.&#8217;&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and comforted me</b><p>&#8226; God does more than rescue; He soothes the wounds. &#8220;Even though I walk through the valley&#8230; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>).<p>&#8226; His Word is a steady balm: &#8220;This is my comfort in affliction, for Your promise preserves my life&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/119-50.htm">Psalm 119:50</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah opens with &#8220;Comfort, comfort My people&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>), and Paul blesses &#8220;the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3-4</a>).
