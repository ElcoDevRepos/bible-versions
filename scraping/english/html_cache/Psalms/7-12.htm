In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word for repentance, "shuv," means to turn back or return. This concept is echoed in the New Testament with the Greek word "metanoia," meaning a change of mind or heart. The call to repentance is a consistent message from the prophets (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/55-7.htm">Isaiah 55:7</a>) and is central to the teachings of Jesus (e.g., <a href="/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>). The lack of repentance is often associated with judgment and consequences, as seen in the stories of Israel's disobedience and exile.<p><b>God will sharpen His sword</b><br>The imagery of God sharpening His sword is a metaphor for impending judgment. In ancient times, a sharpened sword was a symbol of readiness for battle or execution of justice. This phrase reflects God's role as a righteous judge who is prepared to act against sin. Similar imagery is found in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41</a>, where God speaks of sharpening His sword against His adversaries. The sword is often used in Scripture to symbolize divine judgment and the power of God's word (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p><b>He has bent and strung His bow</b><br>The bow and arrow are frequently used in the Bible as symbols of God's judgment and wrath. The bending and stringing of a bow indicate preparation for action, suggesting that God is ready to execute justice. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages, such as <a href="/lamentations/2-4.htm">Lamentations 2:4</a> and <a href="/habakkuk/3-9.htm">Habakkuk 3:9</a>, where God's bow is depicted as a tool of judgment against the wicked. The bow also serves as a reminder of God's covenant with humanity, as seen in <a href="/genesis/9-13.htm">Genesis 9:13</a>, where the rainbow is a sign of God's promise not to destroy the earth with a flood again. In this context, the bow represents both judgment and the faithfulness of God to uphold His covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/7.htm">Psalm 7</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who often wrote psalms during times of distress and seeking God's justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine judge who is depicted as preparing for judgment against the unrepentant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_david.htm">Enemies of David</a></b><br>While not explicitly mentioned in this verse, the context of the psalm involves David's plea for deliverance from his enemies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/imagery_of_warfare.htm">Imagery of Warfare</a></b><br>The verse uses imagery of God as a warrior preparing for battle, symbolizing divine judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/repentance.htm">Repentance</a></b><br>The act of turning away from sin and seeking God's forgiveness, which is central to the message of this verse.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_repentance.htm">The Necessity of Repentance</a></b><br>Repentance is crucial to avoid God's judgment.

Repentance is not merely feeling sorry but changing direction, agreeing with God about the seriousness of wrongdoing, and embracing His way (<a href="/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30&#8211;32</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently presents repentance as the dividing line between mercy and judgment (<a href="/luke/13-3.htm">Luke 13:3</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>). David&#8217;s wording assumes God&#8217;s call has already gone out; the remaining issue is human response.<p>&#8226; Because Scripture is both accurate and authoritative, we read this warning as a literal declaration of what God will do if that call is ignored.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God will sharpen His sword</b><p>&#8226; The imagery shifts to a sword&#8212;a clear picture of decisive, personal judgment. A sword must be whetted before battle; God is shown actively preparing to execute justice (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The action is deliberate, not impulsive. Divine patience does not mean indifference; if repentance is withheld, judgment will certainly arrive (<a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, the same picture assures us that evil will not go unanswered. God&#8217;s justice, though sometimes delayed, is never denied.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He has bent and strung His bow</b><p>&#8226; A bent bow with string drawn tight signals judgment that is imminent, already in position to strike (<a href="/lamentations/2-4.htm">Lamentations 2:4</a>; <a href="/job/16-13.htm">Job 16:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Unlike the sword, which must close distance, the bow can reach swiftly and unexpectedly. The combined images teach that God can judge both near and far, in His perfect timing and manner (<a href="/habakkuk/3-9.htm">Habakkuk 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The tense&#8212;&#8220;has bent&#8221;&#8212;emphasizes readiness. Nothing more is required before release; refusal to repent leaves the sinner directly in the line of fire.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/7-12.htm">Psalm 7:12</a> sets a straightforward progression: refusal to repent invites God&#8217;s active, ready, and inevitable judgment. The sword is sharpened, the bow is drawn&#8212;imagery underscoring that divine justice is poised and certain. God&#8217;s patience offers space for repentance; His holiness guarantees consequences if that space is spurned.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">If he turn not.</span>--The Hebrew is doubly idiomatic.
