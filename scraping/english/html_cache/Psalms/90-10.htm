It acknowledges the brevity of human life compared to the eternal nature of God. In biblical times, reaching seventy years was considered a full life, as seen in the lives of patriarchs like Abraham and Isaac, who lived much longer, indicating a decline in lifespan post-flood.<p><b>or eighty if we are strong&#8212;</b><br>This suggests that with strength and health, some may live longer, up to eighty years. It highlights the variability of human life and the grace of God in granting additional years. This can be seen as a reminder of human frailty and the need to rely on God's strength. The mention of strength may also imply the physical and spiritual vigor required to endure life's challenges.<p><b>yet their pride is but labor and sorrow,</b><br>This phrase underscores the futility of human pride and achievements, which often result in toil and grief. It reflects the curse of labor from <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>, where work became burdensome due to sin. The pride of life, as warned against in 1 <a href="/john/2-16.htm">John 2:16</a>, is fleeting and ultimately unsatisfying, pointing to the need for humility and dependence on God.<p><b>for they quickly pass,</b><br>Life's transience is emphasized here, echoing the sentiments of other scriptures like <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which compares life to a mist. This brevity serves as a call to wisdom, urging believers to number their days and live purposefully, as advised in <a href="/psalms/90-12.htm">Psalm 90:12</a>. It also points to the eternal perspective that life on earth is temporary, and true fulfillment is found in eternity with God.<p><b>and we fly away.</b><br>This imagery of flying away suggests the soul's departure from the body at death, reminiscent of <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>, where the spirit returns to God. It can also be seen as a type of the believer's hope in the resurrection and eternal life, as promised in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>.
