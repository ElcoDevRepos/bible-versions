The psalmist, Asaph, contrasts his personal struggle with the broader truths about God's goodness to Israel. This personal approach is common in the Psalms, where individual experiences are used to convey universal truths. The use of "me" emphasizes the personal nature of the struggle and the introspective journey of faith.<p><b>my feet had almost stumbled</b><br>The imagery of feet stumbling suggests a loss of stability or direction, often used metaphorically in Scripture to describe spiritual or moral faltering. In the ancient Near Eastern context, walking a path was a common metaphor for living one's life. The psalmist's near stumble reflects a crisis of faith, possibly due to the prosperity of the wicked, which is a central theme in this psalm. This metaphor is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/3-23.htm">Proverbs 3:23</a>, which speaks of walking securely when one follows God's wisdom.<p><b>my steps had nearly slipped</b><br>This phrase continues the metaphor of walking, emphasizing the precariousness of the psalmist's situation. Slipping steps suggest a moment of doubt or temptation, where the psalmist almost veered off the righteous path. The Hebrew culture often used such physical metaphors to describe spiritual realities. This imagery is also found in <a href="/psalms/37-31.htm">Psalm 37:31</a>, where the law of God in one's heart prevents slipping. The psalmist's admission of nearly slipping highlights the tension between faith and doubt, a common theme in the wisdom literature of the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, Asaph was a prominent Levite musician appointed by King David to lead worship in the tabernacle.
