The sanctuary was the dwelling place of God's presence among His people, symbolizing His holiness and majesty. The term "awesome" reflects the fear and respect that God's presence commands. In biblical history, the sanctuary was central to Israelite worship, where sacrifices were made, and God's law was taught. This reverence is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1-4</a>, where the prophet Isaiah has a vision of God's holiness in the temple. The sanctuary also foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who is described as the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), where God's presence dwells fully.<p><b>the God of Israel Himself gives strength and power to His people.</b><br>This phrase highlights God's active role in empowering His people, Israel. Throughout the Old Testament, God is depicted as the source of strength and victory for Israel, whether in battles, such as those led by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5-9</a>), or in the spiritual strength needed to follow His commandments. The empowerment of God's people is a recurring theme, seen in the stories of judges like Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-14.htm">Judges 6:14</a>) and kings like David (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45-47</a>). In the New Testament, this empowerment is extended to all believers through the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>), fulfilling the promise of strength and power to God's people. This empowerment is not just physical but also spiritual, enabling believers to live out their faith.<p><b>Blessed be God!</b><br>This concluding phrase is a doxology, a short hymn of praises to God. It reflects a response of worship and gratitude for God's attributes and actions. The call to bless God is a common biblical expression of praise, found throughout the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103:1-2</a>) and other scriptures. It acknowledges God's sovereignty, goodness, and faithfulness. In the context of <a href="/psalms/68.htm">Psalm 68</a>, it serves as a fitting response to the recognition of God's power and provision for His people. This expression of blessing God is also seen in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to give thanks in all circumstances (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>), recognizing God's continual work in their lives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, depicted as awesome and powerful, providing strength to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanctuary.htm">Sanctuary</a></b><br>Refers to the holy place where God dwells, symbolizing His presence and majesty.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, recipients of His strength and power.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/strength_and_power.htm">Strength and Power</a></b><br>Gifts from God to His people, enabling them to fulfill His purposes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/blessing.htm">Blessing</a></b><br>The act of praising God for His attributes and deeds.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_awe-inspiring_presence.htm">God's Awe-Inspiring Presence</a></b><br>Recognize the majesty and holiness of God in His sanctuary.

Like <a href="/psalms/86-8.htm">Psalm 86:8&#8211;10</a>, this single phrase places every other power in submission to the One true King. We&#8217;re reminded of <a href="/jeremiah/10-6.htm">Jeremiah 10:6</a>&#8212;&#8220;There is none like You, O LORD.&#8221; By starting this way, the psalmist calls us to lift our eyes immediately to the Almighty rather than to circumstances.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You are awesome in Your sanctuary</b><p>&#8220;Awesome&#8221; speaks of holy fear that comes from beholding God&#8217;s unveiled majesty. His &#8220;sanctuary&#8221; points to the earthly temple and, beyond that, to His heavenly dwelling.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a> asks, &#8220;Who is like You&#8212;majestic in holiness, awesome in glory?&#8221; The answer, of course, is no one.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/96-9.htm">Psalm 96:9</a> urges, &#8220;Worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness; tremble before Him.&#8221;<p>Where God&#8217;s presence is manifest, awe is the only fitting response. The literal sanctuary in Jerusalem displayed this glory, yet <a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a> reminds us that the earthly copy points to the greater heavenly reality. The verse celebrates both.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the God of Israel Himself gives strength and power to His people</b><p>Here the direction shifts from worship in His dwelling to blessing flowing out to His people. The promise is explicit: God &#8220;Himself&#8221; is the Giver.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/29-11.htm">Psalm 29:11</a> declares, &#8220;The LORD gives strength to His people; the LORD blesses His people with peace.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29-31</a> assures us He &#8220;gives power to the faint&#8221; and renews the weary.<p>&#8226; In the New Testament, <a href="/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a> prays that believers be &#8220;strengthened with power through His Spirit.&#8221;<p>These passages show the same pattern: worship leads to empowerment. Because God is faithful to Israel, He will likewise sustain every believer who belongs to the new covenant community (<a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Blessed be God!</b><p>The psalm ends with a doxology, just as <a href="/psalms/41-13.htm">Psalm 41:13</a> and <a href="/psalms/72-18.htm">Psalm 72:18-19</a> do. Praise is the natural conclusion when we&#8217;ve considered His glory and His generosity. <a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3</a> echoes, &#8220;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,&#8221; linking Old Testament praise to New Testament fulfillment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/68-35.htm">Psalm 68:35</a> calls us to look up, stand in holy awe, receive divine strength, and burst into praise.
