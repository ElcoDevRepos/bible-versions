The imagery of crushing foes is consistent with the biblical theme of God as a divine warrior who fights on behalf of His people (<a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>). Historically, this can be seen in the numerous battles where Israel triumphed over their enemies, such as David's victories over the Philistines (<a href="/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17-25</a>). Theologically, this points to God's sovereignty and His commitment to uphold His covenant with David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). In a broader sense, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who ultimately defeats all spiritual enemies (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>).<p><b>and strike down those who hate him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's active role in defending His chosen leader against adversaries. The act of striking down is a demonstration of divine justice against those who oppose God's anointed. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, kings were often seen as representatives of God on earth, and opposition to them was tantamount to opposition to God Himself. This is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus, the ultimate anointed one, faces opposition but is ultimately vindicated by God (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23-24</a>). The phrase also serves as a reminder of the ultimate judgment that awaits those who reject God's authority (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ethan_the_ezrahite.htm">Ethan the Ezrahite</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, who is traditionally believed to be a wise man during the time of King Solomon.
