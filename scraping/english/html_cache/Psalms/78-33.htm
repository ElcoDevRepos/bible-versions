The futility of their days can be seen as a consequence of their disobedience and lack of faith, as described in the books of Exodus and Numbers. The Israelites' failure to trust in God's promises led to a generation perishing in the desert, unable to enter the Promised Land (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-35</a>). This futility is a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's guidance and serves as a warning to remain faithful. The concept of futility is echoed in Ecclesiastes, where life apart from God is described as "meaningless" or "vanity."<p><b>and their years in sudden terror</b><br>The sudden terror refers to the various judgments and calamities that befell the Israelites due to their rebellion, such as plagues, enemy attacks, and divine punishments (<a href="/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31-35, 21</a>:6). These events were often swift and unexpected, emphasizing the seriousness of God's holiness and justice. The terror experienced by the Israelites can be seen as a type of the final judgment, where those who reject God face sudden destruction (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>). This phrase also serves as a call to repentance, urging believers to live in reverence and obedience to God, avoiding the pitfalls of disbelief and rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (He)</a></b><br>The sovereign and just God who judges His people for their disobedience and lack of faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, who experienced God's judgment due to their repeated rebellion and unbelief during their wilderness journey.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness_journey.htm">Wilderness Journey</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites wandered in the desert for 40 years after their exodus from Egypt, marked by disobedience and lack of trust in God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>God&#8217;s judgment on the Israelites serves as a reminder of the serious consequences of disobedience and unbelief.
