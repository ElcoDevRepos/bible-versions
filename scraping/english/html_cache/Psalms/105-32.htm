The transformation of rain into hail was a direct act of divine intervention, showcasing God's power over nature. Hail, a destructive force, was used as a tool of judgment against the Egyptians, who worshipped a pantheon of gods, including those believed to control the weather. This act demonstrated the supremacy of the God of Israel over the Egyptian deities. The plague of hail was particularly significant because it was not a natural occurrence in Egypt, a land known for its dry climate, thus emphasizing the miraculous nature of the event.<p><b>with lightning throughout their land</b><br>The inclusion of lightning alongside hail further underscores the severity and supernatural aspect of this plague. Lightning, often associated with divine presence and power in the Bible, served to intensify the fear and chaos among the Egyptians. This imagery is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God&#8217;s presence is accompanied by thunder and lightning, such as at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a>). The phrase "throughout their land" indicates the widespread impact of the plague, affecting all of Egypt and leaving no part untouched. This comprehensive judgment highlights God's control over the entire land and serves as a precursor to the ultimate deliverance of the Israelites, foreshadowing the power of Christ to bring salvation and judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is the one who exercises His power over nature to bring about hail instead of rain.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where this event took place, as part of the plagues that God sent to persuade Pharaoh to release the Israelites from slavery.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>Though not mentioned directly in this verse, they were God's chosen leaders to confront Pharaoh and lead the Israelites out of Egypt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who hardened his heart against God&#8217;s commands, leading to the plagues.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who were enslaved in Egypt and were the beneficiaries of God's deliverance through these miraculous signs.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nature.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nature</a></b><br>This verse reminds us that God has complete control over the natural world.
