In the creation narrative of <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, God speaks the universe into existence, demonstrating His sovereign power. The act of speaking signifies divine authority and intentionality, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>, where the Word is identified with Christ, emphasizing the creative power of God's spoken word. This reflects the belief in the inerrancy and efficacy of Scripture, as God's word accomplishes what it intends (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><b>and it came to be</b><br>This phrase underscores the immediate and effective nature of God's creative power. Unlike human words, which may or may not result in action, God's words are inherently powerful and result in creation. This is evident in the creation account, where each act of creation follows God's command. The phrase also connects to <a href="/hebrews/11-3.htm">Hebrews 11:3</a>, which states that the universe was formed at God's command, reinforcing the idea of creation ex nihilo (out of nothing).<p><b>He commanded</b><br>The use of "commanded" indicates authority and control. In the ancient Near Eastern context, kings and rulers issued commands that were to be obeyed without question. Similarly, God's command in creation reflects His ultimate authority over all things. This is mirrored in the New Testament, where Jesus, as the incarnate Word, commands nature and it obeys (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>), illustrating His divine authority.<p><b>and it stood firm</b><br>This phrase suggests stability and permanence in God's creation. The world is not chaotic or unstable but is established by God's decree. This reflects the biblical theme of God's faithfulness and the reliability of His promises. In <a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89-90</a>, God's word is described as eternal and His faithfulness as enduring through all generations, reinforcing the idea that what God establishes is unshakeable. This also points to the eschatological hope of a new creation that will stand firm forever (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as the Creator whose word is powerful and effective.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The event referenced here is the act of creation, where God spoke the universe into existence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/33.htm">Psalm 33</a>, traditionally believed to be David, who is expressing awe at God's creative power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_word.htm">The Power of God's Word</a></b><br>God's word is not just informative but creative and authoritative.
