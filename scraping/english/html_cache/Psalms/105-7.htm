The use of "LORD" in all caps signifies the divine name YHWH, highlighting God's eternal and unchanging nature. This covenantal name was revealed to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, establishing a personal relationship with Israel. The phrase "our God" indicates a collective identity and belonging, reminding the Israelites of their unique position as God's chosen people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). This relationship is foundational to understanding the rest of the Psalm, which recounts God's faithfulness to His promises.<p><b>His judgments carry throughout the earth.</b><br>This part of the verse underscores God's sovereignty and justice. The term "judgments" refers to God's decrees and decisions, which are righteous and just (<a href="/psalms/19-9.htm">Psalm 19:9</a>). The scope "throughout the earth" indicates that God's authority is not limited to Israel but extends globally, affirming His role as the Creator and Judge of all nations (<a href="/psalms/96-13.htm">Psalm 96:13</a>). This universal reach of God's judgments is a theme echoed in the prophetic literature, such as <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>, where God judges between nations. It also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Christ's return to judge the living and the dead (<a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>), emphasizing the ultimate fulfillment of God's justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and faithfulness to His promises.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, often the primary audience of the Psalms, who are reminded of God's faithfulness and judgments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_earth.htm">The Earth</a></b><br>Represents the entirety of creation, highlighting the universal scope of God's authority and judgments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is sovereign over all creation.
