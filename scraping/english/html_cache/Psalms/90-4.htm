It reflects the biblical theme of God's omniscience and omnipresence, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's thoughts and ways are higher than ours. It underscores the divine attribute of seeing all of time simultaneously, a concept that is beyond human comprehension.<p><b>a thousand years</b><br>The mention of "a thousand years" is symbolic, representing a long period of time. This is not meant to be a literal measurement but rather a way to express God's timeless nature. This concept is echoed in <a href="/2_peter/3-8.htm">2 Peter 3:8</a>, which also states that with the Lord, a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day. It highlights the difference between God's eternal nature and human temporality.<p><b>are but a day that passes</b><br>This phrase illustrates the fleeting nature of time from God's perspective. While humans experience time sequentially, God exists outside of time. The imagery of a day passing suggests the transience of human life, a theme prevalent in biblical literature, such as in <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which compares life to a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.<p><b>or a watch of the night</b><br>A "watch of the night" refers to a division of time used in ancient cultures, particularly in military contexts, where the night was divided into watches for guard duty. In biblical times, the night was typically divided into three or four watches. This phrase further emphasizes the brevity and insignificance of human time in comparison to God's eternal existence. It also connects to the theme of vigilance and readiness, as seen in Jesus' teachings in <a href="/mark/13-35.htm">Mark 13:35-37</a>, where He instructs His followers to be watchful and alert.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/90.htm">Psalm 90</a>, Moses is a central figure in the Old Testament, known for leading the Israelites out of Egypt and receiving the Ten Commandments from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The eternal and sovereign Creator, whose perspective on time is vastly different from that of humans.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God during the time of Moses, often experiencing God's guidance and discipline.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting for much of Moses' leadership, where the Israelites wandered for 40 years.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/watch_of_the_night.htm">Watch of the Night</a></b><br>A term used to describe a division of the night into periods for keeping guard, reflecting the ancient understanding of time.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_eternal_perspective.htm">God's Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>God's view of time is not limited by human constraints.

Because He sees perfectly, His evaluation of time is flawless, and His judgments can be trusted (<a href="/jeremiah/23-24.htm">Jeremiah 23:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a thousand years</b><p>- To us, a millennium feels vast&#8212;think of the gap between the Norman Conquest and today. Yet Moses states that &#8220;a thousand years&#8221; fall within God&#8217;s gaze as effortlessly as a single moment.<p>- Scripture often uses a thousand to represent immensity without exaggeration (<a href="/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10</a>). Here it is literal: God is fully aware of every hour of every century. <a href="/2_peter/3-8.htm">2 Peter 3:8</a> echoes this psalm, reminding believers that God&#8217;s timetable is never slow but perfectly aligned with His purpose.<p>- This truth calms anxious hearts about history, prophecy, or personal delay. The Lord who shepherded saints a thousand years ago is the same One guiding us now (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are but a day that passes</b><p>- Moses continues: those thousand years &#8220;are but a day that passes.&#8221; God experiences the sweep of centuries the way we recall yesterday&#8212;vivid, immediate, and already complete (<a href="/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/102-11.htm">Psalm 102:11-12</a>).<p>- For believers, this means:<p>&#8226; No promise can expire before God fulfills it.<p>&#8226; No injustice can hide in the backlog of time; He will bring every deed into judgment (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>).<p>&#8226; No season of suffering feels drawn-out to Him; in His plan it is measured, purposeful, and temporary (<a href="/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or a watch of the night</b><p>- A &#8220;watch&#8221; in ancient Israel lasted only three or four hours (<a href="/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19</a>; <a href="/mark/6-48.htm">Mark 6:48</a>). Compared with &#8220;a day,&#8221; a watch is even briefer, underscoring how swiftly God surveys enormous stretches of time.<p>- By adding this comparison, Moses shows that even what we call &#8220;long&#8221; is, to the Eternal, a sliver. Jesus used the same imagery when urging readiness for His return during any watch (<a href="/luke/12-37.htm">Luke 12:37-38</a>).<p>- Practically, this perspective motivates:<p>&#8226; Patient endurance&#8212;our trials cannot outlast God&#8217;s plan.<p>&#8226; Urgency in obedience&#8212;the short &#8220;night watch&#8221; reminds us that opportunities to serve Him are precious and fleeting (<a href="/ephesians/5-15.htm">Ephesians 5:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>- God&#8217;s view of time is absolute; nothing escapes His sight.<p>- A literal thousand years feel to Him like a single passing day.<p>- Even the briefest night watch illustrates how swiftly He masters vast eras.<p>- Therefore, we rest in His faithfulness, trust His timing, and live each moment with eternal perspective.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/90.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">A thousand years.</span>--This verse, which, when Peter II. was written (see <span class= "ital">New Testament Commentary</span>), had already begun to receive an arithmetical treatment, and to be made the basis for Millennarian computations, merely contrasts the unchangeableness and eternity of the Divine existence and purpose with the vicissitudes incident to the brief life of man. To One who is from the infinite past to the infinite future, and Whose purpose runs through the ages, a thousand years are no more than a yesterday to man:<p><span class= "ital">"</span>And all our yesterdays have lighted fools<p>The way to dusty death;"<p>or even as a part of the night passed in sleep:<p>"A thousand years, with Thee they are no more<p>Than yesterday, which, ere it is, is spent.<p>Or, as a watch by night, that course doth keep,<p>And goes and comes, unwares to them that sleep."<p>FRANCIS BACON.<p>The exact rendering of the words translated in the Authorised Version, "when it passeth," is doubtful.
