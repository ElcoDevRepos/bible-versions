This site is significant in biblical history as a place of divine revelation and covenant. It is traditionally identified with a mountain in the Sinai Peninsula, though its exact location remains uncertain. Horeb is a symbol of God's presence and law, making the events that occurred there particularly grievous.<p><b>they made a calf</b><br>The making of the calf refers to the incident in <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>, where the Israelites, in Moses' absence, pressured Aaron to create a golden calf. This act was a direct violation of the commandment against idolatry. The calf was likely modeled after Egyptian deities, reflecting the Israelites' struggle to leave behind the influences of Egypt. This event highlights the human tendency to revert to familiar practices in times of uncertainty.<p><b>and worshiped a molten image</b><br>Worshiping the molten image signifies the Israelites' departure from monotheism and their covenant with God. This act of idolatry was a grave sin, as it replaced the worship of the invisible God with a tangible idol. The worship of the calf is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing the spiritual adultery of God's people. It serves as a warning against the dangers of idolatry and the importance of faithfulness to God. This incident foreshadows the need for a mediator, a role ultimately fulfilled by Jesus Christ, who intercedes on behalf of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/horeb.htm">Horeb</a></b><br>Also known as Mount Sinai, this is the mountain where Moses received the Ten Commandments from God.
