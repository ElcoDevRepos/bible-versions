Zion holds significant biblical importance as the city of David and the location of the Temple, symbolizing God's dwelling place among His people. The greatness of the LORD in Zion reflects His sovereign rule and divine presence. Historically, Zion was the center of Jewish worship and the site where God's glory was manifested, particularly in the Temple. This phrase connects to other scriptures such as <a href="/psalms/48.htm">Psalm 48:1-2</a>, which also speaks of the LORD's greatness in Zion, and <a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>, which prophesies that the law will go out from Zion. Zion is often seen as a type of the heavenly Jerusalem, pointing to the ultimate reign of Christ.<p><b>He is exalted above all the peoples.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's supremacy and authority over all nations and peoples, not just Israel. It underscores the universal sovereignty of God, who is not limited to a single nation but is the ruler of all creation. This theme is echoed in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/97-9.htm">Psalm 97:9</a>, which declares the LORD as exalted above all gods, and <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where every knee shall bow to Jesus Christ, acknowledging His lordship. The exaltation of God above all peoples also points to the future messianic kingdom where Christ will reign supreme over all the earth, fulfilling prophecies such as those found in <a href="/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>. This phrase calls believers to recognize and submit to God's ultimate authority and to proclaim His greatness to all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing the God of Israel, who is characterized by His greatness and sovereignty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>A significant location in biblical history, often synonymous with Jerusalem, representing the spiritual and political center of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_peoples.htm">The Peoples</a></b><br>Refers to all nations and ethnic groups, highlighting the universal reign and authority of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sovereignty_of_god.htm">The Sovereignty of God</a></b><br>Recognize that God's greatness is not limited to a specific location or people; He is sovereign over all creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_zion.htm">The Significance of Zion</a></b><br>Understand Zion as a symbol of God's presence and His covenant relationship with His people, which extends to the Church today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/universal_worship.htm">Universal Worship</a></b><br>Reflect on the call for all peoples to acknowledge and worship the LORD, transcending cultural and national boundaries.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/exaltation_of_god_in_our_lives.htm">Exaltation of God in Our Lives</a></b><br>Consider how we can exalt God in our daily lives, ensuring that He is honored above all else in our personal and communal worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_greatness_in_our_challenges.htm">God's Greatness in Our Challenges</a></b><br>Trust in God's greatness and sovereignty, especially during personal trials, knowing that He is exalted above all circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_99_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 99:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_99_2_on_God_s_rule_over_nations.htm">How does Psalm 99:2 emphasize God's sovereignty over all nations today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Zion_exaltation_show_God_s_bond.htm">What does "exalted in Zion" reveal about God's relationship with His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Ways_to_exalt_God_daily_per_Psalm_99_2.htm">How can we exalt God in our daily lives, as Psalm 99:2 suggests?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Psalm_99_2_with_God_s_authority_verse.htm">Connect Psalm 99:2 with another scripture highlighting God's supreme authority.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/God_s_exaltation_impact_on_worship.htm">How should God's exaltation influence our worship practices and attitudes?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_99_2_on_God_s_rule_over_nations_2.htm">What does Psalm 99:2 reveal about God's sovereignty over all nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_99_2_Lord_s_greatness_in_Zion.htm">How does Psalm 99:2 emphasize the greatness of the Lord in Zion?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_Psalm_99_2_important_today.htm">Why is God's exaltation in Psalm 99:2 significant for believers today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_99.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 99?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/do_you_believe_in_what_you_cannot_see.htm">What is Zion's significance in biblical prophecy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/evidence_for_psalm_126's_restoration.htm">Is there any archaeological or textual evidence confirming the miraculous restoration claimed in Psalm 126, beyond interpreted metaphor or tradition?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_no_science_proof_of_divine_talk.htm">Psalm 3:4 claims God answers from 'his holy mountain'--why is there no scientific confirmation of divine communication from a specific location?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/where_is_psalm_110's_conquest_fulfilled.htm">Psalm 110 portrays a victorious king judging entire nations.

His greatness is not comparative but absolute, echoing <a href="/psalms/145-3.htm">Psalm 145:3</a>, &#8220;Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; His greatness is unsearchable.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Every attribute&#8212;power, wisdom, holiness, love&#8212;rests on a scale only God can fill. Nothing diminishes or challenges that greatness.<p>&#8226; In practical terms, this means we approach Him with confidence, not hesitation.
