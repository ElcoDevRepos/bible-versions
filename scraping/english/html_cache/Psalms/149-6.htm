In the context of ancient Israel, praise was often expressed through song and music, as seen in the Psalms, which were used in temple worship. The "high praises" suggest an exalted form of worship, one that acknowledges God's supreme authority and majesty. This aligns with other scriptures such as <a href="/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34:1</a>, which encourages continual praise. The act of praising God is not only a form of worship but also a declaration of faith and trust in His power and sovereignty. In the New Testament, <a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a> speaks of offering a "sacrifice of praise," indicating that praise is a vital part of the Christian life, transcending circumstances.<p><b>and a double-edged sword in their hands</b><br>The imagery of a "double-edged sword" is rich with meaning. Historically, swords were common weapons in ancient warfare, symbolizing strength and authority. In a spiritual context, the double-edged sword represents the Word of God, as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>, which is "living and active, sharper than any double-edged sword." This suggests that believers are equipped with the power of God's Word to discern truth and combat spiritual adversaries. The dual nature of the sword&#8212;both defensive and offensive&#8212;implies that believers are called to defend their faith and advance God's kingdom. This imagery also connects to <a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>, where the "sword of the Spirit" is part of the armor of God, highlighting the necessity of spiritual readiness and the active role of believers in spiritual warfare.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/149.htm">Psalm 149</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who often wrote about worship and warfare.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_congregation_of_the_faithful.htm">The Congregation of the Faithful</a></b><br>The people of Israel, who are called to praise God and execute His justice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The object of high praise, whose glory and justice are central to the psalm.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_god.htm">Enemies of God</a></b><br>Those who oppose God's will and righteousness, against whom the faithful are to wield the "two-edged sword."<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_two-edged_sword.htm">The Two-Edged Sword</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's Word and the power of divine justice, reflecting both spiritual and physical warfare.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_praise.htm">The Power of Praise</a></b><br>Praise is not just an act of worship but a powerful spiritual weapon.

&#8220;High praises&#8221; point to exuberant, wholehearted celebration of the Lord&#8217;s greatness&#8212;fitting for those who know His saving power (<a href="/psalms/98-1.htm">Psalm 98:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Praise is both declaration and weapon; it shifts the focus from human weakness to divine strength (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-21.htm">2 Chronicles 20:21&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; By praising while going into battle, Israel acknowledged that victory comes from the Lord, not from military might (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/149-4.htm">Psalm 149:4</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, continual praise bears witness to Christ&#8217;s triumph and silences the enemy&#8217;s accusations (<a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>;
