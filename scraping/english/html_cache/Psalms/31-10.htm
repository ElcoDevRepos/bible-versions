The language of being "consumed" suggests an overwhelming sense of sorrow that affects every aspect of life. In biblical context, grief is frequently associated with mourning, loss, or the consequences of sin. The psalmist's lament can be seen as a cry for deliverance, similar to other psalms where David seeks God's intervention during times of personal crisis (e.g., <a href="/psalms/6-6.htm">Psalm 6:6-7</a>). This expression of grief also prefigures the suffering of Jesus Christ, who was described as "a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief" (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<p><b>and my years with groaning;</b><br>The mention of "years" indicates a prolonged period of suffering, suggesting that the psalmist's distress is not a fleeting experience but a long-term affliction. Groaning is a common biblical expression of deep, often physical, pain and spiritual anguish. This phrase can be connected to the Israelites' groaning under Egyptian bondage (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23</a>), symbolizing a cry for divine intervention. The endurance of suffering over years also parallels the perseverance required of believers, as seen in the New Testament exhortations to endure trials with faith (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>).<p><b>my iniquity has drained my strength,</b><br>Here, the psalmist acknowledges a personal responsibility for his suffering, attributing it to his own iniquity or sin. This reflects the biblical principle that sin can have physical and spiritual consequences, leading to a loss of strength and vitality. The connection between sin and physical weakness is echoed in <a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3-4</a>, where David describes his bones wasting away due to unconfessed sin. This acknowledgment of sin and its effects is a precursor to the New Testament teaching on repentance and forgiveness through Christ (1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>).<p><b>and my bones are wasting away.</b><br>The imagery of bones wasting away conveys a profound sense of physical decay and weakness, often associated with severe emotional or spiritual distress. In ancient Near Eastern culture, bones were considered the core of one's physical being, and their deterioration symbolized a deep-seated affliction. This phrase can be linked to the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who bore the iniquities of others, leading to his own physical suffering. It also foreshadows the physical suffering of Christ on the cross, where He bore the sins of humanity, leading to His physical and spiritual anguish.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/31.htm">Psalm 31</a>, David is expressing a deep personal lament, likely during a time of distress or persecution.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>Though not explicitly mentioned in this verse, the context of the psalm suggests that David is surrounded by adversaries, contributing to his grief and groaning.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate recipient of David's lament, God is seen as the source of hope and deliverance amidst David's suffering.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledging_human_frailty.htm">Acknowledging Human Frailty</a></b><br>Recognize that physical and emotional suffering are part of the human experience, often exacerbated by sin and iniquity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_impact_of_sin.htm">The Impact of Sin</a></b><br>Understand that sin can have tangible effects on our physical and mental well-being, as seen in David's lament.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/turning_to_god_in_distress.htm">Turning to God in Distress</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of bringing our grief and burdens to God, trusting in His strength and deliverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_weakness.htm">Hope in Weakness</a></b><br>Encourage believers to find hope and strength in God, even when feeling physically and emotionally drained.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_confession.htm">The Role of Confession</a></b><br>Highlight the importance of confessing sin and seeking God's forgiveness as a step towards healing and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_31_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 31:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_sin_in_Psalm_31_10.htm">How does Psalm 31:10 highlight the impact of sin on our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_to_find_God_s_strength_in_grief.htm">What steps can we take to seek God's strength amid "grief" and "sorrow"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_31_10_Romans_6_23_Sin_s_effects.htm">How does Psalm 31:10 connect with Romans 6:23 about sin's consequences?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_aid_those_in_anguish_per_Psalm_31_10.htm">In what ways can we support others experiencing "anguish" as described in Psalm 31:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Finding_hope_in_God_amid_life_s_trials.htm">How can we find hope in God when feeling "consumed" by life's challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_31_10_Human_suffering_reflection.htm">How does Psalm 31:10 reflect the human experience of suffering and distress?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_influenced_Psalm_31_10.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 31:10?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_31_10_and_divine_deliverance.htm">How does Psalm 31:10 relate to the theme of divine deliverance?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_31.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/can_sin_directly_cause_illness.htm">Psalm 31:10 links sin to physical weakness&#8212;does any scientific or historical evidence suggest moral wrongdoing can directly cause illness? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/effects_of_unconfessed_sin.htm">What are the effects of unconfessed sin?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_about_health.htm">What does the Bible say about health?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_does_psalm_43_2_imply_god_forsakes.htm">Why does Psalm 43:2 suggest God has forsaken the writer, when other passages emphasize God's constant presence?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 31:10 Mean</div><b>For my life is consumed with grief</b><p>&#8220;For my life is consumed with grief&#8221; paints the picture of sorrow that fills every waking moment.

This sin necessitated a lifelong repentance (<a href="/psalms/38-17.htm">Psalm 38:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/51-3.htm">Psalm 51:3</a>, etc.). My strength faileth because of mine iniquity.
