The concept of plotting with "one mind" suggests a concerted effort and a shared purpose among various groups. In biblical context, this reflects the frequent alliances formed by Israel's neighbors to oppose God's people, as seen in historical accounts of coalitions against Israel (e.g., <a href="/2_chronicles/20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-2</a>). The unity of these enemies can be seen as a foreshadowing of the end-times coalition against God and His anointed, as described in <a href="/revelation/17-13.htm">Revelation 17:13</a>, where ten kings give their power and authority to the beast with one purpose.<p><b>they form an alliance against You&#8212;</b><br>The alliance is not merely against Israel but against God Himself, indicating that the opposition to God's people is ultimately an opposition to God. This reflects the spiritual warfare theme found throughout Scripture, where earthly conflicts mirror the cosmic battle between good and evil. Historically, alliances against Israel often involved nations such as Moab, Ammon, and Edom, who were geographically and culturally close to Israel. This phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, where the opposition faced by Israel prefigures the opposition Jesus faced from religious and political leaders who conspired against Him (<a href="/matthew/26-3.htm">Matthew 26:3-4</a>). Theologically, this underscores the idea that enmity against God's people is enmity against God, a theme echoed in <a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a>, where Jesus identifies with His followers by asking Saul, "Why do you persecute Me?"<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/83.htm">Psalm 83</a>, Asaph was a prominent Levite singer and seer in David's court, known for his role in leading worship and composing psalms.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of God's chosen people, often the target of surrounding nations' hostility, as depicted in this psalm.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_israel.htm">Enemies of Israel</a></b><br>The psalm refers to a coalition of nations plotting against Israel, representing historical and spiritual adversaries.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate target of the enemies' alliance, as their opposition to Israel is seen as opposition to God Himself.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/alliance.htm">Alliance</a></b><br>The coalition of nations that come together with a unified purpose to oppose God's people, symbolizing the broader spiritual battle against God's plans.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_opposition.htm">Unity in Opposition</a></b><br>The enemies of God often unite in their opposition, reminding us of the importance of unity among believers in standing firm in faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>The physical alliance against Israel reflects the spiritual battles believers face.

Unity itself is not condemned&#8212;<a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a> celebrates brothers dwelling together in unity&#8212;but when hearts are set against God, that oneness magnifies sin. Jesus warned, &#8220;If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand&#8221; (<a href="/mark/3-25.htm">Mark 3:25</a>), yet here we see the opposite: a house perfectly united, not for righteousness, but for rebellion.<p>Points to note:<p>&#8226; A collective mindset intensifies opposition.<p>&#8226; God sees not merely individual hearts but corporate intentions (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers are called to the counter-example&#8212;&#8220;one heart and one soul&#8221; devoted to Christ (<a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they plot together</b><p>The verb moves from attitude to action. This is deliberate strategy, reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1</a> where &#8220;the peoples plot in vain.&#8221; It is calculated, not impulsive. Mordecai once uncovered such plotting against a king (<a href="/esther/2-21.htm">Esther 2:21-23</a>); here, the scheming targets the King of kings. <a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a> reminds us, &#8220;Many plans are in a man&#8217;s heart, but the purpose of the LORD will prevail.&#8221;<p>Key observations:<p>&#8226; Plotting signals premeditation&#8212;sin brewed in the mind before it appears in the open (<a href="/james/1-15.htm">James 1:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The righteous may feel outnumbered, yet God is never surprised (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly unmasks evil schemes and records their collapse (<a href="/daniel/6-24.htm">Daniel 6:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they form an alliance</b><p>The conspiracy moves beyond thoughts and plans into formal partnership. Various peoples lay aside differences to fight a common enemy&#8212;God&#8217;s covenant people, and by extension, God Himself. Similar coalitions arose against Jehoshaphat (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-2</a>) and later against Nehemiah&#8217;s rebuilding efforts (<a href="/nehemiah/4-7.htm">Nehemiah 4:7-8</a>). <a href="/revelation/17-13.htm">Revelation 17:13-14</a> foresees end-time kings of the earth who &#8220;share one purpose&#8221; in making war against the Lamb&#8212;an ultimate alliance destined to fail.<p>Consider:<p>&#8226; Alliances amplify resources yet also multiply accountability (<a href="/obadiah/1-7.htm">Obadiah 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Human treaties stand in stark contrast to the everlasting covenant God makes with His people (<a href="/jeremiah/32-40.htm">Jeremiah 32:40</a>).<p>&#8226; Earthly coalitions fade; the church&#8217;s fellowship endures (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against You&#8212;</b><p>The psalmist personalizes the attack: hostility toward Israel is hostility toward Israel&#8217;s God. Saul learned this when the risen Jesus asked, &#8220;Why do you persecute Me?&#8221; (<a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a>). <a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a> declares, &#8220;Whoever touches you touches the apple of His eye.&#8221; Enemies may think they are contending with mere mortals, but the real target is the LORD.<p>Truths to remember:<p>&#8226; Persecution of God&#8217;s people is spiritual warfare directed at God Himself (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p>&#8226; God takes opposition personally and promises vindication (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>).<p>&#8226; The final outcome is settled: every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/83-5.htm">Psalm 83:5</a> portrays united, intentional, organized rebellion directed ultimately at God.
