David's selection is significant because it demonstrates God's preference for the heart over outward appearances, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God tells Samuel not to consider appearance or height. David, the youngest son of Jesse, was chosen over his older brothers, emphasizing God's unexpected and gracious election. This choice also foreshadows the selection of Jesus Christ, a descendant of David, as the ultimate Servant of God, fulfilling the messianic prophecies found in <a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a> and <a href="/matthew/12-18.htm">Matthew 12:18</a>.<p><b>and took him from the sheepfolds;</b><br>David's origins as a shepherd underscore his humble beginnings and the pastoral imagery often associated with leadership in the Bible. Shepherding was a common occupation in ancient Israel, and it required skills such as guidance, protection, and care, which were essential for a king. This background prepared David for his future role as the shepherd of Israel, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a>. The imagery of a shepherd is also a type of Christ, who is referred to as the Good Shepherd in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, illustrating His care and leadership over His people. David's transition from shepherd to king symbolizes God's ability to elevate the humble and use them for His purposes, as echoed in <a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The youngest son of Jesse, chosen by God to be the king of Israel.
