Birds are often used in Scripture to symbolize freedom and the vastness of God's creation. In the ancient Near East, birds were seen as messengers between the heavens and the earth, reflecting the connection between the divine and the natural world. Jesus later uses birds as examples of God's provision in <a href="/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>, emphasizing trust in God's care.<p><b>and the fish of the sea</b><br>Fish represent the abundance and mystery of God's creation, as the sea was often viewed as a place of chaos and the unknown in ancient cultures. The inclusion of fish underscores the comprehensive nature of human stewardship over all living creatures. In the New Testament, Jesus calls His disciples to be "fishers of men" (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>), using the imagery of fishing to describe the mission of spreading the Gospel.<p><b>all that swim the paths of the seas</b><br>This phrase suggests the order and design within creation, as the "paths of the seas" implies established routes or currents, which were not fully understood until modern oceanography. It reflects the wisdom and sovereignty of God in creation. The mention of sea paths can also be seen as a metaphor for the journey of life, with God guiding and sustaining His creation. This imagery is echoed in the story of Jonah, where the sea plays a crucial role in God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a>, David was the second king of Israel and a man after God's own heart.
