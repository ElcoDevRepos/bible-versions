The colorful garments may represent the righteousness and glory bestowed upon the bride, akin to the "fine linen, bright and clean" described in <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>, which symbolizes the righteous acts of the saints. The act of being led to the king signifies a formal and joyous presentation, reminiscent of Esther's preparation and presentation before King Xerxes (<a href="/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12-17</a>). This can also be seen as a type of the Church, the Bride of Christ, being presented to Jesus, the King of Kings, as described in <a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>.<p><b>her virgin companions are brought before you.</b><br>The mention of virgin companions highlights the purity and sanctity of those who accompany the bride, reflecting the cultural importance of virginity and purity in ancient Israelite society. These companions can be seen as bridesmaids or attendants, similar to the parable of the ten virgins in <a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>, which emphasizes readiness and purity in anticipation of the bridegroom's arrival. The phrase "brought before you" suggests a ceremonial introduction, indicating honor and respect.
