In biblical context, the "sinners" are those who live in rebellion against God's laws, often exploiting others for personal gain. The oppressed, frequently mentioned throughout Scripture, include widows, orphans, and foreigners, who were particularly vulnerable in ancient Israelite society. The frustration of their plans can be seen as a broader commentary on the injustice and corruption prevalent in societies that turn away from God's righteousness. This theme is echoed in other parts of the Bible, such as in the prophetic books where God condemns the mistreatment of the poor and calls for justice (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/10.htm">Isaiah 10:1-2</a>, <a href="/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11-12</a>).<p><b>yet the LORD is their shelter</b><br>Despite the actions of the wicked, this phrase affirms God's protective and providential care for those who are oppressed. The term "shelter" conveys a sense of refuge and safety, suggesting that God is a reliable protector against the injustices of the world. This assurance is a recurring theme in the Psalms, where God is often depicted as a fortress or stronghold (e.g., <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>, <a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>). Theologically, this reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where He promises to be their defender. This also points to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who embodies God's justice and mercy, offering spiritual refuge and salvation to all who trust in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sinners.htm">The Sinners</a></b><br>These are individuals who act wickedly and oppose God's ways.
