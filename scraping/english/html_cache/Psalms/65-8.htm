The "wonders" refer to God's miraculous acts and the natural phenomena that display His glory. In biblical context, this can be seen in the awe that nations felt towards the God of Israel, as seen in the stories of the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14-16</a>) and the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>). The fear mentioned here is not just terror but a reverent awe, acknowledging God's supreme authority. This reverence is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/66-3.htm">Psalm 66:3-4</a>, where the earth bows down to God. Historically, the ancient Near Eastern cultures were polytheistic, yet the God of Israel was distinct in His acts, which were unparalleled and caused even distant nations to take notice. This phrase also foreshadows the global reach of the Gospel, as seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>), where all nations are called to recognize and worship God.<p><b>You make the dawn and sunset shout for joy.</b><br>This imagery of dawn and sunset personified as shouting for joy emphasizes the beauty and order of creation, which reflects God's glory. The regularity of these daily events speaks to God's faithfulness and sovereignty over time and nature. In the ancient world, the sun was often worshipped as a deity, but this verse attributes the control and splendor of the sun's rising and setting to the one true God. This is consistent with the biblical theme that creation itself testifies to God's greatness, as seen in <a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1-6</a>, where the heavens declare the glory of God. The joy expressed here can be seen as a type of the joy found in Christ, who is described as the "light of the world" (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>) and brings spiritual dawn to those in darkness. The cycle of dawn and sunset also symbolizes the hope and renewal found in God's promises, as His mercies are new every morning (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as the Creator whose wonders inspire awe and reverence among people, even those who are far away.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/distant_lands.htm">Distant Lands</a></b><br>Refers to people living far from Israel, emphasizing the universal reach of God's power and the global recognition of His wonders.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/dawn_and_sunset.htm">Dawn and Sunset</a></b><br>Natural phenomena that symbolize the daily cycle of life and the consistent testimony of God's creative power and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_universal_sovereignty.htm">God's Universal Sovereignty</a></b><br>God's wonders are not limited to a specific location or people; they are recognized globally, demonstrating His sovereignty over all creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/creation_as_a_testimony.htm">Creation as a Testimony</a></b><br>The natural world, including the daily occurrences of dawn and sunset, serves as a constant reminder of God's presence and power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_and_awe.htm">Reverence and Awe</a></b><br>The appropriate response to God's wonders is reverence and awe, acknowledging His greatness and majesty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/joy_in_god's_creation.htm">Joy in God's Creation</a></b><br>The imagery of dawn and sunset shouting for joy encourages believers to find joy and gratitude in the beauty and order of God's creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witness_to_the_nations.htm">Witness to the Nations</a></b><br>Believers are called to be witnesses of God's wonders, sharing the message of His greatness with those who are far away, both geographically and spiritually.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_65_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 65:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_65_8_Awe_in_God_s_creation_today.htm">How does Psalm 65:8 inspire awe in God's creation and power today?
