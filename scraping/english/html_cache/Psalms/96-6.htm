In biblical context, "splendor" and "majesty" are often associated with God's presence, as seen in the visions of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1-4</a>) and John (<a href="/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2-3</a>). These terms convey the awe-inspiring nature of God, which is evident throughout Scripture. The imagery of splendor and majesty is also reminiscent of the descriptions of kingship in the ancient Near East, where rulers were often depicted with grandeur and authority. This reflects the understanding of God as the ultimate King, whose presence is marked by unparalleled glory.<p><b>strength and beauty fill His sanctuary.</b><br>The sanctuary refers to the holy place where God dwells, initially the tabernacle and later the temple in Jerusalem. "Strength" signifies God's power and might, which are central to His character and actions throughout the Bible, such as in the deliverance of Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>). "Beauty" in this context can be understood as the perfection and holiness of God's presence, which is both awe-inspiring and inviting. The combination of strength and beauty suggests a balance of power and grace, reflecting the nature of God as both just and merciful. This duality is seen in the person of Jesus Christ, who embodies both the strength of God in His authority and the beauty of God in His sacrificial love. The sanctuary, as a place of worship, symbolizes the meeting point between God and His people, where His attributes are fully displayed and experienced.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, depicted as the source of splendor, majesty, strength, and beauty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanctuary.htm">Sanctuary</a></b><br>Refers to the holy place where God's presence dwells, symbolizing His divine attributes and glory.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of the psalm, traditionally attributed to David, who calls for worship and recognition of God's greatness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_god's_majesty.htm">Recognizing God's Majesty</a></b><br>Acknowledge the greatness and majesty of God in your daily life.

So the version of Apollinaris, "Pureness and stately glory fit his shrine." The chronicler having adopted this psalm as suitable for the occasion when the ark was brought to Zion by David, has substituted "strength and gladness are in his <span class= "ital">place" </span>possibly because the Temple was not built at that time.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/96.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Honour and majesty are before him</span>.

When the psalms came to be used in the temple service, loftier language was more fitting. The whole passage has probable reference to the glory of God as seated between the cherubim in the first temple. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/96-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Splendor</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;w&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1935.htm">Strong's 1935: </a> </span><span class="str2">Splendor, majesty, vigor</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and majesty</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1926.htm">Strong's 1926: </a> </span><span class="str2">Magnificence, ornament, splendor</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are before Him;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#183;n&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - common plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6440.htm">Strong's 6440: </a> </span><span class="str2">The face</span><br /><br /><span class="word">strength</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1465;&#1445;&#1494;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;z)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5797.htm">Strong's 5797: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strength, might</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and beauty</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1437;&#1514;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1431;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7791;ip&#772;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;re&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8597.htm">Strong's 8597: </a> </span><span class="str2">Beauty, glory</span><br /><br /><span class="word">fill His sanctuary.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;miq&#183;d&#257;&#183;&#353;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4720.htm">Strong's 4720: </a> </span><span class="str2">A consecrated thing, place, a palace, sanctuary, asylum</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/psalms/96-6.htm">Psalm 96:6 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/psalms/96-6.htm">Psalm 96:6 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/psalms/96-6.htm">Psalm 96:6 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/psalms/96-6.htm">Psalm 96:6 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/psalms/96-6.htm">Psalm 96:6 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/psalms/96-6.htm">Psalm 96:6  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/psalms/96-6.htm">Psalm 96:6 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/psalms/96-6.htm">Psalm 96:6 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/psalms/96-6.htm">Psalm 96:6 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/psalms/96-6.htm">Psalm 96:6 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/psalms/96-6.htm">OT Poetry: Psalm 96:6 Honor and majesty are before him (Psalm Ps Psa.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/psalms/96-5.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Psalm 96:5"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 96:5" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/psalms/96-7.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Psalm 96:7"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 96:7" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
