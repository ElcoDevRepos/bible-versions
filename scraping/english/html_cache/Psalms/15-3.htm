In biblical times, slander was a serious offense, often leading to social and legal consequences. The tongue is frequently highlighted in Scripture as a powerful tool that can either build up or destroy (<a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-6</a>). The call to avoid slander aligns with the Ninth Commandment, which prohibits bearing false witness (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). This reflects God's desire for truthfulness and justice among His people. The absence of slander is a mark of righteousness and aligns with the character of Jesus, who is described as the Truth (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p><b>who does no harm to his neighbor</b><br>This phrase underscores the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor, a commandment reiterated by Jesus as the second greatest commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>). In the cultural context of ancient Israel, community and kinship were vital, and harming a neighbor would disrupt social harmony and violate covenantal relationships. The Hebrew concept of "shalom" (peace) involves wholeness and well-being, which is compromised by harm. This principle is echoed in the parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25-37</a>), where Jesus illustrates that true neighborliness transcends ethnic and social boundaries.<p><b>who casts no scorn on his friend</b><br>Casting scorn involves belittling or mocking others, which is contrary to the biblical call to love and respect one another. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, honor and shame were significant social dynamics, and scorn could lead to public disgrace. <a href="/proverbs/17-9.htm">Proverbs 17:9</a> highlights the value of covering an offense rather than exposing it, promoting forgiveness and reconciliation. This attitude reflects the humility and grace exemplified by Christ, who, despite being scorned and mocked, chose to forgive and love (<a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>). The absence of scorn is a reflection of a heart transformed by God's love, seeking to uplift rather than tear down.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/15.htm">Psalm 15</a>, David was the second king of Israel and a man after God's own heart.
