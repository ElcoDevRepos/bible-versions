In the context of ancient Israel, "Your people" refers to the Israelites, God's chosen nation. The concept of salvation is central to the biblical narrative, with God repeatedly delivering Israel from physical and spiritual enemies. This plea echoes the broader biblical theme of God as a savior, seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-14</a>, where God delivers the Israelites from Egypt. It also foreshadows the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ, who is seen as the fulfillment of God's promise to save His people from their sins (<a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>).<p><b>and bless Your inheritance;</b><br>The term "inheritance" refers to the land and people of Israel, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). In a broader theological sense, it also encompasses the spiritual blessings and promises given to God's people. The request for blessing is a call for God's favor, provision, and protection. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God promises to bless those who are faithful to Him (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). In the New Testament, believers in Christ are considered God's inheritance, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>, where Paul speaks of the riches of God's glorious inheritance in the saints.<p><b>shepherd them</b><br>The imagery of God as a shepherd is a powerful biblical metaphor for guidance, care, and protection. This reflects the pastoral culture of ancient Israel, where shepherds played a crucial role in tending to their flocks. The shepherd metaphor is prevalent throughout Scripture, notably in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where the Lord is depicted as a shepherd who provides and cares for His sheep. This imagery is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who identifies Himself as the Good Shepherd in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, emphasizing His role in leading, protecting, and sacrificing for His people.<p><b>and carry them forever.</b><br>The phrase "carry them forever" suggests enduring support and sustenance. It implies God's eternal commitment to His people, ensuring their well-being and security. This reflects the everlasting nature of God's covenant with Israel, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/46-4.htm">Isaiah 46:4</a>, where God promises to sustain and carry His people even to old age. In the New Testament, this eternal care is mirrored in the promise of eternal life through Jesus Christ, who assures His followers of His constant presence and support (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>). The idea of being carried by God also resonates with the concept of divine grace, where believers are upheld not by their strength but by God's unending love and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/28.htm">Psalm 28</a>, David was the second king of Israel and a man after God's own heart.
