The term "pleasant land" highlights the fertility and abundance of Canaan, often described as "a land flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). Despite its richness, the Israelites' lack of faith led them to despise it. This attitude is documented in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13-14</a>, where the spies sent to scout the land returned with a report that incited fear and rebellion among the people. The Israelites' disdain for the land reflects a deeper spiritual issue: a rejection of God's provision and plan. This rejection is a recurring theme in Israel's history, illustrating a pattern of unbelief and disobedience.<p><b>they did not believe His promise.</b><br>The promise in question is God's covenantal assurance to give the land of Canaan to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 15</a>:18-21). The Israelites' failure to believe this promise is a significant moment of unbelief, as it directly challenges God's faithfulness and power. This lack of faith is a central theme in the wilderness narrative, where the Israelites frequently doubted God's ability to fulfill His promises, despite witnessing His miraculous works. This unbelief is not just a historical account but serves as a warning to future generations about the consequences of doubting God's word. In the New Testament, this theme is echoed in <a href="/hebrews/3-19.htm">Hebrews 3:19</a>, which warns believers about the dangers of unbelief, using the Israelites' experience as a cautionary example. The call to trust in God's promises is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who embodies God's faithfulness and the ultimate promise of salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God who were delivered from Egypt and journeyed through the wilderness towards the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>Referred to as the "pleasant land" in this verse, it is the land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites wandered for 40 years due to their disobedience and lack of faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who guided them out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spies.htm">The Spies</a></b><br>Twelve men sent by Moses to scout the Promised Land, ten of whom returned with a negative report that led to the Israelites' disbelief.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_promises.htm">Faith in God's Promises</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites struggled to believe in God's promise of the Promised Land, we must examine our own faith in God's promises for our lives.

By the time of Moses that pledge had been repeated often (<a href="/exodus/6-8.htm">Exodus 6:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Unbelief was the root of Israel&#8217;s refusal. <a href="/deuteronomy/1-32.htm">Deuteronomy 1:32</a> states, &#8220;But in spite of this, you did not believe the LORD your God.&#8221; <a href="/hebrews/3-18.htm">Hebrews 3:18&#8211;19</a> ties the wilderness judgment directly to unbelief, showing it was a moral, not intellectual, failure.<p>&#8226; Because they rejected the promise, an entire generation died in the desert (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-34</a>). God remains faithful, yet He allows unbelief to forfeit blessings meant for His people.<p>&#8226; For Christians, the call is clear: &#8220;Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for He who promised is faithful&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>). Trusting His promises&#8212;whether concerning daily provision (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>) or eternal rest (<a href="/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1-3</a>)&#8212;keeps us from repeating Israel&#8217;s mistake.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/106-24.htm">Psalm 106:24</a> captures the heart of Israel&#8217;s failure at Kadesh Barnea: they treated God&#8217;s good gift with contempt and refused to trust His word.
