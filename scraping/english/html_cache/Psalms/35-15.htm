The imagery of stumbling suggests a moment of vulnerability or failure. In ancient Israel, public misfortune was often seen as a sign of divine disfavor, which could lead to social ostracism. The assembly in glee indicates a communal joy at the psalmist's distress, reminiscent of Job's friends who misinterpreted his suffering as a result of sin (<a href="/job/16-10.htm">Job 16:10</a>). This reaction contrasts with the biblical call to support and restore those who fall (<a href="/galatians/6.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>).<p><b>they gathered together against me.</b><br>The gathering against the psalmist suggests a coordinated effort to harm or discredit him. This can be seen as a form of social persecution, where individuals unite to oppose someone perceived as an enemy. Historically, such gatherings could occur at city gates or public squares, places of judgment and discourse. This aligns with the experiences of other biblical figures like David, who faced conspiracies and betrayal (<a href="/1_samuel/18-8.htm">1 Samuel 18:8-9</a>). It also foreshadows the gathering of religious leaders against Jesus, culminating in His crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/26-3.htm">Matthew 26:3-4</a>).<p><b>Assailants I did not know slandered me without ceasing.</b><br>The mention of unknown assailants highlights the psalmist's sense of isolation and the unexpected nature of the attacks. Slander, or false accusations, was a serious offense in biblical times, often leading to social and legal repercussions. The continuous nature of the slander suggests relentless persecution, akin to the persistent accusations faced by Jesus (<a href="/mark/14-55.htm">Mark 14:55-59</a>). This phrase underscores the theme of unjust suffering, a common motif in the Psalms and a foreshadowing of Christ's own experiences of betrayal and false testimony.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of the psalm, traditionally believed to be King David, who often faced opposition and betrayal from those around him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies/assailants.htm">Enemies/Assailants</a></b><br>These are the individuals who gathered against David, rejoicing in his misfortune and attacking him relentlessly.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/stumbling.htm">Stumbling</a></b><br>This refers to a moment of weakness or difficulty in David's life, which his enemies exploited.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gathering_in_glee.htm">Gathering in Glee</a></b><br>This describes the malicious joy and unity of David's adversaries as they sought to harm him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tearing_without_ceasing.htm">Tearing Without Ceasing</a></b><br>This indicates the relentless and vicious nature of the attacks David faced.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_spiritual_warfare.htm">Recognizing Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Just as David faced relentless attacks, believers must be aware of the spiritual battles they encounter and rely on God's strength.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_betrayal.htm">Responding to Betrayal</a></b><br>David's experience teaches us to turn to God in prayer and seek His justice when we face betrayal or unjust treatment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/maintaining_integrity.htm">Maintaining Integrity</a></b><br>Despite the attacks, David maintained his integrity and trust in God, setting an example for us to follow in times of adversity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/finding_comfort_in_god's_presence.htm">Finding Comfort in God's Presence</a></b><br>In moments of feeling overwhelmed by enemies, we can find solace in God's presence and His promise to never leave us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/praying_for_our_enemies.htm">Praying for Our Enemies</a></b><br>Jesus taught us to pray for those who persecute us, transforming our response from one of retaliation to one of grace and forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_35_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 35:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_35_15_Adversaries_actions.htm">How does Psalm 35:15 illustrate the behavior of adversaries during David's trials?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_betrayal_in_Psalm_35_15.htm">What can we learn about handling betrayal from Psalm 35:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_35_15_s_link_to_Jesus_accusers.htm">How does Psalm 35:15 connect to Jesus' experiences with His accusers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_respond_to_mockery_in_Psalm_35_15.htm">In what ways can we respond to mockery as seen in Psalm 35:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_35_15_Praying_for_opponents.htm">How can Psalm 35:15 guide us in praying for those who oppose us?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_35_15_on_betrayal_and_suffering.htm">How does Psalm 35:15 reflect on the nature of human betrayal and suffering?
