In biblical context, "wickedness" often refers to actions and attitudes that are contrary to God's will and commandments. The psalmist frequently encounters adversaries who oppose God's ways, reflecting the ongoing spiritual battle between righteousness and sin. Historically, Israel faced numerous threats from surrounding nations and internal corruption, which can be seen as a backdrop for this verse. The idea of wickedness drawing near suggests an imminent threat or pressure, a common theme in the Psalms where the faithful are often surrounded by enemies. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who faced opposition from those who rejected His message and sought to harm Him.<p><b>they are far from Your law.</b><br>This part of the verse contrasts the proximity of the wicked with their distance from God's law. The "law" refers to the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, which contain God's instructions and commandments for His people. Being "far from Your law" implies a deliberate rejection or ignorance of God's statutes. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, adherence to the law was central to maintaining a covenant relationship with God. This distance from the law signifies a spiritual and moral separation from God. Theologically, this separation underscores the need for redemption and the transformative power of God's Word, which is fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who embodies the law and offers a path back to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who expresses a deep love for God's law and a desire for righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/followers_of_wickedness.htm">Followers of Wickedness</a></b><br>Individuals who pursue evil and are characterized by their distance from God's law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_law.htm">God's Law</a></b><br>The divine instructions and commandments given by God, which are central to the life and faith of the Psalmist.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_opposition.htm">The Reality of Opposition</a></b><br>Recognize that those who pursue wickedness will often be close in proximity but far in spirit from God's law.

Scripture portrays such people as actively scheming: &#8220;For they cannot sleep unless they do evil; they are robbed of slumber unless they make someone fall&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Their behavior is willful and sustained. <a href="/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29&#8211;32</a> catalogs those &#8220;filled with all unrighteousness,&#8221; underscoring that wickedness is a chosen path rather than an accident.<p>&#8226; By opening with this clause, the psalmist affirms that evil has real agents in the world. Believers must recognize the presence of those who intentionally oppose God (<a href="/2_timothy/3-13.htm">2 Timothy 3:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>draw near</b><p>&#8226; Evil people &#8220;draw near&#8221; in the sense of proximity and pressure. The psalmist often experiences their pursuit: &#8220;The wicked wait to destroy me, but I will ponder Your testimonies&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/119-95.htm">Psalm 119:95</a>).<p>&#8226; Closeness here means threat, not fellowship&#8212;similar to how Jesus observed, &#8220;My betrayer is at hand&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/26-46.htm">Matthew 26:46</a>).<p>&#8226; For the faithful, this reminds us that hostility can feel immediate: &#8220;Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>). Yet the nearness of God (<a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>) remains greater than any encroaching wickedness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they are far from Your law</b><p>&#8226; Though physically close to the psalmist, the wicked stand at a vast moral distance from God&#8217;s instruction. <a href="/jeremiah/6-19.htm">Jeremiah 6:19</a> declares, &#8220;They have not listened to My words and have rejected My instruction.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Distance from God&#8217;s law produces blindness: &#8220;My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>). Rejecting truth leaves them without the light that guides (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast is stark: closeness in attack, remoteness in obedience. They may surround the believer, but they are estranged from the very standard that guarantees life (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-47.htm">Deuteronomy 32:47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/119-150.htm">Psalm 119:150</a> highlights a paradox: evildoers can stand right next to God&#8217;s people while standing far away from God Himself. Their pursuit is intentional, their presence intimidating, yet their hearts have rejected the life-giving authority of God&#8217;s Word.
