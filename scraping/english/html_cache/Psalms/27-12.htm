The psalmist, traditionally understood to be David, often faced adversaries, both external and internal. The phrase echoes the biblical theme of God as a refuge and deliverer, seen in other Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>). Historically, David's life was marked by numerous conflicts, including those with King Saul and his own son Absalom. The request not to be handed over suggests a reliance on divine justice rather than human intervention. This can be connected to Jesus' prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane, where He submits to God's will despite the impending betrayal and crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>).<p><b>for false witnesses rise up against me</b><br>False testimony was a serious offense in ancient Israel, as seen in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). The psalmist's experience of being falsely accused is a common biblical motif, also seen in the trials of Jesus (<a href="/mark/14-56.htm">Mark 14:56-59</a>). In a cultural context, bearing false witness could lead to severe consequences, including death, as it undermined justice and community trust. This phrase highlights the psalmist's innocence and the malicious intent of his adversaries. It also foreshadows the false accusations Jesus faced, fulfilling the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>.<p><b>breathing out violence</b><br>This vivid imagery conveys the intensity and hostility of the psalmist's enemies. The phrase suggests a relentless pursuit of harm, akin to a predator seeking its prey. In biblical literature, violence is often associated with wickedness and opposition to God's ways (<a href="/genesis/6-11.htm">Genesis 6:11-13</a>). The psalmist's depiction of his foes aligns with the broader scriptural narrative of the righteous being persecuted by the unrighteous. This can be seen in the New Testament, where early Christians faced persecution for their faith (<a href="/acts/8.htm">Acts 8:1-3</a>). The phrase also typifies the spiritual battle between good and evil, with Christ ultimately triumphing over violence and sin through His death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/27.htm">Psalm 27</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who often faced adversaries and false accusations throughout his life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/foes/enemies.htm">Foes/Enemies</a></b><br>The adversaries of David, who sought to harm him and falsely accused him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_witnesses.htm">False Witnesses</a></b><br>Individuals who rise against David with deceitful testimonies, intending to cause him harm.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/violence.htm">Violence</a></b><br>The aggressive and harmful intentions of David's enemies, which he seeks protection from.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine protector whom David appeals to for deliverance from his adversaries.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_protection.htm">Trust in God's Protection</a></b><br>David's plea demonstrates a deep trust in God as his protector against false accusations and violence.
