The term "arrogant" often refers to those who are self-reliant and dismissive of God's authority. In biblical context, arrogance is frequently condemned as it leads to rebellion against God (<a href="/proverbs/16-5.htm">Proverbs 16:5</a>). The psalmist's cry to God indicates a deep reliance on divine intervention, a recurring motif in the Psalms where God is seen as the protector of the humble and oppressed (<a href="/psalms/18-27.htm">Psalm 18:27</a>).<p><b>a band of ruthless men seeks my life;</b><br>The mention of "ruthless men" suggests individuals who are violent and without mercy. Historically, David, the attributed author of this psalm, faced numerous threats from such men, including King Saul and his followers (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>). The phrase "seeks my life" indicates a serious threat, often associated with physical danger or persecution. This reflects the broader biblical narrative where God's people frequently face persecution from those who oppose God's will (<a href="/acts/9.htm">Acts 9:1</a>).<p><b>they have no regard for You.</b><br>This phrase highlights the spiritual condition of the psalmist's adversaries. Their lack of regard for God signifies a rejection of divine authority and moral law. Biblically, this disregard is often linked to idolatry and moral corruption (<a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21-23</a>). The psalmist contrasts his own faithfulness with the godlessness of his enemies, underscoring a theme of righteousness versus wickedness found throughout Scripture (<a href="/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>). This disregard for God is ultimately seen as the root of their hostility and violence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/86.htm">Psalm 86</a>, David is expressing his distress and seeking God's intervention against his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/arrogant/ruthless_men.htm">Arrogant/Ruthless Men</a></b><br>These are the adversaries of David, characterized by their pride and lack of reverence for God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure to whom David directs his plea for help and protection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reliance_on_god_in_times_of_trouble.htm">Reliance on God in Times of Trouble</a></b><br>David's response to adversity is to turn to God, demonstrating a model of faith and dependence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_nature_of_opposition.htm">Understanding the Nature of Opposition</a></b><br>Recognize that opposition often comes from those who do not honor God, as seen in the description of the arrogant and ruthless.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_as_a_weapon.htm">Prayer as a Weapon</a></b><br>David's prayer is a powerful example of how believers can confront challenges through earnest communication with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_adversaries.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Adversaries</a></b><br>Trust in God's ultimate control and justice, even when faced with seemingly overwhelming opposition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/maintaining_faith_amidst_persecution.htm">Maintaining Faith Amidst Persecution</a></b><br>Like David, believers are encouraged to maintain their faith and integrity, knowing that God is aware of their struggles.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_86_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 86:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Responding_to_arrogant_foes_in_Psalm_86_14.htm">How can we respond to "arrogant foes" as described in Psalm 86:14?

Their arrogance is not merely a personality flaw; it is rebellion against God&#8217;s rightful rule (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often pairs pride with hostility toward God&#8217;s people. In <a href="/psalms/3-1.htm">Psalm 3:1</a> David cries, &#8220;O LORD, how many are my foes! How many rise up against me!&#8221;. The same dynamic is on display here: opposition to the servant flows from contempt for the Master.<p>&#8226; For believers, the line reminds us that conflict often comes precisely because we choose humility and dependence on God, provoking the proud (<a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a band of ruthless men seeks my life</b><p>&#8226; The threat is organized (&#8220;a band&#8221;) and violent (&#8220;ruthless&#8221;). David faced such men when Saul&#8217;s soldiers hunted him in the wilderness (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>) and when the Ziphites betrayed him (<a href="/psalms/54-3.htm">Psalm 54:3</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Ruthless&#8221; indicates they act without mercy or conscience. Paul encountered similar plots when more than forty men &#8220;formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul&#8221; (<a href="/acts/23-12.htm">Acts 23:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The believer should not be surprised when hostility intensifies. Jesus warned, &#8220;You will be hated by everyone because of My name&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-22.htm">Matthew 10:22</a>), yet He also promised sustaining grace (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they have no regard for You</b><p>&#8226; Here is the heart of the matter: disdain for God leads to oppression of His people. <a href="/romans/3-18.htm">Romans 3:18</a> summarizes the unbelieving mindset, &#8220;There is no fear of God before their eyes&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Pharaoh once asked, &#8220;Who is the LORD, that I should obey His voice?&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>). Every generation sees the same posture. When God is dismissed, human life is devalued, and violence becomes thinkable.<p>&#8226; This diagnosis keeps the believer&#8217;s perspective clear. Our struggle is not merely against flesh and blood but against a spiritual refusal to honor God (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/86-14.htm">Psalm 86:14</a> exposes an age-old pattern: the proud rise up, form ruthless schemes, and persecute God&#8217;s servants precisely because they do not fear the Lord. David&#8217;s candid lament invites believers to recognize such opposition for what it is, to stand firm in humility, and to trust the God who sees, judges, and ultimately delivers His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/86.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) See Note, <a href="/psalms/54-3.htm" title="For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them.
