Biblically, delighting in life is often associated with living in accordance with God's will and commandments. In the wisdom literature, such as Proverbs, delight in life is linked to the fear of the Lord and the pursuit of righteousness (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The question implies that true delight is not found in material wealth or earthly pleasures but in a life aligned with divine principles. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>, where He speaks of offering life abundantly to His followers.<p><b>who desires to see good days?</b><br>The desire to see good days reflects a longing for peace, prosperity, and well-being. In the historical context of ancient Israel, "good days" would have included safety from enemies, fruitful harvests, and harmonious community life. Theologically, this desire is connected to the blessings of obedience to God's covenant, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings are promised for those who follow God's commands. The phrase also echoes the eschatological hope found in the prophets, where the ultimate "good days" are realized in the coming of God's kingdom. In the New Testament, this is fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ, who inaugurates the kingdom of God and offers eternal life, the ultimate "good days," to believers (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, who wrote this psalm after pretending to be insane before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.

This event is recorded in <a href="/1_samuel/21-10.htm">1 Samuel 21:10-15</a>, where David's cunning act led to his escape, demonstrating God's protection and provision.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_audience.htm">The Audience</a></b><br>The psalm is directed towards the people of Israel and, by extension, to all believers who seek to live a life pleasing to God and desire His blessings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/desire_for_life.htm">Desire for Life</a></b><br>The verse begins with a rhetorical question, prompting self-reflection on one's desires.

Rather than isolating a select few, he invites anyone who longs for blessing to lean in.<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, this appeal is universal: &#8220;Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1-3</a>) and &#8220;Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/17-7.htm">Jeremiah 17:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter echoes this verse almost word-for-word, applying it to believers of every age (<a href="/1_peter/3-10.htm">1 Peter 3:10</a>).<p>&#8226; By addressing &#8220;the man,&#8221; David sets the stage for personal reflection: Am I that person? Do I qualify for what follows?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Delights in life</b><p>&#8226; To &#8220;delight in life&#8221; is to prize the days God gives, receiving them as gracious gifts rather than mere existence. Jesus affirmed this quality of life: &#8220;I have come that they may have life, and have it in all its fullness&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture insists that true enjoyment flows from walking with God: &#8220;There is nothing better for a man than to eat, drink, and enjoy his work; this also I have seen is from the hand of God&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul told Timothy that God &#8220;richly provides us with everything to enjoy&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17-19</a>). Such pleasure is rooted in gratitude, stewardship, and obedience, never in selfish indulgence.<p>&#8226; This delight looks forward as well: &#8220;Beloved, I pray that in every way you may prosper and enjoy good health, as your soul also prospers&#8221; (3 <a href="/bsb/john/2.htm">John 2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Desires to see good days</b><p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;good days&#8221; pictures both quality and longevity&#8212;days marked by the visible favor of God. David immediately explains how to experience them: &#8220;Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from deceitful speech. Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-13.htm">Psalm 34:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Good days&#8221; are promised elsewhere: &#8220;Honor your father and mother&#8230;that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-2.htm">Ephesians 6:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Proverbs reinforces the link between obedience and well-being: &#8220;My son, do not forget my teaching&#8230;for they will prolong your life many years and bring you peace and prosperity&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Ultimately, every &#8220;good day&#8221; flows from fellowship with the Shepherd: &#8220;Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>). Even in trial, the believer&#8217;s days are considered &#8220;good&#8221; because God&#8217;s presence and purpose fill them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/34-12.htm">Psalm 34:12</a> confronts us with a simple yet searching question. Anyone who genuinely wants life&#8217;s fullness and God&#8217;s favor must heed the instructions that follow&#8212;guarding speech, rejecting evil, doing good, and pursuing peace. The promise is not merely longer days but better ones, saturated with the goodness God delights to lavish on those who seek Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/34.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Desireth life.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">the man delighting in life. </span>These gnomic sayings are echoes from the book of Proverbs.
