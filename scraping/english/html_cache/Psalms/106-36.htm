The worship of idols was strictly forbidden in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>), yet the Israelites repeatedly fell into this sin, influenced by the surrounding pagan cultures. The worship of idols often involved rituals and practices that were abominable to God, such as child sacrifice and temple prostitution. This idolatry was not merely a religious failure but a breach of the covenant relationship with God, who had delivered them from Egypt and established them as His chosen people. The prophets frequently condemned this practice, calling the people back to exclusive worship of Yahweh (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/10.htm">Jeremiah 10:1-16</a>).<p><b>which became a snare to them</b><br>The term "snare" suggests a trap or a source of entanglement, indicating that idolatry led to the Israelites' downfall. This imagery is consistent with warnings found in the Law, where God cautioned that the idols of the nations would become a snare (<a href="/exodus/23-33.htm">Exodus 23:33</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/7-16.htm">Deuteronomy 7:16</a>). The consequences of idolatry were severe, leading to spiritual blindness, moral decay, and ultimately, divine judgment. The snare of idolatry often resulted in the Israelites being conquered and oppressed by foreign nations, as seen in the cycles of the Book of Judges. This phrase also serves as a warning to believers about the dangers of allowing anything to take the place of God in their lives, echoing the New Testament teachings against idolatry (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-14.htm">1 Corinthians 10:14, 1</a> <a href="/john/5-21.htm">John 5:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from Egypt but repeatedly fell into idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised to the Israelites, where they encountered pagan nations and their idols.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>Objects of worship that the Israelites adopted from surrounding nations, contrary to God's commandments.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who warned them against idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pagan_nations.htm">Pagan Nations</a></b><br>The surrounding cultures in Canaan that influenced the Israelites to worship false gods.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but can be anything that takes the place of God in our lives.

The psalmist is recounting how Israel, a people who had personally witnessed the Red Sea miracle, deliberately diverted the reverence that rightfully belonged to the LORD (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Worship is exclusive&#8212;Jesus reaffirmed it: &#8220;Worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/4-10.htm">Matthew 4:10</a>).<p>&#8226; When that exclusivity is violated, God calls it spiritual adultery (<a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>).<p>So the opening words indict the heart, not merely the outward ritual.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>their idols</b><p>The phrase exposes the substitute. These false gods were man-made, powerless objects (<a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>), yet Israel treated them as if they could speak, hear, or save.<p>&#8226; Idols often mirrored the culture&#8217;s appetite&#8212;fertility, prosperity, security (<a href="/1_kings/18-26.htm">1 Kings 18:26-29</a>).<p>&#8226; Modern parallels exist whenever anything other than God directs our trust or shapes our identity (<a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>).<p>Because Scripture is literal and accurate, the text is not just ancient history; it describes a pattern of misplaced devotion that still snares hearts today.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which became</b><p>The verb points to an inevitable transformation: what began as voluntary worship turned into bondage. God had warned, &#8220;If you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land&#8230; they will become a snare&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/23-33.htm">Exodus 23:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Sin promises freedom but morphs into slavery (<a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34</a>).<p>&#8226; What we serve eventually shapes us (<a href="/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16-18</a>).<p>The change is not accidental; it is the predictable outcome of ignoring God&#8217;s clear commands.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a snare</b><p>A snare is a hidden trap meant to capture prey.
