The psalmist seeks to be distinguished from the wicked, emphasizing a desire for righteousness. In biblical context, the "wicked" often refers to those who live in opposition to God's laws. The imagery of being "dragged away" suggests a forceful removal, possibly alluding to judgment or exile, which was a common consequence for disobedience in ancient Israel. This plea can be connected to the broader biblical theme of separation between the righteous and the wicked, as seen in parables like the wheat and the tares (<a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30</a>).<p><b>and with the workers of iniquity</b><br>"Workers of iniquity" denotes those who actively engage in sinful behavior. The term "iniquity" implies a deep moral corruption and deliberate wrongdoing. This phrase highlights the psalmist's awareness of the pervasive nature of sin and the active role some take in perpetuating it. Historically, Israel faced many internal and external threats from those who practiced iniquity, leading to societal and spiritual decay. The psalmist's request underscores a desire for personal integrity and divine discernment.<p><b>who speak peace to their neighbors</b><br>This phrase addresses the duplicity of the wicked, who outwardly express peace while harboring ill intentions. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, community and neighborly relations were vital for survival and prosperity. The act of speaking peace while plotting harm is a betrayal of trust and community values. This duplicity is condemned throughout scripture, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/26-24.htm">Proverbs 26:24-26</a>, which warns against those who disguise their hatred with charming words.<p><b>while malice is in their hearts</b><br>The contrast between outward expressions and inner intentions is stark here. "Malice" indicates a deep-seated desire to harm others, revealing the true nature of the wicked. This internal corruption is a recurring theme in scripture, where the heart is often seen as the source of both good and evil (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>). The psalmist's insight into the human heart aligns with Jesus' teachings in the New Testament, where He emphasizes the importance of inner purity over outward appearances (<a href="/matthew/15-18.htm">Matthew 15:18-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of this psalm, David is expressing a plea for divine justice and protection from deceitful and wicked individuals.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>These are individuals characterized by their deceitful nature, speaking peace outwardly while harboring malice internally.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/workers_of_iniquity.htm">Workers of Iniquity</a></b><br>This term refers to those who actively engage in sinful behavior, contributing to the moral decay of society.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbors.htm">Neighbors</a></b><br>The people to whom the wicked speak peace, representing those who may be deceived by outward appearances.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and protector, whom David is appealing to for deliverance and justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_relationships.htm">Discernment in Relationships</a></b><br>As believers, we must seek God's wisdom to discern the true intentions of those around us, recognizing that not everyone who speaks peace has pure motives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_of_heart.htm">Integrity of Heart</a></b><br>We are called to align our words with our hearts, ensuring that our outward expressions of peace are genuine and not tainted by hidden malice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_for_protection.htm">Prayer for Protection</a></b><br>Like David, we should regularly pray for God's protection against those who may seek to harm us through deceit and wickedness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_divine_justice.htm">Trust in Divine Justice</a></b><br>We can find comfort in knowing that God is aware of the true nature of every heart and will ultimately bring justice to those who practice iniquity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/self-examination.htm">Self-Examination</a></b><br>This verse challenges us to examine our own hearts, ensuring that we are not guilty of the same duplicity we seek to avoid in others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_28_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 28:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_joining_the_wicked_2.htm">How can we avoid being "dragged away with the wicked" in Psalm 28:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_28_3_on_wicked_deceitfulness.htm">What does Psalm 28:3 teach about the deceitful nature of the wicked?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_28_3_Prov_4_14-15_Avoid_evil.htm">How does Psalm 28:3 connect with Proverbs 4:14-15 on avoiding evil paths?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_spot_malice_in_peaceful_words.htm">In what ways can we discern "peace" words that hide "malice" intentions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_28_3_Praying_against_deceit.htm">How can Psalm 28:3 guide our prayers for protection from deceitful influences?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_28_3_on_God_s_view_of_deceit.htm">What does Psalm 28:3 reveal about God's view on deceitful behavior?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_28_3_Justice_and_divine_retribution.htm">How does Psalm 28:3 challenge our understanding of justice and divine retribution?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Psalm_28_3_address_hypocrisy.htm">In what ways does Psalm 28:3 address the issue of hypocrisy among believers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_28.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_bible's_stance_on_slander.htm">What is the Bible's stance on slander?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_psalm_28_2's_temple_timeline.htm">In Psalm 28:2, which references the &#8220;most holy sanctuary,&#8221; how do we reconcile questions about the historicity or exact timeline of the temple&#8217;s existence? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_is_god_hidden_in_innocent_suffering.htm">If God is omnipresent, why does He appear hidden when the innocent suffer?
