The "waters" symbolize God's power and judgment, as seen in <a href="/exodus/14-28.htm">Exodus 14:28</a>, where the sea returned to its normal state, covering the chariots and horsemen. This event is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, demonstrating God's sovereignty and faithfulness. The Red Sea crossing is also a type of baptism, symbolizing the believer's passage from death to life, as noted in <a href="/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-2</a>. Geographically, the Red Sea is a significant body of water that separates the Arabian Peninsula from Africa, and its crossing is a testament to God's control over creation.<p><b>not one of them remained.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the totality of God's victory over the Egyptians. It underscores the completeness of God's deliverance and judgment, as not a single Egyptian soldier survived. This total destruction of the enemy is a recurring theme in Scripture, illustrating God's ability to protect His people and fulfill His promises. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a>, where death and Hades are thrown into the lake of fire.
