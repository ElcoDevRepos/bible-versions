In the ancient Near Eastern context, brooks or streams were vital sources of water, especially in arid regions. The imagery of drinking from a brook can symbolize humility and reliance on God's provision. In biblical typology, this act can be seen as a representation of Jesus Christ's humanity and His reliance on the Father during His earthly ministry. The brook by the road indicates a place of transition or journey, possibly alluding to the path of obedience and suffering that Christ undertook. This imagery connects to other scriptures where water is a symbol of life and sustenance, such as in <a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>, where God leads His people beside still waters.<p><b>therefore He will lift up His head.</b><br>Lifting up one's head is a sign of victory, confidence, and restoration. In the context of <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>, which is a messianic psalm, this phrase signifies the triumph and exaltation of the Messiah after a period of trial or battle. The act of lifting the head can also denote the resurrection and ascension of Christ, as He is raised to a position of honor and authority. This connects to <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where God exalts Jesus and gives Him the name above every name. Historically, lifting the head was a gesture of dignity and honor, often associated with kingship and divine favor. This phrase encapsulates the ultimate victory of the Messiah, who, after enduring suffering, is gloriously vindicated.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_messiah.htm">The Messiah (Christ)</a></b><br>The primary figure in <a href="/bsb/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>, often interpreted as a Messianic prophecy pointing to Jesus Christ.

In <a href="/judges/15-18.htm">Judges 15:18-19</a> Samson drinks and regains strength; likewise, Christ endures the struggle, then receives sustenance (<a href="/john/19-28.htm">John 19:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Because Scripture speaks literally and without error, we see an actual moment: the Lord pausing to drink as He advances in victory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the brook</b><p>&#8226; A brook is a running stream, a ready supply that God provides (<a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>).<p>&#8226; David crossed the Kidron brook on the road out of Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/15-23.htm">2 Samuel 15:23</a>); Jesus crossed the same Kidron when heading to Gethsemane (<a href="/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1</a>).
