Biblically, the sun is often associated with God's creation and His control over time and seasons (<a href="/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14-19</a>). The rising sun can symbolize God's faithfulness and the renewal of His mercies each day (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>). In a broader theological context, the sun's rising is a reminder of Christ, the "Sun of Righteousness," who brings light and life (<a href="/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>).<p><b>and they withdraw</b><br>The "they" in this context refers to the nocturnal animals mentioned earlier in the psalm, such as lions. These creatures retreat as the day begins, illustrating the natural rhythm of life ordained by God. This withdrawal signifies the transition from night to day, a time when humans typically begin their activities. The orderly behavior of animals reflects God's wisdom in creation, as seen in <a href="/job/38.htm">Job 38-39</a>, where God questions Job about the natural world and its creatures.<p><b>they lie down in their dens</b><br>This phrase indicates the resting place of the animals after their nightly activities. Dens provide safety and shelter, symbolizing God's provision for all His creatures. The imagery of animals lying down in their dens can also be seen as a metaphor for peace and security, themes prevalent throughout Scripture (<a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>). In a spiritual sense, it can remind believers of the rest and refuge found in God, as Jesus invites those who are weary to find rest in Him (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sun.htm">The Sun</a></b><br>Represents the natural order and the daily cycle established by God.

When &#8220;the sun rises,&#8221; it marks the precise moment He ordained for night&#8217;s creatures to yield to day. Scripture consistently treats the sun as a literal, dependable servant of the Creator (<a href="/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14-18</a>; <a href="/psalms/19-4.htm">Psalm 19:4-6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>). Each dawn testifies that God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness never falters (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>). The same Lord who spoke light into existence still governs its rhythm; the predictable sunrise invites trust that every aspect of life rests under His steady rule.<p>&#8226; God sets times and seasons, not chance.<p>&#8226; Light exposes, clarifies, and limits darkness&#8212;physically and morally (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Every sunrise is a fresh reminder of God&#8217;s mercy and order.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they withdraw</b><p>&#8220;Them&#8221; refers to the nocturnal predators just mentioned (v. 21). At dawn they &#8220;withdraw,&#8221; literally retreating because a boundary has been drawn. Their instinct is no accident; it mirrors God&#8217;s governance over the animal kingdom (<a href="/job/38-39.htm">Job 38:39-41</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29</a>). Predators prowl only within the slot God assigns, then pull back when He signals. This underscores:<p>&#8226; Divine authority channels even the fiercest forces.<p>&#8226; Creation&#8217;s balance&#8212;hunting by night, rest by day&#8212;protects weaker creatures and preserves harmony (<a href="/psalms/147-9.htm">Psalm 147:9</a>; <a href="/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Human life likewise flourishes when we recognize and respect God-given boundaries (<a href="/proverbs/8-29.htm">Proverbs 8:29-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they lie down in their dens</b><p>Once withdrawn, the animals &#8220;lie down in their dens.&#8221; God not only limits their activity; He provides refuge for their rest (<a href="/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>; <a href="/nahum/1-7.htm">Nahum 1:7</a>). What seems merely instinctive is actually sustained by the Creator&#8217;s constant care. He furnishes places of safety for beasts&#8212;and infinitely more for people who bear His image (<a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1-4</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>).<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; Rest is God&#8217;s gift, built into the fabric of creation (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Even mighty lions need shelter; human strength is no exemption (<a href="/psalms/34-10.htm">Psalm 34:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-30.htm">Isaiah 40:30-31</a>).<p>&#8226; Trusting God&#8217;s provision allows true rest, both physically and spiritually (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/104-22.htm">Psalm 104:22</a> highlights God&#8217;s flawless ordering of day and night. He summons the sun, signals predators to retreat, and grants them dens for rest. Every sunrise proclaims His faithfulness; every withdrawal of darkness reveals His rule; every den testifies to His provision. Living in step with that rhythm brings confidence, security, and rest under the steadfast care of the Creator.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/104.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Lay them down.</span>--With sunrise all is changed. The Wild animals, with their savage instincts, give way to man with his orderly habits and arranged duties. The curse of labour, on which the account in Genesis dwells, is here entirely out of sight, and instead there appears the "poetry of labour." And if all sense of the primal curse has disappeared, the later curse, which lies so heavy on the modern generations of overworked men,<p>"Who make perpetual moan,<p>Still from one labour to another thrown,"<p>has not appeared. The day brings only healthy toil, and the evening happy rest.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/104.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22, 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sun ariseth.</span> Bright beams of light flame up the eastern sky; and earth basks in the sun's smile.
