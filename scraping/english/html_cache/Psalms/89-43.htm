In biblical times, a sharp sword was essential for victory in battle, symbolizing strength and effectiveness. The bending of the sword's edge implies a divine intervention that renders the weapon ineffective. This can be seen as a metaphor for God withdrawing His support or favor, leading to a loss of strength and capability. Historically, Israel's victories were often attributed to God's support, and their defeats to His displeasure. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where God is depicted as the one who grants or withholds victory (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>, <a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3-7</a>).<p><b>and have not sustained him in battle</b><br>The lack of sustenance in battle indicates a withdrawal of divine support, which was crucial for success in ancient warfare. In the context of the Davidic covenant, where God promised to establish David's throne forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>), this phrase reflects a period of perceived abandonment or judgment. Theologically, it underscores the belief that human strength and military might are insufficient without God's blessing. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, which emphasizes reliance on the Lord rather than on chariots and horses. The historical context may refer to times when Israel faced defeat due to disobedience or turning away from God, illustrating the conditional nature of divine favor based on covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ethan_the_ezrahite.htm">Ethan the Ezrahite</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, traditionally believed to be a wise man during the time of Solomon.

Here that support is withheld.<p>- The king&#8212;likely a Davidic ruler in crisis (see <a href="/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>)&#8212;finds no upholding hand. In contrast, <a href="/deuteronomy/31-8.htm">Deuteronomy 31:8</a> promises, &#8220;The LORD Himself goes before you; He will be with you.&#8221; The psalmist laments the absence of that pledge.<p>- The literal battlefield loss mirrors a deeper covenant tension. God is not breaking His oath (<a href="/psalms/89-34.htm">Psalm 89:34</a>); He is disciplining (<a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>) so the king&#8212;and the nation&#8212;will repent and seek mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in battle</b><p>- The defeat is real, not metaphorical. Armies clash, Jerusalem trembles, and the throne appears threatened (<a href="/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6-10</a>).<p>- Yet even in loss, the psalm anchors hope in God&#8217;s unaltered promise to David (<a href="/psalms/89-35.htm">Psalm 89:35-37</a>). <a href="/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a> has Moses cry, &#8220;Rise up, O LORD, may Your enemies be scattered,&#8221; but here the enemies advance because the Lord has chosen not to rise&#8212;temporarily.<p>- The section presses readers to recognize that victory belongs to the Lord alone (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).

The verse affirms that military strength and national security flow directly from divine favor; when that favor is lifted, defeat follows. Yet within the wider psalm, this setback is a momentary discipline meant to drive the covenant people back to wholehearted trust in the God who can just as easily restore the edge to the sword and stand by His king in victory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/89.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(43) <span class= "bld">Edge of his sword.</span>--The Hebrew is <span class= "ital">ts-r, i.e., rock, </span>and a comparison with <a href="/joshua/5-2.htm" title="At that time the LORD said to Joshua, Make you sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.">Joshua 5:2</a> (margin) suggests that we have here a reminiscence of the "stone age." The word "flint" for the edge of a weapon might easily survive the actual use of the implement itself. So we should still speak of "a foeman's steel" even if the use of chemical explosives entirely abolished the use of sword and bayonet. This is one of the cases where the condition of modern science helps us in exegesis of the Bible.
