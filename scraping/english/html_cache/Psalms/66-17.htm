In biblical times, crying out to God was a common practice, reflecting a deep sense of need or urgency. The act of crying out is seen throughout the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/3-4.htm">Psalm 3:4</a>, <a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>) and signifies a personal and direct communication with God. It reflects the belief that God is attentive to the cries of His people (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>). The use of the mouth in prayer highlights the importance of spoken words in worship and supplication, as seen in the practices of ancient Israel.<p><b>and praised Him with my tongue.</b><br>Praising God with the tongue indicates a verbal expression of worship and gratitude. This phrase underscores the importance of acknowledging God's attributes and deeds through spoken praise. The tongue, as a symbol of speech, is often mentioned in the Bible as a powerful tool for both blessing and cursing (<a href="/james/3-9.htm">James 3:9-10</a>). In the context of worship, it is used to glorify God, as seen in other Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34:1</a>, <a href="/psalms/51-15.htm">Psalm 51:15</a>). This act of praise is not only a personal expression but also a communal one, as the Israelites often gathered to sing and declare God's praises together, reflecting a shared faith and devotion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/66.htm">Psalm 66</a>, traditionally attributed to David, who is expressing a personal testimony of God's deliverance and the response of praise.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure to whom the Psalmist cries out and offers praise, highlighting His role as a deliverer and worthy of worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_act_of_praise.htm">The Act of Praise</a></b><br>The event of vocalizing gratitude and worship, emphasizing the importance of verbal expression in one's relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_vocal_praise.htm">The Power of Vocal Praise</a></b><br>Vocalizing praise is a powerful act of faith and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty.
