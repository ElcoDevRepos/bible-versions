In the ancient Near Eastern context, the east and west were seen as opposite ends of the earth, symbolizing an immeasurable distance. This imagery is used to convey the complete and total separation of our sins from us once they are forgiven by God. Unlike north and south, which have definitive poles, east and west continue indefinitely, highlighting the boundless nature of God's forgiveness. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>, where God promises to blot out transgressions for His own sake and remember sins no more.<p><b>so far has He removed our transgressions from us</b><br>The removal of transgressions signifies a divine act of grace and mercy. In the Old Testament, the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) involved the symbolic removal of Israel's sins through the scapegoat ritual, where a goat was sent into the wilderness, carrying the sins of the people away (<a href="/leviticus/16-10.htm">Leviticus 16:10</a>). This act prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who bore the sins of humanity on the cross, as described in <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>. The phrase underscores the completeness of God's forgiveness, assuring believers that their sins are not merely covered but entirely taken away. This assurance is foundational to the Christian understanding of salvation and redemption, as seen in passages like <a href="/micah/7-19.htm">Micah 7:19</a>, where God promises to cast all sins into the depths of the sea.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103</a>, King David, is expressing his gratitude and awe for God's mercy and forgiveness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is portrayed as the one who forgives and removes transgressions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/east_and_west.htm">East and West</a></b><br>These directions are used metaphorically to illustrate the infinite distance God places between us and our sins.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_forgiveness.htm">Understanding God's Forgiveness</a></b><br>God's forgiveness is complete and infinite.
