The shofar was blown to announce the start of festivals, to call people to worship, and to signal important events (<a href="/leviticus/23-24.htm">Leviticus 23:24</a>, <a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a>). Its sound is a call to attention, symbolizing the power and majesty of God. The use of the horn in worship highlights the importance of audibly proclaiming God's greatness. The shofar is also associated with the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>) and is a reminder of God's covenant with His people.<p><b>praise Him with the harp and lyre.</b><br>The harp and lyre were stringed instruments commonly used in ancient Israelite worship. The harp, or "kinnor," is often associated with King David, who played it to soothe King Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/16-23.htm">1 Samuel 16:23</a>). The lyre, or "nebel," was another popular instrument in temple worship. These instruments were used to accompany psalms and hymns, creating a melodic and harmonious atmosphere for worship. The use of these instruments signifies the beauty and artistry involved in praising God, reflecting the creativity endowed by the Creator. The inclusion of musical instruments in worship is a testament to the joy and celebration inherent in acknowledging God's sovereignty and goodness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/150.htm">Psalm 150</a>, traditionally attributed to King David, who is known for his musical talents and deep devotion to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_worship.htm">Temple Worship</a></b><br>The context of this psalm is likely related to the worship practices in the Temple in Jerusalem, where music played a significant role.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/musicians_and_levites.htm">Musicians and Levites</a></b><br>Those who were appointed to play instruments and lead worship in the Temple, emphasizing the organized and communal aspect of worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/instruments.htm">Instruments</a></b><br>The trumpet, harp, and lyre are mentioned, highlighting the variety of musical expressions used in praising God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of Israel, for whom the psalms were a central part of their worship and spiritual life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_music_in_worship.htm">The Role of Music in Worship</a></b><br>Music is a powerful tool for expressing praise and adoration to God.
