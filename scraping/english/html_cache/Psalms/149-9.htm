The "judgment written" suggests a predetermined plan or decree, possibly referring to the Law of Moses or prophetic declarations found in the Old Testament. This aligns with the biblical theme of God as a righteous judge who enforces His laws and promises. The execution of judgment by the faithful indicates their role in God's plan, reminiscent of Israel's conquests in the Promised Land under Joshua, where they acted as instruments of divine justice. This also foreshadows the eschatological judgment where believers will participate in God's final victory over evil, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>.<p><b>This honor is for all His saints.</b><br>The term "saints" refers to those set apart for God, often used in the Old Testament for Israel and in the New Testament for believers in Christ. The "honor" bestowed upon them is the privilege of participating in God's righteous judgment, a theme echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/6-2.htm">1 Corinthians 6:2-3</a>, where Paul states that the saints will judge the world and even angels. This reflects the high calling and responsibility of God's people to uphold His justice and righteousness. It underscores the communal aspect of faith, where all believers share in the mission and victory of God, not just a select few.<p><b>Hallelujah!</b><br>This exclamation of praise, meaning "Praise the Lord," is a fitting conclusion to the psalm, emphasizing the joy and reverence due to God for His justice and faithfulness. It serves as a reminder of the ultimate purpose of God's actions: His glory and the worship of His people. The use of "Hallelujah" connects this psalm to the broader biblical tradition of praise, seen throughout the Psalms and in the heavenly worship depicted in <a href="/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19:1-6</a>. It calls believers to respond to God's righteous acts with worship and adoration, recognizing His sovereignty and goodness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_saints.htm">The Saints</a></b><br>Refers to the faithful followers of God, often seen as those who are set apart for His purposes.
