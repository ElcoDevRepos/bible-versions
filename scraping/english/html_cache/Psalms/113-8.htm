In biblical context, God often chooses the lowly and raises them to prominence, as seen in the stories of Joseph, David, and Esther. This reflects God's sovereignty and His ability to overturn societal norms. The concept of being seated with nobles signifies a place of dignity and respect, often reserved for those of high status. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the believer's future glorification, as described in <a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6</a>, where believers are seated with Christ in the heavenly realms.<p><b>with the princes of His people</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the inclusion of the humble among the leaders of God's chosen people. Historically, Israel was led by judges, kings, and prophets, who were considered princes or leaders. The elevation of the humble to such positions underscores God's justice and His ability to transform lives. It also points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who is the Prince of Peace and the King of Kings, and who calls His followers to share in His reign. This is echoed in <a href="/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>, where believers are made a kingdom and priests to serve God and reign on the earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/113.htm">Psalm 113</a>, traditionally attributed to King David, who is expressing praise to God for His mighty works and His care for the humble.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/princes.htm">Princes</a></b><br>Symbolic of those in positions of authority and honor.
