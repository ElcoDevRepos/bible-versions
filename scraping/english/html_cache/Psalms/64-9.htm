The fear mentioned here is not merely terror but a reverential awe. Throughout Scripture, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). This fear is a response to witnessing God's righteous acts, often seen in the context of His deliverance of the righteous and judgment of the wicked. Historically, when God acted decisively, such as during the Exodus, surrounding nations feared Him (<a href="/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14-16</a>).<p><b>and proclaim the work of God;</b><br>Proclaiming God's work involves acknowledging His deeds and declaring them to others. This is a call to testify about God's interventions and mighty acts. In the biblical narrative, God's works are often recounted in songs and psalms, serving as a reminder of His faithfulness and power (<a href="/psalms/105.htm">Psalm 105:1-5</a>). The proclamation is not just for the Israelites but for all nations, pointing to the universal scope of God's sovereignty.<p><b>so they will ponder what He has done.</b><br>Pondering implies deep reflection and consideration. This phrase encourages meditation on God's actions, leading to a greater understanding of His character and purposes. In the Hebrew tradition, meditation on God's works and law is a key aspect of spiritual life (<a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>). This reflection can lead to repentance, worship, and a deeper relationship with God. The acts of God, whether in creation, history, or personal life, are meant to draw people closer to Him and reveal His glory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mankind.htm">Mankind</a></b><br>Refers to all people, emphasizing the universal impact of God's actions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure whose works are being proclaimed and pondered.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_works_of_god.htm">The Works of God</a></b><br>The mighty acts and judgments of God that lead to reverence and reflection among people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universal_impact_of_god's_works.htm">The Universal Impact of God's Works</a></b><br>God's actions are not limited to a specific group but are meant to be recognized by all humanity.

This is not a vague respect; it is genuine, heart-level awe similar to what Israel felt at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-31.htm">Exodus 14:31</a>) and what the church anticipates at Christ&#8217;s return (<a href="/revelation/15-4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture teaches that &#8220;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). When God acts, He reveals Himself as the One who deserves undiluted reverence.<p>&#8226; The scope&#8212;&#8220;all mankind&#8221;&#8212;reminds us that God&#8217;s glory will reach every corner of the earth, echoing <a href="/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a>: &#8220;For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD as the waters cover the sea.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and proclaim the work of God</b><p>&#8226; Fear does not paralyze; it propels testimony. Those who witness God&#8217;s deliverance will &#8220;proclaim&#8221; (declare, tell aloud) what He has done, as Israel did after crossing the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/4-23.htm">Joshua 4:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture frequently couples reverence with verbal witness: &#8220;Sing to the LORD, proclaim His salvation day after day, declare His glory among the nations&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-23.htm">1 Chronicles 16:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; This proclamation exalts God&#8217;s character&#8212;His justice against wickedness (<a href="/psalms/64-7.htm">Psalm 64:7-8</a>) and His faithful defense of the righteous (<a href="/psalms/64-1.htm">Psalm 64:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so they will ponder what He has done</b><p>&#8226; Beyond immediate praise, people will &#8220;ponder&#8221; (consider deeply) God&#8217;s deeds. The call is to meditate, much like Asaph: &#8220;I will remember the works of the LORD; yes, I will remember Your wonders of old. I will reflect on all You have done and ponder Your mighty deeds&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Pondering guards against forgetfulness and fuels continual worship (<a href="/psalms/111-2.htm">Psalm 111:2</a>). It turns a momentary experience into lifelong transformation, inspiring obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Reflection cements the lesson David intends: God hears prayer, judges evil, and vindicates His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/64-9.htm">Psalm 64:9</a> assures us that when God intervenes, the whole world will stand in awe, openly declare His mighty works, and thoughtfully dwell on His deeds.
