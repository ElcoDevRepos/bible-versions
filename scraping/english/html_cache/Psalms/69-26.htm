In the biblical context, this can be seen as a reference to David, who often felt pursued by enemies during times of personal trial. Theologically, it reflects the idea that God sometimes allows His people to undergo suffering for a greater purpose, and yet others may unjustly exploit these moments of vulnerability. This can be connected to the suffering servant motif found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the servant is struck by God yet is also persecuted by others. It also foreshadows the persecution of Jesus Christ, who was struck down by God&#8217;s will for the redemption of humanity and yet was also persecuted by human authorities.<p><b>and recount the pain of those You wounded.</b><br>This phrase indicates that the persecutors not only attack but also take pleasure in recounting or remembering the suffering of those whom God has allowed to be wounded. Historically, recounting the pain of others could be seen as a form of mockery or a way to justify their actions against the afflicted. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, recounting someone&#8217;s pain could also imply a lack of compassion and a hardening of heart, which is condemned in various parts of Scripture. This connects to the broader biblical theme of God&#8217;s justice and mercy, where God is aware of the suffering of His people and will ultimately bring justice. It also points to the experience of Christ, who bore the wounds of humanity and whose suffering was recounted by His followers as a testament to His sacrifice and victory over sin.<div

hostility. See the wider backdrop in <a href="/psalms/69-1.htm">Psalm 69:1&#8211;4</a>, where he says, &#8220;Save me, O God, for the waters are up to my neck,&#8221; revealing real, not merely poetic, distress.<p>&#8226; David speaks not only for himself but prophetically for the Messiah; the New Testament applies several lines from this psalm to Christ&#8217;s suffering (<a href="/john/2-17.htm">John 2:17</a>; <a href="/romans/15-3.htm">Romans 15:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Verses 22&#8211;28, where v. 26 sits, describe the wicked response of David&#8217;s enemies&#8212;and ultimately Christ&#8217;s enemies&#8212;to God&#8217;s servant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;For they persecute the one You struck&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The persecutors exploit what God has allowed:<p>&#8211; David recognizes that God&#8217;s hand of discipline is on him (<a href="/psalms/38-1.htm">Psalm 38:1&#8211;4</a>), yet others use that discipline as an excuse to pile on.<p>&#8211; Job felt a similar double blow: &#8220;Why do you persecute me as God does?&#8221; (<a href="/job/19-22.htm">Job 19:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The irony is sharp:<p>&#8211; Instead of humbling themselves at God&#8217;s evident action, these enemies intensify their attacks, showing hearts hardened against both God and His servant (<a href="/isaiah/57-4.htm">Isaiah 57:4&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8211; In Christ, this reaches its apex. Though &#8220;we considered Him stricken by God&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>), people still mocked Him on the cross (<a href="/matthew/27-41.htm">Matthew 27:41&#8211;44</a>).<p>&#8226; Truths to take home:<p>&#8211; God may discipline His own children, but He condemns those who exploit that discipline for cruelty (<a href="/zechariah/1-15.htm">Zechariah 1:15</a>).<p>&#8211; Suffering believers can know that hostility does not escape God&#8217;s notice; He distinguishes between His fatherly correction and man&#8217;s malice (<a href="/psalms/94-12.htm">Psalm 94:12&#8211;13, 23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and recount the pain of those You wounded.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Recount&#8221; pictures spiteful storytelling&#8212;keeping a ledger of another&#8217;s misery:<p>&#8211; The enemies are not passive observers; they gloat and spread accounts of David&#8217;s suffering (<a href="/psalms/35-15.htm">Psalm 35:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8211; Obadiah denounces Edom for this very sin: &#8220;You should not have gloated over your brother in the day of his misfortune&#8221; (<a href="/obadiah/1-12.htm">Obadiah 1:12</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Those You wounded&#8221; reaffirms that God&#8217;s servant is under divine chastening, yet others exploit it:<p>&#8211; In <a href="/lamentations/1-12.htm">Lamentations 1:12</a>, Jerusalem laments that her sorrow is from the LORD, but passers-by merely stare.<p>&#8211; On Golgotha, the crowds rehearse Jesus&#8217; pain for sport: &#8220;He saved others; He cannot save Himself&#8221; (<a href="/mark/15-31.htm">Mark 15:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Lessons for believers:<p>&#8211; Guard against rehearsing others&#8217; grief; love &#8220;does not rejoice in unrighteousness&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-6.htm">1 Corinthians 13:6</a>).<p>&#8211; Trust that God will vindicate His wounded ones and judge those who savor their pain (<a href="/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/69-26.htm">Psalm 69:26</a> exposes enemies who capitalize on God-permitted affliction. They pursue the already stricken and broadcast their misery for ridicule. The verse warns against cruel opportunism and assures the faithful that God distinguishes between His corrective hand and man&#8217;s persecution. Ultimately, it foreshadows Christ, &#8220;smitten of God, and afflicted,&#8221; yet scorned by men&#8212;reminding us that our Savior shares fully in the sufferings of all who are unjustly hounded while under God&#8217;s sovereign care.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/69.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">They talk . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and respecting the pain of thy pierced ones, they talk. </span>(For the construction of this verb <span class= "ital">talk, </span>see <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm" title="I will declare the decree: the LORD has said to me, You are my Son; this day have I begotten you.">Psalm 2:7</a>.)
