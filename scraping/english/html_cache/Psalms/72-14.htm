The concept of redemption is deeply rooted in the Hebrew tradition, where a kinsman-redeemer would buy back or rescue a relative from slavery or debt (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>). This anticipates the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who redeems humanity from the bondage of sin (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>). The mention of "oppression and violence" reflects the social injustices prevalent in ancient Israel and surrounding nations, where the poor and marginalized often suffered under corrupt rulers. The psalmist envisions a just ruler who will protect the vulnerable, echoing the messianic hope for a future king who embodies God's justice and mercy (<a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>).<p><b>for their blood is precious in his sight</b><br>This phrase underscores the value and sanctity of human life in the eyes of God. In biblical times, blood symbolized life itself (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>), and the shedding of innocent blood was a grave offense (<a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>). The psalmist emphasizes that the lives of the oppressed are not overlooked by God; they are precious and worthy of protection. This reflects God's character as a defender of the weak and a judge of the wicked (<a href="/psalms/9-12.htm">Psalm 9:12</a>). The phrase also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Christ's sacrificial death, where His blood is described as precious, redeeming believers from sin (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>). The value placed on human life here aligns with the broader biblical narrative of God's love and care for all people, particularly those who are downtrodden and afflicted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/72.htm">Psalm 72</a>, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom and wealth.

Scripture repeatedly portrays the Lord as the Kinsman-Redeemer who steps into real history to buy back His people:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/103-4.htm">Psalm 103:4</a> &#8211; &#8220;who redeems your life from the pit.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a> &#8211; &#8220;The redeemed of the LORD will return and enter Zion with singing.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68</a> &#8211; &#8220;Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, because He has visited and redeemed His people.&#8221;<p>The promise covers body and soul.

The King&#8217;s authority guarantees both.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from oppression and violence</b><p>God&#8217;s people often face harsh rulers, economic injustice, and physical danger. The verse singles out &#8220;oppression and violence&#8221; to stress that no form of tyranny intimidates the Redeemer. Consider:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/9-9.htm">Psalm 9:9</a> &#8211; &#8220;The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/72-4.htm">Psalm 72:4</a> (earlier in this psalm) &#8211; &#8220;May he vindicate the afflicted among the people and save the children of the needy; may he crush the oppressor.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a> &#8211; Jesus &#8220;went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil.&#8221;<p>Whether the threat arises from corrupt governments, criminal aggression, or satanic forces, the King intervenes. His rule is protective, not merely symbolic.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for their blood is precious</b><p>The motivation behind the rescue is the immense value God places on each life:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/116-15.htm">Psalm 116:15</a> &#8211; &#8220;Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of His saints.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a> &#8211; Life is so sacred that shedding blood demands accountability.<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/10-31.htm">Matthew 10:31</a> &#8211; &#8220;You are worth more than many sparrows.&#8221;<p>Because life is precious, the Redeemer will not tolerate lasting harm to His people.
