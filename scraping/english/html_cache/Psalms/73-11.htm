In biblical literature, "the wicked" often refers to those who live in opposition to God's laws and principles. This group is frequently depicted in the Psalms as being in conflict with the righteous. The term "wicked" is used throughout the Old Testament to describe those who reject God's authority, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a> and <a href="/proverbs/4-14.htm">Proverbs 4:14</a>. The context of <a href="/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a> is a reflection on the apparent prosperity of the wicked, which can be a source of confusion and doubt for the faithful.<p><b>&#8220;How can God know?</b><br>This question reflects a skeptical attitude towards God's omniscience. It suggests a belief that God is either unaware or indifferent to human actions. This skepticism is a common theme in wisdom literature, where the prosperity of the wicked and the suffering of the righteous are often explored. The question challenges the belief in a just and all-knowing God, similar to the doubts expressed in <a href="/job/21-14.htm">Job 21:14-15</a>. It also echoes the serpent's temptation in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>, where doubt is cast on God's word and knowledge.<p><b>Does the Most High have knowledge?&#8221;</b><br>The title "Most High" is a translation of the Hebrew "El Elyon," a name for God that emphasizes His supreme authority and sovereignty over all creation. This title is used in <a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a>, where Melchizedek blesses Abram in the name of "God Most High." The question here implies a challenge to God's ability to perceive and judge human affairs. It reflects a worldview that questions divine justice and oversight, similar to the lament in <a href="/habakkuk/1-2.htm">Habakkuk 1:2-4</a>, where the prophet questions why God allows injustice to prevail. This skepticism is countered throughout scripture by affirmations of God's intimate knowledge and involvement in the world, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, Asaph was a prominent Levite singer and seer in David's court.
