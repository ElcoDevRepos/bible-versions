The breaking of the heart signifies profound sorrow and vulnerability. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, honor and reputation were highly valued, and insults could lead to social isolation and shame. This phrase can be seen as a type of Christ, who also endured insults and rejection, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, "He was despised and rejected by men." The breaking of the heart is a metaphor for the deep emotional and spiritual suffering that Jesus experienced during His passion.<p><b>and I am in despair.</b><br>Despair here indicates a state of hopelessness and deep distress. In the biblical context, despair often arises from a sense of abandonment or overwhelming adversity. The psalmist's despair can be linked to the experiences of other biblical figures, such as Job, who also faced intense suffering and felt abandoned by friends and God. This phrase resonates with the human condition of feeling forsaken, which Jesus Himself expressed on the cross in <a href="/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" It highlights the depth of suffering that can lead to a sense of utter desolation.<p><b>I looked for sympathy, but there was none,</b><br>The search for sympathy underscores the human need for compassion and understanding during times of distress. In the historical context, community and familial support were crucial for emotional and social well-being. The absence of sympathy reflects a profound sense of isolation and betrayal, similar to what Jesus experienced when His disciples deserted Him in His hour of need (<a href="/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a>). This lack of sympathy can also be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/22-11.htm">Psalm 22:11</a>, "Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help."<p><b>for comforters, but I found no one.</b><br>The desire for comforters highlights the need for solace and encouragement. In ancient Near Eastern culture, mourners were often accompanied by professional comforters or friends who would offer support. The absence of comforters emphasizes the depth of the psalmist's isolation and mirrors the experience of Jesus, who found no one to comfort Him during His trials and crucifixion. This phrase connects to the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>, "I have trodden the winepress alone; from the nations no one was with me." It underscores the theme of abandonment and the fulfillment of messianic prophecy through Christ's suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, David is expressing deep personal anguish and seeking God's deliverance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The psalm reflects David's experience of being surrounded by adversaries who scorn and reject him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate source of comfort and deliverance, whom David seeks in his distress.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of David's life and his connection to Jerusalem as the city of God is implicit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/messianic_foreshadowing.htm">Messianic Foreshadowing</a></b><br>This psalm is often seen as prophetic, pointing to the suffering of Christ, who also experienced rejection and scorn.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_emotional_pain.htm">The Reality of Emotional Pain</a></b><br>Acknowledge that even the most faithful believers, like David, experience deep emotional pain and rejection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_god_in_distress.htm">Seeking God in Distress</a></b><br>In times of scorn and loneliness, turn to God as the ultimate source of comfort and strength.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/empathy_and_support.htm">Empathy and Support</a></b><br>As followers of Christ, we are called to be comforters to those in distress, reflecting God's love and compassion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ's_identification_with_our_suffering.htm">Christ's Identification with Our Suffering</a></b><br>Recognize that Jesus fully understands our pain, having endured rejection and scorn Himself.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_god's_deliverance.htm">Hope in God's Deliverance</a></b><br>Trust in God's promise of deliverance and restoration, even when human support is lacking.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_69_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 69:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_find_comfort_after_heartbreak.htm">How can we find comfort when "scorn has broken my heart"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_69_20_on_rejection_loneliness.htm">What does Psalm 69:20 teach about handling rejection and loneliness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_is_Jesus_suffering_linked_to_loneliness.htm">How does Jesus' suffering connect with "no one to comfort me"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_help_others_in_distress.htm">How can we support others experiencing "distress" and "anguish"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_69_20_Rely_on_God_s_presence.htm">How does Psalm 69:20 encourage us to rely on God's presence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_69_20_s_link_to_Jesus_suffering.htm">How does Psalm 69:20 reflect the suffering of Jesus Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_influenced_Psalm_69_20.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 69:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_69_20_and_biblical_rejection.htm">How does Psalm 69:20 relate to the theme of rejection in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_69.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 69?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_evidence_shows_david's_deep_distress.htm">Psalm 69:20 says the psalmist&#8217;s heart was broken by scorn&#8212;what external evidence supports such severe distress in David&#8217;s life?
