"Clean hands" refers to righteous actions and moral integrity, echoing the ceremonial cleanliness required in the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/30-19.htm">Exodus 30:19-21</a>). "Pure heart" points to inner purity and sincerity, aligning with the Beatitudes in <a href="/matthew/5-8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." The dual focus on actions and heart reflects the holistic nature of biblical righteousness, where both deeds and intentions matter. This concept is rooted in the Hebrew understanding of the heart as the center of thought and will, not just emotion.<p><b>who does not lift up his soul to an idol</b><br>This phrase warns against idolatry, a recurring theme in the Old Testament. Idolatry was a significant temptation for Israel, surrounded by nations worshiping various gods. "Lifting up the soul" suggests devotion or allegiance, which should be directed solely to Yahweh. The first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) underscores this exclusivity. In a broader sense, idolatry can represent anything that takes precedence over God in one's life, including wealth, power, or even self. This phrase calls for undivided loyalty to God, a theme echoed in the New Testament, such as in 1 <a href="/john/5-21.htm">John 5:21</a>, "Little children, keep yourselves from idols."<p><b>or swear deceitfully</b><br>This phrase addresses the integrity of one's speech, aligning with the ninth commandment against bearing false witness (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). In ancient Israel, oaths were serious commitments, often invoking God's name as a witness. Swearing deceitfully would not only harm others but also profane God's name. Jesus expands on this in <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>, urging honesty without the need for oaths. The emphasis on truthful speech reflects God's character as truth (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>) and calls believers to mirror that truthfulness in their interactions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24</a>, David was the second king of Israel and a man after God's own heart.
