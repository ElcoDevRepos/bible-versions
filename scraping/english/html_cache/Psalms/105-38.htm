The Egyptians experienced severe suffering due to the ten plagues, which included the death of the firstborn, turning water into blood, and swarms of locusts. The departure of the Israelites marked the end of these calamities, bringing relief to the Egyptians. Historically, this event is significant as it represents the liberation of the Israelites from slavery, a pivotal moment in their history. Theologically, it underscores God's power and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises to His people.<p><b>for the dread of Israel had fallen on them</b><br>The dread mentioned here refers to the fear and awe that the Egyptians felt towards the Israelites and their God. This fear was not only due to the plagues but also because of the demonstration of God's might and protection over His chosen people. This concept of dread is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>, where Rahab speaks of the fear that had fallen on the inhabitants of Canaan because of the Israelites. This fear served as a divine tool to protect Israel and fulfill God's plan. It also foreshadows the reverence and fear that nations would have towards God's people throughout biblical history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A powerful ancient civilization located in Northeast Africa, known for its pharaohs and monumental architecture.
