It emphasizes the wisdom and experience gained over a lifetime. In biblical culture, age was associated with wisdom and authority, and elders were respected for their life experiences. This statement sets the stage for a testimony based on a lifetime of observation. The transition from youth to old age is a common biblical theme, highlighting the faithfulness of God throughout the different stages of life (<a href="/job/12-12.htm">Job 12:12</a>, <a href="/proverbs/16-31.htm">Proverbs 16:31</a>).<p><b>yet never have I seen the righteous abandoned</b><br>The term "righteous" refers to those who live in accordance with God's laws and maintain a faithful relationship with Him. The assurance that the righteous are never abandoned aligns with God's covenant promises throughout the Old Testament, where He pledges to be with His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>, <a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>). This phrase underscores God's faithfulness and His commitment to those who are devoted to Him. It also reflects the cultural understanding of divine justice, where righteousness is rewarded with God's presence and provision.<p><b>or their children begging for bread</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the generational blessings that come from living a righteous life. In ancient Israel, family and community were central, and the well-being of one's children was a significant concern. The promise that the children of the righteous will not beg for bread suggests a divine provision that extends beyond the individual to their descendants. This is consistent with the biblical principle of blessings being passed down through generations (<a href="/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>, <a href="/psalms/112.htm">Psalm 112:1-2</a>). It also reflects the social structure of Israel, where community support and God's provision were expected to prevent such destitution.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/37.htm">Psalm 37</a>, King David, reflects on his life experiences and observations of God's faithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>Refers to those who live in accordance with God's will and commandments, demonstrating faithfulness and integrity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_children_of_the_righteous.htm">The Children of the Righteous</a></b><br>The descendants of those who are faithful to God, who also benefit from God's provision and protection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_over_time.htm">God's Faithfulness Over Time</a></b><br>David's testimony as an elder reflects a lifetime of witnessing God's unwavering faithfulness to His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_security_of_the_righteous.htm">The Security of the Righteous</a></b><br>The righteous are never abandoned by God, highlighting the security and peace that come from living a life aligned with His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generational_blessings.htm">Generational Blessings</a></b><br>The blessings of the righteous extend to their children, emphasizing the importance of a godly legacy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_divine_provision.htm">Trust in Divine Provision</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to trust in God's provision, even in times of uncertainty, knowing He cares for His own.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_a_righteous_life.htm">Living a Righteous Life</a></b><br>The call to live righteously is not just for personal benefit but also for the well-being of future generations.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_37_25_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 37:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_37_25_Trust_God_s_provision.htm">How does Psalm 37:25 encourage trust in God's provision for the righteous?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/God_s_faithfulness_in_not_forsaking.htm">What does "never seen the righteous forsaken" reveal about God's faithfulness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_37_25_Faith_in_tough_finances.htm">How can Psalm 37:25 strengthen your faith during financial difficulties?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Ps_37_25_Mt_6_33_on_seeking_God.htm">Connect Psalm 37:25 with Matthew 6:33 on seeking God's kingdom first.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Psalm_37_25_daily.htm">How can you apply the promise of Psalm 37:25 in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_37_25_vs_global_poverty.htm">How does Psalm 37:25 align with the reality of poverty and suffering in the world?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Does_Psalm_37_25_promise_needs_met.htm">Does Psalm 37:25 imply that all righteous people will always have their needs met?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Interpret_Psalm_37_25_amid_hardship.htm">How should believers interpret Psalm 37:25 when witnessing righteous people experiencing hardship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_37.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 37?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/has_the_righteous_ever_been_forsaken.htm">Has the righteous ever been forsaken?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_do_the_righteous_face_poverty.htm">In Psalm 37:25 (&#8220;I have not seen the righteous forsaken&#8221;), why do historical records reveal numerous cases where faithful people faced dire poverty or were seemingly abandoned?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/can_we_affect_the_end_times'_timing.htm">Has the righteous ever been forsaken?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/meaning_of_'persecuted_not_forsaken'.htm">What does "Persecuted but not Forsaken" mean?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 37:25 Mean</div><b>I once was young</b><p>- David speaks from the vantage point of remembered youth, echoing <a href="/psalms/71-17.htm">Psalm 71:17</a> &#8211;

It has certainly all the gravity, calmness, seriousness, and tone of authority which befit a teacher of many years and much experience. <span class="cmt_word">Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread</span>. The social condition of the Israelites was very unlike that of modern European communities. Though there were rich and poor among them, there could scarcely be any that were <span class="accented">very</span> poor. Where there was a general obligation upon all well-disposed persons to lend to such as were in need, and no interest could be asked upon loans, and in the year of jubilee all debts were remitted, and mortgaged lands returned to their original owners or their families, actual begging was scarcely possible, and at any rate could only be brought about by extreme and reckless misconduct. Many philanthropists believe that even at the present time in our own country mendicancy is nearly always the consequence of persistence in evil courses. Still more must this have been the case in Palestine in the time of the monarchy (see <a href="/proverbs/20-4.htm">Proverbs 20:4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/37-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I once was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">young</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1444;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;
