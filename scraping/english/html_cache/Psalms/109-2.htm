In biblical context, the wicked often refers to those who oppose God's ways and His people. Deceitful mouths suggest intentional falsehoods and manipulation. Historically, false accusations were a common tactic used by enemies to undermine leaders, as seen in the stories of Joseph (Genesis 39) and Daniel (Daniel 6). This phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, who faced false accusations from religious leaders (<a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59-61</a>).<p><b>they speak against me with lying tongues.</b><br>The emphasis on "lying tongues" underscores the malicious intent behind the words spoken against the psalmist. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, one's reputation was crucial, and slander could lead to social and legal repercussions. The use of the tongue as a metaphor for speech is common in Scripture, highlighting the power of words to harm or heal (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>). This phrase connects to other scriptures that warn against the dangers of the tongue, such as <a href="/james/3-6.htm">James 3:6-8</a>. It also foreshadows the false testimonies brought against Jesus during His trial (<a href="/mark/14-56.htm">Mark 14:56-59</a>), further establishing a typological connection to Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/109.htm">Psalm 109</a>, David is expressing his distress over being falsely accused and slandered by his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The unspecified adversaries who are speaking deceitfully against David, representing those who oppose the righteous.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and protector whom David calls upon for justice and vindication.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_words.htm">The Power of Words</a></b><br>Words can be used to build up or destroy.
