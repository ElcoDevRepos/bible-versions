In biblical context, God's eternal existence is a recurring theme, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>, which speaks of the everlasting God. The Hebrew word for "abides" suggests a continuous, unchanging presence, reinforcing the idea of God's immutability. This eternal aspect of God provides assurance to believers that His promises and His presence are constant and reliable, unlike the fleeting nature of earthly powers.<p><b>He has established His throne for judgment.</b><br>This phrase highlights God's sovereign authority and His role as the ultimate judge. The imagery of a throne signifies power, authority, and governance. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, a throne was a symbol of a king's right to rule and make judgments. Biblically, God's throne is often associated with justice and righteousness, as seen in <a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>, which states that righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne. This phrase also points to the eschatological belief in God's final judgment, where He will judge the world with equity, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>. The concept of divine judgment is central to understanding God's holiness and the moral order He upholds.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal nature and faithfulness to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/throne.htm">Throne</a></b><br>Symbolizes God's sovereign rule and authority over all creation, particularly in the context of judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>Refers to God's righteous and just decisions, highlighting His role as the ultimate judge of the earth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_eternal_nature.htm">God's Eternal Nature</a></b><br>God's existence is not bound by time; He is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
