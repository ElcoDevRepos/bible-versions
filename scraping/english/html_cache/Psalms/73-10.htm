In the context of <a href="/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, the psalmist Asaph is reflecting on the prosperity of the wicked. "This place" could metaphorically refer to the mindset or lifestyle of the wicked, which seems appealing to others. Historically, Israel often struggled with the temptation to adopt the practices of surrounding nations, which led them away from God. This phrase can also be seen as a warning against the allure of worldly success and the danger of returning to sinful ways, reminiscent of Israel's repeated return to idolatry despite God's deliverance.<p><b>and drink up waters in abundance</b><br>The imagery of drinking water in abundance symbolizes indulgence and satisfaction. In biblical times, water was a precious resource, and having it in abundance signified prosperity and blessing. However, in this context, it implies overindulgence in the prosperity and pleasures of the wicked. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of seeking satisfaction in God rather than in worldly pleasures. The phrase echoes <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>, where God accuses His people of forsaking Him, the "spring of living water," for broken cisterns that cannot hold water. It also contrasts with Jesus' offer of "living water" in <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>, which leads to eternal life, highlighting the temporary satisfaction of worldly pursuits versus the eternal fulfillment found in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, a Levite and one of the leaders of David's choir.

Because of that apparent success, &#8220;their people&#8221;&#8212;those who identify with or admire them&#8212;&#8220;return to this place.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The wording points to a cycle: spectators drift back to the sphere of the wicked, attracted by what they see. Compare <a href="/psalms/49-13.htm">Psalm 49:13-14</a>, where the masses follow self-confident leaders into ruin.<p>&#8226; This turning &#8220;to this place&#8221; suggests a movement of the heart more than geography: minds and loyalties gravitate toward the prosperous ungodly. <a href="/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10-15</a> warns against joining sinners on an enticing path; <a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3-4</a> shows how easily crowds flock to voices that scratch itching ears.<p>&#8226; Asaph is showing that the influence of the ungodly is real and magnetic.

In <a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a> the waters are plentiful, but they do not satisfy the soul.<p>&#8226; The abundance highlights excess. Instead of tasting and testing, people consume uncritically. <a href="/proverbs/14-15.htm">Proverbs 14:15</a> cautions that &#8220;the simple believe every word,&#8221; while <a href="/proverbs/5-15.htm">Proverbs 5:15-18</a> urges drinking only from one&#8217;s own (God-given) cistern.<p>&#8226; By spotlighting the crowd&#8217;s eager consumption, Asaph underlines the danger: when the wicked set the menu, spiritual dehydration follows, no matter how full the cup appears. Only the living water Jesus offers truly refreshes (<a href="/john/4-13.htm">John 4:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/73-10.htm">Psalm 73:10</a> shows a sobering chain reaction: the apparent triumph of the ungodly draws observers back into their orbit, and those observers then gorge on whatever the arrogant pour out. The verse warns that fascination with worldly prosperity can pull hearts away from God, leading to undiscerning acceptance of empty ideas. Real life and satisfaction are found not in the overflowing words of the wicked but in the faithful, living water the Lord provides.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/73.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Therefore.</span>--The Prayer Book version has undoubtedly caught the meaning here.
