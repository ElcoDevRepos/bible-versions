This dominion is a stewardship responsibility, emphasizing humanity's role in caring for God's creation. The phrase also points to the order and intentionality in creation, as God entrusts His works to human governance. In a broader theological context, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate ruler and steward of all creation, as affirmed in <a href="/hebrews/2-6.htm">Hebrews 2:6-8</a>, where this Psalm is quoted to describe Jesus' authority over all things.<p><b>You have placed everything under his feet:</b><br>This imagery of placing everything under one's feet signifies complete authority and subjugation, a common motif in ancient Near Eastern cultures to denote victory and control. Biblically, it echoes the promise of victory over enemies, as seen in <a href="/joshua/10-24.htm">Joshua 10:24</a>, where defeated kings are placed under the feet of the Israelites. In the New Testament, this phrase is applied to Christ in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27</a> and <a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a>, where it signifies His ultimate authority over all powers and principalities.
