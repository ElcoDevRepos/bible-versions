The "ropes" symbolize the constraints and pressures imposed by the wicked, possibly referring to literal imprisonment or metaphorical entrapment. In biblical times, binding with ropes was a common method of restraining prisoners, indicating a loss of freedom and autonomy. This imagery is consistent with other biblical accounts where God's people face persecution, such as Joseph's imprisonment (<a href="/genesis/39-20.htm">Genesis 39:20</a>) and Paul's numerous imprisonments (<a href="/acts/16-24.htm">Acts 16:24</a>). The wicked often represent those who reject God's commandments and seek to harm the righteous, as seen throughout the Psalms and Proverbs.<p><b>I do not forget Your law</b><br>Despite the adversity faced, the psalmist remains steadfast in remembering and adhering to God's law. This commitment highlights the importance of God's Word as a source of strength and guidance in times of trouble. The law, or Torah, encompasses God's teachings and commandments, which were central to the life and faith of the Israelites. The psalmist's resolve to remember the law echoes the exhortation in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a> to keep God's commandments at the forefront of one's life. This dedication to God's law is a recurring theme in <a href="/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, emphasizing the transformative power of Scripture. The psalmist's unwavering focus on God's law amidst trials can be seen as a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the law and remained obedient to the Father even unto death (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who expresses a deep love and commitment to God's law despite facing adversity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Those who oppose the psalmist, representing forces of evil or ungodly individuals who seek to ensnare or oppress the righteous.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_law.htm">God's Law</a></b><br>The divine instructions and commandments given by God, which the psalmist holds in high regard and remains committed to despite challenges.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_god's_word.htm">Commitment to God's Word</a></b><br>Despite external pressures and challenges, the psalmist remains steadfast in his commitment to God's law.

Scripture insists that those who love God will meet opposition (<a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>; <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18</a>). So the verse meets us where many believers live&#8212;tied down by unjust accusations, cultural pressure, even literal persecution (<a href="/acts/16-24.htm">Acts 16:24&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the narrative thread of the Bible reminds us that enemies never write the final chapter. Joseph was bound in Egypt, but &#8220;the LORD was with Joseph and extended kindness to him&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/39-21.htm">Genesis 39:21</a>). Daniel was sealed in a den (<a href="/daniel/6-17.htm">Daniel 6:17</a>), Peter chained between guards (<a href="/acts/12-6.htm">Acts 12:6</a>); each time God&#8217;s faithfulness outlasted the ropes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I do not forget Your law</b><p>&#8226; Here is the psalmist&#8217;s chosen response. Instead of panic, he turns continually to God&#8217;s unchanging word. <a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a> had already declared, &#8220;I have hidden Your word in my heart that I might not sin against You.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Remembering means more than mental recall; it means clinging, obeying, and finding delight in what God has spoken (<a href="/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a>; <a href="/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse draws a sharp contrast: wicked ropes are temporary; divine law is eternal (<a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>). When we stay mindful of that law, we are anchored&#8212;even if circumstances tighten around us (<a href="/psalms/119-92.htm">Psalm 119:92</a>, &#8220;If Your law had not been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Jesus models this perfectly: under the ultimate oppression of the cross He cited Scripture (<a href="/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>), showing that fidelity to God&#8217;s word is the pathway through suffering and into victory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/119-61.htm">Psalm 119:61</a> holds two realities side by side: oppression from the wicked and unwavering loyalty to God&#8217;s law. The verse invites every believer to acknowledge the ropes that may bind, yet to answer them with steadfast remembrance of Scripture. Hostile cords can restrain hands and feet, but they cannot rule the heart that treasures God&#8217;s word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/119.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(61) <span class= "bld">The bands . . .</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">cords of the wicked surrounded me. </span>(See <a href="/context/psalms/18-5.htm" title="The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.">Psalm 18:5-6</a>.)
