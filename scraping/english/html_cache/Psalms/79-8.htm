In the Old Testament, the concept of sin often involved both personal and communal responsibility. The Israelites understood that their current suffering was often a result of past disobedience to God's covenant (<a href="/leviticus/26-40.htm">Leviticus 26:40-42</a>). This phrase echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51:1-2</a>, where David seeks God's mercy and cleansing from sin. Theologically, it underscores the need for repentance and the hope for God's grace, which is fully realized in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who offers forgiveness of sins (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>).<p><b>let Your compassion come quickly,</b><br>The request for God's compassion highlights His character as merciful and loving. In the Hebrew context, compassion is often linked to the idea of a mother's love for her child, suggesting a deep, nurturing care (<a href="/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a>). The urgency in "come quickly" indicates the dire situation of the psalmist, possibly during the Babylonian exile when Jerusalem was in ruins (<a href="/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8-12</a>). This plea is a reminder of God's readiness to respond to His people's cries, as seen in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, where God is described as "compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness."<p><b>for we are brought low.</b><br>This phrase captures the humility and desperation of the people. Being "brought low" can refer to both physical and spiritual states of distress. Historically, this could relate to the destruction of Jerusalem and the subsequent exile, a time when the Israelites experienced profound humiliation and loss (<a href="/lamentations/1.htm">Lamentations 1:1-3</a>). Spiritually, it reflects the brokenness that comes from recognizing one's sinfulness and need for God, akin to the Beatitudes' teaching on the poor in spirit (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>). This condition sets the stage for divine intervention, as God often lifts the humble and contrite (<a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/79.htm">Psalm 79</a>, Asaph was a Levite and one of the leaders of David's choir.
