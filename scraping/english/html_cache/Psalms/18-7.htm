In biblical context, such events signify God's powerful intervention in human affairs. Similar occurrences are seen in <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>, where Mount Sinai trembles as God descends upon it. The shaking of the earth symbolizes God's might and His ability to disrupt the natural order to accomplish His purposes.<p><b>and the foundations of the mountains trembled</b><br>Mountains in biblical literature often represent stability and permanence. The trembling of their foundations indicates a profound disturbance, suggesting that even the most stable elements of creation are subject to God's will. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>, where mountains quake before the Lord. It underscores the idea that God's presence and actions are so powerful that they affect the very core of the earth.<p><b>they were shaken because He burned with anger</b><br>God's anger in this context is a response to injustice and sin, reflecting His holiness and righteousness. The shaking of the earth and mountains is a physical manifestation of His wrath. This concept is consistent with other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/13-13.htm">Isaiah 13:13</a>, where the earth is shaken in the day of the Lord's fierce anger. It serves as a reminder of God's judgment and the seriousness of sin, while also pointing to His ultimate authority over creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David is expressing his gratitude and awe for God's deliverance from his enemies, including King Saul.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, whose anger causes the earth to shake and the mountains to tremble.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/earth.htm">Earth</a></b><br>Represents the physical world that responds to God's power and anger.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountains.htm">Mountains</a></b><br>Symbolize stability and strength, yet even they tremble at God's presence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/foundations.htm">Foundations</a></b><br>The underlying structures of the earth, indicating the depth of God's power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_power.htm">God's Sovereign Power</a></b><br>God's power is so immense that it causes the earth to shake.

The psalmist must not be understood literally. He does not mean that the deliverance came by earthquake, storm, and thunder, but describes the discomfiture and dismay of his opponents by a series of highly poetical images.
