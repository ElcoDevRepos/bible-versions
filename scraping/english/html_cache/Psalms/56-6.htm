In the biblical context, David frequently faced conspiracies, notably from King Saul and later from his own son Absalom. The act of conspiring suggests a deliberate and secretive plan, reflecting the deceitful nature of his enemies. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of the righteous being targeted by the wicked, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-2</a>, where nations conspire against the Lord and His Anointed.<p><b>they lurk</b><br>The imagery of lurking suggests a hidden, persistent threat. This can be likened to the behavior of predators, waiting for the opportune moment to strike. In ancient times, enemies often used ambush tactics, taking advantage of the terrain and the element of surprise. This phrase can also be connected to spiritual warfare, where evil forces are described as prowling like a lion (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>). The lurking of enemies is a reminder of the constant vigilance required by the faithful.<p><b>they watch my steps</b><br>This indicates a close and continuous observation, implying that the psalmist's enemies are monitoring his every move. Historically, this could refer to spies or informants who reported David's movements to Saul. The phrase underscores the vulnerability and pressure of being under constant surveillance. Biblically, it reflects the idea that the righteous are often scrutinized by the wicked, as seen in <a href="/job/13-27.htm">Job 13:27</a>, where Job laments being watched by God in a similar manner.<p><b>while they wait to take my life</b><br>The ultimate goal of the psalmist's enemies is revealed here: to take his life. This reflects the severity of the threat and the desperation of the situation. In David's life, this was a literal threat, as Saul sought to kill him. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who also faced plots against His life (<a href="/john/11-53.htm">John 11:53</a>). The phrase emphasizes the mortal danger faced by the psalmist and the need for divine intervention and protection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of the psalm, who is expressing his distress and seeking God's protection from his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The adversaries of David, who are plotting against him and seeking to harm him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>The historical context of this psalm is believed to be when David was captured by the Philistines in Gath, as noted in the title of the psalm.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gath.htm">Gath</a></b><br>A Philistine city where David sought refuge but found himself in danger.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate protector and deliverer whom David trusts amidst his trials.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_protection.htm">Trust in God's Protection</a></b><br>Despite the schemes of enemies, believers can trust in God's sovereign protection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/awareness_of_spiritual_warfare.htm">Awareness of Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Just as David faced physical enemies, Christians face spiritual adversaries and must remain vigilant.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_as_a_weapon.htm">Prayer as a Weapon</a></b><br>David's response to his enemies was to turn to God in prayer, setting an example for believers to follow.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience.htm">God's Omniscience</a></b><br>God is aware of the plots against His people and is actively involved in their defense.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_over_fear.htm">Faith Over Fear</a></b><br>David's faith in God overcame his fear of his enemies, teaching believers to prioritize faith over fear.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_56_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 56:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Trust_God_despite_others_schemes.htm">How can we trust God when others "conspire" and "lurk" against us?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_56_6_on_human_opposition.htm">What does Psalm 56:6 teach about the nature of human opposition?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_56_6_and_Jesus_foes.htm">How does Psalm 56:6 relate to Jesus' experiences with His adversaries?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_prayer_aid_against_scrutiny.htm">How can prayer help us when facing those who "watch my steps"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Psalm_56_6_aid_spiritual_battles.htm">In what ways can Psalm 56:6 encourage us during spiritual battles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_56_6_Human_enemies_intentions.htm">What does Psalm 56:6 reveal about the nature of human enemies and their intentions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_56_6_Rethink_divine_protection.htm">How does Psalm 56:6 challenge our understanding of divine protection against adversaries?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Psalm_56_6_show_David_s_trials.htm">In what ways does Psalm 56:6 reflect the historical context of David's struggles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_56.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 56?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_paranoia.htm">What does the Bible say about paranoia?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_a_christian_family.htm">What defines a Christian family?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_do_tragedies_occur_if_god_watches_us.htm">Psalm 121:8 - If God is watching over our coming and going 'now and forever,' why do global tragedies and apparent divine absences exist throughout history?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/can_one_be_righteous_(rom_3_10_vs._lk_1_5-6).htm">Can a person be righteous?
