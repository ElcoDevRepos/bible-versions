The "descendants" refer to the spiritual lineage of those who serve God, reminiscent of the promises made to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>, where God assures him that his offspring will inherit the land. This inheritance is not merely physical but also spiritual, pointing to the eternal promises fulfilled in Christ. The concept of inheritance is central to the biblical narrative, symbolizing the blessings and responsibilities bestowed upon God's people. In the New Testament, this is expanded to include all believers as heirs with Christ (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>).<p><b>and those who love His name will settle in it</b><br>Loving God's name implies a deep, personal relationship with Him, characterized by reverence and obedience. This love is not just emotional but is demonstrated through faithful living. The promise of settling in the land is a metaphor for peace and security, reflecting the ultimate rest found in God's presence. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of God preparing a place for His people, as seen in <a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>, where Jesus speaks of preparing a place for His followers. The idea of "settling" also points to the eschatological hope of the new heavens and new earth, where God's people will dwell with Him eternally (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, David is expressing a deep sense of distress and seeking God's deliverance.

This echoes <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7-8</a>, where the Lord promises Abraham&#8217;s offspring an everlasting possession.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;it&#8221; refers to Zion mentioned in verse 35 (&#8220;For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah&#8221;). The rebuilding is not merely metaphorical; Scripture repeatedly presents Jerusalem&#8217;s restoration as a concrete event (<a href="/isaiah/62-1.htm">Isaiah 62:1-7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-10.htm">Jeremiah 33:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Inheritance language underscores permanence. Just as Israel received Canaan by covenant (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-37.htm">Deuteronomy 4:37-38</a>), believers in Christ are promised an incorruptible inheritance kept in heaven (<a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3-4</a>), to be fully realized when Christ reigns on earth (<a href="/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>; 20:6).<p>&#8226; The verse affirms God&#8217;s faithfulness to successive generations. <a href="/psalms/102-28.htm">Psalm 102:28</a> states, &#8220;The children of Your servants will dwell securely, and their descendants will be established before You,&#8221; reinforcing that covenant blessings outlast individual lifetimes.<p>&#8226; Practically, this assures us that present obedience influences future blessing. Our legacy in Christ matters (<a href="/proverbs/20-7.htm">Proverbs 20:7</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Those who love His name will settle in it</b><p>&#8220;and those who love His name will settle in it&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/69-36.htm">Psalm 69:36</a>b)<p>&#8226; Loving God&#8217;s name&#8212;His revealed character&#8212;marks true believers (<a href="/psalms/5-11.htm">Psalm 5:11</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16-18</a>).
