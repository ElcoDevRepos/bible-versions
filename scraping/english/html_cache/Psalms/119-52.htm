In the biblical context, "judgments" often refer to God's laws and the outcomes of His divine decisions. The psalmist's remembrance suggests a deep familiarity with the Torah, where God's judgments are recorded. Historically, the Israelites were encouraged to remember God's works and laws, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>, where they are instructed to keep God's words in their hearts and teach them diligently. This remembrance serves as a foundation for faith, reminding believers of God's consistent character and His faithfulness throughout history.<p><b>O LORD</b><br>The use of "LORD" in all capitals indicates the Hebrew name Yahweh, the covenant name of God revealed to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>. This name signifies God's eternal presence and unchanging nature. The invocation of Yahweh highlights a personal relationship between the psalmist and God, rooted in the covenantal promises made to the patriarchs. It reflects a deep reverence and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and authority over all creation.<p><b>and in them I find comfort</b><br>The psalmist finds solace in God's judgments, suggesting that divine laws and decisions provide stability and assurance. This comfort is rooted in the understanding that God's judgments are just, righteous, and ultimately for the good of His people. In a broader biblical context, this reflects the theme found in <a href="/romans/15-4.htm">Romans 15:4</a>, where the Scriptures are described as providing endurance and encouragement. The comfort derived from God's judgments also points to the hope of redemption and the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises, as seen in the prophetic writings that anticipate the coming of the Messiah, who embodies God's perfect justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who expresses a deep love and reverence for God's law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal nature and faithfulness to His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgments_of_old.htm">Judgments of Old</a></b><br>Refers to God's decrees, laws, and decisions as recorded in the Scriptures, which have been established since ancient times.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_comfort_of_god's_eternal_word.htm">The Comfort of God's Eternal Word</a></b><br>God's judgments are timeless and provide a foundation of truth and stability in a changing world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_remembering.htm">The Importance of Remembering</a></b><br>Actively recalling God's past faithfulness and His righteous decrees can bring peace and reassurance in times of trouble.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/finding_strength_in_god's_character.htm">Finding Strength in God's Character</a></b><br>Reflecting on God's judgments helps us to trust in His unchanging nature and His commitment to justice and righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/scripture_as_a_source_of_encouragement.htm">Scripture as a Source of Encouragement</a></b><br>The Bible is not just a historical document but a living source of comfort and guidance for believers today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/application_of_god's_judgments_in_daily_life.htm">Application of God's Judgments in Daily Life</a></b><br>Understanding and applying God's judgments can lead to wise decision-making and a life that honors Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_119_52_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 119:52?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_119_52_Remember_God_s_laws_in_trials.htm">How can Psalm 119:52 inspire us to remember God's laws in trials?
