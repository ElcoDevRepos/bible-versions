In the biblical context, redemption often refers to the act of being saved from sin or its consequences. The Old Testament law included provisions for a kinsman-redeemer, as seen in the Book of Ruth, where Boaz redeems Ruth. However, this was a temporal and earthly redemption, not spiritual. The inability of man to redeem another spiritually points to the need for a divine Redeemer, foreshadowing the role of Jesus Christ, who is described as the ultimate Redeemer in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>).<p><b>or pay his ransom to God.</b><br>The concept of a ransom involves a payment made to release someone from bondage or captivity. In ancient cultures, ransoms were often paid to free prisoners or slaves. Biblically, the idea of a ransom is used metaphorically to describe the price required to free humanity from the bondage of sin. Theologically, this phrase underscores the insufficiency of human efforts or wealth to achieve spiritual freedom. It connects to the New Testament teaching that Jesus Christ gave His life as a ransom for many (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>), highlighting the belief that only through Christ's sacrificial death can humanity be reconciled to God. This also reflects the prophetic anticipation of a Messiah who would accomplish what no human could.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_korah.htm">The Sons of Korah</a></b><br>The authors of <a href="/bsb/psalms/49.htm">Psalm 49</a>, a group of Levitical singers and musicians who served in the temple.
