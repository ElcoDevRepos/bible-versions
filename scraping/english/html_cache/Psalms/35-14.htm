In ancient Near Eastern culture, mourning was a communal activity, often involving physical expressions of grief such as pacing or walking in circles. The psalmist's comparison to a "friend or brother" indicates a close, familial bond, emphasizing the depth of his sorrow. This mirrors the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor as oneself (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>) and the New Testament call to bear one another's burdens (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>). The psalmist's actions can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as a friend and brother to believers (<a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>, <a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>).<p><b>I was bowed down with grief,</b><br>The act of being "bowed down" signifies a posture of humility and submission, often associated with intense sorrow or supplication. In biblical times, bowing down was a common expression of mourning, as seen in Job's response to his suffering (<a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>). This phrase highlights the psalmist's vulnerability and the weight of his emotional burden. It also foreshadows the suffering servant motif found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the Messiah is described as a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief. This connection underscores the psalmist's experience as a precursor to the suffering of Christ.<p><b>like one mourning for his mother.</b><br>Mourning for a mother would have been one of the most profound expressions of grief in ancient Israelite society, as the mother-child relationship was deeply cherished. This comparison underscores the intensity of the psalmist's lament. The cultural context of mourning included wearing sackcloth, fasting, and weeping, as seen in the story of David mourning for his son (<a href="/2_samuel/12-16.htm">2 Samuel 12:16-17</a>). This phrase also connects to the New Testament, where Jesus shows compassion for the grieving, such as when He comforts the widow of Nain (<a href="/luke/7-13.htm">Luke 7:13</a>). The psalmist's lament can be seen as a type of Christ's empathy and compassion for humanity's suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/35.htm">Psalm 35</a>, David is expressing his deep emotional turmoil and sense of betrayal by those he once considered close.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>Though not named specifically in this verse, the context of the psalm indicates that David is lamenting the betrayal and attacks from those who were once his allies or friends.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>Implicit in the psalm as the one to whom David cries out for justice and deliverance from his adversaries.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/empathy_in_relationships.htm">Empathy in Relationships</a></b><br>David's grief for his friends shows the depth of empathy we are called to have for others, even when they wrong us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dealing_with_betrayal.htm">Dealing with Betrayal</a></b><br>The psalm teaches us to bring our feelings of betrayal and hurt to God, trusting Him for justice and healing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_pain_of_broken_relationships.htm">The Pain of Broken Relationships</a></b><br>Like David, we may experience deep sorrow when relationships are broken, reminding us of the importance of reconciliation and forgiveness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_as_a_response.htm">Prayer as a Response</a></b><br>In times of emotional turmoil, turning to prayer and seeking God's presence can provide comfort and guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ-like_love.htm">Christ-like Love</a></b><br>Reflecting on how Jesus responded to betrayal can inspire us to love and forgive those who hurt us.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_35_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 35:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_35_14_s_lesson_on_empathy_today.htm">How does Psalm 35:14 guide us in responding to others' suffering today?
