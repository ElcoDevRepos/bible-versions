In the biblical context, instruction and teaching are often associated with wisdom literature, such as Proverbs, where the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. The phrase suggests a personal relationship between God and the believer, where God actively participates in guiding one's life. Historically, the Israelites relied on God's guidance through the Law and the prophets. This guidance is not just about moral or ethical living but encompasses the entirety of one's life journey. The "way you should go" can be seen as a metaphor for living according to God's will, aligning with the paths of righteousness mentioned in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>. This phrase also foreshadows the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate teacher and guide, who declared Himself to be "the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p><b>I will give you counsel and watch over you.</b><br>Here, the promise of counsel indicates God's willingness to provide wisdom and understanding, akin to the role of the Holy Spirit, who is described as the Counselor in <a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>. The assurance of being watched over reflects God's protective nature, reminiscent of the shepherd imagery found in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where God is portrayed as a shepherd who watches over His flock. This phrase underscores the intimate care and attention God provides, ensuring that the believer is not left to navigate life's challenges alone. The historical context of ancient Israel, where kings and leaders often sought divine counsel through prophets, highlights the importance of seeking God's guidance. The promise of watchfulness also connects to the New Testament, where Jesus assures His followers of God's constant presence, as seen in <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>, "And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/32.htm">Psalm 32</a>, David is a central figure in the Old Testament, known for his deep relationship with God, his psalms, and his reign as king of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, offering guidance and counsel to the believer.

But such a sudden intrusion of a Divine utterance, without any notice of a change of speaker, is without parallel in the Psalms, and should certainly not be admitted without some plain necessity. Here is no necessity at all. The words are quite suitable in the mouth of David, as an admonition to the Israelites of his time; they accord with the title, which he himself seems to have prefixed to the psalm, and explain it; and they fulfil the promise made in <a href="/psalms/51-15.htm">Psalm 51:15</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt</span> <span class="cmt_word">go.</span> We must suppose the "godly man" of ver. 6 addressed, if we regard David as the speaker.
