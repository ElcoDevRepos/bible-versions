The sheepfolds were enclosures where sheep were kept, symbolizing peace and rest. Lying down among them suggests a state of tranquility and security. Biblically, sheepfolds can represent the people of God, as seen in <a href="/john/10.htm">John 10:1-16</a>, where Jesus describes Himself as the Good Shepherd. This imagery may also allude to the tribes of Israel, particularly those who were more settled and less involved in warfare, such as Issachar (<a href="/genesis/49-14.htm">Genesis 49:14-15</a>).<p><b>the wings of the dove are covered with silver</b><br>Doves are often symbols of peace and the Holy Spirit (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>). The mention of silver suggests purity and redemption, as silver was used in the tabernacle and temple (<a href="/exodus/26-19.htm">Exodus 26:19</a>; <a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>). This could symbolize the divine protection and blessing over Israel, or the church, as they rest in God's provision. The dove's wings covered with silver may also imply the beauty and value of God's presence and peace among His people.<p><b>and her feathers with shimmering gold.</b><br>Gold in the Bible often represents divinity, kingship, and glory (<a href="/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18</a>). The shimmering gold feathers of the dove could symbolize the glory and majesty of God resting upon His people. This imagery might also point to the transformation and sanctification of believers, reflecting God's glory (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>). The combination of silver and gold suggests a completeness of divine favor and blessing, reminiscent of the wealth and splendor of Solomon's reign (<a href="/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheepfolds.htm">Sheepfolds</a></b><br>A sheepfold is an enclosure for sheep, symbolizing a place of rest and security.
