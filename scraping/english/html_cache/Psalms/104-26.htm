The mention of ships suggests a bustling economy and the importance of the sea for transportation and commerce. In biblical times, the Mediterranean Sea was a major route for trade, connecting various cultures and regions. The reference to ships also evokes the image of human endeavor and exploration, as well as the reliance on God's creation for sustenance and prosperity. The sea is often seen as a place of both opportunity and danger, reflecting the dual nature of human interaction with the natural world.<p><b>and Leviathan</b><br>Leviathan is a creature mentioned several times in the Bible, often symbolizing chaos and the untamable forces of nature. In ancient Near Eastern mythology, Leviathan is depicted as a sea monster or dragon, representing the chaotic waters subdued by God. The mention of Leviathan here serves to illustrate God's sovereignty over all creation, including the most formidable and mysterious creatures. In <a href="/job/41.htm">Job 41</a>, Leviathan is described in detail, emphasizing its power and the futility of human attempts to control it. This creature can also be seen as a type of Satan or evil, which God ultimately has dominion over.<p><b>which You formed to frolic there</b><br>This phrase underscores God's intentional design and purpose in creation. The idea that God formed Leviathan to "frolic" suggests a sense of playfulness and freedom within the bounds of God's order. It highlights God's creative power and the joy inherent in His creation. The use of the word "frolic" implies that even the most fearsome creatures have a place and purpose in God's world, contributing to the overall harmony and balance of creation. This reflects the biblical theme that all of creation, in its diversity and complexity, is under God's control and serves His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/ships.htm">Ships</a></b><br>Represent human industry and exploration.
