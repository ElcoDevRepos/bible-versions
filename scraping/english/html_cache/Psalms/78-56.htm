The term "tested" refers to the Israelites' continual questioning of God's power and faithfulness, as seen in their wilderness journey (<a href="/exodus/17-2.htm">Exodus 17:2</a>, <a href="/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22</a>). "Disobeyed" indicates a willful rejection of God's commands, reflecting a pattern of behavior that led to their downfall. The title "God Most High" emphasizes God's supreme authority and sovereignty, a title used to remind the Israelites of His unmatched power and position (<a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a>). This rebellion is a reflection of humanity's broader struggle with sin and disobedience, echoing the fall in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.<p><b>for they did not keep His decrees</b><br>The decrees refer to the laws and commandments given by God, particularly those delivered through Moses at Sinai (Exodus 20). The failure to keep these decrees was not just a legal infraction but a breach of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This disobedience led to various consequences, including exile and oppression by foreign nations (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-15</a>). The call to keep God's decrees is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament, emphasizing the importance of obedience as a response to God's grace and as a means of maintaining a right relationship with Him (<a href="/deuteronomy/6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1-3</a>). This failure also foreshadows the need for a new covenant, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who perfectly kept God's law and offers redemption for humanity's disobedience (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, <a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_most_high.htm">God Most High</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's supreme authority and sovereignty over all creation.
