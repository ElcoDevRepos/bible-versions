In the biblical context, strength often refers to both physical and spiritual fortitude. The Hebrew word for "strength" can imply might, power, or resilience, which God imparts to His followers. This is seen throughout the Old Testament, where God empowers leaders like Moses, Joshua, and David to accomplish His purposes. In <a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29-31</a>, God is described as giving strength to the weary and increasing the power of the weak, reinforcing the idea that true strength comes from the LORD. This strength is not just for personal benefit but for fulfilling God's will and advancing His kingdom.<p><b>the LORD blesses His people with peace.</b><br>Peace, or "shalom" in Hebrew, is a comprehensive term that encompasses well-being, wholeness, and harmony. It is not merely the absence of conflict but the presence of God's order and blessing. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, peace was a sign of God's favor and covenantal faithfulness. The peace that God provides is both internal and external, affecting the heart and the community. This peace is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus, referred to as the Prince of Peace in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, offers peace to His followers (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>). The ultimate fulfillment of this peace is found in the reconciliation between God and humanity through Christ, as described in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-18</a>. This peace is a foretaste of the eternal peace promised in the new creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and faithfulness to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_people.htm">His People (Israel)</a></b><br>Refers to the nation of Israel, God's chosen people, who are recipients of His strength and peace.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David (Author)</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to King David, who composed this psalm as a hymn of praise to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple (Implied Context)</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, the psalm's context suggests a setting of worship, possibly in the temple.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_storm.htm">The Storm (Implied Context)</a></b><br>The earlier verses of <a href="/bsb/psalms/29.htm">Psalm 29</a> describe a powerful storm, symbolizing God's majestic power and authority over creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_strength.htm">Divine Strength</a></b><br>God is the ultimate source of strength for His people.
