The concept of turning away is often associated with rebellion against God, as seen in the story of Adam and Eve in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. The Hebrew word used here can imply a deliberate choice to deviate from the path of righteousness. This turning away is not limited to a specific group but encompasses all humanity, reflecting the fallen state of mankind since the original sin.<p><b>They have together become corrupt</b><br>The idea of collective corruption suggests a pervasive moral decay affecting society as a whole. This corruption is not just individual but communal, indicating that sin has a compounding effect on human relationships and institutions. The term "corrupt" can also be linked to the imagery of decay and spoilage, as seen in the prophetic writings of Isaiah and Jeremiah, where the people of Israel are often described as having become rotten due to their idolatry and injustice.<p><b>There is no one who does good</b><br>This statement underscores the total depravity of humanity, a key theological concept that suggests every aspect of human nature is tainted by sin. The assertion that no one does good aligns with the teachings of the Apostle Paul in <a href="/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-12</a>, where he quotes this psalm to emphasize the need for divine grace and redemption. It challenges the notion of inherent human goodness and points to the necessity of a savior.<p><b>Not even one</b><br>The emphatic repetition here serves to eliminate any exceptions to the rule of universal sinfulness. It reinforces the idea that apart from God's intervention, no human being can achieve true righteousness. This phrase echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a>, which states that there is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins. It sets the stage for the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who alone is without sin and capable of restoring humanity to a right relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of this Psalm, David was the second king of Israel and a man after God's own heart.
