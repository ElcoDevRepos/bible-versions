In biblical context, this can be seen as a reflection of the human condition under the curse of sin, as described in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. The psalmist's experience parallels the life of Job, who also faced severe trials and questioned God's purposes. The mention of "youth" indicates that suffering is not limited to a particular stage of life but can be a persistent reality. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who was "a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief" (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>), experiencing suffering throughout His earthly life.<p><b>I have borne Your terrors;</b><br>The psalmist attributes his suffering to divine action, acknowledging God's sovereignty even in distress. This reflects the biblical theme that God is in control of all circumstances, including those that bring fear and terror. The "terrors" may refer to the overwhelming sense of God's judgment or the fear of death and the unknown. This aligns with the experiences of the Israelites, who often faced God's discipline when they strayed from His commandments. Theologically, this can be connected to the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), suggesting that even in terror, there is a recognition of God's ultimate authority.<p><b>I am in despair.</b><br>Despair indicates a deep sense of hopelessness and emotional turmoil. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, expressing such raw emotion in prayer was not uncommon, as seen in other lament psalms. This phrase captures the depth of the psalmist's anguish, similar to the cries of Jeremiah in Lamentations. It also foreshadows the agony of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, where He expressed deep sorrow and distress (<a href="/matthew/26-38.htm">Matthew 26:38</a>). The psalmist's despair highlights the human need for divine intervention and the hope of redemption, which is ultimately fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist (Heman the Ezrahite)</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/88.htm">Psalm 88</a>, traditionally identified as Heman the Ezrahite, a wise man and a musician in the time of King David.

&#8220;From my youth&#8221; highlights that the psalmist&#8217;s suffering has been lifelong. This is not a brief trial but a history of hardship that began early (<a href="/psalms/71-17.htm">Psalm 71:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often shows God&#8217;s servants marked by trials from childhood, such as Joseph sold by his brothers (<a href="/genesis/37-2.htm">Genesis 37:2, 28</a>) and Jeremiah, who was consecrated &#8220;before you were born&#8221; yet faced rejection for decades (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Lifelong struggles remind us that God&#8217;s purposes span a lifetime; even persistent pain is folded into His wise and loving plan (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I was afflicted and near death</b><p>&#8226; The psalmist&#8217;s affliction brought him repeatedly to the brink of the grave. Job echoed this feeling: &#8220;I have no peace&#8230; for trouble comes&#8221; (<a href="/job/3-24.htm">Job 3:24&#8211;26</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul, pressed &#8220;beyond our ability&#8230; so that we despaired even of life&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8&#8211;9</a>), learned to rely on &#8220;God who raises the dead.&#8221;<p>&#8226; When illness or danger feels terminal, <a href="/psalms/118-17.htm">Psalm 118:17</a> encourages, &#8220;I will not die, but live, and proclaim what the LORD has done.&#8221; God can use even near-death experiences to display His deliverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have borne Your terrors</b><p>&#8226; The psalmist recognizes God&#8217;s sovereignty over every hardship. He calls them &#8220;Your terrors,&#8221; acknowledging that nothing touches him apart from God&#8217;s hand (<a href="/psalms/90-11.htm">Psalm 90:11</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-37.htm">Lamentations 3:37&#8211;38</a>).<p>&#8226; This sense of divine awe does not deny God&#8217;s goodness; rather, it confesses that the Almighty&#8217;s discipline is profound and purposeful (<a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah described Hezekiah&#8217;s brush with death: &#8220;Like a lion He breaks all my bones; day and night You make an end of me&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/38-13.htm">Isaiah 38:13</a>). Feeling God&#8217;s terrors can drive the heart to a deeper reverence and reliance on His mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am in despair</b><p>&#8226; Honest lament reaches its lowest point here. The psalmist is &#8220;in despair,&#8221; yet his very cry is an act of faith. He is still speaking to God, not turning from Him (<a href="/psalms/42-11.htm">Psalm 42:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul wrote, &#8220;We are hard pressed&#8230; but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8</a>). The child of God may feel despair, but in Christ there is always a deeper hope beneath the sorrow.<p>&#8226; Even when emotions say &#8220;There is no hope,&#8221; God&#8217;s Word assures that His steadfast love never ceases (<a href="/lamentations/3-21.htm">Lamentations 3:21&#8211;23</a>). Despair is real, but it is not the final word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/88-15.htm">Psalm 88:15</a> portrays lifelong suffering that has pressed the psalmist to the edge of death, overwhelmed him with the terrors of God&#8217;s discipline, and left him in utter despair. Yet every phrase is spoken to the LORD, revealing a rugged faith that clings to God even when no light is visible. The verse invites believers to bring honest grief to the God who rules every circumstance, trusting that His sovereign purposes and steadfast love remain sure, even when feelings fail.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/88.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Terrors.</span>--Another of the many expressions which connect this psalm with the book of Job. (See <a href="/job/6-4.htm" title="For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinks up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.">Job 6:4</a>; <a href="/job/9-34.htm" title="Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:">Job 9:34</a>, &c.)<p><span class= "bld">Distracted.</span>--The Hebrew word is peculiar to the place. The ancient versions all agree in taking it as a verb, and rendering it by some general term denoting "trouble." But the context evidently requires a stronger word, and possibly connecting with a cognate word meaning "wheel," we may get, "I turn giddy." A change of a stroke in one letter would give "I grow frigid." (Comp. <a href="/psalms/38-8.htm" title="I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.">Psalm 38:8</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/88.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up</span>. This is a new point. The psalmist's afflictions have not come upon him recently. He does not merely mean, as some have supposed, that, like other men, as soon as he was born he began to die, but speaks of something, if not absolutely peculiar to himself, yet at any rate rare and abnormal - a long continuance in a dying state, such as could only have been brought about by some terribly severe malady. <span class="cmt_word">While I suffer thy terrors I am distracted</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I have endured thy terrors</span>; <span class="accented">I am exhausted.</span> (On the endurance of God's "terrors," see <a href="/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>; <a href="/job/9-34.htm">Job 9:34</a>; <a href="/job/13-21.htm">Job 13:21</a>.) The natural result would be a state, not of distraction, but of exhaustion.
