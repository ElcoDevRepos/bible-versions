The greatness of God is a recurring motif in the Old Testament, highlighting His sovereignty over creation and His unparalleled authority. In the context of ancient Israel, acknowledging God's greatness was a declaration of faith in His ability to protect and provide for His people, contrasting with the limited power of human rulers and pagan deities. This greatness is also reflected in the New Testament, where Jesus is recognized as Lord, affirming His divine nature and authority (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<p><b>and mighty in power</b><br>The power of God is a testament to His ability to act in the world and in the lives of individuals. This power is evident in the creation narrative (Genesis 1), where God speaks the universe into existence. It is also demonstrated in the deliverance of Israel from Egypt, showcasing His ability to intervene in history. The power of God is not just physical but also spiritual, as seen in the resurrection of Jesus, which is the ultimate display of divine power over sin and death (<a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>). This power assures believers of God's capability to fulfill His promises and sustain His creation.<p><b>His understanding has no limit</b><br>God's understanding is infinite, surpassing human comprehension. This attribute is closely related to His omniscience, the ability to know all things past, present, and future. In the biblical context, God's understanding is often contrasted with human wisdom, which is limited and flawed (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). The limitless understanding of God assures believers that He is aware of all circumstances and can provide perfect guidance and judgment. This is further illustrated in the New Testament, where Jesus, as the embodiment of divine wisdom, discerns the thoughts and intentions of the heart (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/147.htm">Psalm 147</a>, traditionally attributed to King David, who is expressing praise and adoration for God's greatness and power.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, whose greatness, power, and limitless understanding are being extolled.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation often addressed in the Psalms, representing God's chosen people who are recipients of His mighty acts and wisdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/147.htm">Psalm 147</a> includes references to God's creation, highlighting His power and understanding.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exiles.htm">The Exiles</a></b><br>The historical context of the Psalm may relate to the return of the Jewish exiles from Babylon, a time when God's power and understanding were crucial for restoration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_infinite_power.htm">God's Infinite Power</a></b><br>Recognize that God's power is beyond human comprehension and is evident in both creation and His providential care for His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/limitless_understanding.htm">Limitless Understanding</a></b><br>Trust in God's perfect wisdom, especially in times of uncertainty, knowing that His understanding is without limit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/praise_and_worship.htm">Praise and Worship</a></b><br>Cultivate a heart of worship by acknowledging God's greatness and mighty power in your daily life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>In practical matters, rely on God's wisdom rather than solely on human understanding, seeking His guidance in decision-making.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_in_trials.htm">Encouragement in Trials</a></b><br>Find comfort in God's omnipotence and omniscience, knowing that He is fully aware of your circumstances and has the power to sustain you.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_147_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 147:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Use_God_s_power_in_daily_challenges.htm">How can we apply God's "great power" in our daily challenges today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_God_s_wisdom_inspire_trust.htm">What does "His understanding has no limit" teach us about trusting God's wisdom?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_147_5_Isaiah_40_28_link.htm">How does Psalm 147:5 connect with God's omniscience in Isaiah 40:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_God_s_power_boost_our_faith_2.htm">In what ways can acknowledging God's "great power" strengthen our faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Reflect_God_s_wisdom_in_relationships.htm">How can we reflect God's "infinite understanding" in our relationships with others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_147_5_on_God_s_power_and_wisdom.htm">How does Psalm 147:5 define God's understanding and power?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Context_of_Psalm_147_5_s_writing.htm">What historical context surrounds the writing of Psalm 147:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_147_5_vs_modern_science_views.htm">How does Psalm 147:5 challenge modern scientific views on knowledge and power?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_147.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 147?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_gand#246;del_affect_divine_knowledge.htm">How does G&#246;del&#8217;s incompleteness theorem affect the idea of a complete divine knowledge system?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_does_god_pose_questions.htm">Why does God pose questions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_can_god_name_every_star.htm">(Psalm 147:4) How can God literally count and name every star in the universe, given the countless galaxies and ever-expanding cosmos?
