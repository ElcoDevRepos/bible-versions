The concept of "fear" here is not about terror but a profound respect and awe for God's holiness and authority. This reverence is foundational in the wisdom literature, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge." The idea of God confiding in His people suggests a deep, personal relationship, akin to the friendship between God and Abraham, who was called a friend of God (<a href="/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>). This intimacy is also reflected in the New Testament, where Jesus calls His disciples friends and shares with them the mysteries of the Kingdom (<a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>).<p><b>and reveals His covenant to them</b><br>The covenant is a central theme in the Bible, representing God's promises and relationship with His people. In the Old Testament, covenants were formal agreements, often sealed with a sacrifice, as seen in God's covenant with Abraham (Genesis 15). The revelation of His covenant implies that God discloses His plans and purposes to those who are in a right relationship with Him. This is seen in the prophetic literature, where God reveals His future plans to His prophets (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>). In the New Testament, the new covenant is established through Jesus Christ, whose sacrifice fulfills and surpasses the old covenants (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>). This revelation is available to all who believe in Christ, as they are brought into a new relationship with God, marked by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit who guides them into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is personal and relational, desiring to reveal His will and purposes to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_fear_him.htm">Those who fear Him</a></b><br>Believers who hold a reverent awe and respect for God, acknowledging His holiness and authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The divine agreement between God and His people, signifying a relationship based on promises and commitments from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_leads_to_revelation.htm">Reverence Leads to Revelation</a></b><br>Those who fear the Lord are granted deeper insights into His will and purposes.
