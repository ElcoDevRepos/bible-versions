In the context of <a href="/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>, the Israelites repeatedly turned away from God despite witnessing His miracles. The "fury" here is a manifestation of God's righteous anger, which is consistent with His character as a just and holy God. This concept is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as in the plagues of Egypt (Exodus 7-12), where God's fury was similarly unleashed against Pharaoh and the Egyptians for their oppression of His people.<p><b>wrath, indignation, and calamity</b><br>These terms collectively describe the intensity and multifaceted nature of God's judgment. "Wrath" refers to God's intense anger, "indignation" suggests a moral outrage, and "calamity" indicates the resulting destruction or disaster. This triad emphasizes the seriousness of God's response to sin. In the broader biblical narrative, such expressions of divine judgment serve as warnings to turn back to God, as seen in the prophetic books like Isaiah and Jeremiah, where similar language is used to call Israel to repentance.<p><b>a band of destroying angels</b><br>This phrase introduces the concept of divine agents executing God's judgment. The "destroying angels" are often associated with the execution of God's will, as seen in the Passover narrative (<a href="/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>), where the angel of death passed over Egypt. In the New Testament, angels are also depicted as agents of God's judgment and protection (<a href="/matthew/13-41.htm">Matthew 13:41-42</a>, <a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7:1-3</a>). This imagery underscores the seriousness of divine judgment and the reality of spiritual beings involved in God's plans.

The &#8220;them&#8221; are the Egyptians who oppressed God&#8217;s people (<a href="/exodus/1-13.htm">Exodus 1:13-14</a>). God&#8217;s fury is not capricious anger; it is the righteous response of a holy covenant-keeping God to persistent rebellion (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-30.htm">Hebrews 10:30</a>). The same LORD who patiently warned through nine plagues finally released the full force of judgment in the tenth (<a href="/exodus/11-4.htm">Exodus 11:4-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Wrath</b><p>Wrath speaks of God&#8217;s settled, holy opposition to sin. Unlike human outbursts, His wrath is always just (<a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>). In Egypt it protected Israel while judging idolatry (<a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12-13</a>). Elsewhere Scripture shows wrath:<p>&#8226; Against the world in Noah&#8217;s day (<a href="/genesis/6-13.htm">Genesis 6:13</a>)<p>&#8226; Against Nadab and Abihu for profaning worship (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>)<p>&#8226; Against unbelief in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11-12</a>)<p>God&#8217;s wrath underscores that sin matters and will be answered unless covered by the blood of the Lamb (<a href="/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Indignation</b><p>Indignation conveys the intense moral offense God feels toward evil. It is wrath felt at the heart level (<a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11</a>). When Israel was oppressed, the LORD was &#8220;moved to pity&#8221; for them (<a href="/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18</a>), but when Egypt defied Him, indignation rose. <a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a> describes &#8220;the LORD&#8217;s anger burning and His tongue like a consuming fire,&#8221; illustrating how indignation burns against hard-heartedness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Calamity</b><p>Calamity is the tangible form judgment takes&#8212;here, the death of the firstborn (<a href="/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29-30</a>). God warned Pharaoh, &#8220;I will send the full force of My plagues against you and your officials&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/9-14.htm">Exodus 9:14</a>). Calamity in Scripture often has a redemptive purpose:<p>&#8226; It exposes false gods (<a href="/numbers/33-4.htm">Numbers 33:4</a>).<p>&#8226; It leads observers to fear and trust the LORD (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminds future generations of His power (<a href="/psalms/78-6.htm">Psalm 78:6-8</a>).<p>While severe, calamity is never random; it is measured justice aimed at the ultimate good of God&#8217;s plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A band of destroying angels</b><p>God frequently uses angels to carry out His decrees (<a href="/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20</a>). On Passover night &#8220;the LORD struck down all the firstborn&#8221; by means of an angelic host (<a href="/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>). Similar scenes appear when:<p>&#8226; One angel struck 185,000 Assyrians (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>).<p>&#8226; An angel brought plague after David&#8217;s census (<a href="/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Seven angels pour out final bowls of wrath (<a href="/revelation/15-1.htm">Revelation 15:1</a>).<p>These &#8220;destroying angels&#8221; act only on divine command, ensuring that judgment is precise and just.
