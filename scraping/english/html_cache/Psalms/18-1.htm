The role of the choirmaster was significant in ancient Israel, as music was a central part of worship. This suggests that the psalm was not only a personal expression but also meant to instruct and inspire the community.<p><b>Of David the servant of the LORD,</b><br>David is identified as the author, emphasizing his role as a servant of God. This title highlights his humility and dedication to God's will. David's life, from shepherd to king, exemplifies servanthood, and his reliance on God is a recurring theme throughout his psalms. This phrase also connects to the Messianic prophecy, as Jesus is often referred to as the "Son of David" and the ultimate Servant of the Lord.<p><b>who sang this song to the LORD</b><br>David's expression of praise is directed to God, showcasing the personal and intimate relationship he had with the Lord. Singing was a common form of worship in ancient Israel, and David, known for his musical talent, often used song to convey his devotion and gratitude.<p><b>on the day the LORD had delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.</b><br>This provides the historical context for the psalm. David faced numerous adversaries, including King Saul, who sought his life. The phrase underscores God's faithfulness in delivering David from danger. It reflects the broader biblical theme of God's deliverance and protection, seen throughout the Old Testament, and foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Christ.<p><b>He said: I love You, O LORD, my strength.</b><br>David begins with a declaration of love and acknowledgment of God as his source of strength. This personal affirmation sets the tone for the entire psalm. The use of "strength" indicates reliance on God's power rather than human ability. This theme is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>, where believers are encouraged to find strength in Christ. David's love for God is a model for believers, emphasizing a relationship built on trust and dependence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David was the second king of Israel, known for his deep relationship with God and his role as a warrior and leader.
