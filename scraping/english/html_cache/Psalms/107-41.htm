Throughout the Bible, God is depicted as a protector and deliverer of the oppressed. In the Old Testament, God frequently intervenes on behalf of the Israelites when they are in distress, such as during their bondage in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-8</a>). The concept of God lifting the needy is also echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus Christ is seen healing the sick and providing for the poor, demonstrating God's ongoing concern for the marginalized (<a href="/matthew/11-5.htm">Matthew 11:5</a>). The term "affliction" can refer to various forms of suffering, including poverty, illness, or persecution, and God's deliverance is a recurring theme in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>).<p><b>and increases their families like flocks.</b><br>This imagery of increasing families like flocks draws on the pastoral and agrarian context of ancient Israel, where wealth and prosperity were often measured by the size of one's flocks and herds. The metaphor suggests not only numerical growth but also the idea of care and provision, as a shepherd tends to his flock. This reflects God's promise of blessing and multiplication, reminiscent of His covenant with Abraham, where He promised to make his descendants as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). The increase of families can also be seen as a sign of God's favor and blessing, as children were considered a heritage from the Lord (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>). In a broader spiritual sense, this can be seen as a type of the Church, where believers are gathered and nurtured under the care of Christ, the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_needy.htm">The Needy</a></b><br>This term refers to those who are poor, oppressed, or in distress.
