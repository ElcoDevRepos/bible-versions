In biblical times, a chamber was a private room, often richly adorned, signifying intimacy and honor. The imagery of glory and beauty can be seen as a reflection of the church, often referred to as the bride of Christ, adorned in righteousness and holiness (<a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>). The princess's glory may also symbolize the inner beauty and purity that God desires in His people, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3-4</a>, where the focus is on the inner self rather than outward adornment.<p><b>her gown is embroidered with gold.</b><br>The mention of a gown embroidered with gold highlights the wealth and majesty associated with royalty. Gold, a symbol of purity and divinity, is often used in the Bible to describe the splendor of God's presence, as seen in the construction of the Tabernacle and Solomon's Temple (<a href="/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>, <a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20-22</a>). This imagery can be connected to the New Jerusalem described in <a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18</a>, where the city is made of pure gold, representing the ultimate dwelling place of God with His people. The gold embroidery signifies the value and preciousness of the princess, akin to the church's value in the eyes of Christ, who gave Himself for her (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_princess.htm">The Princess</a></b><br>Symbolically represents the bride, often interpreted as the Church or the people of God, adorned in righteousness and beauty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_chamber.htm">The Chamber</a></b><br>A place of preparation and intimacy, symbolizing the inner life and spiritual preparation of the believer.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gown.htm">The Gown</a></b><br>Represents the righteousness and purity of the bride, adorned with gold, indicating value and divine favor.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_adornment.htm">Spiritual Adornment</a></b><br>Just as the princess is adorned in gold, believers are called to adorn themselves with the virtues of Christ, reflecting His glory in their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/inner_preparation.htm">Inner Preparation</a></b><br>The chamber signifies the importance of inner spiritual preparation.

Verse 11 has just said, &#8220;The king is enthralled by your beauty; honor him, for he is your lord&#8221;. Her splendor is the direct result of his love.<p>- This anticipates the church, whom Christ &#8220;cleanses&#8230; to present her to Himself a glorious church, without stain or wrinkle&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26-27</a>).<p>- The private chamber hints at intimacy and security. <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-8</a> pictures the same prepared bride: &#8220;She was given clothing of fine linen, bright and pure&#8221;. The emphasis is on what she has been given, not what she has earned.<p>- Paul echoes this bridal imagery when he tells believers, &#8220;I promised you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Her gown is embroidered with gold</b><p>- Gold signifies both royalty and purity. In <a href="/exodus/28-2.htm">Exodus 28:2, 5</a> the high-priestly garments were fashioned &#8220;for glory and for beauty,&#8221; using threads of gold&#8212;pointing forward to a people set apart to serve and reign with their King (<a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18</a>).<p>- <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a> celebrates this same gift: &#8220;He has clothed me with garments of salvation and wrapped me in a robe of righteousness&#8230; like a bride adorned with her jewels&#8221;. The bride&#8217;s golden embroidery mirrors the righteousness imputed by the King.<p>- While the outward gown dazzles, Scripture never disconnects external beauty from inner reality. <a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3-4</a> reminds God&#8217;s daughters that true adornment is &#8220;the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit&#8221;. The golden threads reflect an inner glory wrought by grace.<p>- Practically, the verse calls believers to live out the &#8220;righteous acts of the saints&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>). The embroidery of gold is a visual of lives woven with obedience, worship, and service, displaying the King&#8217;s wealth in daily conduct.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/45-13.htm">Psalm 45:13</a> paints a royal bride made glorious by her King and robed in gold that He provides. Historically, it honored a Davidic wedding; prophetically, it celebrates Christ and His church. The verse invites us to rest in the intimacy He offers, rejoice in the righteousness He bestows, and reflect His splendor in lives richly embroidered with faithful devotion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/45.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">The king's daughter is all glorious within</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, in the interior, in the inner room of the palace. The next clause would alone dismiss the reference to moral qualities from which has sprung such a wealth of mystic interpretation. But what palace is intended? Certainly not that of the royal bridegroom, since the procession (see <a href="/psalms/45-14.htm" title="She shall be brought to the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought to you.">Psalm 45:14</a>) has not yet reached its destination.
