Biblically, "workers of iniquity" refers to individuals who actively engage in sin and wrongdoing. The rhetorical question implies a sense of frustration and disbelief at their continued ignorance and rebellion against God. This theme is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>, which speaks of fools who hate knowledge. Historically, this reflects the ongoing struggle between the righteous and the wicked, a common theme in the Psalms. The phrase also suggests a moral blindness, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21-22</a>, where people fail to honor God despite knowing Him.<p><b>They devour my people like bread;</b><br>This imagery of devouring suggests a predatory and consuming nature of the wicked towards the righteous. In ancient Near Eastern culture, bread was a staple food, symbolizing sustenance and daily life. The comparison indicates how casually and routinely the wicked oppress the righteous, as if it were as natural as eating. This reflects the historical context of Israel, often besieged by enemies who sought to destroy them. The phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), contrasting the life-giving nature of Christ with the destructive nature of the wicked.<p><b>they refuse to call upon God.</b><br>This phrase highlights the willful rejection of God by the wicked. To "call upon God" is to seek His guidance, help, and presence, a fundamental aspect of a faithful life. The refusal indicates a deliberate choice to live independently of God's will, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of rebellion against God, as seen in <a href="/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-12</a>, which states that no one seeks God. This refusal is not just ignorance but a conscious decision to reject divine authority, reflecting the spiritual state of those who are separated from God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/workers_of_iniquity.htm">Workers of Iniquity</a></b><br>This term refers to those who commit sin and act wickedly, often in deliberate opposition to God's will. In the context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/53.htm">Psalm 53</a>, they are characterized by their lack of understanding and refusal to seek God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/my_people.htm">My People</a></b><br>This phrase refers to the people of God, often understood as the Israelites in the Old Testament context. They are depicted as victims of the wicked's actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in the Psalm, representing righteousness and the ultimate judge of human actions.

Israel&#8217;s own judges witnessed an endless cycle of sin and chastening (<a href="/judges/2-19.htm">Judges 2:19</a>). <a href="/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10&#8211;12</a> quotes this very psalm to prove that, apart from grace, no one seeks God or understands.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Workers&#8221; emphasizes deliberate activity, not accidental lapses (<a href="/psalms/5-5.htm">Psalm 5:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/7-23.htm">Matthew 7:23</a>). They invest effort in evil while ignoring the God who repeatedly warns and disciplines.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They devour my people like bread</b><p>&#8226; Eating bread is routine, effortless, and daily; so is the persecution the wicked inflict on God&#8217;s people (<a href="/psalms/27-2.htm">Psalm 27:2</a>; <a href="/micah/3-3.htm">Micah 3:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The metaphor highlights both appetite and callousness. As easily as one chews a crust, they chew up lives, reputations, and freedoms (<a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; Behind this hostility stands the ancient enmity between the serpent&#8217;s seed and the woman&#8217;s (<a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>). Yet God keeps a careful count of every tear (<a href="/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>) and promises final justice (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:6&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They refuse to call upon God</b><p>&#8226; Here lies the root problem: rejection of fellowship with the Lord.

By refusing, the wicked declare self-sufficiency and cut themselves off from the only source of wisdom they &#8220;never learn.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Contrast them with believers who &#8220;pray without ceasing&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>) and find bread for their own souls in Christ, the living manna (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/53-4.htm">Psalm 53:4</a> paints a three-part portrait of the unrepentant: willful ignorance, habitual oppression, and stubborn prayerlessness.
