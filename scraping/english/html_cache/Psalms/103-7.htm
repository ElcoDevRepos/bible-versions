Moses is often seen as a type of Christ, serving as a mediator between God and His people. The "ways" of God refer to His character, laws, and plans, which were revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai (Exodus 19-20). This revelation included the Ten Commandments and the detailed instructions for the tabernacle, which symbolized God's presence among His people. Moses' unique relationship with God is emphasized in <a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6-8</a>, where God speaks to him "face to face," unlike any other prophet. This direct communication underscores the special role Moses played in leading Israel and establishing the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>His deeds to the people of Israel</b><br>The "deeds" refer to the mighty acts and miracles God performed on behalf of the Israelites, particularly during the Exodus from Egypt. These include the plagues, the parting of the Red Sea, and the provision of manna and water in the wilderness (Exodus 7-16). These acts demonstrated God's power, faithfulness, and commitment to His covenant promises. The historical context of these events is crucial, as they occurred during a time when Israel was transitioning from slavery to becoming a nation under God's rule. The deeds of God served as a testimony to His sovereignty and were meant to instill faith and obedience in the Israelites. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative, where God's mighty works are continually recounted to remind His people of His faithfulness and to encourage trust in His future promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage.
