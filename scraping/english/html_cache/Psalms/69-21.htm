Gall, a bitter substance, symbolizes extreme bitterness and hardship. In biblical times, gall was often associated with poison or something that causes suffering. This imagery is used to express the psalmist's experience of being given something harmful instead of nourishment. The use of gall can be seen as a metaphor for the betrayal and hostility faced by the psalmist, which is a theme that resonates throughout the Psalms. This phrase also foreshadows the suffering of Jesus Christ, who was offered gall during His crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-34.htm">Matthew 27:34</a>). The bitterness of gall highlights the depth of the psalmist's anguish and the betrayal by those who should have offered support.<p><b>and gave me vinegar to quench my thirst</b><br>Vinegar, a sour wine, was commonly used in ancient times as a cheap drink for soldiers and laborers. In this context, it represents a mockery of the psalmist's need for relief and refreshment. Instead of receiving water to quench his thirst, he is given something that exacerbates his suffering. This act of giving vinegar is a direct connection to the crucifixion of Jesus, where He was offered vinegar to drink (<a href="/john/19-28.htm">John 19:28-30</a>). This prophetic element underscores the messianic nature of the psalm, as it points to the fulfillment of Scripture in the New Testament. The offering of vinegar to Jesus on the cross is seen as a fulfillment of this verse, highlighting the continuity between the Old and New Testaments and the typology of Christ's suffering as prefigured in the Psalms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, David is expressing his deep distress and suffering, which is often seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's own suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_david.htm">Enemies of David</a></b><br>The individuals who caused David's suffering by giving him gall and vinegar, symbolizing betrayal and cruelty.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>In the New Testament, this verse is seen as prophetic of Jesus' crucifixion, where He was offered vinegar to drink.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/golgotha.htm">Golgotha</a></b><br>The place of Jesus' crucifixion, where the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a> is fulfilled.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_soldiers.htm">Roman Soldiers</a></b><br>The ones who offered Jesus vinegar during His crucifixion, fulfilling the prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_fulfillment.htm">Prophetic Fulfillment</a></b><br><a href="/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a> is a clear example of how Old Testament prophecies are fulfilled in the New Testament, specifically in the life and crucifixion of Jesus Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/endurance_in_suffering.htm">Endurance in Suffering</a></b><br>Just as David and ultimately Jesus endured suffering and betrayal, believers are called to endure hardships with faith, trusting in God's ultimate plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_betrayal.htm">Recognizing Betrayal</a></b><br>The offering of gall and vinegar symbolizes betrayal and cruelty.
