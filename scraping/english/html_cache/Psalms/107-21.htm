The act of giving thanks is not just a response to God's actions but a recognition of His sovereignty and goodness. In the Old Testament, thanksgiving was often expressed through sacrifices and offerings (<a href="/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12-15</a>). The call to give thanks is a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and His people, where gratitude is a natural response to His faithfulness.<p><b>for His loving devotion</b><br>The term "loving devotion" is often translated from the Hebrew word "chesed," which encompasses God's steadfast love, mercy, and kindness. This concept is central to the understanding of God's character in the Hebrew Bible. It reflects a covenantal love that is unwavering and faithful, as seen in God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This loving devotion is not based on human merit but on God's nature, as demonstrated in His dealings with Israel throughout their history.<p><b>and His wonders</b><br>The "wonders" refer to the miraculous acts of God, which serve as signs of His power and presence. In the context of the Psalms, these wonders often recall the mighty deeds God performed during the Exodus, such as the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>) and the provision of manna in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-14.htm">Exodus 16:14-15</a>). These acts are not only historical events but also typological foreshadowings of the greater deliverance through Jesus Christ, who performed miracles as signs of His divine authority (<a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>).<p><b>to the sons of men</b><br>This phrase indicates the universal scope of God's actions and love. While the immediate context of the Psalm may focus on Israel, the reference to "the sons of men" suggests that God's wonders and loving devotion extend to all humanity. This inclusivity is echoed in the New Testament, where the Gospel is proclaimed to all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). The phrase also highlights the human response to divine intervention, calling all people to recognize and give thanks for God's works.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and faithfulness to His promises.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_men.htm">Sons of Men</a></b><br>A term referring to humanity in general, highlighting God's interaction and relationship with all people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wonders.htm">Wonders</a></b><br>Refers to the miraculous acts and deeds of God that demonstrate His power and loving devotion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_as_worship.htm">Gratitude as Worship</a></b><br>Giving thanks is a form of worship that acknowledges God's loving devotion and miraculous works in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_god's_wonders.htm">Recognizing God's Wonders</a></b><br>We are called to be attentive to the wonders God performs, both in the biblical account and in our personal experiences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_god's_love.htm">The Universality of God's Love</a></b><br>God's loving devotion extends to all humanity, inviting everyone to respond with gratitude.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultivating_a_thankful_heart.htm">Cultivating a Thankful Heart</a></b><br>Regularly reflecting on God's goodness and expressing thanks can transform our perspective and deepen our faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witnessing_through_thanksgiving.htm">Witnessing Through Thanksgiving</a></b><br>Our expressions of gratitude can serve as a testimony to others of God's active presence and love in the world.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_107_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 107:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ways_to_give_thanks_daily_per_Psalm_107_21.htm">How can we "give thanks" in our daily lives as Psalm 107:21 suggests?
