The term "ordinances" refers to God's decrees or commands, which are part of the Torah given to Moses. In the historical context, the Israelites were expected to meditate on the law day and night (<a href="/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a>). The psalmist's declaration reflects a heart aligned with God's will, similar to the description of the righteous man in <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>. This commitment to God's ordinances can be seen as a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>I have not disregarded His statutes.</b><br>The word "statutes" refers to specific laws or decrees that require obedience. The psalmist's assertion of not disregarding them indicates a life of faithfulness and integrity. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, adherence to God's statutes was a sign of covenant faithfulness. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of obedience leading to blessing, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The psalmist's faithfulness prefigures Christ's perfect obedience to the Father, as seen in <a href="/john/8-29.htm">John 8:29</a>, where Jesus states that He always does what pleases God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David is expressing his devotion and obedience to God's laws.

He is choosing to live with the Word front-and-center, not tucked away for emergencies.<p>&#8226; This echoes <a href="/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a>, where the Lord tells Joshua to keep the Book of the Law &#8220;always on your lips.&#8221; It also parallels <a href="/psalms/119-30.htm">Psalm 119:30</a>, &#8220;I have set Your ordinances before me,&#8221; showing a deliberate, ongoing focus.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;all His ordinances&#8221; reminds us that the believer isn&#8217;t free to pick and choose which parts of God&#8217;s instruction to follow. <a href="/proverbs/3-1.htm">Proverbs 3:1&#8211;2</a> urges, &#8220;My son, do not forget My teaching, but let your heart keep My commandments.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By keeping every ordinance &#8220;before&#8221; him, David demonstrates a heart that values God&#8217;s wisdom above his own impulses (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have not disregarded His statutes</b><p>&#8226; The second line, &#8220;I have not disregarded His statutes,&#8221; highlights active obedience. Unlike Saul, who blatantly ignored God&#8217;s clear commands (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22&#8211;23</a>), David can sincerely say he does not shove God&#8217;s statutes aside.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/119-102.htm">Psalm 119:102</a> offers a similar testimony: &#8220;I have not departed from Your judgments, for You Yourself have instructed me.&#8221; This isn&#8217;t a claim to sinless perfection; it is a declaration of consistent loyalty. When David failed, he repented swiftly (<a href="/bsb/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>).<p>&#8226; God later sums up David&#8217;s life this way: &#8220;My servant David kept My commandments and followed Me with all his heart, doing only what was right in My eyes&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/14-8.htm">1 Kings 14:8</a>). The overall pattern of obedience matters, and God notices.<p>&#8226; Jesus echoes the same principle: &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). True devotion is inseparable from submission to divine authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/18-22.htm">Psalm 18:22</a> shows David holding God&#8217;s Word in constant view and refusing to brush it aside. He loves, trusts, and obeys every statute the Lord has revealed. For believers today, the verse is an invitation to keep Scripture continually before us and to demonstrate genuine love for God through steadfast obedience, knowing He still blesses those who trust and follow His unchanging Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For all his judgments were</span> <span class="cmt_word">before me;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "all his commandments" (compare the use of the same word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;</span> throughout the hundred and nineteenth psalm). <span class="cmt_word">And I did not put away his statutes</span> <span class="cmt_word">from me.</span> The wicked are said to "cast God's commandments behind their back" (<a href="/1_kings/14-9.htm">1 Kings 14:9</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/9-26.htm">Nehemiah 9:26</a>; <a href="/psalms/50-17.htm">Psalm 50:17</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/23-35.htm">Ezekiel 23:35</a>).
