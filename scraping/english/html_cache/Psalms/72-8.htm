In the biblical context, "from sea to sea" often refers to the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Dead Sea or the Red Sea to the east. This expression is a poetic way of describing a kingdom that spans the entire known world of the time. It reflects the ideal of a universal reign, which is a common theme in messianic prophecies. The imagery of a king ruling over all lands is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/zechariah/9-10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a>, which also speaks of a dominion from sea to sea. This can be seen as a type of Christ, whose spiritual kingdom is prophesied to extend over all nations, as seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>and from the Euphrates</b><br>The Euphrates River was one of the great rivers of the ancient Near East and often marked the northeastern boundary of Israel's promised land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>). It was a significant geographical marker, representing the extent of the land promised to Abraham and his descendants. In the context of <a href="/psalms/72.htm">Psalm 72</a>, it symbolizes the far-reaching influence and authority of the king's rule. Historically, the Euphrates was a major trade route, and control over it would imply economic and political power. This phrase also connects to the Davidic covenant, where God promises David's descendants a kingdom that would be established forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>), ultimately fulfilled in the reign of Jesus Christ.<p><b>to the ends of the earth</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the universal scope of the king's reign, extending beyond the known world of the psalmist's time. It suggests a dominion that is not limited by geographical boundaries, pointing to a future where the king's influence reaches all nations. In the biblical narrative, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of the messianic kingdom, where Christ's rule is recognized globally. The idea of reaching "the ends of the earth" is also found in the New Testament, where the gospel is to be preached to all nations (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). This universal reign is a key aspect of the eschatological hope in Christian theology, where Christ's kingdom is fully realized in the new creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Solomon, this psalm is a royal psalm that prays for the king's reign and prosperity.
