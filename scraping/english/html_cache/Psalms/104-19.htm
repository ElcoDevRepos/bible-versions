In ancient Israel, the lunar calendar was essential for determining religious festivals and agricultural cycles, such as Passover and the Feast of Tabernacles. The moon's phases were crucial for marking these times, reflecting God's order in creation. <a href="/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14-18</a> also highlights the role of celestial bodies in marking time, reinforcing the idea of divine design. The moon's regularity symbolizes God's faithfulness and the predictability of His creation.<p><b>the sun knows when to set.</b><br>The sun's setting is depicted as an act of obedience to God's design, illustrating the natural order established by the Creator. This reflects the daily cycle of light and darkness, which is foundational to life on earth. The sun's reliability is a testament to God's control over the universe, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/19-4.htm">Psalm 19:4-6</a>, where the sun's course is described as a joyful, ordained path. The setting sun also signifies the end of a day, a time for rest and reflection, aligning with the biblical theme of Sabbath rest and the rhythm of work and rest established by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (He)</a></b><br>The Creator who established the celestial bodies to govern time and seasons.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moon.htm">Moon</a></b><br>A celestial body created by God to mark the seasons, reflecting His order and design.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sun.htm">Sun</a></b><br>Another celestial body that follows a divinely appointed path, knowing when to set, symbolizing God's control over time and nature.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_order_and_design.htm">Divine Order and Design</a></b><br>God&#8217;s creation is not random but follows a precise order.

The sun is no mere mechanical timepiece to the Israelite poet, but a conscious servant of God. How beautifully this mention of sunset prepares the way for the exquisite picture of the nocturnal landscape, as the sunrise in <a href="/psalms/104-22.htm" title="The sun rises, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.">Psalm 104:22</a> does for the landscape of the day.<p>In Genesis the creation of the "heavenly bodies"--the fourth day's work--is related in, so to speak, a scientific manner. But the poet, as in the former part of his treatment of the subject, at once goes to the influence of these phenomena on animated being. In Genesis the lamps of heaven are, as it were, hung out at God's command; in the poem they seem to move to their office of guiding the seasons and illuminating the earth like living things who are conscious of the glorious function they have to perform.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/104.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He appointed the moon for seasons</span> (comp. <a href="/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14</a>).
