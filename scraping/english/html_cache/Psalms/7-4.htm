The psalmist, traditionally understood to be David, is asserting his innocence before God. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, loyalty to allies was a significant moral and social obligation. Betraying an ally would have been seen as a grave sin, violating the covenantal relationships that were central to Israelite society. This plea can be connected to the broader biblical theme of integrity and righteousness, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/17-13.htm">Proverbs 17:13</a>, which warns against repaying good with evil. The phrase also foreshadows the betrayal of Jesus by Judas, highlighting the ultimate act of rewarding good with evil.<p><b>if I have plundered my foe without cause</b><br>Here, the psalmist is emphasizing his commitment to justice, even towards his enemies. In the historical context, plundering was a common practice in warfare, yet the psalmist claims innocence of such acts without justification. This reflects the biblical principle of just warfare and the importance of righteous conduct, even in conflict, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/20.htm">Deuteronomy 20</a>, which outlines ethical warfare practices. The phrase underscores the importance of motive and justice, aligning with Jesus' teachings in <a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>, where He instructs to love enemies and pray for those who persecute you. This commitment to justice and righteousness, even towards foes, is a type of Christ, who exemplified perfect justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of the psalm, traditionally believed to be King David, who often wrote psalms during times of distress and persecution.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cush,_a_benjamite.htm">Cush, a Benjamite</a></b><br>The psalm is attributed to David concerning the words of Cush, a Benjamite.

He stakes his safety on that innocence, foreshadowing Christ&#8217;s call to repay evil with good. The verse challenges believers to the same blameless integrity&#8212;loyal to allies, honorable toward foes&#8212;trusting God, not self, to right every wrong.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Yea, I have</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., on the contrary, so far from returning evil for good, I have returned good for evil. </span>With allusion, there can be little doubt, to the incidents referred to in the last Note. From metrical reasons, and also to avoid the abruptness of the change of construction, Ewald conjectures that two clauses have dropped out of the text, and restores as follows--<p>"If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me<p>(And cunning unto him that was at peace with me,<p>Yea, if I have not rewarded his soul with good).<p>And delivered him that without cause is my enemy."<p>Milton's translation gives yet another colour to the passage--<p>"If I have wrought<p>Ill to him that meant me peace,<p>Or to him have rendered less,<p>And not freed my foe for nought."<p>The conjecture of a corruption of the text is supported by the rendering of the LXX. and Vulg., and a very slight change gives the probable rendering: "If I have returned evil to him that dealt friendly with me, and injured my enemy without cause."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me</span>. This is probably the true meaning. David denies that he has wantonly attacked and injured any one with whom he was on friendly and peaceable terms. No doubt he was accused of having estranged Saul by plotting to take the crown from him<span class="cmt_word">. (Yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy.)</span> This translation, which is retained by our Revisers, has the support also of Ewald, Hupfeld, Mr. Aglen, and the 'Speaker's Commentary.' If accepted, it must be considered as a reference to <a href="/1_samuel/24-7.htm">1 Samuel 24:7</a>, or else to <a href="/1_samuel/26-9.htm">1 Samuel 26:9</a>, or both, and as a sort of parenthetic protest, "Nay, not only have I not injured a friend, but I have gone so far as to let my enemy escape me." A different meaning is, however, given to the passage by many critics, as Rosenmuller, Hengstenberg, Bishop Horsley, Cheyne, etc., who regard the sense as running on without any parenthesis, and translate, "If I have oppressed him who without cause is mine enemy." David, according to this view, denies that he has either injured a friend or requited evil to a foe. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/7-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have rewarded</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1453;&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(g&#257;&#183;mal&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1580.htm">Strong's 1580: </a> </span><span class="str2">To deal fully or adequately with, deal out to, wean, ripen</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my ally</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#333;&#183;wl&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular construct &#124;
