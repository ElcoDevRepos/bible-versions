The salvation of Israel is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, emphasizing God's faithfulness to His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This act of salvation is not based on the merit of the people but on God's grace and mercy. It reflects the broader biblical narrative of God as a deliverer, a theme that culminates in the New Testament with the salvation offered through Jesus Christ.<p><b>for the sake of His name</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, a name was more than just an identifier; it represented one's character and reputation. God's actions are often described as being for the sake of His name, meaning they are done to uphold His holiness, faithfulness, and reputation among the nations. This concept is echoed in <a href="/ezekiel/20-9.htm">Ezekiel 20:9</a> and <a href="/isaiah/48-9.htm">Isaiah 48:9-11</a>, where God acts to protect the sanctity of His name. It underscores the idea that God's ultimate purpose is His own glory, a theme that runs throughout Scripture.<p><b>to make His power known</b><br>This phrase points to the demonstration of God's might and authority, particularly through miraculous events like the plagues in Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea. These acts served as a testament to God's supremacy over the false gods of Egypt and the natural world. The display of divine power is a recurring motif in the Bible, intended to inspire awe and reverence among both the Israelites and surrounding nations. It also foreshadows the ultimate revelation of God's power through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which is the cornerstone of Christian faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, highlighting His sovereignty and the motivation behind His actions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people whom God saved, representing His chosen nation and the recipients of His mercy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place of bondage from which God delivered the Israelites, symbolizing oppression and sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea.htm">The Red Sea</a></b><br>The event of crossing the Red Sea is a significant demonstration of God's power and salvation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>Though not directly mentioned in this verse, he is the leader through whom God performed the miraculous deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_purpose.htm">God's Sovereignty and Purpose</a></b><br>God's actions are driven by His sovereign will and purpose, not merely human merit.
