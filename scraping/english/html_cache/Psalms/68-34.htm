In biblical context, "ascribe" means to attribute or give credit. This is a call to worship, acknowledging God's sovereignty and omnipotence. Throughout Scripture, God's power is evident in creation (Genesis 1), in His deliverance of Israel from Egypt (Exodus 14), and in His ongoing sustenance of the world (<a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>). The act of ascribing power to God is an acknowledgment of His rightful place as the ultimate authority over all things.<p><b>Whose majesty is over Israel</b><br>This phrase highlights God's special relationship with Israel, His chosen people. Historically, Israel was set apart by God to be a nation through which He would reveal Himself to the world (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>). God's majesty over Israel is seen in His covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>), His guidance through the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>), and His establishment of the Davidic kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). This majesty is also prophetic, pointing to the coming of Jesus Christ, the Messiah, who fulfills God's promises to Israel (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1-17</a>).<p><b>Whose strength is in the skies</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's omnipotence and His dominion over the heavens. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the skies were often associated with the divine realm. God's strength in the skies is a reminder of His control over the natural world, as seen in the creation account (<a href="/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6-8</a>) and in His ability to command the weather (<a href="/job/37-5.htm">Job 37:5-6</a>). This imagery also connects to the New Testament, where Jesus' ascension into heaven (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>) and His promised return from the skies (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>) affirm His divine authority and power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as powerful and majestic, deserving of praise and recognition for His strength and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation over which God's majesty is declared.
