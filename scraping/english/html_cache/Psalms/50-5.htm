In the Old Testament context, saints are those who are set apart for God's purposes, typically the Israelites. The gathering implies a divine summons, reminiscent of the assembly at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-17.htm">Exodus 19:17</a>), where God called His people to receive the Law. This gathering can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the eschatological gathering of believers at the end of times, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>.<p><b>who made a covenant with Me</b><br>The covenant mentioned here refers to the solemn agreement between God and His people. In the Old Testament, covenants were central to the relationship between God and Israel, with the Mosaic Covenant being a primary example (<a href="/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7-8</a>). This covenant involved laws and commandments that the Israelites were to follow, and it established them as God's chosen people. The concept of covenant is foundational in Scripture, pointing to the New Covenant established through Jesus Christ (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, <a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>), which offers salvation to all who believe.<p><b>by sacrifice</b><br>Sacrifice was a crucial element of the Old Testament covenant, serving as a means of atonement and worship. The sacrificial system, detailed in Leviticus, involved offerings that symbolized repentance and devotion to God. This phrase highlights the importance of sacrifice in maintaining the covenant relationship. In the New Testament, Jesus Christ is seen as the ultimate sacrifice, fulfilling and surpassing the Old Testament sacrificial system (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>). His sacrifice on the cross is the basis for the New Covenant, providing eternal redemption for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, calling His people to gather.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/saints.htm">Saints</a></b><br>Refers to the faithful followers of God, those who are set apart for His purposes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>A solemn agreement between God and His people, often sealed with a sacrifice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrifice.htm">Sacrifice</a></b><br>The act of offering something valuable to God, symbolizing commitment and worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/50.htm">Psalm 50</a>, a Levite and one of David's chief musicians, who conveys God's message.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_covenant.htm">Understanding Covenant</a></b><br>Recognize the seriousness and sacredness of a covenant with God, which involves commitment and sacrifice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_sacrifice.htm">The Role of Sacrifice</a></b><br>Reflect on how sacrifices in the Old Testament point to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, and how we are called to live sacrificially.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/gathering_of_the_faithful.htm">Gathering of the Faithful</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of community among believers, gathering together to worship and uphold the covenant.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_as_saints.htm">Living as Saints</a></b><br>Encourage believers to live lives that are set apart, reflecting their identity as God's saints.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_god.htm">Faithfulness to God</a></b><br>Highlight the importance of remaining faithful to the covenant, trusting in God's promises and commands.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_50_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 50:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_50_5_on_covenant_faithfulness.htm">How does Psalm 50:5 emphasize the importance of covenant faithfulness in our lives?

God does not simply gather random worshipers; He gathers those bound to Him by solemn promise.<p>&#8226; The foundation is the covenant inaugurated at Sinai: &#8220;Moses took the blood, sprinkled it on the people, and said, &#8216;This is the blood of the covenant that the LORD has made with you&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Every covenant initiative in Scripture originates with God (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>). Here, He reminds His people that they are covenant-keepers in His sight, even while later verses expose covenant breaches.<p>&#8226; The new covenant fulfilled in Christ&#8217;s blood (<a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>) intensifies this truth for believers: we, too, are bound to God by His own act of mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by sacrifice</b><p>&#8226; Covenants in Scripture are ratified with blood. <a href="/psalms/50-5.htm">Psalm 50:5</a> underscores that access to God is impossible without a substitutionary sacrifice.<p>&#8226; The original covenant was sealed by sacrificial blood at the altar (<a href="/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5-8</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/psalms/50.htm">Psalm 50</a> later critiques empty ritual (vv. 8-13) and highlights true thanksgiving (v. 14), but it never negates the necessity of sacrifice; it criticizes sacrifice without heart.<p>&#8226; The phrase anticipates the ultimate sacrifice of Christ: &#8220;But now He has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of Himself&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Therefore, believers today recognize that our gathering before God is made possible only &#8220;by a new and living way, opened for us through the curtain of His flesh&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-20.htm">Hebrews 10:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/50-5.htm">Psalm 50:5</a> pictures God summoning His covenant people into His presence. He initiates the gathering, claims the gathered as His own, reminds them of the blood-bound covenant, and points to the indispensable role of sacrifice. In the Old Testament context, this recalls Sinai; in its fullest sense, it foreshadows the once-for-all sacrifice of Jesus Christ, by which God still gathers His saints today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/50.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">My saints.</span>--This verse is of great importance, as containing a formal definition of the word <span class= "ital">chasidim, </span>and so a direction as to its interpretation wherever it occurs in the Hebrew hymn book.
