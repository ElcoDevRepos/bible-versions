It refers to an event recorded in <a href="/1_samuel/21-10.htm">1 Samuel 21:10-15</a>, where David, fleeing from King Saul, sought refuge with Achish, the king of Gath. "Abimelech" is likely a title, similar to "Pharaoh," rather than a personal name, as the king of Gath is called Achish in the Samuel account. David's feigned madness was a strategic move to escape potential danger, highlighting his resourcefulness and reliance on God for deliverance. This incident underscores the theme of God's protection and deliverance, which is central to the psalm.<p><b>I will bless the LORD at all times;</b><br>David's commitment to bless the LORD "at all times" reflects a deep, unwavering devotion. This phrase emphasizes the importance of continual worship and gratitude, regardless of circumstances. It aligns with other scriptures that encourage constant praise, such as <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:16-18</a>, which calls believers to rejoice always and give thanks in all circumstances. David's life, marked by trials and triumphs, exemplifies a heart that remains steadfast in worship.<p><b>His praise will always be on my lips.</b><br>The expression of praise being "always on my lips" suggests a lifestyle of worship that permeates every aspect of life. This phrase indicates that praise is not confined to formal worship settings but is a constant expression of faith. It connects to <a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>, which speaks of offering a "sacrifice of praise" continually. David's declaration serves as a model for believers to maintain an attitude of praise, reflecting a heart transformed by God's grace and goodness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, David wrote this psalm during a time of personal distress, specifically when he pretended to be insane before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he left (<a href="/1_samuel/21-10.htm">1 Samuel 21:10-15</a>). This context highlights David's reliance on God in times of trouble.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>A title used for Philistine kings, similar to "Pharaoh" in Egypt.

If the statement in the title may be relied upon, David's fortunes were now at the lowest ebb. He had fled from the court of Saul on finding that Saul was determined to put him to death (<a href="/1_samuel/20-31.htm">1 Samuel 20:31</a>). He had hoped to find a safe refuge with Achish, but had been disappointed. He was on the point of becoming a fugitive and an outlaw, a dweller in dens and caves of the earth (<a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>). He had as yet no body of followers.
