Historically, Israel often faced threats from surrounding nations, and this verse highlights the divine intervention that causes these adversaries to lose courage. The concept of foreigners losing heart can be seen in other biblical narratives, such as the fear of the Canaanites when Israel entered the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>). It underscores the power of God to protect His people and fulfill His promises.<p><b>and come trembling</b><br>The imagery of trembling suggests a profound fear and recognition of God's might. This reaction is not merely physical but also spiritual, indicating an acknowledgment of the God of Israel's supremacy. In the broader biblical context, trembling before God is a common response to His presence and power, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>, where the Israelites trembled at Mount Sinai. This trembling can also be seen as a type of reverence or awe that foreshadows the ultimate submission to Christ, who is the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>from their strongholds</b><br>Strongholds represent places of security and defense, often fortified cities or military positions. The fact that foreigners come trembling from these strongholds signifies the futility of relying on human strength and fortifications against the divine power of God. This theme is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>, which states that safety is of the Lord. Theologically, it points to the idea that true security is found not in physical defenses but in the Lord. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate stronghold and refuge for believers, as expressed in Psalms 18:2.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David is expressing his gratitude and praise to God for delivering him from his enemies.

In his lifetime that included Philistines, Moabites, Ammonites, and other surrounding peoples. The psalm parallels <a href="/2_samuel/22-45.htm">2 Samuel 22:45-46</a>, making it clear that the king&#8217;s victories came because the Lord Himself fought for him. Christ-looking readers see a picture of every power that resists the Messiah ultimately having to acknowledge His authority (<a href="/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8-12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lose heart</b><p>To &#8220;lose heart&#8221; is to watch courage melt away. When Israel entered Canaan, Rahab said, &#8220;When we heard of it, our hearts melted and everyone&#8217;s courage failed&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/2-11.htm">Joshua 2:11</a>). The same language shows up when God overthrows Egypt (<a href="/exodus/15-15.htm">Exodus 15:15</a>). The pattern is consistent: when the Lord arises on behalf of His people, adversaries are stripped of confidence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Come trembling</b><p>The verse moves from inner collapse to outward response. Those who once boasted now &#8220;come trembling.&#8221; <a href="/psalms/81-15.htm">Psalm 81:15</a> notes that &#8220;those who hate the LORD will pretend obedience,&#8221; while <a href="/micah/7-17.htm">Micah 7:17</a> says nations &#8220;will come trembling out of their dens; they will turn in fear to the LORD.&#8221; Whether the trembling is genuine repentance or reluctant submission, the sovereignty of God is unmistakable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From their strongholds</b><p>Strongholds symbolize security&#8212;walled cities, mountain fortresses, political alliances. Yet even fortified places cannot hide an enemy from divine judgment. <a href="/jeremiah/48-41.htm">Jeremiah 48:41</a> describes Moab&#8217;s citadels falling, and <a href="/obadiah/1-3.htm">Obadiah 1:3-4</a> exposes the futility of dwelling &#8220;in the clefts of the rock.&#8221; David&#8217;s testimony shows that when God intervenes, opposing forces abandon their most secure positions and present themselves in fear.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/18-45.htm">Psalm 18:45</a> promises that every opposition to God&#8217;s rule&#8212;whether ancient armies, future world powers, or personal spiritual enemies&#8212;will lose heart, leave their supposed safety, and stand trembling before the King. The verse reassures believers that the Lord&#8217;s deliverance is total: He not only preserves His people but also humbles every adversary, proving that no fortress can withstand His reign.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(45) <span class= "bld">Fade away</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, wither like vegetation before a scorching blast.<p><span class= "bld">Be afraid out of their close places.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">come trembling out of their castles. </span>LXX. and Vulgate have "grow old and came limping from their paths."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their</span> <span class="cmt_word">close places.</span> Converts are represented as coming into the Church, not merely from love, but partly from fear.
