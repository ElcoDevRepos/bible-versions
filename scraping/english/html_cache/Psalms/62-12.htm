The Hebrew word often translated as "loving devotion" is "chesed," which conveys a sense of loyal love and mercy. This concept is central to the Old Testament, reflecting God's enduring commitment to Israel despite their frequent unfaithfulness. It is a reminder of God's character as seen in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, where God describes Himself as "abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness." This loving devotion is not only a characteristic of God but also a call for His people to respond in kind, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, where the Israelites are commanded to love the Lord with all their heart, soul, and strength. The phrase also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of God's love through Jesus Christ, who embodies divine love and calls His followers to love one another as He has loved them (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>).<p><b>For You will repay each man according to his deeds.</b><br>This phrase underscores the biblical principle of divine justice and retribution. It reflects the belief that God is a righteous judge who will ultimately hold every person accountable for their actions. This concept is rooted in the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, such as <a href="/proverbs/24-12.htm">Proverbs 24:12</a>, which states that God will repay each person according to what they have done. It also echoes the prophetic writings, like <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>, where God declares that He searches the heart and examines the mind to reward each person according to their conduct. In the New Testament, this principle is affirmed in passages like <a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>, where Paul writes that God "will repay each person according to what they have done." This phrase serves as both a warning and an encouragement, reminding believers of the importance of living righteously and trusting in God's ultimate justice. It also points to the final judgment, where Christ will judge the living and the dead, as described in <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12-13</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/62.htm">Psalm 62</a>, David was the second king of Israel and a man after God's own heart.
