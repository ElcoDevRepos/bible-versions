In ancient Israel, debt was a serious matter, often leading to loss of property or even enslavement. The creditor here symbolizes the consequences of one's actions, aligning with the biblical principle of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). This imprecation is part of a larger tradition of lament and imprecatory psalms, where the psalmist calls upon God to enact justice. The cultural context of debt and servitude in the ancient Near East underscores the severity of this curse, as losing one's possessions could mean losing one's livelihood and social standing.<p><b>and strangers plunder the fruits of his labor</b><br>The mention of "strangers" plundering the fruits of one's labor highlights the complete loss and humiliation intended for the enemy. In the agrarian society of ancient Israel, the "fruits of labor" would primarily refer to agricultural produce, which was essential for survival and prosperity. The involvement of "strangers" suggests a loss of protection and community, as outsiders taking what one has worked for indicates a breakdown of social and familial support. This imagery connects to the curses found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience to God leads to foreign nations consuming the labor of the Israelites. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and separation from God, as seen in the parables of Jesus, where the unfaithful are cast out and their rewards given to others (<a href="/matthew/25-28.htm">Matthew 25:28-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/109.htm">Psalm 109</a>, David is expressing a deep lament and imprecation against his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_david.htm">Enemies of David</a></b><br>The psalm is directed towards those who have wronged David, possibly including individuals who have betrayed or falsely accused him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/creditor.htm">Creditor</a></b><br>Represents those who would take advantage of the psalmist's enemies, seizing their possessions as a form of divine justice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/strangers.htm">Strangers</a></b><br>Symbolize outsiders who would benefit from the downfall of the psalmist's adversaries, further emphasizing the totality of their loss.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fruits_of_labor.htm">Fruits of Labor</a></b><br>Refers to the results of one's work and efforts, which in this context, are taken away as a consequence of wrongdoing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_injustice.htm">The Consequences of Injustice</a></b><br>The verse serves as a reminder that injustice and betrayal can lead to severe consequences, both spiritually and materially.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's justice may manifest in ways that seem harsh, but they serve to uphold righteousness and deter wrongdoing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer.htm">The Power of Prayer</a></b><br>David's imprecatory prayer reflects the power of bringing grievances before God, trusting Him to handle justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_integrity.htm">The Importance of Integrity</a></b><br>Maintaining integrity in our dealings can protect us from the kind of divine retribution described in this psalm.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/empathy_and_forgiveness.htm">Empathy and Forgiveness</a></b><br>While the psalm reflects a call for justice, Christians are also called to balance justice with mercy and forgiveness, following Christ's example.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_109_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 109:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_109_11_God_s_justice_on_wicked.htm">How does Psalm 109:11 reflect God's justice against the wicked?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lesson_on_sin_s_consequences.htm">What does "creditor seize all he has" teach about consequences of sin?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Use_Psalm_109_11_for_enemy_deliverance.htm">How can we apply Psalm 109:11 in praying for deliverance from enemies?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Psalm_109_11_Prov_22_7_on_debt_power.htm">Connect Psalm 109:11 with Proverbs 22:7 on the power of creditors.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Believers_response_to_injustice_8.htm">How should believers respond to injustice, inspired by Psalm 109:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_109_11_historical_context.htm">What is the historical context of Psalm 109:11 in the Bible?
