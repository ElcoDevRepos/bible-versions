Despite being the smallest tribe, Benjamin's role in leadership is highlighted here, possibly alluding to King Saul, Israel's first king, who was from the tribe of Benjamin. This phrase may also symbolize the unexpected ways God chooses leaders, emphasizing that divine selection is not based on human standards of power or size. The tribe's location, near Jerusalem, gave it strategic importance. Benjamin's leadership can be seen as a type of Christ, who, though humble and seemingly insignificant, rules with divine authority.<p><b>the princes of Judah in their company</b><br>Judah, the tribe from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ descended, is often associated with leadership and kingship. The mention of Judah's princes signifies the tribe's prominence and its role in unifying the nation. Judah's presence alongside Benjamin suggests a harmonious leadership, reflecting the unity desired among God's people. This unity prefigures the coming of Christ, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, who unites all believers under His reign.<p><b>the princes of Zebulun and of Naphtali</b><br>Zebulun and Naphtali were tribes located in the northern part of Israel. Their inclusion here highlights the participation of all Israel in worship and leadership, not just the southern tribes. This reflects the broader unity and diversity within the nation. In a prophetic sense, these tribes are significant in <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, which speaks of a great light shining in Galilee, fulfilled in Jesus' ministry.

If the psalm is to be accounted as David's, we may note it as a graceful act on his part that he places Saul's tribe first. The princes of Judah and their council. Again "and" is wrongly supplied. "The princes of Judah" are called "their council," or "their bulwark" (Kay), as holding the most important position in Israel at the time.
