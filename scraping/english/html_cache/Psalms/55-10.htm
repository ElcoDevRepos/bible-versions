In biblical times, the concept of "day and night" often signifies something that is unceasing or persistent. This can be seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>, where the righteous meditate on the law "day and night," indicating a constant devotion. The imagery here suggests a situation of ongoing vigilance or danger, reflecting the psalmist's sense of urgency and distress.<p><b>they encircle the walls</b><br>The imagery of encircling walls suggests a siege or a state of being surrounded by enemies. In ancient cities, walls were crucial for protection, and to have them encircled would imply a significant threat. This can be connected to the historical context of Jerusalem, a city often under threat from surrounding nations. The encircling of walls can also symbolize spiritual warfare, where believers feel besieged by sin or evil forces. This imagery is reminiscent of the siege of Jerusalem by the Babylonians, as described in <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>.<p><b>while malice and trouble lie within</b><br>This phrase indicates that the threat is not only external but also internal. "Malice and trouble" suggest internal corruption or betrayal, which can be more dangerous than external enemies. This reflects the psalmist's lament over betrayal by close companions, as seen in the broader context of <a href="/psalms/55.htm">Psalm 55</a>. The internal strife within a community or individual can be more destructive than external attacks, echoing the theme of betrayal by a trusted friend, similar to Judas' betrayal of Jesus in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>). This internal conflict can also be seen as a type of Christ, who faced betrayal and internal strife among His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/55.htm">Psalm 55</a>, David is expressing his distress over betrayal and the pervasive evil surrounding him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city whose walls are being encircled, symbolizing a place of supposed safety that is under threat.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>Those who are causing malice and trouble, representing both external and internal threats to David and the city.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/walls.htm">Walls</a></b><br>Symbolic of protection and security, yet they are being encircled by threats, indicating vulnerability.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/malice_and_trouble.htm">Malice and Trouble</a></b><br>Represent the internal corruption and external threats that David is lamenting.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/vigilance_in_prayer.htm">Vigilance in Prayer</a></b><br>Just as David was aware of the threats around him, we must be vigilant in prayer, seeking God's protection against both external and internal threats.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_the_heart.htm">Guarding the Heart</a></b><br>The internal presence of malice and trouble highlights the importance of guarding our hearts against sin and corruption.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_accountability.htm">Community Accountability</a></b><br>The encircling of the walls suggests the need for community vigilance and accountability to maintain spiritual integrity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_protection.htm">Trust in God's Protection</a></b><br>Despite the threats, David's psalm ultimately points to reliance on God's protection and deliverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/awareness_of_spiritual_warfare.htm">Awareness of Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Recognizing the spiritual dimension of our struggles helps us to rely on God's strength and armor.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_55_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 55:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_55_10_Evil_s_constant_presence.htm">How does Psalm 55:10 illustrate the persistence of evil in our lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_to_reduce_community_violence.htm">What actions can we take to combat "violence and strife" in our communities?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_55_10_and_Ephesians_6_12_link.htm">How does Psalm 55:10 connect with Ephesians 6:12 about spiritual warfare?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_seek_God_s_protection_daily.htm">In what ways can we seek God's protection from daily "violence and strife"?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_55_10_Pray_for_city_peace.htm">How can Psalm 55:10 encourage us to pray for peace in our cities?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_55_10_s_link_to_David_s_era.htm">How does Psalm 55:10 reflect the historical context of King David's reign?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_day_and_night_key_in_Psalm_55_10.htm">What is the significance of "day and night" in Psalm 55:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_55_10_s_link_to_biblical_betrayal.htm">How does Psalm 55:10 relate to the theme of betrayal in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_55.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 55?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_anxiety.htm">What is the Bible's perspective on anxiety?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/evidence_for_threats_in_psalm_5.htm">Has any historical or archaeological evidence been found to confirm the specific threats David describes in Psalm 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_to_find_strength_in_faith.htm">What does the Bible say about abuse?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/evidence_of_divine_acts_in_psalm_10_14-15.htm">What historical or archaeological evidence confirms the divine intervention claimed here?

David is not describing a brief skirmish but an unceasing pressure that spans every hour.<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses &#8220;day and night&#8221; to show something persistent&#8212;God&#8217;s people are called to pray without ceasing (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>), to meditate on His law &#8220;day and night&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>), and to stand guard continually, as Nehemiah&#8217;s builders did when &#8220;we&#8230; posted a guard against them day and night&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/4-9.htm">Nehemiah 4:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Here the enemy&#8217;s vigilance contrasts sharply with the believer&#8217;s call to steadfast devotion. If evil is relentless, our dependence on the LORD must be equally relentless.<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us of the spiritual alertness urged in <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, where our adversary &#8220;prowls around like a roaring lion.&#8221; Continuous attack demands continuous watchfulness and prayer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They encircle the walls</b><p>&#8226; The language of siege is literal for David: hostile forces ring Jerusalem, probing for weakness. Encirclement threatens not just military defeat but also suffocation of daily life&#8212;food, commerce, worship.<p>&#8226; Throughout biblical history, cities under siege illustrate the pressure God&#8217;s people face. When the king of Aram &#8220;sent horses, chariots, and a massive army&#8230; and surrounded the city&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/6-14.htm">2 Kings 6:14</a>), Elisha&#8217;s servant felt despair until his eyes were opened to the LORD&#8217;s greater army.<p>&#8226; Like those ancient walls, our lives, families, and churches can feel surrounded by cultural, moral, or personal attacks. Yet the LORD &#8220;is a shield around me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>). He is the true fortress; stone walls may fail, but His salvation stands firm.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s image also anticipates the cosmic siege described in <a href="/revelation/20-9.htm">Revelation 20:9</a>, when the nations &#8220;marched across the broad expanse of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints.&#8221; The final victory still belongs to God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Malice and trouble lie within</b><p>&#8226; The grim discovery: the city&#8217;s real danger isn&#8217;t only outside. &#8220;Malice and trouble&#8221; have already set up house inside the walls. External enemies are serious, but internal corruption is lethal.<p>&#8226; David experienced betrayal firsthand: &#8220;Even my close friend&#8230; has lifted up his heel against me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>). The treachery that wounded him prefigures Judas&#8217;s betrayal of Christ (<a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah laments a similar rot: &#8220;You dwell in the midst of deception&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/9-6.htm">Jeremiah 9:6</a>). Paul warned the Ephesian elders, &#8220;From your own number men will arise and distort the truth&#8221; (<a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29-30</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, the verse presses us to examine our own hearts and communities:<p>&#8211; Sin concealed behind respectable walls will one day undo the entire structure (<a href="/james/4-1.htm">James 4:1</a>).<p>&#8211; Church purity and personal repentance are not optional luxuries; they are frontline defenses.<p>&#8211; Guarding the gate matters, but cleansing the courtyard matters more (<a href="/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/55-10.htm">Psalm 55:10</a> shows a double threat&#8212;unceasing foes outside and hidden sin inside. David&#8217;s honesty calls us to constant vigilance (&#8220;day and night&#8221;), steadfast trust in God&#8217;s protection when surrounded, and courageous self-examination so malice finds no refuge within. The LORD who saves from siege also cleanses His dwelling place, making His people secure now and forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/55.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">They go.</span>--It is quite in keeping with the Hebrew style to suppose <span class= "ital">mischief </span>and <span class= "ital">strife </span>personified here as the ancient versions do, and not only occupying the <span class= "ital">city </span>as inhabitants, but prowling about its walls.
