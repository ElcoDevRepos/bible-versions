The imagery of a vine being cut down and burned suggests judgment and destruction. Historically, this can be linked to the invasions and exiles that Israel faced, such as the Assyrian conquest of the northern kingdom and the Babylonian exile of Judah. The cutting down and burning signify God's judgment due to Israel's unfaithfulness and idolatry. The vine metaphor also connects to Jesus Christ, who in <a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1-5</a> describes Himself as the true vine, emphasizing the need for spiritual connection and faithfulness to God.<p><b>they perish at the rebuke of Your countenance.</b><br>The phrase "rebuke of Your countenance" indicates God's displeasure and judgment. In biblical terms, God's countenance or face often represents His favor or disfavor (<a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>). When God turns His face away, it signifies a withdrawal of His blessing and protection. The perishing of the vine at God's rebuke underscores the seriousness of divine judgment. This can be seen in the historical context of Israel's repeated disobedience leading to national calamities. Theologically, it serves as a warning of the consequences of turning away from God. In a broader sense, it points to the ultimate judgment and the need for repentance and restoration through Christ, who offers reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vine.htm">The Vine</a></b><br>Symbolically represents Israel, God's chosen people, often depicted as a vineyard or vine in the Old Testament.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/fire.htm">Fire</a></b><br>Represents judgment and destruction, often used in the Bible to signify God's purifying or punitive actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_rebuke.htm">God's Rebuke</a></b><br>Indicates divine displeasure and correction, a response to the people's disobedience and sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, often experiencing cycles of faithfulness and rebellion, leading to divine discipline.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The attributed author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/80.htm">Psalm 80</a>, a leader of one of the temple choirs during the time of King David.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_discipline.htm">Understanding Divine Discipline</a></b><br>Recognize that God's rebuke is a form of loving discipline intended to bring His people back to righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Reflect on how turning away from God leads to spiritual and sometimes physical destruction.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_remaining_in_christ.htm">The Importance of Remaining in Christ</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to abide in Jesus, the true vine, to bear fruit and avoid spiritual decay.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_despite_our_failures.htm">God's Faithfulness Despite Our Failures</a></b><br>Even when we face judgment, God remains faithful and offers restoration to those who repent.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_intercession.htm">The Role of Intercession</a></b><br>Like Asaph, we are encouraged to intercede for our communities and nations, seeking God's mercy and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_80_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 80:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_80_16_Consequences_of_forsaking_God.htm">How does Psalm 80:16 illustrate the consequences of turning away from God?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Symbolism_of_burned_with_fire_in_Ps_80_16.htm">What does "burned with fire" symbolize in the context of Psalm 80:16?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Psalm_80_16_s_warning_today.htm">How can we apply the warning in Psalm 80:16 to our spiritual lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/NT_teachings_echoing_Psalm_80_16.htm">Which New Testament teachings align with the message in Psalm 80:16?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_80_16_Trust_in_God_s_care.htm">How does Psalm 80:16 encourage reliance on God's protection and guidance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_80_16_historical_events.htm">What historical events might Psalm 80:16 be referencing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_80_16_God_s_bond_with_Israel.htm">How does Psalm 80:16 reflect God's relationship with Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_does_vine_imagery_mean_in_Psalm_80_16.htm">What is the significance of the "vine" imagery in Psalm 80:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_80.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 80?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_psalm_80_4-5_show_a_kind_god.htm">How does Psalm 80:4-5 align with the image of a benevolent God when He supposedly 'feeds' and 'drinks' His people with sorrow and tears?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_there_proof_israel's_borders_expanded.htm">In Psalm 80:8-11, is there any historical or archaeological proof that Israel's borders expanded so miraculously they 'covered the mountains' and 'the mighty cedars?'</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_psalm_80_18_poetic_exaggeration.htm">Psalm 80:18 implies Israel's unwavering devotion once revived; however, biblical accounts frequently show Israel backsliding.

Verse 16 explains why salvation feels distant: the divine countenance is turned in rebuke, not favor.<p>- Yet the mention of God&#8217;s face also offers hope. If wrath flows from His face, restoration can come when He turns that same face toward His people in mercy (<a href="/psalms/80-19.htm">Psalm 80:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16</a> portrays Israel, God&#8217;s cherished vine, devastated by enemy axes and fire because of the Lord&#8217;s corrective rebuke. The verse teaches that covenant blessing and protection hinge on God&#8217;s favorable face; when He withdraws it, judgment falls swiftly. Still, the very imagery of &#8220;Your vine&#8221; hints that the same God who disciplines can replant, revive, and cause His face to shine again on His people who seek Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/80.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">It is burned.</span>--This verse would certainly be far more intelligible, and also fit better into the rhythm, if it followed immediately after <a href="/psalms/80-13.htm" title="The boar out of the wood does waste it, and the wild beast of the field does devour it.">Psalm 80:13</a>. The poet, while complaining that God fumed with anger while Israel prayed, would scarcely speak of themselves as perishing under His rebuke, which, in <a href="/psalms/76-6.htm" title="At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.">Psalm 76:6</a>, is used of His attitude towards foes actually contending against Him.

The climax has been reached, and the matter is too serious for rhetorical treatment. The nation typified by the vine, the Israel of God, is perishing - perishing "at the rebuke of God's countenance" - because his favour is withdrawn from them. Unless God steps in to save, destruction is certain. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/80-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[Your vine] has been cut down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;s&#363;&#183;&#7717;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3683.htm">Strong's 3683: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cut off or away</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and burned;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1467;&#1508;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#601;&#183;ru&#183;p&#772;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8313.htm">Strong's 8313: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be, on fire</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they perish</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1488;&#1489;&#1461;&#1469;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;&#7687;&#234;&#183;&#7695;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6.htm">Strong's 6: </a> </span><span class="str2">To wander away, lose oneself, to perish</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at the rebuke</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1463;&#1430;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(mig&#183;ga&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;ra&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1606.htm">Strong's 1606: </a> </span><span class="str2">A chiding</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Your countenance.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1462;&#1443;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#257;&#183;ne&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6440.htm">Strong's 6440: </a> </span><span class="str2">The face</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/psalms/80-16.htm">OT Poetry: Psalm 80:16 It's burned with fire (Psalm Ps Psa.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/psalms/80-15.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Psalm 80:15"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 80:15" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/psalms/80-17.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Psalm 80:17"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 80:17" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
