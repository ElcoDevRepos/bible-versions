In the context of ancient Israel, thanksgiving was a central aspect of worship, often expressed through offerings and sacrifices (<a href="/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12-15</a>). The act of entering God's presence with thanksgiving reflects a recognition of His sovereignty and provision. Theologically, this aligns with the New Testament teaching in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>, which encourages believers to give thanks in all circumstances. The concept of entering God's presence also recalls the temple worship in Jerusalem, where the Israelites would come to offer thanks and praise. This phrase can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate means by which believers enter into the presence of God (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p><b>let us make a joyful noise to Him in song.</b><br>The call to make a joyful noise highlights the exuberant and expressive nature of worship. In the cultural context of the Psalms, music and singing were integral to worship, as seen in the use of psalms in temple services and religious festivals (<a href="/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>). This joyful noise is not merely about volume but about the heartfelt expression of joy and reverence for God. Theologically, this connects to the New Testament exhortation in <a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>, where believers are encouraged to speak to one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. The phrase also points to the eschatological hope found in <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9-10</a>, where the redeemed sing a new song before the throne of God, celebrating His redemptive work through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/95.htm">Psalm 95</a>, traditionally attributed to David, who calls the people to worship and reverence God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_presence_of_god.htm">The Presence of God</a></b><br>Refers to the spiritual place where believers come to worship and commune with God, emphasizing His omnipresence and holiness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_congregation_of_israel.htm">The Congregation of Israel</a></b><br>The original audience of the Psalm, representing the collective body of God's people called to worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/thanksgiving.htm">Thanksgiving</a></b><br>A central theme in the Psalm, highlighting the attitude of gratitude and acknowledgment of God's blessings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/joyful_noise.htm">Joyful Noise</a></b><br>Represents the expression of worship through music and song, a common practice in Israelite worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_thanksgiving.htm">The Importance of Thanksgiving</a></b><br>Thanksgiving is not just a seasonal practice but a daily attitude that acknowledges God's goodness and provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/joyful_worship.htm">Joyful Worship</a></b><br>Worship should be an expression of joy and gratitude, reflecting the believer's relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/entering_god's_presence.htm">Entering God's Presence</a></b><br>Approaching God with a heart of thanksgiving prepares us to experience His presence more fully.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_worship.htm">Community Worship</a></b><br>The call to make a joyful noise is often a communal activity, emphasizing the importance of corporate worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_discipline.htm">Spiritual Discipline</a></b><br>Regularly practicing thanksgiving and joyful worship can strengthen our faith and deepen our relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_95_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 95:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_daily_thank_Him_in_our_lives.htm">How can we "come into His presence with thanksgiving" daily in our lives?
