Throughout the Old Testament, the Israelites often forgot God's deliverance and provision, leading to disobedience and idolatry. This forgetfulness is a spiritual issue, reflecting a lack of faith and gratitude. In <a href="/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>, Moses warns the Israelites not to forget the Lord who brought them out of Egypt. This forgetfulness can be seen as a type of spiritual amnesia that affects believers today, reminding them of the importance of remembering God's past faithfulness to strengthen their faith.<p><b>the wonders He had shown them</b><br>The wonders refer to the miraculous acts God performed, particularly during the Exodus, such as the plagues in Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, and the provision of manna and water in the desert. These acts were not only displays of God's power but also served as signs of His covenant faithfulness and love for His people. In the broader biblical narrative, these wonders prefigure the ultimate act of deliverance through Jesus Christ, whose miracles and resurrection are the greatest wonders shown to humanity.
