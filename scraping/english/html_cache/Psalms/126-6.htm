In the agrarian society of ancient Israel, sowing was a labor-intensive task, often done in difficult conditions. The weeping may symbolize the struggles and sacrifices made in faith, trusting that God will provide a harvest. This reflects the broader biblical theme of suffering preceding joy, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/16-20.htm">John 16:20</a>, where Jesus speaks of sorrow turning into joy.<p><b>bearing a trail of seed</b><br>The act of sowing seed is a metaphor for investing in faith and obedience to God, despite present difficulties. The "trail of seed" suggests a continuous effort and commitment, even when immediate results are not visible. This imagery is reminiscent of the parable of the sower in <a href="/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13</a>, where the seed represents the word of God and the different types of soil represent the hearts of people. The sower's faithfulness in spreading the seed is crucial, regardless of the initial reception.<p><b>will surely return with shouts of joy</b><br>This promise of joy upon return emphasizes the certainty of God's faithfulness in rewarding those who diligently sow in faith. The transformation from weeping to joy is a common biblical motif, illustrating God's ability to bring about redemption and restoration. This is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>, where the redeemed return with everlasting joy. The assurance of joy reflects the hope and trust in God's providence and timing.<p><b>carrying sheaves of grain</b><br>The sheaves of grain symbolize the abundant harvest that results from faithful sowing. This harvest is not only a physical provision but also a spiritual blessing, representing the fruitfulness of God's work in and through His people. The imagery of carrying sheaves is reminiscent of the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost), a time of celebrating the harvest and God's provision. It also points to the ultimate harvest of souls, as seen in <a href="/revelation/14-15.htm">Revelation 14:15</a>, where the earth's harvest is reaped. This phrase underscores the principle that diligent, faithful labor in God's service will ultimately lead to a bountiful and joyous reward.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sower.htm">The Sower</a></b><br>Represents those who labor and invest in God's work, often with tears and sacrifice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_field.htm">The Field</a></b><br>Symbolizes the world or the mission field where the seeds of God's word and deeds are sown.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seed.htm">The Seed</a></b><br>Represents the Word of God or acts of faith and obedience, sown with hope and expectation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_harvest.htm">The Harvest</a></b><br>The joyful outcome of the sower's labor, symbolizing spiritual or material blessings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_return.htm">The Return</a></b><br>The fulfillment of God's promises, where the sower comes back with joy and abundance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_faith.htm">Perseverance in Faith</a></b><br>Just as the sower goes out weeping, we are called to persevere in our faith and duties, even when it is difficult or painful.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_god's_promises.htm">Hope in God's Promises</a></b><br>The promise of returning with joy encourages us to trust in God's faithfulness and timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_the_seed.htm">The Power of the Seed</a></b><br>Our actions and words, when aligned with God's will, have the potential to produce a bountiful harvest.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/joy_in_the_harvest.htm">Joy in the Harvest</a></b><br>The joy of the harvest is a reminder of the eternal rewards and blessings that come from faithful service.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_support.htm">Community and Support</a></b><br>The imagery of returning with sheaves suggests the importance of sharing our joy and blessings with others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_126_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 126:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_126_6_s_message_on_perseverance.htm">How does Psalm 126:6 encourage perseverance in difficult spiritual seasons?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Symbolism_of_weeping_reaping_in_Psalm_126_6.htm">What does "weeping" and "reaping" symbolize in Psalm 126:6 for believers today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_126_6_Trust_God_in_hardship.htm">How can Psalm 126:6 inspire us to trust God's promises in hardship?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Ps_126_6_Gal_6_9_on_sow_reap.htm">Connect Psalm 126:6 with Galatians 6:9 about sowing and reaping.  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_harvest_joy_daily.htm">How can we apply the joy of "bringing in the sheaves" in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_126_6_Joy_and_sorrow_s_nature.htm">What does Psalm 126:6 reveal about the nature of joy and sorrow in life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_126_6_Spiritual_sowing_reaping.htm">How does Psalm 126:6 illustrate the concept of sowing and reaping in spiritual terms?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Psalm_126_6.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 126:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_126.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 126?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/does_psalm_126_6_overstate_divine_aid.htm">Does Psalm 126:6 overstate divine intervention in harvest success, appearing to conflict with passages that emphasize human effort or natural processes? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_sowing_and_reaping.htm">What does the Bible say about sowing and reaping?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/do_psalm_126_and_nehemiah_4_conflict.htm">Do the joyful descriptions in Psalm 126:2, 5-6 conflict with other biblical accounts (e.g., Nehemiah 4) that depict the return from exile as difficult and fraught with opposition?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_do_nones_impact_bible_interpretation.htm">When is it appropriate to weep or laugh?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 126:6 Mean</div><b>He who goes out</b><p>&#8226; The verse begins with action&#8212;a deliberate departure.

Temporary sorrow, willing investment, and steadfast faith culminate in an abundant harvest that glorifies the Lord and blesses His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/126.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) The original is very expressive, by the idiom of infinitive combined with finite verb.<p>"He shall walk, and walk and weep,<p>Bearing the handful of seed:<p>He shall come, and come with singing,<p>Bearing his sheaves,"<p>where we must certainly see an extension and not a mere repetition of the former figure, for the very form of the expression suggests the long patient labour of the sower, and the reward which patience and perseverance always bring--a harvest in proportion to the toil and trouble of seed-time. The words of the prophet Haggai (<a href="/context/haggai/1-10.htm" title="Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit.">Haggai 1:10-11</a>; <a href="/haggai/2-19.htm" title="Is the seed yet in the barn? yes, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, has not brought forth: from this day will I bless you.">Haggai 2:19</a>), contemporary with the Return, should be compared. The word rendered "precious" in the Authorised Version may be correctly represented by "handful." Its meaning is "drawing;" and from <a href="/amos/9-13.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that sows seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.">Amos 9:13</a> (see margin) we see that the sower was called "the drawer of seed," no doubt from the hand being repeatedly drawn out for the cast from the bag or basket containing the seed. Others render "seed-basket" here. The contrast so beautifully painted in this verse was certainly realised when "the priests and Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of the house of God with joy" (<a href="/ezra/6-16.htm" title="And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy.">Ezra 6:16</a>; comp. <a href="/ezra/6-22.htm" title="And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.">Ezra 6:22</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-42.htm" title="And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer.
