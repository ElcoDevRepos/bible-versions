The term "destitute" refers to individuals who are impoverished or in a state of great need, often marginalized in society. Biblically, God&#8217;s concern for the poor and needy is a recurring theme (<a href="/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>, <a href="/isaiah/41-17.htm">Isaiah 41:17</a>). The act of turning toward implies a deliberate action by God, indicating His willingness to listen and respond. This reflects the character of God as compassionate and merciful, aligning with His nature as described in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who in the New Testament is depicted as one who ministers to the poor and brokenhearted (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>). Historically, the psalmist may have been writing during a time of national distress, possibly during the Babylonian exile, when the people of Israel felt abandoned and destitute. This phrase reassures them of God's continued presence and willingness to hear their cries.<p><b>He will not despise their prayer.</b><br>The assurance that God will not despise the prayer of the destitute highlights His acceptance and value of sincere supplication, regardless of the social or economic status of the petitioner. In biblical context, despising prayer would imply a rejection or disregard, which is contrary to God&#8217;s nature as depicted throughout Scripture. This is consistent with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the importance of humility in prayer (<a href="/luke/18-9.htm">Luke 18:9-14</a>). The cultural context of ancient Israel placed significant value on social status, yet this phrase underscores that God&#8217;s kingdom operates on different principles, where the humble and contrite are honored (<a href="/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a>). This also connects to the prophetic vision of a future where God&#8217;s justice and mercy are fully realized, as seen in the eschatological promises of <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>, where God wipes away every tear. The phrase reassures believers of all times that God is near to those who call on Him in truth (<a href="/psalms/145-18.htm">Psalm 145:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/102.htm">Psalm 102</a>, traditionally believed to be David or another figure experiencing deep distress, who cries out to God for help and deliverance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_destitute.htm">The Destitute</a></b><br>Refers to those who are in a state of extreme poverty or need, both materially and spiritually, who seek God's intervention.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure who hears and responds to the prayers of the destitute, demonstrating His compassion and faithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>While not mentioned directly in this verse, the broader context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/102.htm">Psalm 102</a> includes a focus on Zion, symbolizing God's presence and the hope of restoration for His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_prayer.htm">The Event of Prayer</a></b><br>The act of the destitute reaching out to God in their time of need, highlighting the importance of prayer as a means of communication with the divine.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_compassionate_nature.htm">God's Compassionate Nature</a></b><br>God is attentive to the prayers of those in need.
