The plague of hail was the seventh plague and was a direct judgment against the Egyptian gods, particularly those associated with agriculture and weather. The destruction of the vines signifies a severe blow to the Egyptian economy and sustenance, as vineyards were a significant source of wealth and daily sustenance. In a broader biblical context, this act demonstrates God's sovereignty over nature and His ability to use it to fulfill His purposes. The use of hailstones as a divine instrument of judgment is also seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>, where God aids Israel in battle. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who has authority over creation and will execute judgment upon the earth (<a href="/revelation/16-21.htm">Revelation 16:21</a>).<p><b>and their sycamore-figs with sleet.</b><br>The sycamore-fig tree, known for its fruit and wood, was another important resource in ancient Egypt. The destruction of these trees by sleet further emphasizes the comprehensive nature of God's judgment. Sycamore-figs were a staple in the Egyptian diet, and their loss would have had a significant impact on food supply. This phrase highlights the precision of God's judgment, targeting specific elements of Egyptian life to demonstrate His power and to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites. The mention of sleet, a rare weather phenomenon in Egypt, underscores the miraculous nature of the plagues. This event can be connected to the broader theme of God's provision and protection for His people, as He disrupts the natural order to deliver them, foreshadowing the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who provides spiritual sustenance and salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, demonstrating His power and judgment over nature and nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where these events took place, representing a nation under God's judgment during the plagues.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/vines_and_sycamore-figs.htm">Vines and Sycamore-Figs</a></b><br>Agricultural products of Egypt, symbolizing the prosperity and sustenance of the nation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hail_and_sleet.htm">Hail and Sleet</a></b><br>Natural elements used by God as instruments of His judgment against Egypt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/plagues_of_egypt.htm">Plagues of Egypt</a></b><br>A series of divine judgments, of which the destruction of crops by hail was a part.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nature.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nature</a></b><br>God controls all elements of nature and can use them to fulfill His purposes.

Here, again, there is an inversion of the order in which the plagues came, since the plague of hail preceded that of the locusts. There is also an addition to the narrative of Exodus in the mention of "vines" (see also <a href="/psalms/105-33.htm">Psalm 105:33</a>), which may indicate a use of tradition.
