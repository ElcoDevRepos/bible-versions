In the biblical context, David often faced threats from enemies, including King Saul and his own son Absalom. The longing to flee is a common human response to fear and persecution, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_samuel/19-10.htm">1 Samuel 19:10</a>, where David fled from Saul. This desire for distance from trouble can also be seen as a metaphor for seeking refuge in God, as expressed in <a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>, where God is described as a "refuge and strength." The notion of fleeing can also be connected to the spiritual journey of seeking peace and safety in God's presence, away from the chaos of the world.<p><b>In the wilderness I would remain.</b><br>The wilderness in biblical times was often a place of solitude, testing, and encounter with God. It was where the Israelites wandered for 40 years, learning dependence on God (<a href="/exodus/16-35.htm">Exodus 16:35</a>). For David, the wilderness was a place of refuge during his flight from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>). It symbolizes a place of both physical and spiritual retreat, where one can find solace and renewal away from the pressures of life. The wilderness experience is also a type of Christ's own time in the wilderness, where He was tempted and prepared for His ministry (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>). This phrase suggests a longing for a place of safety and divine encounter, away from the turmoil of enemies and betrayal.<p><b>Selah</b><br>The term "Selah" is often found in the Psalms and is thought to be a musical or liturgical pause, inviting the reader or listener to reflect on the preceding words. It emphasizes the importance of meditation on the desire for escape and the significance of the wilderness as a place of refuge. This pause allows for contemplation of God's protection and the peace found in His presence, encouraging believers to trust in God's provision and timing. The use of "Selah" here invites a deeper consideration of the themes of distress, longing for deliverance, and the assurance of God's faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/55.htm">Psalm 55</a>, David is expressing his deep desire to escape his troubles and find peace.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>Represents a place of solitude and refuge, often seen in the Bible as a place where individuals encounter God or find respite from their troubles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/selah.htm">Selah</a></b><br>A term used in the Psalms, possibly indicating a pause for reflection or musical interlude, inviting the reader to contemplate the preceding words.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/desire_for_escape.htm">Desire for Escape</a></b><br>We often long to escape our troubles, but true peace is found in God&#8217;s presence, not in physical relocation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness_as_a_place_of_encounter.htm">Wilderness as a Place of Encounter</a></b><br>The wilderness can be a metaphor for times of trial where we can encounter God more deeply and rely on His strength.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflection_and_pause.htm">Reflection and Pause (Selah)</a></b><br>Taking time to pause and reflect on God&#8217;s Word can provide clarity and peace amidst chaos.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God&#8217;s Sovereignty</a></b><br>Even when we desire to flee, trusting in God&#8217;s plan and sovereignty can bring comfort and direction.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_as_a_refuge.htm">Prayer as a Refuge</a></b><br>Like David, we can turn to prayer as a means of seeking refuge and expressing our deepest desires and fears to God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_55_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 55:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_55_7_Finding_peace_in_turmoil.htm">How can Psalm 55:7 inspire us to seek God's peace amid turmoil?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_far_away_show_about_David.htm">What does "far away" in Psalm 55:7 reveal about David's emotional state?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_55_7_Jesus_solitude_link.htm">How does Psalm 55:7 connect with Jesus seeking solitude in the Gospels?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_use_Psalm_55_7_in_trials_today.htm">In what ways can we apply Psalm 55:7 during personal trials today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Escape_longing_vs_trust_in_God.htm">How does longing for escape in Psalm 55:7 relate to trusting God's plan?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_55_7_on_escaping_life_s_trials.htm">What does Psalm 55:7 reveal about the desire to escape life's challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_55_7_s_yearning_for_peace.htm">How does Psalm 55:7 reflect human longing for peace and solitude?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Psalm_55_7.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 55:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_55.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 55?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/bible's_advice_on_handling_angst.htm">What does the Bible say about dealing with angst?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_do_the_faithful_still_suffer.htm">Psalm 20:1 - If this verse promises divine help in trouble, why do so many faithful people still suffer without apparent intervention?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_trust_ps_61_3-4's_'refuge'_without_proof.htm">What evidence supports the psalmist's confidence (Ps 61:3-4) in a physical 'refuge' or 'tower' when no solid archaeological proof exists?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_manifest_presence_of_god.htm">What is the Manifest Presence of God?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 55:7 Mean</div><b>How far away I would flee!</b><p>&#8211; David&#8217;s words are literal: faced with betrayal (vv. 12-15) and the crush of enemies (vv. 9, 23), he truly wants distance.<p>&#8211; The phrase continues his cry from v. 6, &#8220;Oh, that I had wings like a dove!
