It highlights the self-deception and arrogance of those who believe they can act without consequence. This introspective moment reveals the heart's condition, often seen in biblical narratives where individuals convince themselves of falsehoods to justify their actions (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>).<p><b>&#8220;God has forgotten;</b><br>The assertion that God has forgotten suggests a belief in divine neglect or indifference. This reflects a misunderstanding of God's nature, as Scripture consistently portrays God as omniscient and ever-present (<a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>). The wicked's belief that God has forgotten is a common theme in the Psalms, where the righteous often cry out for God's remembrance and intervention (<a href="/psalms/13.htm">Psalm 13:1</a>).<p><b>He hides His face</b><br>The idea of God hiding His face is a metaphor for divine displeasure or judgment. In the Old Testament, God's face shining upon someone is a sign of favor (<a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>), while hiding His face indicates a withdrawal of blessing or presence (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17-18</a>). This phrase underscores the wicked's belief that God is intentionally ignoring their actions, allowing them to continue unchecked.<p><b>and never sees.&#8221;</b><br>The claim that God never sees is a denial of His omnipresence and omniscience. This reflects a common misconception among the wicked, who assume that their deeds are hidden from divine scrutiny. However, Scripture affirms that nothing is hidden from God's sight (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). This belief in divine ignorance is a form of self-deception that ultimately leads to judgment, as God is fully aware of all actions and will hold individuals accountable (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked_person.htm">The Wicked Person</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse is a wicked individual who arrogantly believes that God is not observing his actions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The omniscient and omnipresent deity who, contrary to the wicked person's belief, sees and knows all.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oppressed.htm">The Oppressed</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/10.htm">Psalm 10</a> involves the oppression of the innocent and the poor by the wicked.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience.htm">God's Omniscience</a></b><br>Despite the wicked's belief, God is fully aware of all actions and thoughts.
