The term "swept" indicates a sudden and complete action, emphasizing God's power and judgment against Pharaoh and his forces. Historically, the Red Sea is a significant geographical location, and its crossing is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, symbolizing liberation and divine intervention. The destruction of Pharaoh's army serves as a demonstration of God's sovereignty and justice, fulfilling His promise to protect His chosen people. This event is often seen as a type of baptism, representing the transition from slavery to freedom, and prefigures the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ.<p><b>His loving devotion endures forever.</b><br>This refrain, repeated throughout <a href="/psalms/136.htm">Psalm 136</a>, highlights the central theme of God's enduring love and faithfulness. The Hebrew word for "loving devotion" is "chesed," which encompasses mercy, kindness, and covenant loyalty. This phrase reassures believers of God's unchanging nature and His commitment to His promises. The enduring nature of God's love is a foundational truth in Scripture, echoed in passages like <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a> and <a href="/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38-39</a>. It underscores the idea that God's actions, including the deliverance at the Red Sea, are motivated by His steadfast love for His people. This eternal devotion is ultimately fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus Christ, who embodies God's love and offers salvation to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who enslaved the Israelites and refused to let them go, leading to the plagues and the eventual Exodus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea.htm">The Red Sea</a></b><br>The body of water that God miraculously parted to allow the Israelites to escape from the Egyptian army.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exodus.htm">The Exodus</a></b><br>The event where God delivered the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, a foundational moment in Israel's history.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptian_army.htm">The Egyptian Army</a></b><br>The military force that pursued the Israelites, ultimately being destroyed in the Red Sea.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_loving_devotion.htm">God's Loving Devotion</a></b><br>The central theme of <a href="/bsb/psalms/136.htm">Psalm 136</a>, highlighting God's enduring love and faithfulness to His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_deliverance.htm">God's Sovereignty in Deliverance</a></b><br>God is in control of all events, and His power is unmatched.

Verses 13&#8211;14 celebrated how the Lord &#8220;divided the Red Sea in two&#8230; and led Israel through the midst of it&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/136-13.htm">Psalm 136:13-14</a>). Now the spotlight shifts to what He did to Israel&#8217;s enemies. By adding &#8220;swept,&#8221; Scripture reveals the sudden reversal: the same waters that opened for God&#8217;s people closed over their pursuers. <a href="/exodus/14-27.htm">Exodus 14:27</a> describes the moment&#8212;&#8220;the sea returned to its normal depth&#8230; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians.&#8221; That historical scene teaches:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s acts of salvation and judgment often occur in the same event (<a href="/isaiah/30-18.htm">Isaiah 30:18</a>; <a href="/romans/11-22.htm">Romans 11:22</a>).<p>&#8226; His deliverance is not partial; He finishes what He starts (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pharaoh and his army</b><p>Pharaoh, the most powerful ruler of the ancient world (<a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>), arrived at the Red Sea with &#8220;all the horses, chariots, and horsemen&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/14-23.htm">Exodus 14:23</a>). Humanly speaking, Israel had no chance. Yet <a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a> reminds us, &#8220;A king is not saved by his large army.&#8221; The Lord personally confronted Pharaoh&#8217;s pride (<a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>) and revealed that earthly strength cannot stand against divine purpose (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-6.htm">2 Chronicles 20:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Into the Red Sea</b><p>God turned the Red Sea into both highway and graveyard.

That love motivated the rescue (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-8.htm">Deuteronomy 7:8</a>), upheld Israel through the wilderness (<a href="/psalms/136-16.htm">Psalm 136:16</a>), and culminated in Christ&#8217;s sacrifice &#8220;while we were still sinners&#8221; (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>). Because His love endures:<p>&#8226; No failure can exhaust it (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; No enemy can defeat it (<a href="/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38-39</a>).<p>&#8226; No era will outlast it (<a href="/psalms/100-5.htm">Psalm 100:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Living response</b><p>The verse invites practical faith:<p>&#8226; Trust God to overturn impossible odds, just as He toppled Pharaoh (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Worship with gratitude, echoing Israel&#8217;s song on the far shore (<a href="/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Walk forward in obedience, leaving the old life behind the &#8220;waters&#8221; God has closed (<a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/136-15.htm">Psalm 136:15</a> affirms that the Lord literally swept Pharaoh and his army into the Red Sea, completing Israel&#8217;s deliverance and displaying both judgment and mercy.
