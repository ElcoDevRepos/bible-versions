In the context of <a href="/psalms/107.htm">Psalm 107</a>, it refers to the experiences of those who travel by sea, witnessing God's power over creation. The "works of the LORD" can be understood as His acts of creation and providence, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God creates the heavens and the earth. The sea, often representing chaos and danger in ancient Near Eastern cultures, is under God's control, demonstrating His sovereignty. This phrase also connects to the miracles of Jesus, such as calming the storm in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>, where His authority over nature is revealed, echoing the divine power acknowledged in this psalm.<p><b>and His wonders in the deep</b><br>The "wonders in the deep" refers to the miraculous and awe-inspiring events that occur in the vast and mysterious ocean. In biblical times, the sea was a place of uncertainty and fear, yet it was also a testament to God's creative power and majesty. The deep is often associated with the unknown and the uncontrollable, yet it is within this realm that God's wonders are displayed. This can be linked to the story of Jonah, where God's intervention in the deep sea leads to Jonah's deliverance. Additionally, the deep can symbolize the depths of human experience and the trials faced, where God's presence and intervention bring about deliverance and awe, as seen in the Red Sea crossing in <a href="/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>. The wonders in the deep serve as a reminder of God's omnipotence and His ability to bring order and salvation out of chaos.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and faithfulness to His promises.
