The "glory" of God's kingdom refers to its majesty, splendor, and divine nature. In biblical context, God's kingdom is both a present reality and a future hope. The kingdom of God is often associated with the reign of God over all creation, as seen in passages like <a href="/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>, where the Son of Man is given dominion and glory. The glory of God's kingdom is also reflected in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of the kingdom of heaven in parables (Matthew 13) and teaches His disciples to pray for its coming (<a href="/matthew/6-10.htm">Matthew 6:10</a>). The proclamation of God's kingdom is a call to recognize His sovereignty and to live in accordance with His will.<p><b>and speak of Your might</b><br>The "might" of God refers to His power and strength, which are evident throughout the biblical narrative. God's might is demonstrated in creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where He speaks the universe into existence. It is also displayed in His deliverance of Israel from Egypt, as recounted in Exodus, where His power is shown through the plagues and the parting of the Red Sea. In the Psalms, God's might is often celebrated as a source of protection and refuge for His people (<a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>). The New Testament continues this theme, with Jesus performing miracles that reveal His divine power, such as calming the storm (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>) and raising the dead (<a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43-44</a>). The might of God is a testament to His ability to accomplish His purposes and to uphold His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/145.htm">Psalm 145</a>, King David, is expressing his praise and adoration for God's eternal kingdom and mighty acts.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_kingdom.htm">God's Kingdom</a></b><br>The central theme of this verse, representing God's sovereign rule and the manifestation of His power and glory.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation often seen as the primary audience of the Psalms, called to declare God's glory and might to the world.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/proclaiming_god's_kingdom.htm">Proclaiming God's Kingdom</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to actively declare the glory and might of God's kingdom in our daily lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_sovereignty.htm">Understanding God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognizing God's sovereign rule helps us trust in His plans and purposes, even when circumstances are challenging.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_as_kingdom_ambassadors.htm">Living as Kingdom Ambassadors</a></b><br>Our lives should reflect the values and principles of God's kingdom, serving as a testimony to others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouraging_others_in_faith.htm">Encouraging Others in Faith</a></b><br>Sharing accounts of God's might and glory can strengthen the faith of fellow believers and draw others to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Focusing on God's eternal kingdom helps us prioritize spiritual matters over temporary worldly concerns.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_145_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 145:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_share_God_s_kingdom_s_glory_daily.htm">How can we "speak of the glory" of God's kingdom in daily life?
