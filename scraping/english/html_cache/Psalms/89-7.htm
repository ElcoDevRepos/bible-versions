The concept of a divine council is seen in other biblical passages such as <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a> and <a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>, where God is depicted as presiding over a heavenly assembly. This setting emphasizes God's sovereignty and authority over all spiritual beings. The "holy ones" are typically understood to be angels, who are set apart for God's service and are part of His divine order.<p><b>God is greatly feared</b><br>The fear of God in this context is not about terror but reverence and awe. It reflects the recognition of God's supreme power, holiness, and majesty. This reverence is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, which states that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. The fear of God among the heavenly beings underscores His unmatched authority and the respect He commands even among those who are closest to Him.<p><b>and awesome above all who surround Him</b><br>This phrase highlights God's unparalleled greatness and majesty. The term "awesome" conveys a sense of wonder and respect, acknowledging God's supreme nature. The beings that surround Him, likely the angels or other spiritual entities, are themselves powerful and holy, yet God is exalted above them all. This echoes passages like <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1-3</a>, where the seraphim proclaim God's holiness and glory. It also points to the uniqueness of God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-39.htm">Deuteronomy 4:39</a>, affirming that there is no other like Him in heaven or on earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, depicted as being greatly feared and awesome, emphasizing His supreme authority and holiness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/council_of_the_holy_ones.htm">Council of the Holy Ones</a></b><br>This refers to the heavenly assembly or divine council, which includes angels or other celestial beings who serve and worship God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_ones.htm">Holy Ones</a></b><br>These are the beings that surround God, often understood as angels or spiritual beings who are in God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god.htm">Reverence for God</a></b><br>Recognize the importance of fearing God, not in terror, but in awe and respect for His holiness and authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_holiness.htm">Understanding God's Holiness</a></b><br>Reflect on the holiness of God and how it should influence our worship and daily lives, striving to live in a way that honors His holy nature.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_angels.htm">The Role of Angels</a></b><br>Acknowledge the role of angels and spiritual beings in God's divine plan, serving as examples of obedience and worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Trust in God's supreme power and authority, knowing that He is above all and in control of all circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_of_believers.htm">Community of Believers</a></b><br>Draw parallels between the heavenly council and the community of believers, encouraging mutual reverence and worship of God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_89_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 89:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_89_7_God_s_holiness_in_worship.htm">How does Psalm 89:7 emphasize God's holiness and reverence in worship?
