It suggests divine authority and a formal statement. In the context of <a href="/psalms/82.htm">Psalm 82</a>, God is addressing the judges or leaders of Israel, who are expected to uphold justice and righteousness. This introduction sets the tone for a divine evaluation of their roles and responsibilities.<p><b>&#8216;You are gods;</b><br>The term "gods" here is translated from the Hebrew word "Elohim," which can refer to divine beings, judges, or rulers. In this context, it is understood to mean human judges or leaders who have been given authority by God to execute justice on earth. This phrase highlights the responsibility and accountability of those in positions of power, as they are representatives of God's justice. The use of "gods" underscores the gravity of their role and the expectation that they act with divine wisdom and fairness.<p><b>you are all sons of the Most High.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the special status and relationship these leaders have with God. Being called "sons of the Most High" implies a position of honor and privilege, as well as a call to reflect God's character in their leadership. The term "Most High" is a title for God that denotes His supreme authority and sovereignty. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of sonship, where believers are called to be children of God, reflecting His nature and purposes. In the New Testament, this concept is expanded through the teachings of Jesus, who is the ultimate Son of God, and through whom believers are adopted into God's family.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Elohim)</a></b><br>The supreme being who is addressing the "gods" in this Psalm, emphasizing His authority and the divine order.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gods--elohim.htm">Gods - Elohim</a></b><br>Refers to human judges or leaders who have been given authority and responsibility to execute justice on earth.
