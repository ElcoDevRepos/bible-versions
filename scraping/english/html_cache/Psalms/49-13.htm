In the wisdom literature, such as Proverbs, the fool is contrasted with the wise, who fear the Lord. The fate of the foolish is often depicted as destruction or ruin, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/1-32.htm">Proverbs 1:32</a>, where the complacency of fools will destroy them. This phrase underscores the inevitable outcome for those who reject divine wisdom.<p><b>and their followers</b><br>Followers of the foolish are those who align themselves with the values and beliefs of the foolish, often leading to shared consequences. In biblical history, we see examples such as Korah's rebellion (Numbers 16), where those who followed the foolish leader faced the same judgment. This highlights the importance of discerning whom one chooses to follow, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>, which warns that bad company corrupts good character.<p><b>who endorse their sayings</b><br>Endorsing the sayings of the foolish implies agreement and propagation of their misguided beliefs. This can be seen in the context of false prophets and teachers, as warned against in <a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1-3</a>. The endorsement of falsehood leads to spiritual deception and ultimately judgment. The New Testament frequently warns against being led astray by false teachings, emphasizing the need for sound doctrine (<a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3-4</a>).<p><b>Selah</b><br>The term "Selah" is often found in the Psalms and is thought to be a musical or liturgical pause, inviting the reader or listener to reflect on the preceding words. It serves as a moment to consider the gravity of the message, encouraging deeper contemplation of the fate of the foolish and the importance of aligning oneself with God's wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_self-confident.htm">The Self-Confident</a></b><br>This refers to individuals who place their trust in their own wealth, wisdom, or power rather than in God. In the context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/49.htm">Psalm 49</a>, these are people who rely on material possessions and human achievements.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/followers.htm">Followers</a></b><br>These are individuals who admire and emulate the self-confident, often endorsing their philosophies and lifestyle choices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/selah.htm">Selah</a></b><br>A term used frequently in the Psalms, possibly indicating a pause for reflection or musical interlude.

Verse 13 brings the argument to a sobering climax&#8212;&#8220;This is the fate&#8230;&#8221; The word signals a settled, unavoidable outcome.<p>&#8226; Earlier in the psalm, verse 10 reminds us that &#8220;the wise die; the fool and the senseless alike perish and leave their wealth to others&#8221;. No amount of money, fame, or human acclaim can alter the destiny God assigns (<a href="/job/27-8.htm">Job 27:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus echoes the same certainty: the rich man who built bigger barns heard the final verdict, &#8220;You fool! This very night your life will be required of you&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-20.htm">Luke 12:20</a>).<p>God is not guessing about the future; He declares it. What follows is the unchanging end for a specific kind of person.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the foolish</b><p>In Scripture a &#8220;fool&#8221; is never merely uninformed; he is morally bankrupt, living as though God does not matter (<a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Characteristics of folly:<p>&#8211; Rejects divine wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/12-15.htm">Proverbs 12:15</a>)<p>&#8211; Boasts in self (<a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23</a>)<p>&#8211; Lives for the moment (<a href="/matthew/7-26.htm">Matthew 7:26</a>)<p>&#8226; The psalmist has already described the fool&#8217;s confidence: &#8220;They trust in their wealth and boast of great riches&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/49-6.htm">Psalm 49:6</a>). Such misplaced security ends in ruin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and their followers</b><p>Folly is contagious. People gravitate toward voices that promise ease without submission to God (<a href="/2_timothy/3-13.htm">2 Timothy 3:13</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-2.htm">2 Peter 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture warns repeatedly:<p>&#8211; &#8220;Do not walk in the counsel of the wicked&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8220;Bad company corrupts good character&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8220;He who walks with the wise will be wise, but the companion of fools will be destroyed&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>).<p>Those who trail after the fool inherit the same destiny. Association becomes agreement, and agreement produces accountability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who endorse their sayings</b><p>To &#8220;endorse&#8221; is more than silent approval; it is active affirmation of the fool&#8217;s worldview. <a href="/romans/1-32.htm">Romans 1:32</a> points to this very pattern: not only practicing sin but &#8220;approving of those who practice it.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Endorsement takes many forms:<p>&#8211; Sharing ungodly counsel (<a href="/proverbs/17-4.htm">Proverbs 17:4</a>)<p>&#8211; Funding or promoting evil (<a href="/micah/6-11.htm">Micah 6:11</a>)<p>&#8211; Mocking righteousness (<a href="/bsb/jude/1.htm">Jude 18</a>)<p>&#8226; 2 <a href="/bsb/john/11.htm">John 11</a> warns, &#8220;Whoever greets him shares in his wicked works.&#8221; Agreement with falsehood aligns the endorser with its judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Selah</b><p>The inspired pause invites the reader to reflect and respond. In other psalms Selah appears where a truth demands meditation (<a href="/psalms/3-4.htm">Psalm 3:4</a>; 46:7). Here it urges us to stop, weigh the end of earthly pride, and choose wisdom over folly. Reflection is not optional; it is the doorway to repentance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/49-13.htm">Psalm 49:13</a> compresses an entire theology of destiny into a single line. God has decreed a fixed end for:<p>&#8226; the fool who ignores Him,<p>&#8226; the crowd that follows the fool, and<p>&#8226; everyone who champions the fool&#8217;s words.<p>Earthly assets and acclaim cannot alter that decree. The only safe path is humble trust in the LORD, the Redeemer &#8220;who will redeem my soul from Sheol&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/49-15.htm">Psalm 49:15</a>).
