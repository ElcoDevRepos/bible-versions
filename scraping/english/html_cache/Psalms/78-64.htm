Historically, this can be connected to the events described in <a href="/1_samuel/4.htm">1 Samuel 4</a>, where the Israelites were defeated by the Philistines, and the Ark of the Covenant was captured. The priests Hophni and Phinehas, sons of Eli, died in this battle. This event signifies a moment of judgment upon the house of Eli, as prophesied in <a href="/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31-34</a>. The fall of the priests symbolizes a spiritual decline and the consequences of disobedience to God&#8217;s commands. It also foreshadows the ultimate priestly sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who, unlike these priests, was sinless and offered Himself willingly for the redemption of humanity.<p><b>but their widows could not lament</b><br>In ancient Israel, mourning and lamentation were significant cultural practices, often involving public displays of grief. The inability of the widows to lament suggests a situation of overwhelming defeat and despair, where the normal customs of mourning could not be observed, possibly due to the chaos and fear following the battle. This could also imply a divine judgment where the usual expressions of grief were suppressed, highlighting the severity of the situation. Theologically, it underscores the theme of divine justice and the consequences of turning away from God. This phrase can be contrasted with the hope found in Christ, who provides comfort and restoration, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/5-4.htm">Matthew 5:4</a>, "Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The religious leaders of Israel who were responsible for performing sacrifices and maintaining the spiritual welfare of the people.

Verses 56-64 describe Israel&#8217;s rebellion despite God&#8217;s faithfulness, leading to decisive judgment. The line &#8220;His priests fell by the sword, but their widows could not lament&#8221; sits at the climax of that judgment, immediately after &#8220;He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh&#8221; (v. 60). The psalmist recalls the disaster recorded in <a href="/1_samuel/4-10.htm">1 Samuel 4:10-11</a>, where the Philistines killed Hophni and Phinehas, seized the ark, and shattered national confidence&#8212;an event so dreadful that even basic mourning rituals were cut short (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;His priests fell by the sword&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The priests represented the nation before God; when they died, it signaled a collapse of spiritual leadership (<a href="/1_samuel/2-34.htm">1 Samuel 2:34</a>).<p>&#8226; Their deaths were not random; they fulfilled earlier warnings that disobedience brings judgment (<a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-47.htm">Deuteronomy 28:47-48</a>).<p>&#8226; By mentioning &#8220;His&#8221; priests, the psalm stresses divine ownership: these men belonged to God, so their fall exposed Israel&#8217;s breach of covenant more than military weakness (<a href="/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;But their widows could not lament&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Ancient mourning involved public wailing, sackcloth, and extended gatherings (<a href="/2_samuel/1-17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17-20</a>; <a href="/amos/5-16.htm">Amos 5:16</a>). Here, that normal process is suppressed.<p>&#8226; Reasons the widows could not lament:<p>&#8211; Shock and panic as the ark was captured (<a href="/1_samuel/4-21.htm">1 Samuel 4:21-22</a>).<p>&#8211; Ongoing threat from the enemy likely restricted assemblies for funerals (<a href="/lamentations/1-4.htm">Lamentations 1:4</a>).<p>&#8211; The nation&#8217;s sin produced such disgrace that formal lament seemed futile&#8212;God Himself had turned away (<a href="/micah/3-4.htm">Micah 3:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The silenced lament underscores how sin steals even the small mercies of closure and comfort (<a href="/isaiah/57-21.htm">Isaiah 57:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Implications for God&#8217;s People</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness includes holy discipline; ignoring His word endangers even sacred offices and institutions (<a href="/psalms/89-30.htm">Psalm 89:30-32</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritual leaders bear heightened accountability; their fall can devastate the flock (<a href="/ezekiel/34-7.htm">Ezekiel 34:7-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Corporate sin invites losses that ripple outward&#8212;widows, families, entire communities feel the price (<a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1, 5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Living Application</b><p>&#8226; Guard against complacency: repeated warnings, if unheeded, harden hearts (<a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Value godly leadership: pray for and support those who serve, recognizing how their health affects the body (<a href="/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Mourn rightly for sin: allow sorrow to lead to repentance before tragedy makes lament impossible (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/78-64.htm">Psalm 78:64</a> captures a moment when divine judgment fell so hard that even the priests died and their widows were stunned into silence. The verse testifies that God keeps His word&#8212;both promises and warnings. Neglecting Him can strip away leaders, security, and even the healing gift of grief. Remembering this sober history urges us to walk in obedience, uphold faithful leadership, and turn back to the Lord while mercy is still extended.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/78.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(64) <span class= "bld">And their widows . . .</span>--Undoubtedly referring to the fact that the wife of Phinehas died in premature labour, and so could not attend the funeral of her husband with the customary lamentations, which in Oriental countries are so loud and marked.
