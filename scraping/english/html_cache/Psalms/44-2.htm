The "hand" of God is often used metaphorically in Scripture to denote His power and authority (<a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>). The driving out of nations refers to the conquest of Canaan, where God enabled the Israelites to defeat the inhabitants of the land (<a href="/joshua/3-10.htm">Joshua 3:10</a>). This act fulfilled the promise made to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). Theologically, it underscores God's sovereignty and His role as a divine warrior on behalf of His people.<p><b>and planted our fathers there;</b><br>The imagery of planting suggests stability and growth, indicating that God not only removed the previous inhabitants but also established the Israelites in the land. This reflects the covenantal promise of a homeland for the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-8.htm">Deuteronomy 1:8</a>). The use of "fathers" connects the current generation to their ancestors, emphasizing continuity and the fulfillment of God's promises. This act of planting can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the true vine, and believers are the branches (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1-5</a>), symbolizing spiritual establishment and growth.<p><b>You crushed the peoples</b><br>The term "crushed" conveys a decisive and overwhelming victory, often associated with divine judgment. This reflects the historical accounts of battles where God intervened on behalf of Israel, such as the defeat of the Amorites (<a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10-11</a>). It also serves as a reminder of God's justice and His ability to humble nations. This concept is echoed in the prophetic literature, where God is depicted as the one who will ultimately judge and crush the rebellious nations (<a href="/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>).<p><b>and cast them out.</b><br>Casting out the peoples signifies the complete removal and dispossession of the original inhabitants of Canaan. This was necessary for the Israelites to take possession of the land promised to them. It also serves as a warning against idolatry and disobedience, as Israel was later warned that they too could be cast out if they turned away from God (<a href="/leviticus/18-28.htm">Leviticus 18:28</a>). This phrase can be seen as a foreshadowing of the final judgment, where those who reject God will be cast out from His presence (<a href="/matthew/25-30.htm">Matthew 25:30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the various groups and tribes that occupied the Promised Land before the Israelites.
