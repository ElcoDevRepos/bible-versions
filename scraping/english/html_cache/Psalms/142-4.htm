The psalmist's plea to "look to my right" suggests a search for an ally or defender, someone who would stand by him in times of trouble. Biblically, the right hand is often associated with strength and support, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/16-8.htm">Psalm 16:8</a> and <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>. The absence of anyone on the psalmist's right highlights his isolation and vulnerability, a theme echoed in the life of Jesus, who was often abandoned by His closest followers in His time of need (<a href="/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a>).<p><b>no one attends to me.</b><br>This phrase underscores the psalmist's sense of abandonment and neglect. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, community and kinship were vital for survival and support. The lack of attention from others would have been a profound source of distress. This feeling of being forsaken is mirrored in the experiences of many biblical figures, such as Job (<a href="/job/19-14.htm">Job 19:14</a>) and even Jesus, who cried out on the cross, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (<a href="/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>). It reflects the human condition of loneliness and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>There is no refuge for me;</b><br>The concept of refuge is significant throughout the Psalms, often symbolizing God's protection and safety (<a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>). The psalmist's lament that there is "no refuge" indicates a lack of physical and spiritual sanctuary. In biblical times, cities of refuge provided safety for those in danger (<a href="/numbers/35-11.htm">Numbers 35:11-15</a>), but here, the psalmist finds no such place. This absence of refuge points to a deeper spiritual truth that ultimate safety and rest are found in God alone, a theme fulfilled in Christ, who offers Himself as a refuge for sinners (<a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>).<p><b>no one cares for my soul.</b><br>The soul, or "nephesh" in Hebrew, represents the entirety of a person's being. The psalmist's statement that no one cares for his soul highlights a profound sense of neglect and spiritual desolation. In the biblical narrative, God is portrayed as the ultimate caretaker of the soul, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23-3.htm">Psalm 23:3</a>, where He restores the soul. This phrase also foreshadows the ministry of Jesus, who came to seek and save the lost (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>) and who cares deeply for the souls of humanity, offering rest and salvation (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this psalm, traditionally believed to be King David, who often found himself in dire situations, seeking refuge and expressing his reliance on God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cave_of_adullam.htm">Cave of Adullam</a></b><br>While not explicitly mentioned in this verse, the context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/142.htm">Psalm 142</a> is often associated with David's time hiding in the cave of Adullam, a place of refuge during his flight from Saul.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>Though not named in this verse, David's enemies, including King Saul, are the implicit threat that drives him to seek refuge and express his feelings of abandonment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_isolation.htm">The Reality of Isolation</a></b><br>Even the most faithful believers can experience times of profound loneliness and abandonment.

Scripture validates those emotions while also pointing beyond them. The right hand will not stay empty; attention, refuge, and soul&#8208;deep care are secured in the Lord Himself. When circumstances echo David&#8217;s words, believers can voice the same lament&#8212;then cling to the greater biblical chorus that God is near, attentive, and unfailingly protective.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/142.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">I looked.</span>--The Authorised Version follows the ancient versions in turning the Hebrew imperatives into historic tenses.
