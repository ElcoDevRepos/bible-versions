It suggests an organized form of worship in ancient Israel, where music played a significant role in temple services.<p><b>To the tune of &#8220;The Lily of the Covenant.&#8221;</b><br>This likely refers to a well-known melody or musical setting of the time. The use of specific tunes for psalms indicates a rich tradition of music in Hebrew worship, where certain melodies were associated with particular themes or occasions.<p><b>A Miktam of David for instruction.</b><br>The term "Miktam" is often interpreted as a type of psalm or musical term, possibly indicating a golden or precious song. The phrase "for instruction" suggests that this psalm was meant to teach or impart wisdom, reflecting the didactic nature of many of David's writings.<p><b>When he fought Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah, and Joab returned and struck down 12,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.</b><br>This historical context places the psalm during a time of military conflict. Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah were regions in Mesopotamia and Syria, respectively. The Valley of Salt is likely located near the Dead Sea. This setting underscores the geopolitical struggles of Israel and highlights the leadership of David and his commander Joab. The victory over the Edomites is also recorded in <a href="/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/18-12.htm">1 Chronicles 18:12</a>, emphasizing God's deliverance in battle.<p><b>You have rejected us, O God;</b><br>This expression of divine rejection reflects a period of distress or defeat for Israel. It acknowledges God's sovereignty and the belief that national calamities were often seen as a result of divine displeasure.<p><b>You have broken us;</b><br>The imagery of being broken suggests a state of vulnerability and defeat. It conveys the deep sense of loss and the need for divine intervention and healing.<p><b>You have been angry;</b><br>This phrase acknowledges God's righteous anger, which in the Old Testament is often associated with Israel's disobedience or idolatry. It reflects the covenant relationship where God's anger is a response to the people's failure to uphold their part of the covenant.<p><b>restore us!</b><br>The plea for restoration is a common theme in the psalms, reflecting a desire for reconciliation and renewal. It underscores the hope and faith in God's mercy and the belief that He can restore what has been broken. This plea is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/80-3.htm">Psalm 80:3</a> and <a href="/lamentations/5-21.htm">Lamentations 5:21</a>, where the call for restoration is linked to repentance and divine grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of the psalm, traditionally believed to be King David, who often wrote psalms during times of distress and national crisis.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of Israel is the primary subject of the psalm, experiencing a period of divine rejection and seeking restoration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure to whom the psalm is addressed, highlighting His sovereignty and the need for His favor and restoration.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/military_defeat.htm">Military Defeat</a></b><br>The context of the psalm suggests a backdrop of military defeat or national calamity, prompting a plea for divine intervention.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/restoration.htm">Restoration</a></b><br>The desired outcome of the psalm, where the people seek to be restored to God's favor and protection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_discipline.htm">Understanding Divine Discipline</a></b><br>Recognize that God's rejection or discipline is often a response to sin or disobedience.
