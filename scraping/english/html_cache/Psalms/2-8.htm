The act of asking signifies a divine promise that requires a response, emphasizing the importance of prayer and communication with God. In the context of ancient Israel, kings would often seek divine guidance and favor, reflecting a dependency on God's will.<p><b>and I will make the nations Your inheritance</b><br>This promise of nations as an inheritance suggests a transfer of authority and dominion. In the historical context, Israel was surrounded by various nations, often in conflict. The idea of nations as an inheritance implies a future where God's anointed would have authority over all peoples, not just Israel. This is seen as a foreshadowing of the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations, indicating the global scope of His kingdom.<p><b>the ends of the earth Your possession</b><br>This phrase extends the promise to the entire world, indicating a universal reign. In biblical times, the "ends of the earth" would have been understood as the farthest reaches of the known world, symbolizing total dominion. This is consistent with prophecies in <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a> and <a href="/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>, which speak of an everlasting kingdom. It also reflects the eschatological vision in <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>, where the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of Christ, affirming His ultimate sovereignty over all creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, who is addressing His Anointed One, promising Him dominion over the nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_anointed_one.htm">The Anointed One (Messiah)</a></b><br>The recipient of the promise, traditionally understood as the Messiah, who is given authority over the nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the Gentile nations of the world, symbolizing all peoples outside of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/ends_of_the_earth.htm">Ends of the Earth</a></b><br>A phrase indicating the totality of the world, emphasizing the universal scope of the Messiah's reign.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/davidic_covenant.htm">Davidic Covenant</a></b><br>The broader context of this Psalm, which is often linked to the promises made to David regarding his lineage and the coming of a future king.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sovereignty.htm">Divine Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is sovereign over all nations and history, and His plans will be fulfilled through His Anointed One.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/messianic_fulfillment.htm">Messianic Fulfillment</a></b><br>Understand that Jesus is the fulfillment of this promise, and His kingdom is both a present reality and a future hope.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_and_intercession.htm">Prayer and Intercession</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of asking God for the nations, aligning our prayers with His redemptive purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/global_mission.htm">Global Mission</a></b><br>Encourage active participation in the Great Commission, as believers are called to spread the gospel to the ends of the earth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_christ's_reign.htm">Hope in Christ&#8217;s Reign</a></b><br>Find assurance in the ultimate victory and reign of Christ over all the earth, which provides hope amidst current global challenges.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_2_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 2:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_2_8_s_role_in_global_evangelism.htm">How does Psalm 2:8 encourage us to pray for global evangelism efforts?
