Gold, especially pure gold, has been a symbol of wealth and value throughout history, often used in the construction of sacred objects, such as the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10-11</a>). The psalmist's comparison suggests that spiritual wealth surpasses material wealth. In biblical times, gold was a standard of wealth and power, yet the psalmist elevates God's word above even the finest gold. This reflects the biblical theme that spiritual riches are eternal, unlike earthly treasures (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). The phrase also connects to the wisdom literature, where the pursuit of wisdom and understanding is often valued above material wealth (<a href="/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13-15</a>).<p><b>they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb.</b><br>Honey, particularly honey from the comb, was a delicacy in ancient Israel, symbolizing pleasure and satisfaction. The Promised Land was described as a land "flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>), indicating abundance and prosperity. The psalmist uses this imagery to convey the delight and satisfaction found in God's word. This sweetness suggests that God's commandments are not burdensome but bring joy and fulfillment to those who follow them. The comparison to honey also evokes the idea of God's word being nourishing and life-giving, similar to how honey provides energy and sustenance. This aligns with other scriptures that describe God's word as life-giving and sustaining (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>, <a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>). The sweetness of God's word can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>) and who offers spiritual nourishment and satisfaction to believers (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19</a>, David was the second king of Israel and a man after God's own heart.
