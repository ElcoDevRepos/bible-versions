Laughter here symbolizes a deep, heartfelt response to God's intervention. In biblical times, laughter was often associated with moments of divine blessing or miraculous events, as seen in Sarah's laughter upon learning of Isaac's promised birth (<a href="/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12-15</a>). This joy is a testament to God's faithfulness and the fulfillment of His promises.<p><b>our tongues with shouts of joy</b><br>The expression of joy through shouting indicates a communal celebration, often seen in Israel's history during festivals or victories. This public declaration of joy serves as a witness to others of God's mighty works. In the context of worship, such expressions were common in the Psalms, where music and vocal praise were integral to celebrating God's deeds (<a href="/psalms/98-4.htm">Psalm 98:4-6</a>). The joy expressed here is not just personal but shared among the community, highlighting the collective experience of God's salvation.<p><b>Then it was said among the nations</b><br>This phrase suggests that the surrounding nations recognized the extraordinary nature of what God had done for His people. It reflects the idea that God's actions on behalf of Israel were so significant that they became known beyond their borders. This acknowledgment by other nations fulfills the Abrahamic promise that through Israel, all nations would be blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). It also serves as a testimony to God's power and sovereignty, drawing attention to His role in the affairs of the world.<p><b>&#8220;The LORD has done great things for them.&#8221;</b><br>The acknowledgment of the LORD's deeds by other nations underscores the magnitude of His intervention. This recognition serves as a form of evangelism, as the nations witness the reality of Israel's God. The phrase echoes the sentiment found in other scriptures where God's mighty acts are celebrated, such as the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>) and the return from exile (<a href="/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a>). It points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, whose life, death, and resurrection are the greatest acts of God for humanity, offering salvation to all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience and subject of this Psalm, reflecting on their return from exile and the joy that accompanied their restoration.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>The surrounding peoples who observed the restoration of Israel and recognized the work of the LORD in their deliverance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is credited with the great deeds that brought about the restoration and joy of His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/joy_in_restoration.htm">Joy in Restoration</a></b><br>The joy expressed in this verse is a result of God's restorative work.
