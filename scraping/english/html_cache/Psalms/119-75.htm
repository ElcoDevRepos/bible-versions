The use of "I know" indicates a certainty and experiential knowledge of God's character. The invocation of "O LORD" uses the covenant name of God, Yahweh, emphasizing a personal and covenantal relationship. This is consistent with the psalmist's frequent appeals to God throughout <a href="/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, which is a meditation on the law and the character of God.<p><b>that Your judgments are righteous</b><br>The term "judgments" refers to God's decisions, decrees, and laws. The psalmist acknowledges that God's judgments are inherently righteous, meaning they are just, fair, and morally right. This reflects the biblical theme that God's ways are perfect (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>) and His law is a reflection of His holy character. The righteousness of God's judgments is a recurring theme in the Psalms and is foundational to understanding God's interactions with humanity.<p><b>and that in faithfulness You have afflicted me</b><br>Here, the psalmist recognizes that God's actions, even those that involve suffering or discipline, are done in faithfulness. This reflects the biblical principle that God disciplines those He loves (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>). The affliction is not seen as arbitrary or punitive but as a means of growth and refinement. This understanding is consistent with the broader biblical narrative where suffering is often used by God to bring about a greater good or deeper relationship with Him, as seen in the lives of figures like Joseph (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>) and Job.
