In the Old Testament, military success or failure was often seen as a direct result of God's favor or displeasure. The Israelites believed that God was actively involved in their national affairs, and their victories were seen as blessings from God, while defeats were interpreted as signs of His disfavor. This perspective is consistent with the covenantal relationship described in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where obedience to God results in blessings, and disobedience leads to curses, including military defeat. The historical context may relate to various periods of Israel's history, such as the time of the Judges or the Babylonian exile, when Israel faced significant military challenges.<p><b>and those who hate us have plundered us</b><br>The act of plundering by enemies was a common consequence of military defeat in the ancient Near East. This phrase indicates not only a loss in battle but also the subsequent humiliation and material loss suffered by the Israelites. The enemies' hatred suggests longstanding animosity, possibly reflecting the ongoing conflicts with neighboring nations such as the Philistines, Moabites, or Edomites. This situation echoes the curses outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>, where God warns that if Israel disobeys, they will be defeated by their enemies. Theologically, this can be seen as a call for the Israelites to examine their faithfulness to God and seek repentance. The plundering also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance and restoration promised in prophetic books, where God assures His people of eventual victory and restoration, pointing to the hope of redemption through the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_korah.htm">The Sons of Korah</a></b><br>The authors of <a href="/bsb/psalms/44.htm">Psalm 44</a>, a group of Levitical singers and musicians who served in the temple.

The psalmist speaks directly to God, recognizing His sovereignty even in defeat: &#8220;You have made us retreat&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/44-10.htm">Psalm 44:10</a>).<p>&#8226; This confession echoes covenant warnings that the Lord Himself would withdraw military success if His people turned from Him (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Historic examples confirm the literal reality of such retreats:<p>&#8209; Israel&#8217;s loss at Ai when sin was in the camp (<a href="/joshua/7-4.htm">Joshua 7:4-5</a>).<p>&#8209; Periodic subjugation under neighboring nations during the Judges (<a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; By attributing the setback to God, the psalmist models honest lament&#8212;affirming divine control while pleading for restoration (<a href="/psalms/60-1.htm">Psalm 60:1-3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-17.htm">Isaiah 63:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Application points:<p>&#8209; Defeat is never random; it invites self-examination and renewed dependence on the Lord (<a href="/psalms/139-23.htm">Psalm 139:23-24</a>).<p>&#8209; Acknowledging God&#8217;s hand prepares the heart for repentance and future victory (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and those who hate us have plundered us</b><p>&#8226; The second clause reveals the consequence: enemy hatred turns into tangible loss&#8212;&#8220;plundered us&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/44-10.htm">Psalm 44:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture presents plunder as both punishment and wake-up call (<a href="/lamentations/5-1.htm">Lamentations 5:1-2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/30-16.htm">Jeremiah 30:16</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s people experienced material stripping when spiritual fidelity eroded (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-24.htm">2 Chronicles 24:24</a>;

Ultimate vindication comes through the Messiah who &#8220;disarmed the powers and authorities&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Application points:<p>&#8209; Earthly losses remind believers that true treasure is in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p>&#8209;

The verse teaches that (1) God remains sovereign even in defeat, (2) setbacks prompt heart-level repentance, and (3) losses are temporary for those who return to Him.
