The mountains, often seen as symbols of permanence and stability, highlight the eternal nature of God, who predates even the most ancient and enduring parts of creation. In biblical times, mountains were considered sacred and were often sites of divine revelation, such as Mount Sinai. This underscores the idea that God is the ultimate source of all creation, transcending time and space.<p><b>or You brought forth the earth and the world</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to God's role as the Creator. The distinction between "earth" and "world" may suggest the physical planet and the inhabited world, respectively. This aligns with the Genesis account of creation, where God speaks the universe into existence. The act of creation is a demonstration of God's power and sovereignty, setting the stage for His ongoing relationship with humanity. The imagery of God "bringing forth" creation can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is described in the New Testament as the agent of creation (<a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>, <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>).<p><b>from everlasting to everlasting You are God</b><br>This phrase affirms the eternal nature of God, existing beyond the confines of time. The concept of "everlasting" suggests an infinite past and future, highlighting God's unchanging and eternal character. This is a central theme in Scripture, where God is often described as the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end (<a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>). The eternal nature of God provides a foundation for trust and faith, as His purposes and promises are not subject to change. This eternal aspect of God is also reflected in Jesus Christ, who is described as the same yesterday, today, and forever (<a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/90.htm">Psalm 90</a>, Moses is a central figure in the Old Testament, known for leading the Israelites out of Egypt and receiving the Ten Commandments from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountains.htm">Mountains</a></b><br>Symbolic of stability and permanence in the Bible, mountains are used here to emphasize the eternal nature of God compared to the temporal nature of creation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/earth_and_the_world.htm">Earth and the World</a></b><br>Represents the entirety of creation, highlighting God's role as the Creator.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/everlasting_to_everlasting.htm">Everlasting to Everlasting</a></b><br>A phrase that underscores God's eternal existence, beyond the confines of time and space.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The event of God bringing forth the earth and the world, emphasizing His power and sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_eternal_nature.htm">God's Eternal Nature</a></b><br>God exists beyond time, having no beginning or end.
