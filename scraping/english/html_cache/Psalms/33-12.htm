In biblical context, "blessed" refers to a state of happiness and divine favor. The term "nation" here can be understood as a collective group of people who acknowledge and worship the LORD, Yahweh, as their God. Historically, this was directly applicable to Israel, chosen by God to be His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). The concept of a nation under God is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>, which states, "Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people." This phrase also points to the idea that true prosperity and peace come from aligning with God's will and commands.<p><b>the people He has chosen as His inheritance!</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the special status of being chosen by God. In the Old Testament, Israel is often referred to as God's chosen people (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). The term "inheritance" signifies a treasured possession, indicating a deep, covenantal relationship. This concept is further developed in the New Testament, where believers in Christ are described as a chosen people and a royal priesthood (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). The idea of being God's inheritance implies a future hope and promise, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>, where Paul speaks of "the riches of His glorious inheritance in His holy people." This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who through His sacrifice, extends the promise of being God's people to all who believe, transcending ethnic and national boundaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nation.htm">The Nation</a></b><br>Refers to any group of people who collectively acknowledge the LORD as their God.

In the Hebrew context, it implies a deep, personal relationship and a sense of belonging.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_blessing_of_divine_allegiance.htm">The Blessing of Divine Allegiance</a></b><br>A nation or people are truly blessed when they recognize and serve the LORD as their God.
