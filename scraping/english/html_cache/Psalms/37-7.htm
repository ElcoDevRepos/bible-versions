In the biblical context, being still is often associated with trust and surrender (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>, <a href="/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>). It implies a cessation of striving and a focus on God's sovereignty. The Hebrew word for "be still" can also mean to relax or let go, suggesting a release of anxiety and control. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of resting in God's presence and trusting in His timing and plans.<p><b>and wait patiently for Him;</b><br>Patience is a recurring theme in Scripture, often linked with faith and hope (<a href="/romans/8-25.htm">Romans 8:25</a>, <a href="/james/5-7.htm">James 5:7-8</a>). Waiting on the Lord is an act of faith, acknowledging His perfect timing and wisdom. Historically, the Israelites experienced periods of waiting, such as during their wilderness journey or the Babylonian exile, which tested their faith and reliance on God. This patience is not passive but active, involving prayer, meditation on God's Word, and a steadfast hope in His promises.<p><b>do not fret when men prosper in their ways,</b><br>The prosperity of the wicked is a common concern in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3-12</a>). This phrase addresses the temptation to envy or be anxious about the success of those who do not follow God's ways. The biblical narrative often contrasts the temporary success of the wicked with the eternal reward of the righteous (<a href="/proverbs/24-19.htm">Proverbs 24:19-20</a>). This calls believers to focus on God's justice and ultimate plan rather than immediate circumstances.<p><b>when they carry out wicked schemes.</b><br>Wicked schemes refer to actions that are contrary to God's law and character. Throughout Scripture, God is portrayed as a righteous judge who will ultimately bring justice (<a href="/psalms/94-23.htm">Psalm 94:23</a>, <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>). The historical context of Israel often involved surrounding nations or internal leaders who acted wickedly, yet God's sovereignty and justice prevailed. This phrase reassures believers that despite the apparent success of evil, God remains in control and will address all wrongdoing in His time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/37.htm">Psalm 37</a>, King David, is reflecting on the prosperity of the wicked and the righteous' response to it.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The central figure in whom believers are to place their trust and patience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Those who prosper through unrighteous means, causing distress to the righteous.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>Those who are called to trust in the LORD and not be envious of the wicked.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom David originally wrote, providing context for understanding the cultural and historical background.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>Understand that God's timing is perfect, and our role is to trust and wait patiently for His plans to unfold.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoid_envy_and_anxiety.htm">Avoid Envy and Anxiety</a></b><br>Recognize that fretting over the prosperity of the wicked can lead to envy and anxiety, which detract from our faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/focus_on_god's_faithfulness.htm">Focus on God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Remember past instances of God's faithfulness as a source of encouragement and strength while waiting.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultivate_patience.htm">Cultivate Patience</a></b><br>Develop patience as a fruit of the Spirit, allowing it to shape our responses to life's challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seek_god's_presence.htm">Seek God's Presence</a></b><br>Use times of waiting as opportunities to deepen your relationship with God through prayer and meditation on His Word.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_37_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 37:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_be_still_before_the_LORD_daily.htm">How can we "be still before the LORD" in daily life challenges?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_waiting_teach_trust_in_God.htm">What does "wait patiently for Him" teach about God's timing and our trust?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_37_7_Philippians_4_6-7_on_anxiety.htm">How does Psalm 37:7 connect with Philippians 4:6-7 on anxiety?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_not_worry_about_others_success.htm">Why is it important not to "fret over those who prosper"?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_stillness_deepen_God_bond.htm">How can practicing stillness enhance your relationship with God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_37_7_s_message_on_patience.htm">How does Psalm 37:7 encourage patience in the face of injustice or wrongdoing?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_be_still_before_the_LORD.htm">What does "be still before the LORD" mean in the context of Psalm 37:7?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_do_believers_patiently_wait_daily.htm">How can believers apply "wait patiently for Him" in their daily lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_37.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 37?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_waiting_on_the_lord_mean.htm">What does waiting on the Lord mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/does_numbers_5_show_god_ordering_abortion.htm">Why worry about those who do wrong?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/meaning_of_isaiah_40_31_on_strength.htm">What does Isaiah 40:31 mean about strength and renewal?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_worry_about_those_who_do_wrong.htm">Why worry about those who do wrong?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 37:7 Mean</div><b>Be still before the LORD</b><p>&#8226;
