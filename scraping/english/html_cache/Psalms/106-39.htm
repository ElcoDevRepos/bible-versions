The term "defiled" suggests a state of impurity, often associated with idolatry and sin. In the context of ancient Israel, defilement was not only a personal issue but also a communal one, affecting the entire nation's relationship with God. The actions referred to here likely include the worship of foreign gods and participation in pagan rituals, which were strictly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). This defilement is a breach of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, echoing the warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah and Ezekiel about the consequences of such actions (<a href="/jeremiah/2-7.htm">Jeremiah 2:7</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/20-43.htm">Ezekiel 20:43</a>).<p><b>and prostituted themselves by their deeds</b><br>The imagery of prostitution is frequently used in the Bible to describe Israel's unfaithfulness to God. This metaphor conveys the idea of spiritual adultery, where the people of Israel, who were meant to be devoted to God alone, instead gave themselves to other deities and practices. This is reminiscent of the prophetic writings of Hosea, where Israel's idolatry is likened to a wife's infidelity (<a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2, 4</a>:12). The "deeds" mentioned here refer to the specific acts of idol worship and alliances with pagan nations, which were seen as betrayals of their exclusive covenant with God. This language underscores the seriousness of their sin and the depth of their betrayal, as they exchanged the glory of God for the worship of created things (<a href="/romans/1-23.htm">Romans 1:23</a>). The use of such strong imagery serves as a call to repentance and a return to faithfulness, pointing forward to the ultimate redemption and restoration found in Jesus Christ, who offers forgiveness and a new covenant relationship with God (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The primary subjects of <a href="/bsb/psalms/106.htm">Psalm 106</a>, the Israelites are depicted as God's chosen people who repeatedly fall into sin and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land into which the Israelites entered, where they were influenced by the pagan practices of the surrounding nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, he is a central figure in the account of Israel's journey and their covenant relationship with God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pagan_nations.htm">Pagan Nations</a></b><br>The surrounding nations whose practices and idols led the Israelites astray.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_covenant.htm">God's Covenant</a></b><br>The divine agreement between God and Israel, which they violated through their actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_compromise.htm">The Danger of Compromise</a></b><br>The Israelites' defilement began with small compromises.
