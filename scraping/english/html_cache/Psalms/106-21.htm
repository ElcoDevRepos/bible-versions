In the biblical narrative, forgetting God often leads to disobedience and idolatry. The term "Savior" underscores God's role as the deliverer, a title that foreshadows the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ. The Israelites' forgetfulness is a warning against spiritual amnesia, reminding believers to continually remember and recount God's faithfulness. This concept is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>, where the Israelites are admonished not to forget the Lord who brought them out of slavery.<p><b>who did great things in Egypt</b><br>This refers to the miraculous events surrounding the Exodus, where God demonstrated His power through the ten plagues and the parting of the Red Sea. These acts were not only displays of divine power but also served as judgments against the gods of Egypt, affirming the supremacy of the God of Israel. The "great things" are a testament to God's covenant faithfulness and His ability to save His people against overwhelming odds. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative of redemption, as the Exodus is a type of Christ's redemptive work, liberating humanity from the bondage of sin. The historical and archaeological context of Egypt during this period provides insights into the cultural and religious backdrop against which these events occurred, emphasizing the magnitude of God's intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, referred to as the Savior who performed great deeds for the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people who forgot God despite His miraculous works in their history.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place where God performed great acts to deliver the Israelites from slavery.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/exodus.htm">Exodus</a></b><br>The event of Israel's deliverance from Egypt, showcasing God's power and faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader chosen by God to guide the Israelites out of Egypt, though not directly mentioned in this verse, he is a key figure in the events alluded to.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_forgetfulness.htm">The Danger of Forgetfulness</a></b><br>Forgetting God's past works can lead to spiritual decline and disobedience.

Verse 21 opens with the stark admission: &#8220;They forgot.&#8221;<p>- Forgetting here is not a lapse of memory but a willful neglect. The people chose convenience over covenant faithfulness (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10-12</a>; <a href="/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-11.htm">Psalm 78:11</a>).<p>- This deliberate amnesia set the stage for idolatry, complaint, and rebellion&#8212;reminding us how quickly blessings become commonplace when gratitude fades.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God</b><p>- The One they dismissed is not a vague higher power but the living God who revealed His name and character (cf. <a href="/psalms/95-3.htm">Psalm 95:3-7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a>).<p>- Relationship, not ritual, lay at the heart of Israel&#8217;s identity. To forget God was to sever the very lifeline of the nation.<p>- Every command, celebration, and statute was designed to keep Him central, yet they pushed Him to the margins.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>their Savior</b><p>- &#8220;God their Savior&#8221; personalizes the offense. The same Lord who rescued them is the One they neglected (cf. <a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/22-2.htm">2 Samuel 22:2-3</a>; <a href="/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>).<p>- Salvation in Scripture is both historical and ongoing: He saved from Egypt, and He saves from daily perils. Neglecting the Savior implies self-reliance&#8212;a swift path to spiritual ruin.<p>- The phrase underscores covenant love: God binds Himself to His people as Rescuer, expecting reciprocal loyalty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who did great things</b><p>- The psalmist draws attention to the magnitude of divine acts: plagues, Passover, Red Sea crossing&#8212;events meant to be retold for generations (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/10-21.htm">Deuteronomy 10:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-12.htm">Psalm 78:12-14</a>; <a href="/joel/2-21.htm">Joel 2:21</a>).<p>- &#8220;Great things&#8221; testifies to power beyond human explanation, calling forth awe and obedience. Forgetting such wonders reveals a heart dull to glory.<p>- Remembering magnifies faith; forgetting shrinks God to the size of our fears.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in Egypt</b><p>- Egypt symbolizes bondage, oppression, and divine triumph. God&#8217;s works there form the cornerstone of Israel&#8217;s national story (cf. <a href="/exodus/12-50.htm">Exodus 12:50-51</a>; <a href="/psalms/136-10.htm">Psalm 136:10-12</a>).<p>- Every plague exposed Egypt&#8217;s idols and exalted the Lord. Israel&#8217;s deliverance was not merely political; it was a revelation of God&#8217;s character&#8212;holy, just, and compassionate.<p>- To overlook Egypt is to erase the evidence of grace that birthed the nation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/106-21.htm">Psalm 106:21</a> warns that spiritual amnesia breeds unfaithfulness. Israel&#8217;s neglect of &#8220;God their Savior, who did great things in Egypt&#8221; showcases the tragedy of forgetting covenant history. The verse calls believers to deliberate remembrance&#8212;rehearsing God&#8217;s mighty acts, keeping Him central, and responding with continuous gratitude and obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/106.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Forgot God their saviour.</span>--With evident allusion to <a href="/deuteronomy/6-12.htm" title="Then beware lest you forget the LORD, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/106.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They forgat God their Saviour</span> (comp. ver. 13).
