Throughout the Bible, God is depicted as one who sees and understands the afflictions of His people. In <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>, God tells Moses that He has seen the misery of His people in Egypt. This awareness is not passive; it implies a readiness to act. The Hebrew word for "regarded" suggests a deep, attentive observation, indicating that God is not indifferent to the plight of the oppressed.<p><b>You see to repay it by Your hand.</b><br>Here, the text underscores God's justice. The phrase "repay it by Your hand" suggests divine retribution and the assurance that God will address wrongs. This is consistent with the biblical theme of God as a righteous judge, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>, where God declares that vengeance is His. The "hand" of God often symbolizes His power and intervention in the world, as seen in the deliverance of Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3</a>).<p><b>The victim entrusts himself to You;</b><br>This phrase highlights the faith and reliance of those who suffer on God's protection and justice. The act of entrusting oneself to God is a recurring theme in the Psalms, reflecting a deep trust in God's character and promises. <a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a> encourages believers to commit their way to the Lord, trusting in Him to act. This trust is not misplaced, as God is portrayed as a refuge and fortress for those in distress (<a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>).<p><b>You are the helper of the fatherless.</b><br>The Bible frequently emphasizes God's special care for the vulnerable, including orphans. In ancient Israel, the fatherless were among the most defenseless members of society, often lacking provision and protection. God's role as their helper is a testament to His compassion and justice. This is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>, where God is described as one who defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow. This care for the vulnerable is a type of Christ, who in the New Testament is shown to have a heart for the marginalized and oppressed, fulfilling the prophetic vision of a Messiah who brings justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is portrayed as the one who sees and takes action regarding the troubles and griefs of the oppressed.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_victim.htm">The Victim</a></b><br>Represents those who are suffering or oppressed, who place their trust in God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fatherless.htm">The Fatherless</a></b><br>Symbolizes the vulnerable and marginalized in society, whom God helps and defends.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_awareness_and_action.htm">God's Awareness and Action</a></b><br>God is not distant or indifferent to human suffering.

In times of trouble, believers are encouraged to place their trust in God's faithful care and provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_a_helper.htm">God as a Helper</a></b><br>God is described as the helper of the fatherless, emphasizing His role as a defender and provider for those who lack earthly support.
