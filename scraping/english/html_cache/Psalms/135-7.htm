The imagery of clouds rising from the ends of the earth suggests a divine orchestration of weather patterns, which in ancient times were often seen as mysterious and beyond human understanding. This reflects the biblical theme of God as the Creator who sustains the universe (<a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>). The "ends of the earth" can be understood as a poetic expression indicating the vastness of God's reach and authority, similar to the language used in <a href="/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>, which speaks of God's everlasting power and understanding.<p><b>He generates the lightning with the rain</b><br>This part of the verse underscores God's power in orchestrating the elements, specifically the combination of lightning and rain. In the ancient Near East, storms were often associated with divine activity, and lightning was seen as a manifestation of divine power. This aligns with the depiction of God in <a href="/job/37-3.htm">Job 37:3-6</a>, where He commands the thunder and rain. The connection between lightning and rain also serves as a reminder of God's provision, as rain was essential for agriculture and survival in biblical times. This reflects God's role as a provider, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>, where God promises rain for the land in its season.<p><b>and brings forth the wind from His storehouses.</b><br>The imagery of wind being brought forth from God's storehouses suggests a divine control over the unseen forces of nature. In biblical literature, wind often symbolizes the Spirit of God or His breath, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, where the Spirit of God hovers over the waters. The concept of storehouses implies that God has an abundant supply of resources at His command, reinforcing His omnipotence. This idea is echoed in <a href="/jeremiah/10-13.htm">Jeremiah 10:13</a>, where God is described as bringing forth the wind from His treasuries.

Such was the Oriental notion, see <a href="/zechariah/10-1.htm" title="Ask you of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.">Zechariah 10:1</a> and compare <a href="/1_samuel/12-17.htm" title="Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call to the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that you may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.">1Samuel 12:17</a>. Both of these places refer to showers out of the ordinary rainy season, such as thunder-storms in the harvest season. The sudden downfall of sheets of rain after a flash and peal is even in this climate sufficiently striking to make such a notion as the dependence of rain on lightning quite conceivable, how much more in tropical countries, and where, except in the due rainy season, it would never probably fall without thunder and lightning. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/135.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth</span> (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/10-13.htm">Jeremiah 10:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-16.htm">Jeremiah 51:16</a>) By God's contrivance vapor is continually rising from the remotest regions of the earth, to hang in clouds, descend in rain, and spread abroad fertility. <span class="cmt_word">He maketh lightnings for the rain.</span> To accompany it, perhaps to give it its fertilizing qualities (see Dr. Kay's comment 'The Psalms,' p. 428). <span class="cmt_word">He bringeth the wind out of his treasuries</span> (see <a href="/job/38-22.htm">Job 38:22</a>, where God's "treasuries" for the snow and the hail are spoken of; and comp.
