The "hand that hated them" symbolizes the power and control that Egypt, particularly Pharaoh, had over the Israelites. This deliverance is a central theme in the Exodus narrative, where God intervenes to free His people from slavery. The hatred of the Egyptians can be seen in their harsh treatment and oppressive labor demands on the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/1-13.htm">Exodus 1:13-14</a>). This act of salvation is a demonstration of God's covenant faithfulness and His power over the nations. It also prefigures the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ, who delivers believers from the bondage of sin and death.<p><b>He redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</b><br>The term "redeemed" here implies a transaction or a liberation that comes at a cost. In the context of the Exodus, God redeemed Israel through the plagues and the parting of the Red Sea, culminating in the destruction of the Egyptian army (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>). The "enemy" refers to the Egyptians who pursued the Israelites to bring them back into slavery. This redemption is a type of the greater redemption found in Christ, who redeems humanity from sin through His sacrificial death and resurrection. The concept of redemption is central to the biblical narrative, highlighting God's initiative in rescuing His people. This act of redemption is celebrated throughout Scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/43.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a> and <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>, which speak of God's redeeming love and power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and faced numerous adversities throughout their history.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_foe/enemy.htm">The Foe/Enemy</a></b><br>Represents the Egyptians in the context of the Exodus, but can also symbolize any adversarial force against God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exodus.htm">The Exodus</a></b><br>The pivotal event where God delivered the Israelites from Egyptian bondage, showcasing His power and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_deliverance.htm">God's Faithfulness in Deliverance</a></b><br>God is consistently faithful in delivering His people from their enemies, as seen throughout biblical history.

The same phrasing appears in <a href="/luke/1-71.htm">Luke 1:71</a>, where Zacharias praises God for &#8220;salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us,&#8221; showing a consistent biblical theme.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Hand&#8221; pictures active power. Pharaoh&#8217;s armies were intent on destroying Israel, yet they were powerless once God stepped in (<a href="/psalms/18-17.htm">Psalm 18:17</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, the principle stands: the Lord still rescues those who trust Him from forces too strong for them, whether physical persecution or the schemes of the evil one (<a href="/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He redeemed them from the hand of the enemy</b><p>&#8226; Redemption adds the idea of purchase.

It foreshadows a greater price: &#8220;You were redeemed&#8230; with the precious blood of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Enemy&#8221; reaches beyond Egypt to the ultimate adversary. <a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a> says He &#8220;rescued us from the dominion of darkness.&#8221; Every exodus points to the cross, where Christ literally bought our freedom from sin&#8217;s slavery (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a> reinforces the personal side: &#8220;Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name; you are Mine.&#8221; The Exodus proves God keeps that promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/106-10.htm">Psalm 106:10</a> celebrates two inseparable truths: God saves and God redeems.
