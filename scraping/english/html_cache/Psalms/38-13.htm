This metaphor highlights the psalmist's inability to respond to his accusers or to hear their taunts. In biblical times, deafness was often seen as a significant disability, leading to social exclusion. The psalmist's choice to liken himself to a deaf man may indicate a deliberate decision to ignore the accusations and slander, choosing instead to focus on God. This reflects a theme found in <a href="/isaiah/42-19.htm">Isaiah 42:19</a>, where the servant of the Lord is described as blind and deaf, emphasizing trust in God over human judgment. The psalmist's silence can also be seen as a form of protest or a way to maintain dignity amidst false accusations.<p><b>and like a mute man, I do not open my mouth.</b><br>Here, the psalmist compares himself to a mute man, emphasizing his decision not to defend himself verbally. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, speech was a powerful tool for defense and persuasion. By choosing silence, the psalmist demonstrates reliance on God for vindication rather than human means. This mirrors the behavior of Jesus Christ during His trial, as described in <a href="/matthew/27-12.htm">Matthew 27:12-14</a>, where He remained silent before His accusers, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>. The psalmist's silence can be seen as an act of faith, trusting that God will ultimately deliver justice. This approach underscores the biblical principle of leaving vengeance to God, as stated in <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/38.htm">Psalm 38</a>, David is expressing his deep distress and sense of isolation due to his sin and the resulting consequences.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>Though not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of the psalm includes adversaries who are taking advantage of David's weakened state.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>Implicit in the psalm as the one David ultimately turns to for help and forgiveness, despite his current silence and suffering.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/silence_in_suffering.htm">Silence in Suffering</a></b><br>Sometimes, in our suffering, we may feel like we cannot express ourselves or that our cries are unheard.
