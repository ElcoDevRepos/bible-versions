These locations were typically on hills or mountains and were associated with pagan rituals. The use of high places was explicitly forbidden in the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-4</a>), as worship was to be centralized in the temple in Jerusalem. The Israelites' use of high places indicates a syncretism with Canaanite religious practices, which was a recurring issue throughout their history (<a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>). This disobedience was a direct affront to God, who had commanded exclusive worship and had provided specific instructions on how and where He was to be worshiped.<p><b>and provoked His jealousy with their idols</b><br>Idolatry was a significant sin in Israel, as it violated the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). The term "jealousy" here reflects God's zealousness for His people's undivided devotion. In the ancient Near Eastern context, idols were physical representations of deities, and their worship was common among Israel's neighbors. The Israelites' adoption of idol worship was not only a breach of covenant but also a rejection of God's unique identity and sovereignty. This provocation is seen throughout the Old Testament, where God repeatedly calls His people back to faithfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11-13</a>). The prophets often likened idolatry to spiritual adultery, emphasizing the relational betrayal involved (Hosea 1-3). This phrase underscores the seriousness of idolatry and the deep offense it caused to God, who desired a pure and exclusive relationship with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are being addressed in this Psalm.
