In biblical context, "the righteous" refers to individuals who seek to live in obedience to God's commandments and maintain a relationship with Him. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>, which states, "The eyes of the LORD are in every place, keeping watch on the evil and the good." The imagery of God's eyes suggests His omniscience and personal involvement in the lives of His people. Historically, the idea of divine watchfulness was comforting to the Israelites, who often faced external threats and needed assurance of God's protection. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of Jesus as the Good Shepherd, who knows and cares for His sheep (<a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>).<p><b>and His ears are inclined to their cry</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's responsiveness to the prayers and pleas of the righteous. The imagery of God's ears being inclined suggests a posture of attentiveness and readiness to listen. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, crying out to God was a common practice in times of distress, as seen in the Psalms and other Old Testament narratives. This assurance of God's listening ear is paralleled in <a href="/1_peter/3-12.htm">1 Peter 3:12</a>, which reiterates that "the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their prayer." Theologically, this reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where He promises to hear and respond to their needs. This phrase also points to the intercessory role of Jesus Christ, who, as our High Priest, mediates on behalf of believers, ensuring that their prayers are heard by the Father (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, who wrote this psalm after pretending to be insane before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he left.
