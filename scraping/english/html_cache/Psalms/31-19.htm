In the Hebrew context, "goodness" often refers to God's benevolent actions and character. The psalmist marvels at the vastness of God's kindness, which is a recurring theme throughout the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>). This goodness is not only a quality of God but also an active force in the lives of believers.<p><b>which You have laid up for those who fear You</b><br>The idea of "laying up" suggests a treasure or storehouse, indicating that God's goodness is reserved and abundant for those who fear Him. In biblical terms, "fear" denotes reverence and awe rather than terror. This concept is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, where the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. The imagery of a storehouse implies that God's blessings are both plentiful and secure, awaiting those who live in reverence to Him.<p><b>which You have bestowed before the sons of men</b><br>This phrase highlights the public nature of God's blessings. God's goodness is not hidden but displayed openly, serving as a testimony to all people. The public demonstration of God's favor can be seen in the lives of biblical figures like Joseph and Daniel, whose faithfulness led to visible blessings. This public bestowal also points to the ultimate revelation of God's goodness in Jesus Christ, whose life and works were witnessed by many.<p><b>on those who take refuge in You</b><br>Taking refuge in God implies trust and reliance on His protection and provision. This imagery is common in the Psalms, where God is often depicted as a fortress or shield (e.g., <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>). The concept of refuge is deeply rooted in the historical context of ancient Israel, where cities of refuge provided safety for those in danger. Spiritually, this points to the security found in Christ, who offers ultimate refuge from sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/31.htm">Psalm 31</a>, David is expressing his trust in God's goodness and protection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, whose goodness and protection are highlighted.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_fear_god.htm">Those who fear God</a></b><br>Refers to individuals who have a reverent awe and respect for God, acknowledging His power and authority.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_men.htm">Sons of men</a></b><br>A term used to describe humanity in general, emphasizing the public nature of God's goodness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/refuge.htm">Refuge</a></b><br>A metaphorical place of safety and protection, symbolizing trust and reliance on God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_abundance_of_god's_goodness.htm">The Abundance of God's Goodness</a></b><br>God's goodness is not limited or scarce; it is abundant and available to those who fear Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_the_lord.htm">Fear of the Lord</a></b><br>A healthy, reverent fear of God is foundational to experiencing His goodness.
