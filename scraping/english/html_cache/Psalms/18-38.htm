The imagery of crushing suggests total defeat, leaving the enemies powerless to recover. This can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promises to protect and deliver His people, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>, where God promises that enemies will be defeated before Israel. The language of crushing also echoes the prophecy in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the seed of the woman will crush the serpent's head, symbolizing ultimate victory over evil. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who through His death and resurrection, defeated sin and death, ensuring that His enemies cannot rise against Him.<p><b>they have fallen under my feet.</b><br>The imagery of enemies falling under one's feet signifies complete subjugation and authority over them. In ancient Near Eastern culture, placing one's foot on the neck of a defeated enemy was a symbolic act of victory and dominance. This phrase can be connected to <a href="/joshua/10-24.htm">Joshua 10:24</a>, where Joshua commands his commanders to put their feet on the necks of the captured kings, symbolizing God's deliverance and the Israelites' triumph. In a messianic context, this foreshadows Christ's ultimate victory over all His enemies, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>, where it is stated that He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet. This victory is not just physical but spiritual, indicating the comprehensive nature of Christ's reign and the assurance of His ultimate triumph.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David is expressing his gratitude and praise to God for delivering him from his enemies.
