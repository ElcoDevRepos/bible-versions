The concept of "straying" from God's statutes is a recurring theme in the Bible, highlighting the importance of obedience to God's law. In the Old Testament, Israel's history is marked by periods of faithfulness and rebellion, with consequences for turning away from God's commands. The rejection of those who stray underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where God desires a covenant relationship with His people, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on obedience or disobedience to God's law.<p><b>for their deceitfulness is in vain</b><br>The deceitfulness mentioned here refers to the futility of trying to deceive God or live in hypocrisy. Throughout Scripture, God is portrayed as omniscient, knowing the hearts and minds of all people. In the New Testament, Jesus often confronted the Pharisees for their outward religiosity that masked inner corruption (Matthew 23). The phrase "in vain" indicates that any attempt to live contrary to God's truth is ultimately fruitless and leads to judgment. This echoes the wisdom literature, such as <a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>, which warns that there is a way that seems right to a person, but its end is the way of death. The call is to live in genuine faith and obedience, recognizing that God values truth in the inward being (<a href="/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who expresses a deep love and reverence for God's law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in the Psalm, whose statutes and judgments are the focus of the psalmist's devotion.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_stray.htm">Those who stray</a></b><br>Individuals who deviate from God's statutes, representing those who choose deceit over truth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_god's_statutes.htm">The Importance of God's Statutes</a></b><br>God's statutes are not just rules but a guide for righteous living.
