In biblical times, wheat was a staple food, symbolizing sustenance and prosperity. The "finest wheat" suggests not just basic provision but the best quality, indicating God's desire to give His people more than just the essentials. This echoes the blessings promised to Israel if they obeyed God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>. The imagery of God as a provider is consistent throughout Scripture, with Jesus later identifying Himself as the "bread of life" in <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>, offering spiritual nourishment that surpasses physical needs.<p><b>with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.&#8221;</b><br>Honey in ancient Israel was a symbol of delight and abundance, often associated with the Promised Land described as "a land flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). The mention of "honey from the rock" is particularly striking, as it suggests miraculous provision from unexpected places, much like water from the rock in <a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>. This imagery points to God's ability to provide for His people in seemingly impossible situations. The rock can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the cornerstone and source of spiritual sustenance. The satisfaction promised here is both physical and spiritual, aligning with the New Testament promise of abundant life in Christ (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His desire to provide abundantly for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The primary audience of the Psalm, representing God's chosen people who are being reminded of His provision and care.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The historical backdrop of Israel's journey where God provided for them miraculously, symbolized by "honey from the rock."<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wheat_and_honey.htm">Wheat and Honey</a></b><br>Symbols of God's provision and abundance, representing both physical sustenance and spiritual blessings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rock.htm">Rock</a></b><br>Often a symbol of strength and stability, here it also represents the miraculous provision of God, as seen in the wilderness wanderings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_abundant_provision.htm">God's Abundant Provision</a></b><br>God desires to provide not just the essentials but the finest and most satisfying blessings for His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_nourishment.htm">Spiritual Nourishment</a></b><br>Just as God provided physical sustenance, He offers spiritual nourishment through His Word and presence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>The imagery of honey from the rock suggests that God's provision may come from unexpected places and at unexpected times.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_blessing.htm">Obedience and Blessing</a></b><br>The context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/81.htm">Psalm 81</a> emphasizes that God's blessings are often contingent upon the obedience and faithfulness of His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_the_ultimate_provision.htm">Christ as the Ultimate Provision</a></b><br>In the New Testament, Jesus fulfills the imagery of provision, offering Himself as the ultimate source of life and satisfaction.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_81_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 81:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Trust_God_to_satisfy_with_finest_wheat.htm">How can we trust God to "satisfy you with the finest of wheat"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_81_16_God_s_provision_revealed.htm">What does Psalm 81:16 reveal about God's provision for His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_81_16_and_Deut_32_13_link.htm">How does Psalm 81:16 connect with God's promises in Deuteronomy 32:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_do_we_feel_God_s_abundance_daily.htm">In what ways can we experience God's abundance in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Encourage_trust_in_God_s_provision_2.htm">How can we encourage others to rely on God's provision as in Psalm 81:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_honey_from_the_rock_2.htm">What does Psalm 81:16 mean by "honey from the rock"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_81_16_God_s_care_and_provision.htm">How does Psalm 81:16 reflect God's provision and care?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_81_16_historical_context.htm">What historical context surrounds Psalm 81:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_81.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 81?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_'honey_from_the_rock'_a_literal_miracle.htm">In Psalm 81:16, does the claim of satisfying Israel with &#8220;honey from the rock&#8221; suggest a literal miracle, and how do we address it scientifically?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_foods_are_mentioned_in_the_bible.htm">What foods are mentioned in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_deut._32_13's_'honey_from_rock'_credible.htm">How credible is Deuteronomy 32:13&#8217;s claim of extracting &#8220;honey from the rock&#8221; without any supporting archaeological or geological evidence?

The construction of this verse is matter of difficulty.

The expression, "honey out of the rock," is taken from <a href="/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>. It evidently means "honey of the best" - native honey, stored by the bees in clefts of the rocks. Of course, both the "wheat" and the "honey" are metaphors, which we are to regard as shadowing forth all temporal and spiritual blessings. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/81-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But I would feed you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1469;&#1463;&#1453;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1461;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7733;&#238;&#183;l&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
