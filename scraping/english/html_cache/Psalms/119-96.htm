In biblical context, the term "perfection" can refer to completeness or maturity, often associated with human endeavors or the created order. <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:14</a> echoes this sentiment, where Solomon observes the vanity and limitations of earthly pursuits. Historically, the ancient Near Eastern cultures, including Israel, valued wisdom and accomplishments, yet recognized their limitations compared to divine wisdom. This acknowledgment of human limitation sets the stage for the contrast with God's commandments.<p><b>but Your commandment is without limit</b><br>Here, the psalmist contrasts human limitations with the boundless nature of God's commandments. The term "commandment" refers to God's law, which is seen as perfect and eternal, as highlighted in <a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>. This reflects the belief that God's word is unchanging and applicable across all times and cultures, unlike human laws and achievements. Theologically, this points to the divine nature of Scripture, which is seen as a reflection of God's character&#8212;eternal, perfect, and infinite. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of Jesus Christ as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), embodying the limitless nature of God's truth and grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who expresses a deep love and reverence for God's law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_commandment.htm">God's Commandment</a></b><br>Refers to the divine laws and instructions given by God, which are central to the psalmist's meditation and life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/perfection.htm">Perfection</a></b><br>In this context, it refers to human or worldly perfection, which the psalmist finds to be limited and finite.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_limitations_of_human_perfection.htm">The Limitations of Human Perfection</a></b><br>Human achievements and standards, no matter how impressive, have their limits.

Keeping as close to the context as possible, the meaning will be: "To all perfection (or apparent perfection) a limit is visible, but the Divine Law is boundless alike in its scope and its requirements." This, translated into the language of modern ideas, merely says that the actual can never correspond with the ideal:<p>"Who keeps a spirit wholly true<p>To that ideal which he bears<span class= "ital">?"</span><p>But in the word <span class= "ital">end </span>in Hebrew, as in English, there is a limitation in time, as in space (see <a href="/job/26-10.htm" title="He has compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.">Job 26:10</a>; <a href="/job/28-3.htm" title="He sets an end to darkness, and searches out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.">Job 28:3</a>; comp. Symmachus, "I have seen the end of all settled things"), and the Prayer Book version may really give the psalmist's thought as indicating the difference between mere change and progress.<p>"The old order changeth, yielding place to new,<p>And God fulfils Himself in many ways,<p>Lest one good custom should corrupt the world."<p>TENNYSON: <span class= "ital">Morte d'Arthur.</span> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/119.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 96.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have seen an end of all perfection</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to all other perfection I have seen, and see, a limit; but there is no limit to the perfection of thy Law. <span class="cmt_word">Thy commandment is exceeding broad</span>.
