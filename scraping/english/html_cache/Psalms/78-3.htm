In ancient Israel, oral transmission was crucial due to limited literacy and the absence of widespread written texts. The Israelites were instructed to teach their children about God's works and commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>). This practice ensured that each generation understood their identity and covenant relationship with God. The phrase also highlights the importance of personal experience and communal knowledge in faith, as hearing and knowing imply both receiving and internalizing the message.<p><b>and our fathers have relayed to us</b><br>This part underscores the role of the patriarchs and ancestors in preserving and transmitting the faith. The "fathers" refers to previous generations who witnessed God's acts, such as the Exodus and the giving of the Law at Sinai. This transmission of faith is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where the faithfulness of God is recounted through stories and testimonies (<a href="/exodus/12-26.htm">Exodus 12:26-27</a>). The patriarchal tradition is foundational, as seen in the genealogies and narratives of Genesis, which establish a lineage of faith leading to the coming of Christ. This phrase also connects to the New Testament, where the apostles and early church fathers continued this tradition of teaching and preserving the gospel message (<a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>, Asaph was a Levite and one of the chief musicians appointed by King David.
