Historically, this can be connected to periods of Israel's exile or defeat, such as the Babylonian captivity, where the Israelites were taken from their land and subjected to foreign rule. Theologically, it raises questions about divine justice and the reasons behind God's actions, echoing sentiments found in other lament psalms like <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>. The idea of being "sold" without profit suggests a perceived lack of value or worth, which contrasts with the covenantal promises where God treasures His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>).<p><b>no profit do You gain from their sale.</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the futility and loss experienced by the people, as well as the seeming lack of divine purpose in their suffering. In the ancient Near Eastern context, selling people or goods typically involved a transaction that benefited the seller. Here, the psalmist is perplexed by the absence of any gain for God, which could be interpreted as a rhetorical device to express the depth of their despair. This sentiment is echoed in the prophetic literature, where God often allows His people to face consequences for their disobedience, yet always with an ultimate purpose of redemption and restoration (<a href="/isaiah/52-3.htm">Isaiah 52:3</a>). Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who was "sold" for thirty pieces of silver (<a href="/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a>), yet through His sacrifice, brought about the ultimate redemption and reconciliation of humanity with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_korah.htm">The Sons of Korah</a></b><br>The authors of <a href="/bsb/psalms/44.htm">Psalm 44</a>, a group of Levitical singers and musicians who served in the temple.

God&#8217;s sovereignty means nothing happens outside His purposeful governance (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your people</b><p>The phrase highlights covenant relationship.<p>&#8226; &#8220;The LORD has chosen Jacob for Himself, Israel as His treasured possession&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/135-4.htm">Psalm 135:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet covenant privilege brings responsibility; disobedience invites corrective measures (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15&#8211;68</a>).<p>&#8226; The psalmists wrestle with the tension: we are Yours&#8212;how can this be happening?

God receives no earthly gain; the transaction exposes Israel&#8217;s sin and God&#8217;s justice.<p>&#8226; The phrase also magnifies grace: because no price was extracted, no price bars redemption; God remains free to restore.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>no profit do You gain</b><p>The psalmists stress that God Himself appears to receive no advantage from their suffering.<p>&#8226; From a human viewpoint, defeat seems pointless, yet divine purpose often lies beyond sight (<a href="/job/42-3.htm">Job 42:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;lack of profit&#8221; intensifies the plea for mercy: if discipline has achieved its end, Lord, bring deliverance (<a href="/psalms/79-9.htm">Psalm 79:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from their sale</b><p>The closing words revisit the image of being sold, reminding listeners of slavery and exile.<p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s story shows God working through a literal sale to preserve many lives (<a href="/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>; 45:5).<p>&#8226; In exile, Israel will later learn that God&#8217;s covenant love endures; He will &#8220;bring them back&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The psalm points forward to ultimate redemption, fulfilled in Christ who &#8220;gave Himself as a ransom for all&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/44-12.htm">Psalm 44:12</a> confronts us with the paradox of a righteous, loving God who at times disciplines His own people so severely it feels like a sale for nothing. Yet His sovereign authority, covenant commitment, and redemptive purpose run through every line. The verse invites trust that, even when no profit is visible, the Lord&#8217;s ultimate aim is restoration, not ruin, and that belonging to Him guarantees eventual redemption.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/44.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">For nought.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">for not riches </span>(comp. <a href="/jeremiah/15-13.htm" title="Your substance and your treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all your sins, even in all your borders.">Jeremiah 15:13</a>); notice the contrast to <a href="/psalms/72-14.htm" title="He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.">Psalm 72:14</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And dost not increase thy wealth by their price.</span>--This rendering takes the verb as in <a href="/proverbs/22-16.htm" title="He that oppresses the poor to increase his riches, and he that gives to the rich, shall surely come to want.">Proverbs 22:16</a>; but to make the two places exactly parallel, we should have "dost not increase <span class= "ital">for thee." </span>It is better, therefore, to make the clause synonymous with the last, and render <span class= "ital">thou didst not increase in </span>(<span class= "ital">the matter of</span>)<span class= "ital"> their price, i.e., </span>thou didst not set a high price on them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou sellest thy people for nought</span>; literally, <span class="accented">for not-wealth</span> (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/15-13.htm">Jeremiah 15:13</a>).
