In ancient Israelite culture, children were considered a sign of God's favor and a source of strength and security for the family. A full quiver symbolizes readiness and protection, as arrows were essential for defense and hunting. The imagery of a quiver full of arrows suggests preparedness and the ability to face challenges. This concept is echoed in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, where God commands humanity to "be fruitful and multiply." The blessing of children is also seen in the lives of patriarchs like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, whose descendants became the nation of Israel. <p><b>He will not be put to shame</b><br>In biblical times, honor and shame were significant social values. A man with many children would not face shame because his family would provide support and defense. This assurance of not being put to shame is a promise of social stability and respect within the community. The idea of avoiding shame is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/romans/10-11.htm">Romans 10:11</a>, which states that those who believe in Christ will not be put to shame. This reflects the ultimate security found in God's promises.<p><b>when he confronts the enemies at the gate.</b><br>The "gate" was a critical location in ancient cities, serving as the place for legal matters, business transactions, and defense against enemies. Confronting enemies at the gate implies a situation of potential conflict or legal dispute. A man with a large family would have the advantage of support and strength in such confrontations. This imagery can be connected to the protection and advocacy that Christ provides for believers, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>, which assures that if God is for us, no one can stand against us. The gate also symbolizes the place of judgment, where Christ, as the ultimate defender, stands for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blessed_man.htm">The Blessed Man</a></b><br>Represents a person who is favored by God, particularly one who has a large family or many children.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_quiver.htm">The Quiver</a></b><br>A metaphor for a family, specifically children, symbolizing strength and protection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gate.htm">The Gate</a></b><br>In ancient times, the city gate was a place of legal and social transactions, where disputes were settled and justice was administered.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>Those who oppose or bring challenges to the blessed man, possibly in legal or social contexts.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Solomon, this psalm reflects wisdom literature themes, emphasizing the value of family and divine blessing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_blessing_of_children.htm">The Blessing of Children</a></b><br>Children are a heritage from the Lord and a source of joy and strength for families.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/family_as_a_defense.htm">Family as a Defense</a></b><br>A strong family unit provides support and protection against life's challenges, much like a quiver full of arrows.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/engagement_in_community.htm">Engagement in Community</a></b><br>Being active in community and legal matters, as symbolized by the gate, is important for upholding justice and righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/raising_godly_offspring.htm">Raising Godly Offspring</a></b><br>Parents are called to nurture their children in faith, preparing them to face the world with confidence and integrity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>Trusting in God's provision and blessing, rather than solely in human effort, is crucial for a fulfilling life.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_127_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 127:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_127_5_Value_children_as_blessings.htm">How does Psalm 127:5 encourage valuing children as a blessing from God?

Here the blessing is not tied to wealth, status, or accomplishment but to receiving and valuing what God calls a gift (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>). The verse assures that the person who embraces God&#8217;s design for family life experiences His tangible goodness, much like Job after restoration (<a href="/job/42-12.htm">Job 42:12</a>) and the righteous household described in <a href="/proverbs/20-7.htm">Proverbs 20:7</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whose quiver is full of them</b><p>The &#8220;them&#8221; points back to the &#8220;children&#8221; of verse 4, pictured as arrows in a warrior&#8217;s quiver&#8212;ready, useful, and purpose-driven. A full quiver indicates abundance, not burden. God told Adam and Eve, &#8220;Be fruitful and multiply&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>); He reaffirmed that promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>) and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>). Large or small, a family intentionally received from the Lord reflects divine blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-13.htm">Deuteronomy 7:13-14</a>; <a href="/proverbs/17-6.htm">Proverbs 17:6</a>). Like well-made arrows, children shaped by loving discipline and godly instruction (<a href="/ephesians/6-4.htm">Ephesians 6:4</a>) extend a parent&#8217;s influence far beyond personal reach.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will not be put to shame</b><p>Shame in biblical culture involves public disgrace and the loss of honor. The father with a &#8220;full quiver&#8221; enjoys the opposite&#8212;a sense of vindication and dignity. Isaiah promises, &#8220;You will forget the shame of your youth&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/54-4.htm">Isaiah 54:4</a>), and Paul notes that hope &#8220;does not disappoint&#8221; or shame us (<a href="/romans/5-5.htm">Romans 5:5</a>). Children who grow into responsible, faithful adults become living evidence of God&#8217;s blessing, silencing critics and removing reproach (<a href="/proverbs/31-28.htm">Proverbs 31:28-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when he confronts the enemies at the gate</b><p>Ancient city gates served as law courts, business centers, and military choke points (<a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/18-24.htm">2 Samuel 18:24</a>). To meet an enemy &#8220;at the gate&#8221; means facing accusations, legal disputes, or hostile forces where verdicts are rendered. A father standing there with mature sons and daughters at his side enjoys immediate strength and credible witnesses (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-19.htm">Deuteronomy 21:19</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>). The scene anticipates victory: &#8220;The LORD will cause your enemies who rise against you to be defeated before you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>). United, the family presents a formidable defense that upholds righteousness and honors God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/127-5.htm">Psalm 127:5</a> declares that a man who gratefully receives children from the Lord and invests in their godly formation experiences profound blessing. His household becomes a source of strength and honor so that, in life&#8217;s public arenas and conflicts, he stands confident and unashamed. In God&#8217;s design, thriving families extend His testimony across generations, turning potential battles at the gate into platforms for victory and praise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/127.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">They.</span>--Not the <span class= "ital">sons. </span>There is here one of the sudden changes of number in which Hebrew poetry abounds. (See especially <a href="/psalms/107-43.htm" title="Whoever is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the loving kindness of the LORD.">Psalm 107:43</a>.) Parents who have large families of sons are evidently intended. From the figure of the warrior and the arrows we should expect here, too, a martial image. They shall not be discomfited, but they shall challenge their enemies in the gates. In illustration may be quoted:<p>"Therefore men pray to have around their hearth,<p>Obedient offspring, to requite their foes<p>With harm, and honour whom their father loves;<p>But he whose issue is unprofitable,<p>Begets what else but sorrow to himself,<p>And store of laughter to his enemies?"<p><span class= "ital">SOPH.: Antig., </span>641<p>On the other hand, it is the habit of Hebrew poetry to accumulate metaphors, and the <span class= "ital">gate </span>is so commonly spoken of as the place of public resort, where legal cases were decided (<a href="/isaiah/29-21.htm" title="That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproves in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nothing.">Isaiah 29:21</a>; <a href="/amos/5-12.htm" title="For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.">Amos 5:12</a>, &c), that it is quite as likely that the allusion here is to the support which a man's just cause would receive when evidently backed up by a long retinue of stalwart sons. This view certainly receives support from <a href="/job/5-4.htm" title="His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.">Job 5:4</a>, where we have the very opposite picture of a tyrant's sons, not only unable to support their father, but themselves "crushed in the gate;" and the phrase "speak with their enemies" in this same verse may be illustrated from <a href="/joshua/20-4.htm" title="And when he that does flee to one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city to them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.">Joshua 20:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/12-1.htm" title="Righteous are you, O LORD, when I plead with you: yet let me talk with you of your judgments: Why does the way of the wicked prosper? why are all they happy that deal very treacherously?">Jeremiah 12:1</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/127.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them</span>.

"The gate" was the place where judgment was given, and where consequently adversaries were apt to meet, as they pushed their respective causes.
