In biblical context, stumbling often symbolizes failure or downfall (<a href="/psalms/27-2.htm">Psalm 27:2</a>, <a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14-15</a>). The imagery of stumbling is used throughout Scripture to depict the consequences of sin and rebellion against God. Historically, this reflects the belief that God actively protects the righteous by causing the plans of the wicked to fail. Theologically, it underscores the sovereignty of God in ensuring justice.<p><b>Their own tongues turned against them</b><br>This phrase indicates that the words or schemes of the wicked will backfire. Biblically, the tongue is a powerful tool that can be used for both good and evil (<a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-6</a>). The idea of one's own words being used against them is seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/12-13.htm">Proverbs 12:13</a> and <a href="/matthew/12-37.htm">Matthew 12:37</a>, where words are shown to have the power to justify or condemn. This reflects a divine justice where the wicked are ensnared by their own deceitful speech, highlighting the moral order established by God.<p><b>All who see will shake their heads</b><br>This phrase suggests a public recognition of the downfall of the wicked. In cultural context, shaking one's head can be a gesture of scorn, disbelief, or derision (<a href="/job/16-4.htm">Job 16:4</a>, <a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a>). It indicates that the downfall of the wicked serves as a warning and a lesson to others. This public acknowledgment of divine justice reinforces the biblical theme that God&#8217;s righteousness will ultimately be recognized by all, as seen in <a href="/psalms/52-6.htm">Psalm 52:6-7</a>. The shaking of heads can also be seen as a fulfillment of prophetic warnings against those who oppose God&#8217;s will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/64.htm">Psalm 64</a>, David is expressing his trust in God to protect him from his enemies and to bring justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_david.htm">Enemies of David</a></b><br>These are the individuals or groups who plot against David, using their words as weapons to harm him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and protector, who turns the schemes of the wicked back upon themselves.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/witnesses.htm">Witnesses</a></b><br>Those who observe the downfall of the wicked and respond with astonishment and acknowledgment of God's justice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The broader community that would have been familiar with David's struggles and the themes of divine justice and protection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_words.htm">The Power of Words</a></b><br>Words have the power to build up or destroy.
