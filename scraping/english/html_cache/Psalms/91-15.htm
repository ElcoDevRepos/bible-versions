Throughout the Bible, calling out to God is a recurring theme, seen in the lives of figures like David, Daniel, and Elijah. It reflects a relationship where the believer actively seeks God's presence and intervention. The act of calling out signifies faith and dependence on God, acknowledging His sovereignty and willingness to listen. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, calling upon the name of the Lord was a common practice during times of distress, as seen in Psalms and the prophetic books.<p><b>I will answer him</b><br>God's promise to answer is a reassurance of His attentiveness and responsiveness to the prayers of the faithful. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where He commits to being their protector and guide. The assurance of an answer is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a>, where God invites His people to call upon Him with the promise of revealing great and unsearchable things. This promise is not just about receiving what is asked for but about God&#8217;s presence and wisdom being imparted.<p><b>I will be with him in trouble</b><br>This phrase highlights God's promise of presence during difficult times. It is reminiscent of God's assurance to Joshua in <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>, where He promises to be with him wherever he goes. The presence of God in times of trouble is a central theme in the Bible, providing comfort and strength to believers. Historically, this reflects the understanding that God is not distant but actively involved in the lives of His people, offering support and guidance through trials.<p><b>I will deliver him</b><br>Deliverance is a key theme in the Bible, often associated with salvation and rescue from danger or oppression. This promise of deliverance can be seen in the Exodus narrative, where God delivers the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. It also points to the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who delivers believers from sin and death. The concept of deliverance is both physical and spiritual, encompassing God's intervention in various aspects of life.<p><b>and honor him</b><br>The promise of honor signifies God's recognition and reward for faithfulness. In biblical times, honor was a significant aspect of social and religious life, often associated with reputation, respect, and divine favor. This promise can be connected to the Beatitudes in <a href="/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5</a>, where Jesus speaks of the blessings and honor bestowed upon those who are faithful and righteous. It reflects the biblical principle that God exalts the humble and honors those who trust in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_psalmist.htm">The Psalmist</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed to Moses or David, the psalmist is the one who conveys the message of God's protection and faithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God promises to respond, be present, deliver, and honor those who call upon Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_believer.htm">The Believer</a></b><br>The individual who calls out to God, seeking His presence and intervention in times of trouble.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer.htm">The Power of Prayer</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of calling out to God in prayer, trusting in His promise to answer.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_in_trouble.htm">God's Presence in Trouble</a></b><br>Highlight the assurance that God is with us in our trials, providing comfort and strength.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/deliverance_and_honor.htm">Deliverance and Honor</a></b><br>Discuss how God not only delivers us from trouble but also honors us, reflecting His love and faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_of_god.htm">Faithfulness of God</a></b><br>Reinforce the reliability of God's promises, encouraging believers to trust in His word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_relationship_with_god.htm">Active Relationship with God</a></b><br>Encourage believers to maintain an active and personal relationship with God, regularly seeking Him in prayer and worship.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_91_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 91:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_invoke_God_in_troubled_times.htm">How can we call upon God in times of trouble, as Psalm 91:15 suggests?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_God_being_with_him_in_trouble.htm">What does it mean for God to be "with him in trouble"?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Psalm_91_15_to_Deut_31_6_promises.htm">How does Psalm 91:15 connect with God's promises in Deuteronomy 31:6?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Psalm_91_15_show_God_s_deliverance.htm">In what ways can we experience God's deliverance today, according to Psalm 91:15?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Ways_to_honor_God_for_deliverance.htm">How can we honor God for His deliverance, as mentioned in Psalm 91:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_91_15_God_s_promise_of_protection.htm">How does Psalm 91:15 reflect God's promise of deliverance and protection?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Psalm_91_15_s_writing.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Psalm 91:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_91_15_vs_modern_divine_views.htm">How does Psalm 91:15 challenge modern views on divine intervention?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_psalm_91.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Psalm 91?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_can_prayer_be_made_more_effective.htm">How can prayer be made more effective?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_public_prayer_acceptable.htm">Is public prayer acceptable?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/can_prayers_be_answered_by_god.htm">Can prayers be answered by God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what's_the_'valley_of_death'.htm">What is the "valley of the shadow of death"?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Psalm 91:15 Mean</div><b>When he calls out to Me</b><p>&#8226; The verse assumes a living, verbal relationship between the believer and the LORD.
