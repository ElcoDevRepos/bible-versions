The goodness of the LORD is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, highlighting His nature as inherently good (<a href="/psalms/100-5.htm">Psalm 100:5</a>). This goodness is not limited to a select group but extends to all creation, reflecting the idea of common grace. In the context of the ancient Near East, where gods were often seen as capricious and favoring certain people, this statement is radical. It aligns with the New Testament teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>, where God causes the sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust. This universal goodness is a reflection of God's character and His desire for all to come to repentance (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><b>His compassion rests on all He has made.</b><br>The compassion of God is a central theme in Scripture, often linked with His mercy and love. The Hebrew word for compassion here can also be translated as "tender mercies," indicating a deep, parental care. This compassion is not passive but active, as seen in God's interactions with humanity throughout history. The phrase "all He has made" underscores the inclusivity of God's care, extending to every part of creation. This is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus demonstrates compassion through His healing and teaching (<a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>). Theologically, this compassion is a type of Christ, who embodies God's mercy and love through His life, death, and resurrection. The idea that God's compassion "rests" suggests a continual, abiding presence, offering comfort and hope to believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and faithfulness to His promises.
