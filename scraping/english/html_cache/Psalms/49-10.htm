In biblical context, wisdom is highly valued (<a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>), yet it does not grant immortality. The inevitability of death is a theme throughout Scripture, reminding believers of the transient nature of earthly life (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:2</a>). This serves as a humbling reminder that human wisdom, while beneficial, cannot alter the divine order established by God.<p><b>and the foolish and the senseless both perish</b><br>The inclusion of the foolish and senseless highlights the impartiality of death. In biblical terms, foolishness often refers to a lack of moral and spiritual insight (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). The senseless are those who live without understanding or regard for God&#8217;s laws. This phrase underscores the biblical teaching that all humanity, regardless of their wisdom or folly, faces the same end (<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:2-3</a>). It serves as a call to seek true wisdom, which begins with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p><b>and leave their wealth to others</b><br>This part of the verse reflects the futility of amassing earthly riches, as they cannot be taken beyond the grave. The Bible frequently warns against placing trust in wealth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). The historical context of ancient Israel, where wealth was often seen as a sign of God&#8217;s blessing, adds depth to this warning. The transfer of wealth after death is a common theme, illustrating the temporary nature of material possessions (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:18-19</a>). This serves as a reminder to store up treasures in heaven, where they are eternal.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wise_men.htm">Wise Men</a></b><br>Individuals who are considered knowledgeable and prudent in their actions and decisions.

No one needs special revelation to see it; daily life supplies the evidence. <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:2</a> underscores this same obvious truth&#8212;&#8220;death is the destiny of every man.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By opening with &#8220;clear,&#8221; Scripture confirms that God&#8217;s Word aligns with what honest observation shows, removing any illusion that faith and reality are at odds (<a href="/romans/1-19.htm">Romans 1:19&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that wise men die</b><p>&#8226; Wisdom is precious (<a href="/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13&#8211;18</a>), yet it does not grant immunity from the grave.

In light of this, <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a> calls believers to humility&#8212;&#8220;You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Therefore, biblical wisdom moves beyond earthly achievements and seeks the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), the only foundation that endures past death.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the foolish and the senseless both perish</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Foolish and senseless&#8221; describe those who dismiss God&#8217;s counsel (<a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>).
