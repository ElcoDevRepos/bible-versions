In the context of <a href="/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, David is encouraging believers to turn their focus and trust towards God. This act of looking to God is an expression of faith and reliance on His guidance and provision. Biblically, looking to God is often associated with seeking His presence and favor, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/45-22.htm">Isaiah 45:22</a>, "Turn to Me and be saved, all the ends of the earth." This reflects a call to repentance and trust in God's salvation.<p><b>are radiant with joy</b><br>The imagery of radiance suggests a transformation that occurs when one is in the presence of God. This transformation is not just internal but visible to others, as seen in the story of Moses, whose face shone after speaking with God (<a href="/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-35</a>). The joy mentioned here is a deep, abiding joy that comes from a relationship with God, transcending circumstances. This joy is a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>) and is often linked with the peace and assurance found in God's presence.<p><b>their faces shall never be ashamed</b><br>Shame in biblical terms often relates to dishonor or disgrace. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, honor and shame were significant social values. To have one's face "never be ashamed" implies a state of vindication and honor. This assurance is rooted in the faithfulness of God, who does not disappoint those who trust in Him. <a href="/romans/10-11.htm">Romans 10:11</a> echoes this promise, "Anyone who believes in Him will never be put to shame." This phrase also points to the ultimate redemption and justification found in Christ, who bore our shame on the cross, ensuring that believers stand unashamed before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, who wrote this psalm after pretending to be insane before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he left. This context is crucial for understanding the depth of trust and deliverance expressed in the psalm.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>A Philistine king before whom David feigned madness to escape. This event is a backdrop to the psalm, highlighting God's deliverance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure to whom the psalmist looks for deliverance and joy.
