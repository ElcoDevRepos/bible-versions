The word "established" suggests a firm and unchanging order, reflecting the biblical theme of God's unchanging nature (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>). The repetition of "forever and ever" underscores the permanence of God's creation, aligning with the idea that God's word and decrees are eternal (<a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>). This can be seen in the context of the creation narrative in Genesis, where God sets the celestial bodies in place (<a href="/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14-18</a>). The phrase also connects to the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of the enduring nature of His words (<a href="/matthew/24-35.htm">Matthew 24:35</a>).<p><b>He issued a decree that will never pass away.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the concept of divine law and order. In biblical times, a decree from a king was irrevocable, as seen in the story of Esther (<a href="/esther/8-8.htm">Esther 8:8</a>). Similarly, God's decrees are unchangeable and eternal. This reflects the biblical understanding of God's covenant faithfulness, as seen in His promises to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>) and David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). The phrase also points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's decrees in Christ, who is described as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>) and whose kingdom will have no end (<a href="/luke/1-33.htm">Luke 1:33</a>). The eternal nature of God's decree assures believers of the reliability and faithfulness of God's promises throughout scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The Creator and Sustainer of all things, who establishes and decrees the order of creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_bodies.htm">Heavenly Bodies</a></b><br>Though not explicitly mentioned in this verse, the context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/148.htm">Psalm 148</a> includes the sun, moon, and stars, which God has established in their courses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The entirety of the created order, which is called to praise God and is sustained by His eternal decree.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God&#8217;s establishment of creation reflects His absolute sovereignty.

Just as <a href="/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14&#8211;18</a> sets lights in the expanse &#8220;to govern the day and the night,&#8221; so here the psalmist celebrates that permanence.<p>&#8226; <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a> echoes the thought: &#8220;all things were created through Him and for Him&#8230; in Him all things hold together.&#8221; Creation is not self-sustaining; it is upheld by the Lord&#8217;s ongoing will.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/119-90.htm">Psalm 119:90</a> explains the stability: &#8220;Your faithfulness continues through all generations; You established the earth, and it stands.&#8221;<p>Because God Himself has anchored the universe, believers can trust His steadiness in every realm of life&#8212;physical, moral, and spiritual.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He issued a decree that will never pass away</b><p>The second line deepens the first: what God founded He also legally secures.

This anticipates, but only in form, the modern scientific doctrine of the inviolability of natural order. It is the imperishable faithfulness of God that renders the law invariable. See the remarkable passages, <a href="/jeremiah/31-36.htm" title="If those ordinances depart from before me, said the LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.">Jeremiah 31:36</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-20.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; If you can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;">Jeremiah 33:20</a>, from winch we conclude that a covenant was supposed to have been made between God and nature as between Jehovah and Israel, the one being as imperishable as the other. A comparison of the two passages referred to shows that the Hebrew words <span class= "ital">ordinance </span>and <span class= "ital">covenant </span>might be used synonymously. The Authorised Version, which, following the LXX. and Vulg., makes the ordinance itself imperishable, violates the usage of the Hebrew verb.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/148.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath also established them forever and ever</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/89-37.htm">Psalm 89:37</a>).
