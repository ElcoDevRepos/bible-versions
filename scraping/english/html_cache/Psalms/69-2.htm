In biblical times, miry clay was often associated with danger and difficulty, as it was easy to become stuck and unable to escape. This imagery is used elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>, where the prophet Jeremiah is cast into a cistern filled with mud. The miry depths can also symbolize the overwhelming nature of sin and the human condition, reflecting the psalmist's deep distress and need for divine intervention. This phrase can be seen as a type of Christ's suffering, as He bore the weight of humanity's sin and experienced profound anguish.<p><b>where there is no footing</b><br>The lack of footing suggests instability and insecurity, emphasizing the psalmist's precarious situation. In ancient Near Eastern culture, solid ground was a metaphor for safety and security, while the absence of footing indicated vulnerability and danger. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/matthew/7-26.htm">Matthew 7:26-27</a>, where Jesus speaks of the foolish man who builds his house on sand, leading to its collapse. The psalmist's cry for help reflects the human need for a firm foundation, ultimately found in God alone. This can also be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's reliance on the Father during His earthly ministry.<p><b>I have drifted into deep waters</b><br>Drifting into deep waters conveys a sense of being carried away by forces beyond one's control, highlighting the psalmist's feeling of being overwhelmed. In biblical literature, deep waters often symbolize chaos and danger, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, where the Spirit of God hovers over the waters before creation. The deep waters can also represent trials and tribulations, as in <a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>, where God promises to be with His people through the waters. This phrase can be connected to Jesus calming the storm in <a href="/mark/4-35.htm">Mark 4:35-41</a>, demonstrating His authority over the chaotic forces of nature and His ability to bring peace to troubled hearts.<p><b>where the flood engulfs me</b><br>The flood is a powerful image of overwhelming circumstances, reminiscent of the great flood in <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6-9</a>, which represents God's judgment and the destructive power of sin. In the psalmist's context, the flood signifies the intensity of his suffering and the feeling of being consumed by adversity. This imagery is also present in <a href="/jonah/2-3.htm">Jonah 2:3</a>, where Jonah describes being engulfed by the waters during his time in the belly of the fish. The flood can be seen as a type of Christ's experience on the cross, where He was engulfed by the weight of sin and separation from the Father. Ultimately, the psalmist's plea for deliverance points to the hope of salvation and redemption through God's intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, David is expressing a deep sense of distress and seeking God's deliverance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/miry_depths.htm">Miry Depths</a></b><br>Symbolic of a place of despair and helplessness, where one feels trapped and unable to find stability.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/deep_waters.htm">Deep Waters</a></b><br>Represents overwhelming circumstances that threaten to engulf and overpower the individual.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/floods.htm">Floods</a></b><br>Often used in Scripture to symbolize chaos, danger, and overwhelming trials.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_deliverance.htm">God's Deliverance</a></b><br>The underlying hope and expectation that God will rescue the faithful from their dire situations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_our_helplessness.htm">Recognizing Our Helplessness</a></b><br>Acknowledge that there are times in life when we feel overwhelmed and unable to find our footing.

The language is personal and literal, drawing on the physical danger of a bog to describe overwhelming distress. Like Jeremiah&#8217;s experience in the cistern (<a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>), David feels physically pinned and spiritually trapped. <a href="/psalms/40-2.htm">Psalm 40:2</a> recalls a later deliverance &#8220;from the miry clay,&#8221; confirming that God truly rescues from such pits, not merely in metaphor. The Lord sees when His servant is immobilized and unable to escape by his own strength.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>where there is no footing</b><p>The absence of firm ground intensifies the crisis. <a href="/job/30-20.htm">Job 30:20&#8211;21</a> shows Job likewise crying out when God seems silent, standing where stability is gone. Without footing, progress halts; fear replaces confidence. <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a> answers this need, where God promises, &#8220;I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.&#8221; Scripture consistently affirms that the believer&#8217;s stability is not in circumstances but in the Lord who never slips.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have drifted into deep waters</b><p>The image shifts from mud to open water, multiplying the danger. Deep water in Scripture often represents chaos and threat (<a href="/genesis/7-17.htm">Genesis 7:17</a>; <a href="/jonah/2-3.htm">Jonah 2:3</a>). David is not wading at the shoreline; he is &#8220;in over his head.&#8221; Yet <a href="/psalms/77-19.htm">Psalm 77:19</a> reminds us that God&#8217;s path is through the sea, unseen but certain. The same God who parted the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21&#8211;22</a>) can guide His servant through the depths today.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>where the flood engulfs me</b><p>The flood signifies forces too powerful to resist. <a href="/psalms/32-6.htm">Psalm 32:6</a> warns of &#8220;rising floodwaters&#8221; that cannot reach the one who seeks refuge in God, implying that safety lies in timely dependence on Him. In <a href="/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a>, when the enemy comes like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD lifts a standard against him. David anticipates that intervention even while feeling overwhelmed. <a href="/revelation/12-15.htm">Revelation 12:15&#8211;16</a> shows God still shielding His people from the serpent&#8217;s flood, confirming His ongoing faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2</a> presents four escalating images&#8212;miry depths, lack of footing, deep waters, engulfing flood&#8212;to convey absolute helplessness. Scripture affirms these are not exaggerations but accurate depictions of trials believers truly face. Yet every cross reference shows God&#8217;s consistent pattern: He hears, He upholds, He parts waters, He stops floods. David&#8217;s cry invites us to trust the same Lord who literally rescues from pits and floods, turning desperate lament into confident hope.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/69.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing.</span> "Mire" and "clay" are metaphors for dangers and difficulties, which entangle a man and incapacitate him from exertion (comp. <a href="/psalms/40-2.htm">Psalm 40:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I am come into deep waters (</span>comp. ver. 15;
