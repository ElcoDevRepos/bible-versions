The term "yoked" implies a binding or joining, suggesting a deep level of commitment or entanglement. Baal of Peor was a local deity worshiped by the Moabites, and the Israelites' participation in this worship was a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This incident highlights the recurring theme of Israel's unfaithfulness and the temptation to adopt the religious practices of surrounding nations. The geographical location, Peor, is significant as it was near the plains of Moab, a region where the Israelites camped before entering the Promised Land. This event serves as a warning against spiritual compromise and the dangers of syncretism.<p><b>and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods</b><br>The act of eating sacrifices offered to idols was not merely a physical act but a spiritual one, signifying participation in pagan worship (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-18.htm">1 Corinthians 10:18-21</a>). The term "lifeless gods" underscores the futility and emptiness of idol worship, contrasting the living God of Israel with the powerless idols of the nations (<a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>). This phrase reflects the cultural and religious practices of the ancient Near East, where meals were often part of religious rituals. The Israelites' participation in these meals was a breach of their covenant with God, who had commanded them to worship Him alone (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13-15</a>). This incident foreshadows the New Testament teaching on idolatry and the call to worship God in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>). It also serves as a type of Christ, who is the true and living sacrifice, contrasting with the dead idols and pointing to the ultimate fulfillment of worship in Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/baal_of_peor.htm">Baal of Peor</a></b><br>A Canaanite deity associated with fertility and worshiped by the Moabites.
