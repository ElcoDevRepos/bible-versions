Historically, this can be linked to the Babylonian exile, where the Israelites were taken from their homeland and subjected to foreign rule. The groans symbolize a cry for divine intervention and mercy, echoing the cries of the Israelites in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-25</a>). Theologically, it underscores the belief that God hears the cries of the oppressed and is moved to act on their behalf. This plea for God&#8217;s attention is a recurring theme in the Psalms, emphasizing the importance of prayer and supplication in times of distress.<p><b>by the strength of Your arm</b><br>The "strength of Your arm" is a metaphor for God's power and might. In biblical literature, God's arm is often associated with deliverance and salvation, as seen in the Exodus narrative where God&#8217;s mighty arm led the Israelites out of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). This imagery conveys the idea that God is capable of intervening in human affairs with overwhelming force. It also points to the divine attribute of omnipotence, reassuring believers of God&#8217;s ability to rescue and protect His people.<p><b>preserve those condemned to death.</b><br>This phrase highlights a plea for preservation and deliverance from imminent death. In the historical context, this could refer to those facing execution or destruction at the hands of their captors. It resonates with the biblical theme of God as a deliverer, as seen in the story of Daniel in the lion's den (Daniel 6) and the preservation of the Jewish people in the book of Esther. Theologically, it can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ&#8217;s redemptive work, where through His death and resurrection, believers are preserved from eternal death. This plea for preservation is a testament to the hope and trust in God&#8217;s saving power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asaph.htm">Asaph</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/79.htm">Psalm 79</a>, Asaph was a prominent Levite singer and seer in David's court, known for his role in temple worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/captives.htm">Captives</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites who were taken into captivity, likely during the Babylonian exile.

Yet the line also captures the human condition under sin, since <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a> declares, &#8220;the wages of sin is death.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s preservation is more than delay; it is deliverance.

Historically spoken by a devastated nation, the verse still speaks to every believer who groans under bondage, persecution, or the sentence of sin. Because God literally hears, literally acts, and literally preserves, His people can rest assured that no chain, enemy, or grave will have the final word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/79.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Appointed to die.</span>--See margin.
