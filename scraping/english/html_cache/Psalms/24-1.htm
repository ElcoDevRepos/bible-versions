David's authorship connects this psalm to a period of Israel's history marked by the establishment of Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center. His life and reign are chronicled in the books of Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles, providing a backdrop of a leader who sought to honor God in governance and worship. David's psalms often reflect his personal experiences and his understanding of God's sovereignty and faithfulness.<p><b>The earth is the LORD&#8217;s,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's ownership and sovereignty over all creation. It reflects the biblical worldview that God is the Creator and Sustainer of the universe, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, where God creates the heavens and the earth. This declaration counters ancient Near Eastern beliefs that attributed creation to multiple deities, affirming monotheism and God's supreme authority. It also aligns with the covenantal language found in <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>, where God claims ownership over the earth and His people.<p><b>and the fullness thereof,</b><br>The term "fullness" refers to everything that the earth contains, including its resources, creatures, and inhabitants. This comprehensive view of God's dominion is echoed in passages like <a href="/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10-12</a>, where God declares His ownership of every beast and the cattle on a thousand hills. It underscores the idea that all creation is under God's care and control, providing a foundation for stewardship and accountability to God for how resources are used.<p><b>the world and all who dwell therein.</b><br>This phrase extends God's ownership to all people, regardless of nationality or status. It highlights the universality of God's reign, as seen in <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>, where Paul speaks of God making every nation from one man and determining their times and places. This universality is a precursor to the New Testament revelation of the gospel's reach to all nations, as seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). It also foreshadows the eschatological vision in <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>, where the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and sovereignty over all creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_earth.htm">The Earth</a></b><br>Refers to the physical world, the planet we inhabit, created by God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Encompasses the systems, cultures, and societies within the earth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/all_who_dwell_therein.htm">All Who Dwell Therein</a></b><br>Every living being, including humans and animals, that inhabit the earth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the ultimate authority over the earth and everything in it.
