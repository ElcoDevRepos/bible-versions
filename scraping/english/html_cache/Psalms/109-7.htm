In biblical times, trials were often held at the city gates, where elders and judges would hear cases. The psalmist is calling for a fair trial, but with the expectation of a guilty verdict. This reflects the imprecatory nature of the psalm, where the psalmist seeks divine justice against his enemies. The concept of divine justice is prevalent throughout the Old Testament, where God is seen as the ultimate judge (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>).<p><b>let him be found guilty</b><br>The desire for a guilty verdict underscores the psalmist's belief in the righteousness of his cause and the wickedness of his adversary. This reflects the biblical principle that God opposes the proud and wicked (<a href="/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a>). The psalmist's plea aligns with the broader biblical theme of justice, where the wicked are punished, and the righteous are vindicated. This also foreshadows the ultimate judgment that will be executed by Christ, who will judge the living and the dead (<a href="/2_timothy/4.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a>).<p><b>and may his prayer be regarded as sin</b><br>This phrase indicates a desire for the adversary's prayers to be ineffective, highlighting the severity of the psalmist's plea. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, prayer was a vital means of communication with God, and to have one's prayer regarded as sin was a severe judgment. This reflects the biblical theme that God does not hear the prayers of the wicked (<a href="/proverbs/15-29.htm">Proverbs 15:29</a>). Theologically, it underscores the importance of righteousness in approaching God, a theme echoed in the New Testament where believers are encouraged to pray in faith and righteousness (<a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/109.htm">Psalm 109</a>, David is expressing a deep cry for justice against his enemies. This psalm is often categorized as an imprecatory psalm, where the psalmist calls for God's judgment on his adversaries.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_david.htm">Enemies of David</a></b><br>The psalm speaks against those who have wronged David, possibly referring to specific individuals or groups who have betrayed or falsely accused him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The event of being "tried" and "found guilty" suggests a legal or divine judgment, where the psalmist seeks God's intervention against the wicked.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_imprecatory_psalms.htm">Understanding Imprecatory Psalms</a></b><br>These psalms reflect a deep desire for justice and can be seen as an honest expression of human emotion.

The meaning is, "may he go out of court a condemned man."<p><span class= "bld">Let his prayer become sin.</span>--If this clause stood by itself, the most natural way would be to give "prayer" and "sin" their usual sense, and see in it the horrible hope that the man's prayer to God for mercy would be reckoned as "sin." That such was the result of the performance of religious rites by a wicked man was, it is true, a thought familiar to the Hebrew. (See, in addition to the marginal reference, <a href="/proverbs/15-8.htm" title="The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight.">Proverbs 15:8</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-27.htm" title="The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind?">Proverbs 21:27</a>.)
