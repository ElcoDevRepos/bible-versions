In biblical times, pastoral life was central to the economy and sustenance of the people. The "clothed" pastures suggest a covering or abundance, indicating God's provision and care. This imagery is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1-2</a>, where the Lord is depicted as a shepherd who provides for His flock. The presence of flocks also symbolizes prosperity and peace, as seen in <a href="/job/42-12.htm">Job 42:12</a>, where Job's restored fortunes include numerous flocks.<p><b>and the valleys are decked with grain</b><br>Valleys in the ancient Near East were often fertile areas ideal for agriculture. The phrase "decked with grain" suggests a bountiful harvest, a sign of divine favor and blessing. This abundance is a fulfillment of God's promise to provide for His people, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-8.htm">Deuteronomy 28:8</a>, where obedience to God results in blessings on the land. The imagery of grain also points to sustenance and life, echoing the provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16) and foreshadowing Jesus as the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>They shout in triumph; indeed, they sing</b><br>The personification of the pastures and valleys as shouting and singing indicates a joyful response to God's blessings. This reflects the biblical theme of creation praising its Creator, as seen in <a href="/psalms/96-11.htm">Psalm 96:11-12</a>, where the heavens, earth, sea, and fields rejoice. The triumph and singing symbolize victory and celebration, often associated with God's deliverance and faithfulness. This joy is a foretaste of the ultimate redemption and restoration of creation, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/55-12.htm">Isaiah 55:12</a>, where the mountains and hills break forth into singing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pastures_of_the_wilderness.htm">Pastures of the Wilderness</a></b><br>This phrase refers to the uncultivated lands that are typically barren and desolate.

Earlier in the same psalm, David acknowledged, &#8220;You visit the earth and water it&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/65-9.htm">Psalm 65:9</a>). Livestock thrive only when the Lord first sends rain and grass.<p>&#8226; Similar scenes appear in <a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-2</a>, where the Good Shepherd &#8220;makes me lie down in green pastures,&#8221; and in <a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14</a>: &#8220;He makes the grass grow for the livestock.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Abundant flocks also signal covenant blessing (<a href="/ezekiel/34-13.htm">Ezekiel 34:13-15</a>; <a href="/job/5-24.htm">Job 5:24-25</a>). The verse celebrates God&#8217;s faithfulness to those promises.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the valleys are decked with grain</b><p>&#8226; The valleys&#8212;fertile, low-lying fields&#8212;are &#8220;decked,&#8221; literally dressed up, with ripened crops. Grain stands like ornaments across the landscape.<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s earlier actions in the psalm explain the scene: &#8220;You soften the ground with showers and bless its crops&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/65-10.htm">Psalm 65:10</a>).<p>&#8226; From <a href="/genesis/1-11.htm">Genesis 1:11-12</a> God ordained that the earth &#8220;sprout vegetation,&#8221; and He still upholds that order (<a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Passages such as <a href="/joel/2-24.htm">Joel 2:24</a> (&#8220;The threshing floors will be full of grain&#8221;) and <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a> (&#8220;your barns will be filled with plenty&#8221;) echo the same promise: obedient people experience tangible harvest.<p>&#8226; Together, pastures and valleys show completeness&#8212;high ground and low ground alike overflow, confirming that no corner of life lies outside the reach of God&#8217;s provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They shout in triumph; indeed, they sing</b><p>&#8226; David personifies creation. The livestock and grain become a choir, erupting in praise because their very existence declares God&#8217;s glory.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly speaks of nature praising its Creator:<p>&#8211; <a href="/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1-4</a>: &#8220;The heavens declare the glory of God.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/isaiah/55-12.htm">Isaiah 55:12</a>: &#8220;The mountains and the hills will burst into song before you.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/psalms/98-8.htm">Psalm 98:8</a>: &#8220;Let the rivers clap their hands.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus affirmed the idea in <a href="/luke/19-40.htm">Luke 19:40</a>: &#8220;If they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The triumphal shout reminds us that every harvest, paycheck, or answered prayer should prompt vocal gratitude from us as well. Creation leads the chorus; redeemed people gladly join in.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/65-13.htm">Psalm 65:13</a> paints a literal panorama of sheep-covered hills and grain-laden valleys, evidence that God faithfully waters the earth and feeds His creatures. The scene crescendos into universal praise, as even the pastures and crops &#8220;shout in triumph.&#8221; The verse invites us to recognize God&#8217;s abundant provision in every sphere of life and to lift our voices with creation, celebrating the Lord who satisfies the land and the soul alike.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/65.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - The pastures are clothed with flocks; or, <span class="accented">with their flocks; i.e.</span> the flocks befitting them. The valleys also are covered over with corn. The great open sweeps between the ranges of hills are completely covered over with grain crops, wheat, barley, millet; and the result is that they seem to shout for joy, they also sing.
