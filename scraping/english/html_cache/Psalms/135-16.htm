In the ancient Near Eastern context, idols were often crafted with human features to represent deities, yet they lacked the ability to communicate. This is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing the futility of idol worship (see <a href="/isaiah/44-13.htm">Isaiah 44:13-20</a>). The inability of idols to speak underscores their powerlessness and the foolishness of relying on them for guidance or revelation. In contrast, the God of Israel is a speaking God, as seen in His communication through the prophets and ultimately through Jesus Christ, the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>they have eyes, but cannot see;</b><br>This phrase further illustrates the lifelessness of idols. Despite being fashioned with eyes, they are blind and unable to perceive or respond to the needs of their worshippers. This imagery is used throughout the Bible to mock the senselessness of idol worship (see <a href="/psalms/115-5.htm">Psalm 115:5-7</a>). The true God, however, is all-seeing and all-knowing, aware of the plight of His people and responsive to their cries (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>). This contrast points to the superiority of the God of Israel over the false gods of the nations. In the New Testament, Jesus is portrayed as the one who gives sight to the blind, both physically and spiritually, fulfilling the prophetic vision of a God who truly sees and acts (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/135.htm">Psalm 135</a>, traditionally attributed to King David, who is expressing the futility of idol worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>The central focus of this verse, representing man-made objects of worship that are lifeless and powerless.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the Psalm is directed, reminding them of the living God in contrast to lifeless idols.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pagan_nations.htm">Pagan Nations</a></b><br>The surrounding cultures that worshipped idols, serving as a backdrop for the Psalmist's message.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_worship.htm">Temple Worship</a></b><br>The context in which this Psalm would have been sung, emphasizing the worship of the one true God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_idolatry.htm">The Futility of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idols, though crafted with human skill, are ultimately powerless and cannot fulfill the needs of the worshiper.

Only the living God answers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They have eyes, but cannot see</b><p>&#8226; The idols&#8217; carved eyes never open: &#8220;They have eyes, but cannot see.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, God&#8217;s seeing is a source of comfort and accountability:<p>&#8211; <a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>: &#8220;For the eyes of the LORD roam to and fro throughout the earth to show Himself strong.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>: &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>: &#8220;Nothing in all creation is hidden from God&#8217;s sight.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In contrast, idols completely lack awareness. They cannot notice injustice, offer guidance, or protect worshipers (<a href="/1_kings/18-26.htm">1 Kings 18:26-29</a>).<p>&#8226; The psalmist therefore unmasks the folly of depending on anything sightless. God alone sees our hidden motives (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>) and our secret hurts (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: When tempted to lean on lifeless substitutes&#8212;whether a job title, a political movement, or a digital persona&#8212;we remember they cannot truly &#8220;see&#8221; us. The Lord alone perceives every need and acts in perfect wisdom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/135-16.htm">Psalm 135:16</a> paints a vivid contrast: man-made idols possess carved mouths and eyes yet remain mute and blind, proving their utter powerlessness.
