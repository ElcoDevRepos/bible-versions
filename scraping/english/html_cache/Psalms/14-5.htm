In biblical context, this dread is often associated with the presence of God or the recognition of His judgment. The Hebrew word used here can imply terror or panic, suggesting a deep, unsettling fear. Historically, this reflects the common biblical theme where those who oppose God or His people experience fear when confronted with divine truth or justice. This dread is not just an emotional response but a recognition of their moral and spiritual state before a holy God.<p><b>for God is in the company of the righteous</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's presence and favor with those who are righteous. In the Old Testament, righteousness is often linked to covenant faithfulness and obedience to God's laws. Theologically, this presence signifies protection, guidance, and blessing. The righteous are those who live in accordance with God's will, and His presence among them assures their security and vindication. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/46-5.htm">Psalm 46:5</a>, where God's presence is a source of strength and stability. It also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of believers being the temple of the Holy Spirit, with God dwelling among His people through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fool.htm">The Fool</a></b><br>In the context of <a href="/bsb/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14</a>, the "fool" is someone who denies God and lives in moral corruption.
