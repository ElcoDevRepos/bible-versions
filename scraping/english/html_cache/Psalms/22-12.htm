In biblical times, bulls were symbols of strength and ferocity. The psalmist, traditionally understood to be David, uses this imagery to convey a sense of being overwhelmed by enemies. This can be seen as a metaphor for the adversaries that David faced throughout his life, including King Saul and various foreign nations. The imagery of being surrounded by bulls also foreshadows the intense opposition Jesus faced from religious leaders and Roman authorities during His crucifixion, as <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> is often viewed as a messianic prophecy.<p><b>strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.</b><br>Bashan was a region known for its fertile land and strong cattle, located east of the Jordan River. The reference to "strong bulls of Bashan" emphasizes the formidable nature of the adversaries. Historically, Bashan was a place of great prosperity and strength, often associated with powerful kings and armies. This phrase suggests not only the physical strength of the enemies but also their intimidating presence. In a prophetic sense, this can be seen as a type of the spiritual and physical forces that opposed Christ, highlighting the intensity of His suffering and the fulfillment of prophecy in His passion. The encircling of these "bulls" underscores the isolation and vulnerability experienced by both David and Jesus in their respective trials.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, David is expressing a deep sense of distress and persecution.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bulls_of_bashan.htm">Bulls of Bashan</a></b><br>Bashan was a region known for its fertile land and strong cattle.
