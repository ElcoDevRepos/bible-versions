The choice of Jacob over Esau is a central theme in <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a> and <a href="/romans/9-10.htm">Romans 9:10-13</a>, emphasizing God's sovereign will. Jacob's selection is not based on merit but on God's purpose and promise to Abraham. This choice signifies a covenant relationship, where God commits to be the God of Jacob's descendants. The name "Jacob" here symbolizes the patriarch and the entire nation of Israel, underscoring the continuity of God's promises through generations.<p><b>Israel as His treasured possession</b><br>The term "treasured possession" is a translation of the Hebrew word "segullah," which denotes a special, valued property. This concept is rooted in <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>, where God declares Israel to be His treasured possession among all peoples, provided they obey His covenant. This status is not just about privilege but also responsibility, as Israel is called to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. The idea of being a treasured possession is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6 and 14</a>:2, reinforcing Israel's unique role in God's redemptive plan. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of believers as God's chosen people, a royal priesthood, and a holy nation in <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, drawing a parallel between Israel's calling and the church's mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal, self-existent nature and His relationship with His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch whose name was changed to Israel.
