In biblical context, David often faced hostility from those who were envious or threatened by his anointed position. This sentiment is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus refers to this verse in <a href="/john/15-25.htm">John 15:25</a>, highlighting the fulfillment of this prophecy in His own life. Jesus, like David, was hated without cause, underscoring His role as the suffering servant.<p><b>outnumber the hairs of my head</b><br>This hyperbolic expression emphasizes the overwhelming number of adversaries faced by the psalmist. It conveys a sense of being surrounded and outnumbered, a common theme in David's life, particularly during his flight from Saul and later Absalom. The imagery of countless enemies serves to highlight the intensity of the psalmist's distress and reliance on God for deliverance.<p><b>many are those who would destroy me&#8212;my enemies for no reason</b><br>The repetition of the theme of baseless enmity underscores the psalmist's innocence and the unjust nature of the attacks. Historically, David faced numerous threats from those who sought his downfall, despite his loyalty to God and Israel. This also prefigures Christ's experience, as He faced opposition from religious leaders who sought to destroy Him despite His sinlessness and mission of salvation.<p><b>Though I did not steal, I must repay</b><br>This phrase suggests a situation where the psalmist is being held accountable for something he did not do, reflecting a miscarriage of justice. In David's life, this could relate to false accusations or misunderstandings. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who bore the sins of humanity and paid the debt of sin, though He Himself was without sin. This substitutionary atonement is central to Christian doctrine, illustrating the ultimate act of grace and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, David is expressing his distress and persecution by his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The unspecified adversaries who hate David without cause and seek to destroy him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate refuge and source of justice for David amidst his trials.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unjust_persecution.htm">Unjust Persecution</a></b><br>Believers may face hatred and persecution without cause, as David did.

The phrase paints a vivid picture of opposition so vast that it defies counting (<a href="/psalms/3-1.htm">Psalm 3:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Without cause&#8221; reminds us that sometimes righteousness itself invites hatred (<a href="/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>). David had not provoked these enemies; their rage was baseless.<p>&#8226; Jesus takes these exact words to His own lips: &#8220;They hated Me without reason&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-25.htm">John 15:25</a>). The Savior&#8217;s flawless life exposed sin, and the world answered with irrational hatred.<p>&#8226; This line encourages any believer who faces unmerited rejection. Just as God vindicated David (<a href="/2_samuel/22-1.htm">2 Samuel 22:1</a>), He remains faithful to vindicate all who trust Him (<a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>many are those who would destroy me&#8212;my enemies for no reason</b><p>&#8226; The hostility intensifies from hatred to active plots of destruction (<a href="/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a>). David is not exaggerating; Saul&#8217;s army once pursued him with murderous intent (<a href="/1_samuel/24-11.htm">1 Samuel 24:11</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;For no reason&#8221; underscores the injustice. God&#8217;s anointed king is treated like a criminal, yet he has broken no law, a pattern later fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/luke/23-41.htm">Luke 23:41</a>).<p>&#8226; This verse also foreshadows the Messiah&#8217;s experience: mobs cried for Jesus&#8217; crucifixion though Pilate found &#8220;no grounds for death&#8221; (<a href="/luke/23-22.htm">Luke 23:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: believers can expect unfair opposition (<a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>), but our refuge is the same LORD who shielded David (<a href="/psalms/62-7.htm">Psalm 62:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Though I did not steal, I must repay</b><p>&#8226; David feels compelled to &#8220;repay&#8221; wrongs he never committed. In ancient culture, restitution law required thieves to restore multiple times what was taken (<a href="/exodus/22-1.htm">Exodus 22:1</a>). David is being forced to act as if guilty when he is innocent.<p>&#8226; This anticipates the ultimate Substitute: Jesus repaid a debt He never owed. &#8220;The LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>), and He &#8220;canceled the record of debt&#8230; by nailing it to the cross&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse points to the gospel&#8217;s heart: the innocent bearing consequences for the guilty so the guilty can be declared innocent (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p>&#8226; For us, it offers comfort: God sees every false charge. He will one day set every record straight (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a> captures David&#8217;s real-life experience of baseless hatred, relentless foes, and undeserved obligations. Taken literally, it testifies to God&#8217;s servant suffering injustice while remaining innocent. Prophetically, it reaches its fullest meaning in Jesus, whose perfect life drew irrational hostility, whose enemies sought His destruction, and who repaid a debt He never incurred so we could be free. The verse therefore strengthens believers to endure unfair opposition, knowing our righteous God will vindicate His people and has already secured ultimate justice through Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/69.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">They that would destroy me . . .</span>--Properly, <span class= "ital">my exterminators. </span>It seems a piece of hypercriticism to object to this as too strong a word.
