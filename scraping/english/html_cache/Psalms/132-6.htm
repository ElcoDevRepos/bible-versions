This area is significant in biblical history as the birthplace of King David and later, Jesus Christ. The ark of the covenant, representing God's presence, was central to Israel's worship and identity. The phrase suggests a time when the ark was not in its rightful place in the tabernacle, possibly during the period of the Judges when the ark was captured by the Philistines (1 Samuel 4-6). The longing to locate the ark reflects a desire to restore proper worship and God's favor.<p><b>we found it in the fields of Jaar.</b><br>"Jaar" is often understood to refer to Kiriath-jearim, a town where the ark was kept for 20 years after being returned by the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/7.htm">1 Samuel 7:1-2</a>). This location was in the territory of Judah, not far from Jerusalem. The fields of Jaar symbolize a place of waiting and preparation before the ark's eventual transfer to Jerusalem by King David (<a href="/2_samuel/6.htm">2 Samuel 6:1-15</a>). This movement of the ark prefigures the coming of Christ, who would establish a new covenant and dwell among His people. The search and discovery of the ark highlight themes of seeking God's presence and the fulfillment of His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephrathah.htm">Ephrathah</a></b><br>This is a region associated with Bethlehem, the birthplace of King David and later, Jesus Christ.

It celebrates moving from second-hand knowledge to personal engagement with God&#8217;s presence, and it sets the stage for David&#8217;s determination to enthrone the Ark in Jerusalem so the entire nation could worship the Lord as He commanded.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/132.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Lo, we heard.</span>--This verse has been pronounced inexplicable, and yet the general intention is clear. The vow in which David declared his purpose has just been quoted, and that which is now said to have been heard and found can hardly be anything else than this purpose. In fact, the <span class= "ital">feminine </span>suffix to the verbs points directly back to the word rendered <span class= "ital">afflictions </span>in <a href="/psalms/132-1.htm" title="Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:">Psalm 132:1</a>, which is really a feminine form. This being settled, we need not go from the plain direction of such places as <a href="/genesis/35-19.htm" title="And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.">Genesis 35:19</a>; <a href="/genesis/48-7.htm" title="And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.">Genesis 48:7</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-11.htm" title="And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do you worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:">Ruth 4:11</a>; <a href="/micah/5-2.htm" title="But you, Bethlehem Ephratah, though you be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall he come forth to me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.">Micah 5:2</a>, which pronounce the identity of Ephratah with Bethlehem, to seek any other locality which might possibly be so called. David's purpose would naturally be connected--especially after a long lapse of time--with the birthplace of his family. But though taking this poetical licence, the psalm keeps sufficiently close to history as to recognise in the discovery of the Ark at Kirjath-jearim an important, nay, a decisive step in the project of building the Temple. Though his purpose may not have been even dimly defined to David when he moved the Ark, history justly sees in that momentous change the initial step in the grander undertaking. That <span class= "ital">"</span>the fields of the wood" (Heb., <span class= "ital">sedey-y?'ar</span>) is one designation of Kirjath-jearim (city of Yaarim, which went by so many names: <a href="/jeremiah/26-20.htm" title="And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.">Jeremiah 26:20</a>; <a href="/ezra/2-25.htm" title="The children of Kirjatharim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred and forty and three.">Ezra 2:25</a>; <a href="/context/joshua/15-10.htm" title="And the border compassed from Baalah westward to mount Seir, and passed along to the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah:">Joshua 15:10-11</a>) there can be little doubt. We must not, of course, think here of David's contemporaries, but of those of the psalmist, who poetically are represented as taking important part in the early plans for building the Temple--just as we might say, speaking of our old cathedrals, "we built fine churches in those days." The poet makes them say, identifying themselves with the people of those distant times, while naturally the historical correctness suffers, "We heard his project at Bethlehem; we found out <span class= "ital">its </span>meaning (saw it take shape) at Kirjath-jearim." For <span class= "ital">m?tsa, </span>in the sense of "finding out the meaning or discerning," see <a href="/judges/14-12.htm" title="And Samson said to them, I will now put forth a riddle to you: if you can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:">Judges 14:12</a>, "of a riddle." This sentence reminds one of a riddle by its form. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/132.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-10.</span> - The realization of David's design.

The "priests" are" clothed with righteousness," and the "saints shout for joy." God "turns not away the face of his anointed," but accepts the costly offering.
