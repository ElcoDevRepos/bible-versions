In the Old Testament, the tabernacle was a portable sanctuary used by the Israelites during their wanderings in the desert. The use of "tent" signifies God's presence and His willingness to dwell among His people. "Salem" is an ancient name for Jerusalem, derived from the word "shalom," meaning peace. This connects to Melchizedek, the king of Salem, who is a type of Christ (<a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7:1-3</a>). The mention of Salem emphasizes God's historical and ongoing presence in Jerusalem, a city central to biblical prophecy and the unfolding of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>His dwelling place in Zion</b><br>"Zion" is often used in Scripture to refer to the city of Jerusalem, particularly the hill where the temple was built. It symbolizes God's chosen place for His presence and the center of His kingdom on earth. Zion is significant in biblical prophecy, representing the future reign of Christ and the ultimate gathering of God's people (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>; <a href="/revelation/14.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>). The term "dwelling place" indicates a more permanent residence compared to "tent," suggesting the establishment of God's kingdom and His eternal presence with His people. This foreshadows the New Jerusalem, where God will dwell with humanity forever (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/salem.htm">Salem</a></b><br>An ancient name for Jerusalem, meaning "peace."

In <a href="/bsb/psalms/76.htm">Psalm 76</a>, that idea is transported to &#8220;Salem,&#8221; the ancient name for Jerusalem (<a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a>).

In Salem&#8212;Jerusalem&#8212;God camped with His people; in Zion, He enthroned Himself among them.
