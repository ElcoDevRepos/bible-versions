In biblical context, the mouth often symbolizes the heart's overflow (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>). The imagery of "spewing" suggests an uncontrolled and vile outpouring, akin to the venom of a serpent (<a href="/psalms/140-3.htm">Psalm 140:3</a>). This reflects the broader biblical theme of the power of words to harm or heal (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>).<p><b>sharp words from their lips:</b><br>The "sharp words" indicate the intent to wound and destroy, akin to weapons of war (<a href="/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a>). In the ancient Near Eastern culture, words were seen as powerful tools that could enact curses or blessings. The sharpness of their words contrasts with the Word of God, which is described as a double-edged sword (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>), emphasizing the destructive nature of the enemies' speech.<p><b>&#8220;For who can hear us?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question reveals the arrogance and perceived impunity of David's adversaries. They believe their actions and words go unnoticed, reflecting a common biblical theme of the wicked's false sense of security (<a href="/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11</a>). This phrase also connects to the broader narrative of divine justice, where God is portrayed as the ultimate judge who hears and sees all (<a href="/psalms/94-9.htm">Psalm 94:9</a>). It underscores the folly of thinking one can act without divine accountability, a theme echoed in the prophetic literature (<a href="/isaiah/29-15.htm">Isaiah 29:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/59.htm">Psalm 59</a>, David is seeking God's protection from his enemies.
