The psalmist marvels at the multitude of God's works, which can be seen in the variety of life forms and natural phenomena. This echoes <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God creates the heavens and the earth, emphasizing His role as the ultimate Creator. The exclamation "O LORD" uses the covenant name of God, Yahweh, highlighting a personal relationship with the Creator. This phrase invites believers to recognize and praise God's handiwork in the world around them.<p><b>In wisdom You have made them all;</b><br>Here, the psalmist attributes the creation of the world to God's wisdom, a concept that is central to biblical theology. Wisdom in the Bible often refers to God's perfect knowledge and understanding, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a>, "By wisdom the LORD laid the earth&#8217;s foundations." This wisdom is not just intellectual but also practical, as it is applied in the creation and sustaining of the universe. The phrase suggests that every aspect of creation is intentional and purposeful, reflecting God's wise design. This wisdom is also personified in Jesus Christ, who is described as the wisdom of God in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>.<p><b>the earth is full of Your creatures.</b><br>This statement highlights the abundance and diversity of life on earth, all of which are sustained by God. The term "creatures" encompasses all living beings, from the smallest insects to the largest mammals, each playing a role in the ecosystem. This reflects the biblical view of God's providence and care for all His creation, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>, where Jesus speaks of God's provision for the birds of the air. The phrase also implies stewardship, as humans are called to care for God's creation, a mandate given in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>. The fullness of the earth with God's creatures points to His generosity and the interconnectedness of all life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and His relationship with His creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_earth.htm">The Earth</a></b><br>The physical realm created by God, filled with His creatures and reflecting His wisdom and power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/creatures.htm">Creatures</a></b><br>All living beings that inhabit the earth, showcasing the diversity and creativity of God's handiwork.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_wisdom_in_creation.htm">God's Wisdom in Creation</a></b><br>The intricate design and order of the universe reflect God's infinite wisdom.
