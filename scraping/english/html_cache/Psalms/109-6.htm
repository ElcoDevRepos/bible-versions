In biblical context, the idea of setting a wicked man over someone suggests a form of judgment or punishment. The wicked man here could be seen as an instrument of God's justice, similar to how God used foreign nations to discipline Israel (e.g., Assyria and Babylon). Theologically, this reflects the principle that God can use even the unrighteous to fulfill His purposes, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a> where Assyria is described as the rod of God's anger.<p><b>let an accuser stand at his right hand.</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, the right hand was a place of honor and defense. An accuser standing at one's right hand implies a position of influence and authority, often associated with legal proceedings. This imagery is consistent with the role of Satan as the accuser in <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6-12</a> and <a href="/zechariah/3.htm">Zechariah 3:1</a>, where he stands to accuse Joshua the high priest. Theologically, this can be seen as a call for divine retribution, where the adversary is subjected to the same scrutiny and judgment they impose on others. This also foreshadows the ultimate defeat of the accuser through Christ, who now intercedes for believers at the right hand of God (<a href="/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/109.htm">Psalm 109</a>, David is expressing a deep cry for justice against his adversaries. This psalm is often categorized as an imprecatory psalm, where the psalmist calls for God's judgment on his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/adversaries.htm">Adversaries</a></b><br>The psalm speaks of those who have wronged David, possibly referring to specific individuals or a general group of enemies who have falsely accused or betrayed him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/accuser.htm">Accuser</a></b><br>The Hebrew word used here is "satan," which means adversary or accuser. This term can refer to a human accuser or, in a broader sense, to spiritual opposition.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/right_hand.htm">Right Hand</a></b><br>In biblical terms, the right hand is often a place of honor or power. Here, it is ironically the position of the accuser, indicating a place of influence or authority in the judicial process.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judicial_imagery.htm">Judicial Imagery</a></b><br>The verse uses courtroom language, suggesting a legal setting where accusations are made, and justice is sought.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_imprecatory_psalms.htm">Understanding Imprecatory Psalms</a></b><br>These psalms express raw human emotions and a desire for justice.

David asks that every hidden sin be dragged into the open, cutting off excuses and self-justification.<p>&#8226; Ultimately, the verse anticipates God&#8217;s final judgment, where unrepentant sinners face undeniable evidence against them (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22-29</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>).<p>&#8226; By contrast, God Himself &#8220;stands at the right hand of the needy&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/109-31.htm">Psalm 109:31</a>), assuring believers that those who trust Him will never be left without an advocate (<a href="/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/109-6.htm">Psalm 109:6</a> is an imprecatory cry for just recompense: may the hostile oppressor be ruled by wickedness and prosecuted without relief, reaping what he has sown. The verse warns that rejecting righteousness invites harsher masters and unavoidable judgment, while hinting that refuge and advocacy belong to those who seek the Lord&#8217;s mercy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/109.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Set thou a wicked man over him.</span>--This rendering is abundantly confirmed by <a href="/leviticus/26-16.htm" title="I also will do this to you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.">Leviticus 26:16</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-27.htm" title="At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all their service: and you shall appoint to them in charge all their burdens.">Numbers 4:27</a>; <a href="/numbers/27-16.htm" title="Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation,">Numbers 27:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/15-3.htm" title="And I will appoint over them four kinds, said the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.">Jeremiah 15:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-27.htm" title="Set you up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillars.">Jeremiah 51:27</a>, against Hitzig's proposed "Pronounce against him--guilty," which also would only anticipate <a href="/psalms/109-7.htm" title="When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.">Psalm 109:7</a>. (Comp., too, the noun "office" in <a href="/psalms/109-8.htm" title="Let his days be few; and let another take his office.">Psalm 109:8</a>, from the same verb.) The wish expressed is that the persons indicated may fall into the hands of an unscrupulous judge. If, however, we are to think of the divine judgment, then this clause must be taken as exactly parallel to the next: "Appoint a wicked man against him." Here the imprecatory part of the psalm begins, and it has been ingeniously argued that the whole of it (<a href="/context/psalms/109-6.htm" title="Set you a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.">Psalm 109:6-20</a>) is a quotation, giving, not the psalmist's curse on his foes, but theirs on <span class= "ital">him. </span>Such quotations, without any introductory words, are common, and the theory is tenable, but improbable. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/109.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-15.</span> - The imprecatory portion of the psalm now begins. It is no doubt true to say, with Tholuck, that "no passion is discernible in the imprecations, dreadful as they are." Clearly the writer is not moved by personal feelings of hostility, but by a spirit of justice, and an intense abhorrence of sin. He delivers a calm judicial sentence. Still, the spirit of Christian love must ever shrink from such utterances, which belong to an earlier and less perfect dispensation (comp. <a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51-56</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Set thou a wicked man over him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> judge him (see ver. 7).
