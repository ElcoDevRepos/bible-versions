The "channels" suggest hidden pathways or depths that are normally unseen, symbolizing God's ability to reveal and control the natural world. This imagery can also be seen as a metaphor for God's revelation of hidden truths and His sovereign control over creation.<p><b>and the foundations of the world were exposed</b><br>The "foundations of the world" refer to the very structure and order of creation. This phrase suggests a divine unveiling or judgment, where God lays bare the hidden aspects of the earth. It echoes the language of creation found in Genesis, where God establishes the earth's foundations (<a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9-10</a>). This exposure signifies God's authority to reveal and judge, aligning with prophetic imagery in books like Isaiah and Ezekiel, where God's power over creation is a recurring theme.<p><b>at Your rebuke, O LORD</b><br>A "rebuke" from the Lord signifies His authoritative command and judgment. Throughout Scripture, God's rebuke is powerful and effective, often associated with His control over nature and nations (<a href="/psalms/104-7.htm">Psalm 104:7</a>, <a href="/isaiah/50-2.htm">Isaiah 50:2</a>). This phrase underscores God's ability to command creation and bring about His purposes, reflecting His holiness and justice. It also points to the eschatological judgment where God will ultimately rebuke and judge the world.<p><b>at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils</b><br>This vivid imagery portrays God's power and wrath in anthropomorphic terms, suggesting a fierce and immediate divine action. The "breath" of God is often associated with His Spirit and life-giving power (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/37-9.htm">Ezekiel 37:9</a>). However, in this context, it conveys His anger and the destructive force of His judgment, reminiscent of the plagues in Egypt and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. This phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, who will return with power and authority to judge the living and the dead (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>, <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, David is expressing his gratitude and awe for God's deliverance and power.
