In Hebrew poetry, the use of "bones" often signifies the innermost self or the totality of one's being. This expression of total involvement in praise is seen elsewhere in scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103:1</a>, where the psalmist calls on his soul and all that is within him to bless the Lord. The imagery of bones speaking underscores the intensity and sincerity of the psalmist's response to God's deliverance.<p><b>&#8220;Who is like You, O LORD</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights the uniqueness and incomparability of God. In the ancient Near Eastern context, where polytheism was prevalent, the declaration of God's uniqueness was a profound statement of monotheism. The phrase echoes the song of Moses in <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>, "Who among the gods is like you, LORD?" It affirms the belief that the God of Israel is unparalleled in power, holiness, and ability to save. This theme is central to the identity of Israel as a people chosen by a singular, sovereign God.<p><b>who delivers the afflicted from the aggressor</b><br>The deliverance of the afflicted is a recurring theme in the Psalms and throughout the Old Testament. The term "afflicted" often refers to those who are oppressed or suffering, whether due to external enemies or personal circumstances. The "aggressor" can be understood as any force or person causing harm or injustice. This deliverance is a demonstration of God's justice and compassion, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/72-4.htm">Psalm 72:4</a>, where the king is called to defend the afflicted and crush the oppressor. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance brought by Jesus Christ, who came to set the captives free (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>).<p><b>the poor and needy from the robber?&#8221;</b><br>The mention of the "poor and needy" reflects God's concern for the marginalized and vulnerable in society. Throughout the Bible, God is portrayed as a defender of those who lack power and resources, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>, where He executes justice for the orphan and widow. The "robber" symbolizes those who exploit or take advantage of the weak. This deliverance is not only a physical rescue but also a spiritual and moral one, pointing to the broader biblical narrative of God's kingdom, where justice and righteousness prevail. Jesus' ministry often focused on the poor and needy, fulfilling prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, and His teachings in the Beatitudes (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>) further emphasize the blessedness of the poor in spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/35.htm">Psalm 35</a>, David is expressing his reliance on God for deliverance from his enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Yahweh is depicted as the unparalleled deliverer and protector of the afflicted.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_afflicted.htm">The Afflicted</a></b><br>Represents those who are oppressed or suffering, seeking God's intervention.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oppressor.htm">The Oppressor</a></b><br>The one who is too strong for the afflicted, symbolizing any force or person that causes harm or injustice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor_and_needy.htm">The Poor and Needy</a></b><br>Those who are vulnerable and in need of God's protection and justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_unparalleled_nature.htm">God's Unparalleled Nature</a></b><br>Recognize and worship God for His unique ability to deliver and protect.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_divine_deliverance.htm">Dependence on Divine Deliverance</a></b><br>Trust in God's power to rescue us from situations where we feel overwhelmed or oppressed.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/advocacy_for_the_vulnerable.htm">Advocacy for the Vulnerable</a></b><br>As followers of Christ, we are called to support and defend the poor and needy, reflecting God's heart for justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/praise_in_adversity.htm">Praise in Adversity</a></b><br>Even in difficult times, let our whole being, like David's "bones," praise God for His faithfulness and deliverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Acknowledge the spiritual battles we face and rely on God's strength to overcome forces too strong for us alone.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_35_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 35:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_35_10_How_does_it_inspire_praise.htm">How does Psalm 35:10 inspire you to praise God's deliverance in your life?

Similar language appears in <a href="/psalms/22-14.htm">Psalm 22:14</a> and <a href="/psalms/51-8.htm">Psalm 51:8</a>, where bones represent the core of a person&#8217;s strength and vitality.<p>&#8226; When God intervenes, the believer&#8217;s whole frame responds&#8212;just as Jeremiah said God&#8217;s word was &#8220;like a fire shut up in my bones&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who is like You, O LORD</b><p>&#8226; The question is rhetorical; there is no one comparable to Yahweh (<a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-25.htm">Isaiah 40:25</a>).<p>&#8226; It emphasizes God&#8217;s uniqueness in power, holiness, and covenant faithfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/10-6.htm">Jeremiah 10:6</a>).<p>&#8226; This declaration also draws the reader to worship, similar to the heavenly chant in <a href="/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3</a>, &#8220;Great and marvelous are Your works, O Lord God Almighty.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who delivers the afflicted from the aggressor</b><p>&#8226; David had real enemies&#8212;Saul, Philistines, traitors&#8212;yet God repeatedly rescued him (<a href="/1_samuel/17-37.htm">1 Samuel 17:37</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/22-49.htm">2 Samuel 22:49</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Afflicted&#8221; points to those who have been wronged or oppressed, reaffirming that God is &#8220;a refuge for the oppressed&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/9-9.htm">Psalm 9:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The term &#8220;aggressor&#8221; assures believers that no adversary, whether personal or systemic, can outmatch God&#8217;s saving hand (<a href="/psalms/72-4.htm">Psalm 72:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the poor and needy from the robber</b><p>&#8226; Scripture often pairs &#8220;poor and needy&#8221; to describe those lacking resources and power (<a href="/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/22-22.htm">Proverbs 22:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s heart beats for the vulnerable; He pledges to &#8220;arise and provide safety&#8221; for them.<p>&#8226; Jesus echoed this mission, proclaiming, &#8220;He has sent Me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners&#8221; (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>), underscoring divine consistency from Old to New Testament.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;robber&#8221; can be an individual thief or any force that steals dignity, livelihood, or hope&#8212;yet the Lord remains the ultimate defender (<a href="/isaiah/41-17.htm">Isaiah 41:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/35-10.htm">Psalm 35:10</a> captures a fully engaged worshiper who marvels at God&#8217;s unrivaled character and saving acts.
