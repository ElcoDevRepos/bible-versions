The feeling of being "cut off" from God's sight suggests a perceived separation from divine protection and favor, a theme echoed in other psalms such as <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>, where David cries out, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" This sense of abandonment can be linked to the cultural understanding of God's presence as a source of safety and blessing. In ancient Israel, being outside of God's sight was akin to being outside of His covenantal care, a dire situation for any believer. Theologically, this phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, who on the cross expressed a similar sentiment of forsakenness, fulfilling the prophecy of the suffering servant.<p><b>But You heard my plea for mercy</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the responsiveness of God to the cries of His people. Despite the initial feeling of being cut off, the psalmist acknowledges that God hears and responds to pleas for mercy. This is consistent with the biblical narrative that portrays God as compassionate and attentive to the prayers of the righteous, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/3-12.htm">1 Peter 3:12</a>, "For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are attentive to their prayer." The plea for mercy is a common theme in the Psalms, reflecting the human need for divine intervention and forgiveness. It underscores the covenant relationship between God and His people, where God is both just and merciful.<p><b>when I called to You for help.</b><br>The act of calling to God for help is a demonstration of faith and reliance on divine assistance. In the historical context of ancient Israel, calling upon the Lord was an integral part of worship and personal devotion. This phrase emphasizes the importance of prayer as a means of communication with God, a practice deeply rooted in Jewish tradition and carried into Christian teachings. Theologically, it points to the assurance that God is a refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble, as stated in <a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>. This assurance is fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who invites believers to come to Him with their burdens, promising rest and help.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/31.htm">Psalm 31</a>, David is expressing a moment of deep distress and fear, feeling abandoned by God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure to whom David cries out, demonstrating His faithfulness and responsiveness to those who call upon Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/distress.htm">Distress</a></b><br>The event or emotional state that David is experiencing, characterized by a sense of being "cut off" from God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_distress.htm">God's Faithfulness in Distress</a></b><br>Even when we feel abandoned, God is attentive to our cries.

The word &#8220;alarm&#8221; points to sudden terror rather than a slow-burn anxiety. Scripture treats this feeling as a real human experience, not an illusion.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/55-5.htm">Psalm 55:5</a> echoes the same surge: &#8220;Fear and trembling grip me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/1_samuel/23.htm">1 Samuel 23</a> shows David literally running for his life; his alarm springs from a factual threat, underscoring that believers can feel overwhelmed even while held firmly in God&#8217;s hand.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/116-11.htm">Psalm 116:11</a> mirrors the reflex: &#8220;In my alarm I said, &#8216;Everyone is a liar,&#8217;&#8221; reminding us that panic often distorts perception.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am cut off from Your sight!</b><p>Alarm quickly morphs into a dire conclusion: &#8220;God can&#8217;t see me anymore.&#8221; The statement is emotional, yet Scripture records it as truly spoken, revealing how fear can blur faith&#8217;s vision.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a> demonstrates the same cry on David&#8217;s lips and prophetically on Christ&#8217;s: &#8220;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/jonah/2-4.htm">Jonah 2:4</a> repeats the phrase almost verbatim: &#8220;I said, &#8216;I have been banished from Your sight&#8217;; yet I will look once more toward Your holy temple.&#8221; God allows His servants to voice such thoughts, showing He values honest lament over silent despair.<p>&#8226; The literal reality never changes&#8212;God never loses sight of His child (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>)&#8212;but the felt reality may shout otherwise in crisis.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But You heard my plea for mercy</b><p>Here the tide turns. David shifts from what he felt to what actually happened: God listened.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4</a> affirms the pattern: &#8220;I sought the LORD, and He answered me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/6-9.htm">Psalm 6:9</a> personalizes it: &#8220;The LORD has heard my cry for mercy; the LORD accepts my prayer.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The hinge word &#8220;But&#8221; signals the faithful character of God overruling the fearful conclusion of man.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when I called to You for help</b><p>The verse ends by spotlighting the simple act that changed everything&#8212;David called, and God responded.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a> repeats the promise: &#8220;Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a> expands the invitation: &#8220;Call to Me, and I will answer you and show you great and mighty things.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The sequence is clear and literal: distress &#8594; prayer &#8594; divine hearing &#8594; rescue. Nothing mystical or complicated; just the covenant Lord keeping His word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/psalms/31-22.htm">Psalm 31:22</a> captures the whiplash journey from panic to praise. David honestly blurts, &#8220;I&#8217;m cut off!&#8221; yet discovers that God never stopped watching or listening. The verse reassures every believer that momentary feelings of abandonment do not equal divine absence.

David's faith was not so firmly fixed but that he was liable, from time to time, to a sudden access of fear (see <a href="/1_samuel/27-1.htm">1 Samuel 27:1</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-14.htm">2 Samuel 15:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a>). He had said to God in his heart, on one such occasion, <span class="cmt_word">I am cut off from before thine eyes</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he had despaired and given himself up for lost. It is somewhat forced to understand the words as meaning, "I am banished from the city where the ark is placed" ('Speaker's Commentary'). <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee</span>. God did not forsake his servant on account of this temporary failure of faith. No sooner did the psalmist rid himself of his extreme alarm, and turn once more to God in prayer, than he was heard, and his prayer answered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/psalms/31-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In my alarm</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1508;&#1456;&#1494;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#601;&#183;z&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
