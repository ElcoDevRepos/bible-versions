In ancient Near Eastern culture, the firstborn son held a position of privilege and authority. This phrase can be seen as a messianic prophecy, pointing to Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the "firstborn over all creation" (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>). The appointment by God indicates divine choice and favor, reminiscent of God's covenant with David, where God promises to establish his lineage and kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). This appointment underscores the idea of a chosen leader who holds a unique relationship with God, reflecting the special status of Israel as God's "firstborn son" (<a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>).<p><b>the highest of the kings of the earth</b><br>This phrase emphasizes supremacy and unparalleled authority. In the historical context, it reflects the Davidic covenant, where God promises that David's line will endure forever and his throne will be established (<a href="/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3-4</a>). The "highest" king signifies a ruler above all earthly powers, a theme echoed in the New Testament with Jesus Christ, who is described as "King of kings and Lord of lords" (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>). This supremacy is not just political but spiritual, indicating a reign that transcends earthly kingdoms. The phrase also connects to the eschatological hope of a future messianic kingdom where Christ will reign supreme, fulfilling the promises made to David and establishing justice and righteousness on earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ethan_the_ezrahite.htm">Ethan the Ezrahite</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, who is believed to be a wise man during the time of King Solomon.
