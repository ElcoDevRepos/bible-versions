The cultural context of ancient Israel involved agrarian societies where rising early and working late were common practices for survival. However, the psalmist emphasizes that such labor is meaningless without divine favor. This echoes <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>, where Solomon speaks of the vanity of human endeavors. The idea is that human effort alone cannot secure success or fulfillment, aligning with the biblical principle that God is the ultimate provider.<p><b>toiling for bread to eat</b><br>The reference to "toiling for bread" connects to the curse of <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>, where Adam is told he will eat bread by the sweat of his brow. This reflects the human condition post-Fall, where labor is necessary for sustenance. In the New Testament, Jesus teaches in <a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-34</a> not to worry about daily needs, as God provides for His children. The phrase underscores the dependence on God for provision, contrasting human striving with divine grace.<p><b>for He gives sleep to His beloved</b><br>This part of the verse suggests that God grants rest and peace to those He loves, implying trust in His provision. Sleep is a gift from God, symbolizing peace and security. In biblical terms, sleep often represents a state of trust and reliance on God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>. The "beloved" can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate beloved of God, and through whom believers receive rest (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).

Work faithfully, rest gratefully, and trust the One who never slumbers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/psalms/127.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">It . . . sleep.</span>--This verse, of the literal rendering of which there is no question, has met with many different interpretations. About the first clause there is no difference. Early rising, to pursue the business of the day, is vain without the Divine blessing on the labour. The next two clauses admit two different interpretations. Some connect the sitting down with the meal: "delaying to sit down and eat the bread of cares" (or sorrow), <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>so immersed in business as to allow hardly time for meals. But it seems far more natural to take the Hebrew in its more extended sense of resting, and so explain, nearly as the Authorised Version:--<p>"It is in vain to rise early;<p>To delay the hour of rest,<p>To eat the bread that has been won by toil;<p>At His pleasure He giveth to His beloved (in) sleep."<p>As to the last clause, it seems right, from its use in Genesis 1, "it was so," to give <span class= "ital">so </span>the sense "at His pleasure," this being also indicated by the general drift of the psalm. The word "sleep" may be either the direct object, as in the LXX. and Vulg., or the accusative used adverbially, "in sleep," "while they sleep." That the latter suits the context best there can be no question. The whole intention of the psalm is to assert the truth which the Book of Proverbs sums up in one sentence (<a href="/proverbs/10-22.htm" title="The blessing of the LORD, it makes rich, and he adds no sorrow with it.">Proverbs 10:22</a>): "The blessing of Jehovah maketh rich, and toil can add nothing thereto," the truth which was so impressively taught in the Sermon on the Mount, by the contrast of man's restless ambition with the unconscious dependence on the Divine bounty of birds and flowers. To say that what others toil for from morning till night in vain, God gives to His beloved without all this anxiety and exertion, <span class= "ital">while they sleep, </span>puts this truth forcibly, and with that disregard of apparent paradox which was natural to a Hebrew, and which appears so prominently in our Saviour's treatment of the subject. Labour is decried as unnecessary neither here nor in the Sermon on the Mount, but "carking care" is dismissed as unworthy those who, from past experience, ought to trust the goodness of the great Provider. The Greek proverb, "The net catches while the fisher sleeps," and the German, "God bestows His gifts during the night," bring common expressions to confirm this voice of inspiration, which was, in almost so many words, recalled in our Lord's parable (<a href="/mark/4-27.htm" title="And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knows not how.">Mark 4:27</a>). But old association pleads for the equally true and equally beautiful rendering which makes sleep the gift of God. If there is one thing which seems to come more direct from Heaven's bounty than another, that in its character is more benign, in its effects more akin to the nature of God, it is the blessing of sleep. In all times men have rendered thanks to Heaven for this boon. The ancients not only spoke of sleep as "most grateful of known gifts," but made itself a god. The psalmist unconsciously, but most truly, teaches us the further lesson that it is not only a Divine blessing, but a proof of Divine love:<p>"Of all the thoughts of God that are<p>Borne inward unto souls afar, . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/psalms/127.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11</a>); <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to be "careful and troubled" about your work in the world, whatever it is. <span class="cmt_word">To eat the bread of sorrows</span>.
