This forgetfulness is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, illustrating human nature's inclination to overlook God's past faithfulness. The Israelites' forgetfulness is a warning against spiritual amnesia, which can lead to disobedience and idolatry. This theme is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">Deuteronomy 4:9</a>, where Moses warns the people to remember what they have seen and to teach it to their children.<p><b>and failed to wait for His counsel.</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the impatience and lack of trust in God's timing and guidance. The Israelites often acted impulsively, such as when they demanded a golden calf while Moses was on Mount Sinai (Exodus 32). This failure to wait for God's counsel is a caution against taking matters into one's own hands without seeking divine guidance. It reflects a broader biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which advises believers to trust in the Lord and not lean on their own understanding. The failure to wait for God's counsel can lead to dire consequences, as seen throughout Israel's history, and serves as a reminder of the importance of patience and reliance on God's wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The primary subjects of <a href="/bsb/psalms/106.htm">Psalm 106</a>, representing God's chosen people who experienced His mighty works and deliverance but often fell into forgetfulness and disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting for many of the events referenced in <a href="/bsb/psalms/106.htm">Psalm 106</a>, where the Israelites wandered after their exodus from Egypt and witnessed God's miraculous provisions and guidance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_works.htm">God's Works</a></b><br>Refers to the miraculous deeds performed by God, such as the parting of the Red Sea, providing manna, and other acts of deliverance and provision for the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_counsel.htm">God's Counsel</a></b><br>Represents the divine guidance and commandments given to the Israelites, including the Law and instructions through Moses.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites during the Exodus, who acted as a mediator between God and His people, conveying God's laws and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_forgetfulness.htm">The Danger of Forgetfulness</a></b><br>Forgetting God's past works can lead to a lack of faith and disobedience.
