In the Hebrew context, "LORD" refers to Yahweh, the covenant name of God, highlighting His eternal and unchanging nature. The declaration that the LORD is God distinguishes Him from the idols worshiped by surrounding nations, affirming monotheism. This echoes the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one," reinforcing the foundational belief in one true God.<p><b>It is He who made us,</b><br>This acknowledges God as the Creator, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture, beginning with <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>. The act of creation establishes God's authority and ownership over humanity. In <a href="/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>, God is likened to a potter, and humans to clay, illustrating His role in shaping and forming us. This phrase also implies a personal relationship, as God intentionally created each individual.<p><b>and we are His;</b><br>This phrase signifies belonging and covenant relationship. In the ancient Near Eastern context, belonging to a deity implied protection and provision. The covenant with Israel, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>, established them as God's treasured possession. This relationship is further fulfilled in the New Testament, where believers are described as God's children (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>).<p><b>we are His people,</b><br>This phrase identifies the community of believers as God's chosen people. In the Old Testament, Israel was chosen to be a holy nation (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). In the New Testament, this extends to all who believe in Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, where believers are called a "chosen people, a royal priesthood." This reflects the continuity of God's plan for a people set apart for His purposes.<p><b>and the sheep of His pasture.</b><br>This metaphor portrays God as a shepherd, a common biblical image of care and guidance. <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> famously begins with "The LORD is my shepherd," illustrating God's provision and protection. In the New Testament, Jesus identifies Himself as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), fulfilling this imagery by laying down His life for the sheep. The pastoral setting implies a place of safety and sustenance, emphasizing God's nurturing role.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and faithfulness to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Elohim)</a></b><br>A title that highlights God's power and sovereignty over all creation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_people.htm">His People</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites in the Old Testament context, and by extension, all who are in covenant relationship with God through faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheep_of_his_pasture.htm">Sheep of His Pasture</a></b><br>A metaphor for God's people, illustrating their dependence on Him for guidance, provision, and protection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledging_god's_sovereignty.htm">Acknowledging God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that the LORD is God, affirming His ultimate authority and power in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_identity.htm">Understanding Our Identity</a></b><br>Embrace the truth that we are created by God and belong to Him, which gives us purpose and value.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_as_god's_people.htm">Living as God's People</a></b><br>As His people, we are called to live in obedience and trust, reflecting His character in our daily lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_the_shepherd.htm">Dependence on the Shepherd</a></b><br>Like sheep, we must rely on God's guidance and provision, seeking His will in all circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_belonging.htm">Community and Belonging</a></b><br>Being part of God's flock means we are not alone; we are part of a community that supports and encourages one another in faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Psalm_100_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Psalm 100:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Psalm_100_3_God_s_Creator_Shepherd_role.htm">How does Psalm 100:3 affirm God's role as our Creator and Shepherd?
