In the context of <a href="/psalms/144.htm">Psalm 144</a>, David is expressing gratitude for God's protection and provision. The "people of whom this is so" refers to those who experience the blessings described earlier in the psalm, such as deliverance from enemies, prosperity, and peace. This echoes the covenantal promises given to Israel, where obedience to God resulted in blessings (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). The concept of blessing is deeply rooted in the Hebrew understanding of shalom, which encompasses peace, completeness, and welfare.<p><b>blessed are the people whose God is the LORD.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the unique relationship between the people and Yahweh, the covenant name of God. It underscores the idea that true blessing comes from acknowledging and serving the LORD as the one true God. This is a central theme throughout the Old Testament, where Israel is repeatedly called to exclusive worship of Yahweh (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2-3</a>). The phrase also points to the identity of God's people as those who have chosen to follow Him, setting them apart from other nations. In a broader biblical context, this anticipates the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, who fulfills the role of the LORD as the shepherd and king of His people (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, <a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>). The ultimate blessing is found in the relationship with God through Christ, who reconciles humanity to the Father (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/144.htm">Psalm 144</a>, David was the second king of Israel, known for his deep relationship with God and his role as a warrior and poet.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of Israel is often the context for the Psalms, representing God's chosen people who are in covenant with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal, self-existent nature and His relationship with His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_blessedness.htm">Understanding Blessedness</a></b><br>True blessedness is not found in material wealth or earthly success but in having a relationship with the LORD.
