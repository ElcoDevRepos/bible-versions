In biblical times, oaths were taken very seriously, often invoking God's name as a witness (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>). The act of swearing and confirming suggests a deliberate and conscious decision, emphasizing the importance of integrity and faithfulness in one's relationship with God. This mirrors the covenantal language found throughout the Old Testament, where God and His people enter into binding agreements (<a href="/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7-8</a>).<p><b>that I will keep</b><br>The commitment to "keep" implies not just passive observance but active obedience and adherence to God's commands. This reflects the Hebrew concept of "shamar," which means to guard, protect, and observe. The psalmist's intention to keep God's laws aligns with the broader biblical theme of obedience as a response to God's covenantal love and faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/11.htm">Deuteronomy 11:1</a>). It also echoes the Shema, a central declaration of faith in Judaism, which calls for wholehearted devotion to God's commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>).<p><b>Your righteous judgments</b><br>"Righteous judgments" refers to God's decrees and laws, which are inherently just and fair. The term "righteous" underscores the moral perfection and fairness of God's laws, which are designed to guide His people in living a life that reflects His character. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's justice and righteousness, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/19-9.htm">Psalm 19:9</a> and <a href="/isaiah/33-22.htm">Isaiah 33:22</a>. The psalmist's commitment to these judgments highlights the belief that God's laws are not arbitrary but are rooted in His unchanging nature. This also points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's righteousness in Jesus Christ, who perfectly embodied and fulfilled the law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalmist.htm">Psalmist</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>, traditionally believed to be King David, who expresses a deep commitment to God's law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine author of the "righteous judgments" that the psalmist vows to keep.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the law was originally given, serving as the context for the psalmist's commitment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, which contain God's commandments and judgments.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgments.htm">Judgments</a></b><br>The specific decrees and ordinances within God's law that the psalmist is committed to obeying.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_god's_word.htm">Commitment to God's Word</a></b><br>The psalmist's vow highlights the importance of making a personal commitment to follow God's Word.
