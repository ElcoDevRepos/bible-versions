It highlights the direct revelation from God, emphasizing the covenant relationship between God and Abraham. This divine communication underscores the prophetic nature of God's promises and the unfolding of His plan for Israel.<p><b>that his descendants would be foreigners in a strange land</b><br>This prophecy refers to the Israelites' future sojourn in Egypt. The term "foreigners" indicates their status as non-citizens, which is significant in the ancient Near Eastern context where land and lineage were crucial for identity and rights. The "strange land" is Egypt, where the Israelites lived as aliens, as seen in <a href="/genesis/47-4.htm">Genesis 47:4</a>. This foreshadows the Exodus narrative and highlights the theme of God's people living in a world that is not their ultimate home.<p><b>and that they would be enslaved</b><br>This part of the prophecy foretells the Israelites' enslavement in Egypt, as described in <a href="/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8-14</a>. The historical context of Egyptian slavery involved harsh labor and oppression, which is a central theme in the narrative of Israel's deliverance. This period of enslavement serves as a type of the bondage of sin, from which Christ delivers believers.<p><b>and mistreated</b><br>The mistreatment of the Israelites in Egypt included not only forced labor but also attempts to suppress their population, as seen in <a href="/exodus/1-15.htm">Exodus 1:15-22</a>. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the suffering of God's people and God's eventual intervention on their behalf. It also prefigures the persecution faced by the early church and believers throughout history.<p><b>four hundred years</b><br>The "four hundred years" is a rounded figure that corresponds to the period of Israel's sojourn and oppression in Egypt. This timeframe is also mentioned in <a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a> and is reconciled with the 430 years mentioned in <a href="/exodus/12-40.htm">Exodus 12:40-41</a>, which includes the time from Abraham's covenant to the Exodus.

Taking the common computation, the interval between the covenant with Abraham and that with Moses was 430 years (<a href="/galatians/3-17.htm" title="And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel, that it should make the promise of none effect.">Galatians 3:17</a>), of which only 215 are reckoned as spent in Egypt. The Israelites were indeed sojourners in a strange land for the whole 430 years, but the history shows that they were not in bondage nor evil entreated till the Pharaoh arose who knew not Joseph. The chronological difficulty, however, lies in reconciling St. Paul's statement in <a href="/galatians/3-17.htm" title="And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel, that it should make the promise of none effect.">Galatians 3:17</a> with the language of <a href="/genesis/15-13.htm" title="And he said to Abram, Know of a surety that your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;">Genesis 15:13</a>, which gives 400 years as the sojourning in Egypt, and <a href="/exodus/12-40.htm" title="Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelled in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.">Exodus 12:40</a>, which gives 430, and with which St. Stephen is in substantial agreement. St. Paul appears to have followed the LXX. reading of <a href="/exodus/12-40.htm" title="Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelled in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.">Exodus 12:40</a>, which inserts "in the land of Cannan," and in some MSS. "they and their fathers," and with this the Samaritan Pentateuch agrees. Josephus varies, in some passages (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> ii. 15, ? 2), giving 215 years; in others (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> ii. 9, ? 1; <span class= "ital">Wars, </span>v. 9, ? 4), 400. All that can be said is, as before, that chronological accuracy did not affect the argument in either case. It was enough for St. Stephen, as for St. Paul, to accept this or that system of dates, as they had been taught, without inquiring into the grounds on which it rested. Such inquiries were foreign to the Jewish character generally, and above all to that character when possessed by the sense of new and divine realities. Round numbers were enough for them to mark the successive stages of God's dealings with His people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In a strange land</span>; a land belonging to some one else (<a href="/hebrews/11-9.htm">Hebrews 11:9</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, as here); a land in which he had none inheritance, not yet become the possession of his seed; for as the writer to the Hebrews says, he dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob; not applicable, therefore, in the first instance to Egypt at all. And this sojourning as strangers and pilgrims lasted altogether four hundred and thirty years, vie. two hundred and fifteen years in Canaan, and two hundred and fifteen in Egypt; which agrees exactly with St. Paul's reckoning in round numbers of four hundred years from the giving of the promise to Abraham to the giving of the Law on Mount Sinai (<a href="/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a>). The "four hundred years" must not be taken in connection with the bondage" and the ill treatment which characterized the last half of the period, but as spoken of the whole period during which they had not possession of the promised land. <span class="cmt_word">Bring them into bondage</span>.
