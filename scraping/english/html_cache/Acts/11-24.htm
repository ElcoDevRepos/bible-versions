His nickname, meaning "Son of Encouragement," reflects his character and role in the early church. His goodness is demonstrated through his generosity (<a href="/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36-37</a>) and his role as a mediator between Paul and the apostles (<a href="/acts/9-27.htm">Acts 9:27</a>). The term "good" in biblical context often implies moral integrity and a life aligned with God's will, as seen in other scriptural references like <a href="/proverbs/12-2.htm">Proverbs 12:2</a> and <a href="/luke/6-45.htm">Luke 6:45</a>.<p><b>full of the Holy Spirit and faith</b><br>Being "full of the Holy Spirit" indicates that Barnabas was guided and empowered by the Spirit in his ministry, a characteristic shared by other early church leaders (<a href="/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3, 7</a>:55). This fullness is essential for effective ministry and is a fulfillment of Jesus' promise in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>. His faith, a deep trust in God, is evident in his actions and decisions, such as supporting Saul (Paul) and encouraging the church in Antioch. This faith aligns with <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>, which describes faith as confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.<p><b>and a great number of people were brought to the Lord</b><br>Barnabas's ministry in Antioch was fruitful, leading many to faith in Christ. This growth reflects the fulfillment of the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and the spread of the gospel beyond Jewish communities, as seen in <a href="/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19-21</a>. The phrase "brought to the Lord" emphasizes conversion and discipleship, indicating a transformative relationship with Jesus.

Jesus taught, &#8220;A good man brings good things out of the good treasure of his heart&#8221; (<a href="/luke/6-45.htm">Luke 6:45</a>), and Barnabas embodies that principle.<p>&#8226; Paul later exhorts believers to &#8220;learn to devote themselves to good works&#8221;

The verse invites every believer to cultivate the same qualities so that God may continue adding souls to His kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">For he was a good man.</span>--Words of praise of this kind are comparatively rare in this history, and we may, perhaps, think of them here as expressing St. Luke's personal estimate of the character of the preacher, which he was all the more anxious to place on record because he had to narrate before long the sad contention which separated him from his friend and fellow-worker (<a href="/acts/15-39.htm" title="And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed to Cyprus;">Acts 15:39</a>). The word "good" is probably to be taken as presenting the more winning and persuasive form of holiness, as contrasted with the severer forms of simple justice. (Comp. <a href="/romans/5-7.htm" title="For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.">Romans 5:7</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Full of the Holy Ghost.</span>--This was implied in his very name as "the Son of Prophecy" (see Note on <a href="/acts/4-31.htm" title="And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.">Acts 4:31</a>); but it is interesting to note that the words are identical with those in which the historian had previously described Stephen (<a href="/acts/6-5.htm" title="And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:">Acts 6:5</a>).
