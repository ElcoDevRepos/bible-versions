His presence at Stephen's stoning signifies his active role in opposing the followers of Jesus. This event marks a pivotal moment in Saul's life, setting the stage for his dramatic conversion in <a href="/acts/9.htm">Acts 9</a>. Saul's approval of Stephen's death highlights the intense opposition faced by early Christians from Jewish religious leaders. Stephen, the first Christian martyr, was stoned for his bold proclamation of Jesus as the Messiah, as recorded in <a href="/acts/7.htm">Acts 7</a>. Saul's involvement underscores the deep-seated hostility towards the nascent Christian movement.<p><b>On that day a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem,</b><br>The persecution that erupted following Stephen's martyrdom was a significant turning point for the early church. It was spearheaded by Jewish authorities who viewed the growing Christian movement as a threat to their religious and social order. This persecution was not merely a series of isolated incidents but a widespread and organized effort to suppress the followers of Jesus. The church in Jerusalem, which had been the center of Christian activity since Pentecost, faced severe trials as believers were targeted for their faith. This persecution fulfilled Jesus' prophecy that His followers would face opposition (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).<p><b>and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.</b><br>The scattering of believers was a catalyst for the spread of the Gospel beyond Jerusalem, in line with Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be His witnesses "in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth." This dispersion, known as the Diaspora, led to the establishment of new Christian communities and the furtherance of the Gospel message. The apostles remained in Jerusalem, likely to maintain a leadership presence and continue their ministry among the Jewish population. The regions of Judea and Samaria, mentioned here, were significant as they represented the initial expansion of the church's mission beyond its Jewish roots, reaching out to Samaritans who were historically at odds with the Jews, thus breaking down long-standing ethnic and religious barriers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>Later known as the Apostle Paul, Saul was a zealous Pharisee who initially persecuted Christians.

Saul&#8217;s approval exposes human hostility, yet God redeems it, transforming Saul into Paul. Stephen&#8217;s death ignites persecution, but the fire spreads the gospel beyond Jerusalem, precisely as Jesus foretold. What seemed like defeat became divine strategy, proving that the Lord rules over both opposition and expansion, advancing His unshakeable kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">VIII.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">And Saul was consenting unto his death.</span>--The word seems carefully chosen to convey the fact that he did not himself take part in stoning, but contented himself with guiding and directing the murder. He "kept the garments" of the witnesses who flung the stones (<a href="/acts/22-20.htm" title="And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting to his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.">Acts 22:20</a>). The statement came, we can scarcely doubt, from St. Paul's own lips, and in his use of the same word in the passage just referred to, and in <a href="/romans/1-32.htm" title="Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.">Romans 1:32</a>, we may see an indication that he had learnt to see that his guilt in so doing was greater, and not less, than that of the actual murderers.<p><span class= "bld">There was a great</span> <span class= "bld">persecution against the church.</span>--It is clear that this involved much suffering, imprisonment, as in <a href="/acts/8-3.htm" title="As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.">Acts 8:3</a>, perhaps the spoiling of men's goods, the being made "a gazing stock by reproaches and afflictions" (<a href="/context/hebrews/10-33.htm" title="Partly, whilst you were made a spectacle both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst you became companions of them that were so used.">Hebrews 10:33-34</a>). In St. James's description of the sufferings of the brethren (<a href="/context/james/2-6.htm" title="But you have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?">James 2:6-7</a>), we may see at once the measure of the violence of the persecution, and the prominence in it (though Saul, the Pharisee, was for the time the chief leader) of the priesthood and the rich Sadducean aristocracy. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/8-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Saul</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#945;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Saulos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4569.htm">Strong's 4569: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul, the apostle.
