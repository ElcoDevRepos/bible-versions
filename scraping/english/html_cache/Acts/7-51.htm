It originates from the imagery of an ox that refuses to be guided by the yoke. In the Old Testament, God frequently used this term to describe the Israelites when they were rebellious (<a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6</a>). It highlights a spiritual condition of pride and resistance to divine guidance.<p><b>with uncircumcised hearts and ears!</b><br>Circumcision was a physical sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). However, Stephen uses "uncircumcised hearts and ears" to indicate a lack of spiritual sensitivity and receptivity to God's message. This echoes the prophetic call for inner transformation rather than mere outward compliance (<a href="/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/44-7.htm">Ezekiel 44:7</a>). It emphasizes the need for a heart that is open to God's truth and a willingness to listen and obey.<p><b>You always resist the Holy Spirit,</b><br>The resistance to the Holy Spirit is a recurring theme in the history of Israel, as seen in their rejection of the prophets and ultimately, Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit's role is to convict, guide, and empower believers (<a href="/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8-13</a>). By resisting the Holy Spirit, the people were rejecting God's direct influence and guidance in their lives. This resistance is a continuation of the pattern of disobedience and rebellion against God's messengers.<p><b>just as your fathers did.</b><br>Stephen draws a parallel between the current generation and their ancestors, who repeatedly rejected God's messengers, including Moses and the prophets (<a href="/nehemiah/9-26.htm">Nehemiah 9:26</a>, <a href="/matthew/23-31.htm">Matthew 23:31-32</a>). This historical context underscores the continuity of rebellion and highlights the tragic pattern of ignoring God's call to repentance and faithfulness. It serves as a warning and a call to break the cycle of disobedience by embracing the message of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>A deacon in the early church, known for his wisdom and filled with the Holy Spirit.

The Sanhedrin prided themselves on the outward sign but lacked the inward reality.<p>&#8226; Uncircumcised ears refuse to listen. The prophets lamented this blockage (<a href="/jeremiah/6-10.htm">Jeremiah 6:10</a>), and now Stephen exposes it again: truth is hitting their eardrums but never entering their wills.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You always resist the Holy Spirit</b><p>&#8226; From Genesis onward, the Spirit strives with people, convicting and drawing them (<a href="/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/9-30.htm">Nehemiah 9:30</a>). Resisting is a chosen, active posture.<p>&#8226; Isaiah recorded that Israel &#8220;rebelled and grieved His Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/63-10.htm">Isaiah 63:10</a>).

The pattern is clear.<p>&#8226; Jesus warned of this inherited hardness: &#8220;You testify against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/23-31.htm">Matthew 23:31</a>).<p>&#8226; The charge invites repentance: they can break the cycle by confessing Christ, or repeat it and share their fathers&#8217; judgment (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a> confronts deliberate, generational rebellion against God.

Stephen&#8217;s words expose the danger of clinging to outward religion while resisting the living Lord who calls every heart to bow, listen, and believe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(51) <span class= "bld">Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised . . .</span>--The sudden change of tone from calm argument to vehement indignation cannot be thought of as spontaneous. The excitement of the Sanhedrin, perhaps of the listening crowd also, at this point, would seem to have become uncontrollable. The accused seemed to them to be repeating his offence with defiant boldness, and loud clamours took the place of whispered murmurs. Both the adjectives had been applied to the sins of the older Israel; "stiffnecked" in <a href="/exodus/33-3.htm" title="To a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the middle of you; for you are a stiff necked people: lest I consume you in the way.">Exodus 33:3</a>; <a href="/exodus/33-5.htm" title="For the LORD had said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, You are a stiff necked people: I will come up into the middle of you in a moment, and consume you: therefore now put off your ornaments from you, that I may know what to do to you.">Exodus 33:5</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-9.htm" title="And he said, If now I have found grace in your sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray you, go among us; for it is a stiff necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.">Exodus 34:9</a>; "uncircumcised" in <a href="/jeremiah/6-10.htm" title="To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot listen: behold, the word of the LORD is to them a reproach; they have no delight in it.">Jeremiah 6:10</a>. The actual phrase "uncircumcised in heart" had been used by Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/44-7.htm" title="In that you have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when you offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.">Ezekiel 44:7</a>) of "strangers." It was now applied to those who boasted of their exclusive privileges as Israelites, and it is scarcely possible for us to estimate the sharp incisiveness with which it, or its Aramaic equivalent, must have fallen on the ears of the Sanhedrin. It was to them all, and more than all, that "heretic" and "infidel" have been in the controversies of Christians. Here again, in St. Paul's "circumcision of the heart" (<a href="/romans/2-29.htm" title="But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.">Romans 2:29</a>), we have another echo from St. Stephen's speech. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Stiff</span>-<span class="cmt_word">necked</span>; hard of neck, inflexible.

In applying this expression to his hearers, Stephen was using the identical language of Moses when he conveyed God's rebuke to them. Considering that they professed to be standing on Moses' side against Stephen, this must have made his words doubly cutting to them. <span class="cmt_word">Uncircumcised in heart</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> only occurs here in the New Testament, but it is found in 2 Macc. 1:51 2Macc. 2:46; and in the LXX. of <a href="/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48</a>; <a href="/judges/14-3.htm">Judges 14:3</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26</a>, and elsewhere for the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>. The word, in its application to his Jewish audience, contains a whole volume of rebuke. They prided themselves on their circumcision, they trusted in it as a sure ground of favor in the sight of God; but all the while they were on a level with the heathen whom they despised, and were to be reckoned among the uncircumcised whom they loathed. For they were without the true circumcision, that of the heart. Here again Stephen was teaching in the exact spirit and even words of Moses and the prophets.
