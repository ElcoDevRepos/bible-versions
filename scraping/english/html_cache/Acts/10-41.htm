After His resurrection, Jesus did not appear to everyone but chose specific individuals to witness His risen form. This aligns with the biblical principle of God revealing Himself to those He chooses, as seen in the Old Testament with prophets and leaders. The limited appearances underscore the importance of faith and the role of the apostles as primary witnesses to the resurrection, tasked with spreading the Gospel.<p><b>but by the witnesses God had chosen beforehand</b><br>The concept of divine election is evident here, as God predetermined who would witness the resurrected Christ. This selection underscores the sovereignty of God in His redemptive plan. The chosen witnesses, primarily the apostles, were given the responsibility to testify about Jesus' resurrection, forming the foundation of the early church's witness. This echoes the Old Testament practice where God chose specific individuals, like Moses and the prophets, to carry out His purposes.<p><b>by us who ate and drank with Him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the physical reality of Jesus' resurrection. By eating and drinking with His disciples, Jesus demonstrated that He was not a ghost or spirit but had a tangible, resurrected body. This act provided undeniable proof to the apostles of His victory over death, reinforcing their testimony. The communal act of eating and drinking also reflects the fellowship and intimacy shared between Jesus and His followers, reminiscent of the Last Supper and foreshadowing the Messianic banquet.<p><b>after He rose from the dead</b><br>The resurrection is the cornerstone of Christian faith, affirming Jesus as the Son of God and validating His teachings and sacrifice. This event fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speak of the Messiah's suffering and triumph over death. The resurrection is a pivotal moment in salvation history, marking the defeat of sin and death and offering believers the hope of eternal life. It also serves as a type of firstfruits, as Paul describes in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>, indicating the future resurrection of all believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles, who is speaking in this passage.
