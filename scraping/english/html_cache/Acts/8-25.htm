Their testimony and preaching were crucial in affirming the work of the Holy Spirit among the Samaritans, a group traditionally despised by Jews. This act of testifying and speaking the word of the Lord highlights the fulfillment of Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. Their actions also reflect the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, emphasizing the importance of spreading the gospel and teaching all nations.<p><b>they returned to Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem was the center of early Christian activity and the location of the first church. The apostles' return to Jerusalem signifies the importance of maintaining a connection with the church's leadership and the base of operations for the early Christian mission. This return also underscores the unity and accountability within the early church, as the apostles reported back to the other believers and leaders.<p><b>preaching the gospel in many of the Samaritan villages</b><br>The act of preaching in Samaritan villages is significant due to the historical animosity between Jews and Samaritans. By spreading the gospel in these areas, Peter and John were breaking down long-standing barriers and fulfilling Jesus' example of reaching out to marginalized groups, as seen in <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4</a> with the Samaritan woman at the well. This outreach demonstrates the inclusive nature of the gospel and the breaking of ethnic and cultural boundaries, aligning with prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of being a light to the nations.

The apostles return to report, refuel, and maintain unity with the wider body.<p>&#8226; Their going back does not signal retreat but completion of a circuit: the gospel goes out, bears fruit, and the carriers regroup for the next assignment.<p>&#8226; This rhythm mirrors the sending-and-returning pattern Jesus set with the seventy-two (<a href="/luke/10-17.htm">Luke 10:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>preaching the gospel in many of the Samaritan villages</b><p>&#8226; Peter and John seize the journey home as ministry opportunity, stopping in &#8220;many&#8221; Samaritan villages.

Their return to Jerusalem is not a mere withdrawal but part of a purposeful travel pattern that extends the gospel&#8217;s reach. By deliberately preaching in multiple Samaritan villages, they confirm God&#8217;s heart for all peoples and model a lifestyle that turns every journey into a kingdom opportunity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">And they, when they had testified . . .</span>--The statement involves a stay of some duration, long enough to found and organise a community of disciples. And this was followed, not by an immediate return to Jerusalem, but, as the Greek tense shows, by one with many halts, at each of which the glad tidings of "the word of the Lord" were proclaimed, and a Church founded. Did the Apostles enter on this journey into the village on which one of them had sought to call down fire from heaven (<a href="/luke/9-54.htm" title="And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, will you that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?">Luke 9:54</a>)? Now, at least, he had learnt to know what manner of Spirit claimed him as his own.<p>The curtain falls at the close of this drama on the Christians of Samaria, and we know but little of their after history. The one glimpse of them which we get is, however, of very special interest. When Paul and Barnabas after their first missionary journey went up to Jerusalem, they passed "through Phenico and Samaria" (<a href="/acts/15-3.htm" title="And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy to all the brothers.">Acts 15:3</a>). St. Paul also had conquered the antagonism that divided the Jew, and, above all, the Pharisee, from the Samaritan. The Samaritans heard with joy of that conversion of the Gentiles which showed that old barriers and walls of partition were broken down. Many, we may believe, would elect to take their stand on the ground of the freedom of the gospel rather than on any claim to Jewish descent or the observance of the Jewish Law. Others, however, we know, adhered to that Law with a rigorous tenacity, and left their creed and ritual, their Gerizim worship and their sacred Books, as an inheritance to be handed down from century to century, even to the present day. The whole nation suffered severely in the wars with Rome under Vespasian, and Sychem was taken and destroyed, a new city being built by the emperor on the ruins--a Roman city with Temples dedicated to Roman gods--to which, as perpetuating the name of his house and lineage, he gave the name of <span class= "ital">Flavia Neapolis</span> (= New Town), which survives in the modern <span class= "ital">Nablous.</span> In the early history of the Church there attaches to that city the interest of having been the birthplace of the martyr Justin, and of the heretic Dositheus. In one of the Simon legends, as stated above, the latter appears as the instructor of the sorcerer, but this is probably a distortion of his real history.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> <span class="accented">- They therefore</span> for <span class="accented">and they</span>, A.V. ; <span class="accented">spoken</span> for <span class="accented">preached</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to many</span> for in <span class="accented">many</span>, A.V. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/8-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[After Peter and John]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(Hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
