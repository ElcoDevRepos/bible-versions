This reflects the common practice of philosophers and teachers being escorted to places of discussion. His being taken indicates both a level of respect and a desire to understand his message, despite potential underlying hostility.<p><b>and brought him to the Areopagus</b><br>The Areopagus, also known as Mars Hill, was a prominent rock outcropping in Athens, Greece. It served as a meeting place for the council of elders, which was responsible for overseeing matters of religion and education. This location is significant as it was a center for philosophical debate and legal matters, highlighting the importance of Paul's message being heard in such a setting. The Areopagus symbolizes the intersection of Greek philosophy and emerging Christian doctrine.<p><b>where they asked him</b><br>The act of asking Paul indicates a level of curiosity and openness among the Athenians. It reflects the Greek cultural value of dialogue and debate, which was central to their pursuit of knowledge and understanding. This approach aligns with the Socratic method, emphasizing inquiry and discussion.<p><b>&#8220;May we know what this new teaching is</b><br>The phrase "new teaching" suggests that Paul's message was perceived as novel and unfamiliar to the Athenians. This highlights the introduction of Christian doctrine into a predominantly polytheistic and philosophical society. The request to "know" underscores the Greek emphasis on knowledge and wisdom, as well as their interest in exploring new ideas.<p><b>that you are presenting?&#8221;</b><br>The word "presenting" implies that Paul was actively sharing and advocating for his beliefs. This reflects his role as an apostle and missionary, tasked with spreading the gospel. The Athenians' request to understand what Paul was presenting indicates their recognition of his authority and the potential impact of his teachings. This moment foreshadows the spread of Christianity beyond Jewish communities into the Gentile world, fulfilling the Great Commission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is central to this passage.

It had originally consisted only of those who had filled the office of Archon and were over sixty years of age. Its supreme authority had been in some measure limited by Pericles, and it was as the organ of the party who opposed the ideas of freedom and progress of which he was the representative, that 'schylus wrote the tragedy of the <span class= "ital">Eumenides, </span>in which the divine authority of the Court was impressed upon men's minds. Here, however, the narrative that follows presents no trace of a formal trial, and hence it has been questioned whether the Apostle was brought before the <span class= "ital">Court</span> of the Areopagus. Unless, however, there had been some intention of a trial, there seems no reason for their taking him to the Areopagus rather than to the Pnyx or elsewhere; and the mention of a member of the Court as converted by St. Paul's preaching, makes it probable that the Court was actually sitting at the time. The most natural explanation of the apparent difficulty is, that as the charge of bringing in "strange deities" was one which came under the jurisdiction of the Areopagus Court, the crowd who seized on St. Paul hurried him there, not presenting a formal indictment, but calling for a preliminary inquiry, that his speech accordingly, though of the nature of an <span class= "ital">apologia, </span>was not an answer to a distinct accusation, and that having heard it, the Court looked on the matter as calling for no special action, and passed to the order of the day.<p><span class= "bld">May we know . . .?</span>--The form of the question, courteous in semblance, but with a slight touch of sarcasm, is eminently characteristic in itself, and shows also that there was no formal accusation, though the words that followed suggested the thought that there possibly might be materials for one. What had been said was "strange" enough to require an explanation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> <span class="accented">- Took held of</span> for <span class="accented">took</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the Areopagus</span> for <span class="accented">Areopagus</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">teaching is</span> for <span class="accented">doctrine</span>... <span class="accented">is</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">which is spoken by thee</span> for <span class="accented">whereof thou speakest</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Took hold of him</span>.

Here the sense is well expressed by Grotius (quoted by Meyer): "Taking him gently by the hand." <span class="cmt_word">The Areopagas</span>. Mars' Hill, close to the Agora ("the market") on the north, was so called from the legend that Mars was tried there before the gods for the murder of a son of Neptune. It is (says Lewin) a bare, rugged rock, approached at the south-eastern corner by steps, of which sixteen still remain perfect. Its area at the top measures sixty paces by twenty-four, within which a quadrangle, sixteen paces square, is excavated and leveled for the court. The judges seem to have sat on benches tier above tier on the rising rock on the north side of the quadrangle. There were also seats on the east and west sides, and on the south on either side of the stairs. The Areopagus (the upper court) was the most august of all the courts at Athens. Socrates was tried and condemned before it for impiety. On the present occasion, there is no appearance of judicial proceedings, but they seem to have adjourned to the Areopagus from the Agora, as to a convenient place for quiet discussion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/17-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(te)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5037.htm">Strong's 5037: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, both.
