The title "Holy and Righteous One" emphasizes Jesus' sinlessness and divine nature, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>, which speaks of the Righteous Servant. The rejection is a fulfillment of prophecies like <a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, where the stone the builders rejected becomes the cornerstone. This rejection is significant in the context of the Jewish expectation of a Messiah who would be holy and just, yet they failed to recognize Jesus as such.<p><b>and asked that a murderer be released to you</b><br>This refers to the choice given to the crowd by Pontius Pilate during Jesus' trial, as recorded in the Gospels (e.g., <a href="/mark/15-6.htm">Mark 15:6-15</a>). The crowd chose Barabbas, a known insurrectionist and murderer, over Jesus. This decision underscores the moral and spiritual blindness of the people at that time. It also serves as a stark contrast between the innocence of Jesus and the guilt of Barabbas, highlighting the substitutionary aspect of Jesus' sacrifice. The release of Barabbas can be seen as a type of the atonement, where the guilty are set free because the innocent takes their place.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles, who is speaking to the crowd in Jerusalem.
