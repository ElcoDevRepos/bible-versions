This reflects the tension between the early Christian movement and Jewish authorities. The use of "this name" indicates the power and authority associated with Jesus, which the leaders sought to suppress. The prohibition highlights the conflict between divine commission and human authority, echoing Peter and John's earlier response that they must obey God rather than men (<a href="/acts/4-19.htm">Acts 4:19-20</a>).<p><b>he said.</b><br>The speaker is the high priest, representing the religious authority of the time. His role underscores the official opposition to the apostles' mission. The high priest's involvement signifies the seriousness with which the Jewish leaders viewed the apostles' actions, as they perceived a threat to their religious and social order.<p><b>Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching</b><br>The apostles' success in spreading the message of Jesus is evident here. Despite opposition, their teaching had permeated Jerusalem, fulfilling Jesus' command to be His witnesses in Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). This phrase indicates the rapid growth and influence of the early church, as well as the effectiveness of the apostles' ministry. It also reflects the fulfillment of prophecy, as the message of the Messiah was to begin in Jerusalem and spread outward.<p><b>and are determined to make us responsible for this man&#8217;s blood.</b><br>The Jewish leaders were concerned about being held accountable for Jesus' death. The phrase "this man&#8217;s blood" refers to the crucifixion of Jesus, for which the apostles held the Jewish leaders responsible (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23, 3</a>:15). This accusation echoes the earlier cry of the crowd, "His blood be on us and on our children" (<a href="/matthew/27-25.htm">Matthew 27:25</a>). The leaders' fear of being blamed highlights their awareness of the injustice of Jesus' execution and their desire to distance themselves from it.

The apostles, empowered by the Spirit, obey God&#8217;s call, saturate Jerusalem with the gospel, and lovingly confront the very leaders who condemned Jesus. Despite opposition, the message presses forward, offering even its fiercest opponents forgiveness through the blood they fear to acknowledge.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Did not we straitly command you . . .?</span>--The Greek presents the same Hebrew idiom as in <a href="/acts/4-17.htm" title="But that it spread no further among the people, let us straightly threaten them, that they speak from now on to no man in this name.">Acts 4:17</a>, and suggests again that it is a translation of the Aramaic actually spoken.<p><span class= "bld">Ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">with your teaching, </span>both to keep up the connection with the previous clause, and because the word is taken, as in <a href="/matthew/7-28.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:">Matthew 7:28</a>, in its wider sense, and not in the modern sense which attaches to "doctrine" as meaning a formulated opinion.<p><span class= "bld">To bring this man's blood upon us.</span>--There seems a touch, partly of scorn, partly, it may be, of fear, in the careful avoidance (as before, in "this name") of the name of Jesus.
