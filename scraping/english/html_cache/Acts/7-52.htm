The Old Testament is replete with examples, such as Elijah being pursued by Jezebel (<a href="/1_kings/19-2.htm">1 Kings 19:2-3</a>) and Jeremiah being thrown into a cistern (<a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>). This rhetorical question underscores the rebellious nature of the people against God's messengers, emphasizing a historical pattern of rejecting divine warnings and guidance.<p><b>They even killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One.</b><br>This refers to the prophets who spoke of the coming Messiah, often at great personal risk. Isaiah, for instance, prophesied about the suffering servant (Isaiah 53), and tradition holds that he was martyred. The "Righteous One" is a messianic title, pointing to Jesus Christ, who fulfills the prophecies of a savior. The killing of these prophets illustrates the severity of the rejection of God's plan and the foretelling of Christ's own rejection and crucifixion.<p><b>And now you are His betrayers and murderers&#8212;</b><br>Stephen, the speaker in this passage, directly accuses the Jewish leaders of being responsible for the betrayal and murder of Jesus, the Righteous One. This accusation is a culmination of the historical pattern of rejecting God's messengers, now reaching its peak in the rejection of the Messiah himself. The term "betrayers" connects to Judas Iscariot's betrayal (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>), while "murderers" points to the crucifixion (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>). This statement serves as a powerful indictment of the leaders' actions and a call to recognize their role in the fulfillment of the prophecies concerning the suffering of the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Stephen, is one of the first deacons of the early church and the first Christian martyr.

The pattern is clear: God speaks, Israel resists.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They even killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One.</b><p>The resistance wasn&#8217;t just verbal abuse; it escalated to murder, especially when the prophetic word centered on Messiah.<p>&#8226; Zechariah son of Jehoiada is stoned in the very temple court for warning the nation (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus cites the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah spilled &#8220;between the temple and the altar&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>).<p>&#8226; John the Baptist, &#8220;more than a prophet,&#8221; prepares the way for Jesus and is beheaded (<a href="/matthew/14-10.htm">Matthew 14:10</a>).<p>Every slain messenger pointed to &#8220;the Righteous One&#8221;&#8212;a title later applied to Jesus in <a href="/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14</a> and <a href="/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>. Isaiah had pictured Him as the suffering Servant (<a href="/bsb/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>), and Daniel spoke of Messiah being cut off (<a href="/daniel/9-26.htm">Daniel 9:26</a>). Killing the prophets did not silence God; it only sharpened the focus on the One they announced.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And now you are His betrayers and murderers&#8212;</b><p>Stephen moves from history to the present moment.<p>&#8226; The council delivered Jesus to Pilate (<a href="/luke/23-1.htm">Luke 23:1</a>; <a href="/acts/3-13.htm">Acts 3:13</a>), shouting, &#8220;Away with this Man!&#8221; (<a href="/luke/23-18.htm">Luke 23:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter had already charged them: &#8220;You killed the Author of life&#8221; (<a href="/acts/3-15.htm">Acts 3:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The crowd&#8217;s own words, &#8220;His blood be on us and on our children&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/27-25.htm">Matthew 27:25</a>), echo in Stephen&#8217;s accusation.<p>By calling them &#8220;betrayers,&#8221; Stephen points to Judas&#8217;s treachery&#8212;but also to the Sanhedrin&#8217;s role in orchestrating the arrest. By calling them &#8220;murderers,&#8221; he insists that Roman nails did not absolve Jewish leadership of culpability. The chain is unbroken: rejecting God&#8217;s prophets culminated in rejecting God&#8217;s Son.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/7-52.htm">Acts 7:52</a> compresses Israel&#8217;s tragic pattern into three swift blows: persecuting the prophets, killing the forerunners of Messiah, and finally betraying and murdering the Righteous One Himself. Stephen&#8217;s point is not merely historical; it is deeply personal, confronting his hearers with their place in that pattern and urging them to break it through repentance and faith in Jesus. The verse stands as both indictment and invitation: acknowledge the sin of resisting God&#8217;s word and turn to the very Savior who, though rejected, still offers mercy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(52) <span class= "bld">Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted?</span>--St. Stephen echoes, as it were, our Lord's own words (<a href="/matthew/5-12.htm" title="Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.">Matthew 5:12</a>; <a href="/luke/13-34.htm" title="O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which kill the prophets, and stone them that are sent to you; how often would I have gathered your children together, as a hen does gather her brood under her wings, and you would not!">Luke 13:34</a>).

And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:">1John 2:1</a>, and, perhaps, in <a href="/james/5-6.htm" title="You have condemned and killed the just; and he does not resist you.">James 5:6</a>, we find examples of its application. The recent use of it by Pilate's wife (<a href="/matthew/27-19.htm" title="When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have you nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.">Matthew 27:19</a>) may have helped to give prominence to it. He who had been condemned as a malefactor was emphatically, above all the sons of men, the "righteous," the "Just One." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 52.</span> <span class="accented">- Did not</span>... <span class="accented">persecute</span> for <span class="accented">have not</span>... <span class="accented">persecuted</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">killed</span> for <span class="accented">have slain</span>, A.V. ; <span class="accented">righteous</span> for <span class="accented">just</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">have now become</span> for <span class="accented">have</span> <span class="accented">been now</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">betrayers</span> for <span class="accented">the betrayers</span>, A.V.
