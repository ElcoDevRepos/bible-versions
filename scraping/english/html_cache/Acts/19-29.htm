Ephesus was known for the Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The disarray was caused by a riot incited by Demetrius, a silversmith who made shrines of Artemis. His livelihood was threatened by Paul's preaching, which turned people away from idol worship. This reflects the tension between the spread of Christianity and established pagan practices.<p><b>They rushed together into the theatre,</b><br>The theatre in Ephesus was a large open-air venue that could hold thousands of people. It was used for public meetings and entertainment. The gathering in the theatre signifies the seriousness of the situation, as it was a place where civic matters were often addressed. The theatre's size and centrality made it an ideal location for a large, agitated crowd to assemble.<p><b>dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus,</b><br>Gaius and Aristarchus were associates of Paul.

Their seizure by the mob highlights the danger faced by early Christians and the personal risks involved in spreading the Gospel.<p><b>Paul&#8217;s traveling companions from Macedonia.</b><br>Macedonia was a region in northern Greece, and it was significant in the early Christian mission. Paul had established churches there, as seen in his letters to the Thessalonians and Philippians.

Just as &#8220;the entire city was provoked, and the people rushed together&#8221; in Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/21-30.htm">Acts 21:30</a>), here the Ephesian populace is whipped into turmoil.<p>&#8226; The commotion flows out of the earlier verses: silversmiths feared the loss of income when people turned from idols to Christ (<a href="/acts/19-23.htm">Acts 19:23-27</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently shows how the gospel challenges entrenched sin and produces backlash (cf. <a href="/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5-6</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34-36</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase highlights the swift, contagious nature of mob mentality&#8212;hearts hardened against truth band together quickly (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They rushed together into the theatre</b><p>&#8226; The Ephesian theatre, seating about 25,000, was the obvious space for a mass rally. Public opinion often takes center stage in such venues (cf. <a href="/acts/12-21.htm">Acts 12:21-23</a>, where Herod courts a crowd).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Rushed together&#8221; mirrors the violent momentum seen in <a href="/acts/7-57.htm">Acts 7:57</a>, when Stephen&#8217;s accusers &#8220;covered their ears, and with a loud voice, they rushed together at him.&#8221; The same spirit of hostility is now aimed at Paul&#8217;s team.<p>&#8226; God allowed the theatre scene to unfold so that truth and error would be clearly contrasted before many witnesses (see <a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Even when mobs converge, the Lord remains sovereign; later verses show the town clerk restraining the violence (<a href="/acts/19-35.htm">Acts 19:35-41</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus</b><p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;dragging&#8221; underscores the mob&#8217;s brutality; righteous servants often suffer rough treatment (<a href="/acts/8-3.htm">Acts 8:3</a>; <a href="/james/2-6.htm">James 2:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Gaius and Aristarchus had not provoked the riot; they were seized simply because of their close association with Paul, illustrating Jesus&#8217; words: &#8220;If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you as well&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Their readiness to endure mistreatment exemplifies steadfast discipleship (<a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-14.htm">1 Peter 4:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Notice the courage implied&#8212;no record of them resisting or renouncing Christ, reflecting <a href="/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>: &#8220;They went out from the presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they had been counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the Name.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Paul&#8217;s traveling companions from Macedonia</b><p>&#8226; Luke identifies the men&#8217;s origin to remind readers of the gospel&#8217;s reach; Macedonia had first received Paul&#8217;s call in <a href="/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9-10</a>.<p>&#8226; Aristarchus appears again accompanying Paul to Asia and eventually to Rome (<a href="/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>; 27:2; <a href="/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>). His consistent presence validates Paul&#8217;s testimony that many co-laborers shared the cost of ministry.<p>&#8226; The Macedonian churches were known for their generosity amid trial (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-1.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1-5</a>). These companions embody that same sacrificial spirit&#8212;traveling, serving, and now suffering alongside Paul.<p>&#8226; Their mention encourages believers that God knits together a diverse, cross-regional team for His purposes (<a href="/philippians/1-3.htm">Philippians 1:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a> presents a literal snapshot of gospel confrontation in Ephesus: an entire city spirals into confusion, a mob rushes into the great theatre, and two faithful Macedonian believers are violently hauled off because they stand with Paul. The verse underscores how swiftly opposition can form when the light of Christ exposes profitable darkness, yet it also showcases the steadfast courage God supplies to His servants. The narrative invites us to trust the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty amid public hostility and to remain loyal companions in the work of the gospel, confident that He will use every circumstance&#8212;peaceful or chaotic&#8212;for the advance of His kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">The whole city was filled with confusion.</span>--The loud shouts from the quarter in which Demetrius and his workmen met would, of course, attract attention. A rumour would spread through the city that the company of strangers, who had been objects of curiosity and suspicion, were engaged in a conspiracy against the worship which was the pride and glory of their city. It was natural, in such circumstances, that they should flock together to the largest place of public concourse, and drag thither any of that company on whom they might chance to light. We may compare, as an interesting historical parallel, the excitement which was caused at Athens by the mutilation of the Hermae-busts at the time of the Sicilian Expedition under Alcibiades (Thuc. vi. 27).<p><span class= "bld">Gaius and Aristarchus.</span>--The former name represents the Roman "Caius." It was one of the commonest of Latin names, and appears as belonging to four persons in the New Testament: (1) the Macedonian mentioned here; (2) Gaius of Derbe (but see Note on <a href="/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>); (3) Gaius of Corinth, the host of St. Paul, whom he baptised with his own hands (<a href="/romans/16-23.htm" title="Gaius my host, and of the whole church, salutes you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city salutes you, and Quartus a brother.">Romans 16:23</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-14.htm" title="I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;">1Corinthians 1:14</a>); (4) Gaius to whom St. John addressed his third Epistle; (3) and (4), however, may probably be the same. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction to the Third Epistle General of John.</span>) Of Aristarchus we learn, from <a href="/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>, that he was of Thessalonica.

The description given of them, as "Paul's companions in travel" is not without significance as implying a missionary activity beyond the walls of Ephesus, in which they had been sharers. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - The <span class="accented">city</span> for <span class="accented">the whole city</span>, and <span class="accented">the confusion</span> for <span class="accented">confusion</span>, A.V. and T.R.

The common place of resort for all great meetings. So Tacitus, 'Hist.,' 2:80 (quoted by Alford), says that at Antioch the people were wont to hold their public debates in the theatre, and that a crowded meeting was held there to forward the interests of Vespasian, then aspiring to the empire. So Josephus speaks of the people of Antioch holding a public assembly (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) in the theatre ('Bell. Jud.,' 7. 3:3). The people of the Greek city of Tarentum received the ambassadors from Rome in the theatre, "according to the Greek custom," Val. Max., 2:2, 5 (Kuinoel, on <a href="/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a>). The theatre at Ephesus, of which "ruins of immense grandeur" still remain, is said to be the largest of which we have any account (Howson, 2. p. 68). <span class="cmt_word">Having seized</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); a favorite word with Luke(<a href="/acts/6-12.htm">Acts 6:12</a>; <a href="/acts/27-12.htm">Acts 27:12</a>; <a href="/luke/8-29.htm">Luke 8:29</a>); and found also in the LXX, of <a href="/proverbs/6-25.htm">Proverbs 6:25</a>; 2 Macc. 3:27 2Macc. 4:41; but not elsewhere in the New Testament. It is a common medical word of sudden seizures. The force of the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;</span> is that they hurried Gaius and Aristarchus along with them to the theatre, no doubt intending there to accuse them to the people. <span class="cmt_word">Gaius and Aristarchus</span>. In <a href="/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a> there is mention of a certain <span class="accented">Gains</span> who was one of Paul's companions in travel, but who is described as "of Derbe." Again in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-14.htm">1 Corinthians 1:14</a> a Gains is mentioned as one of St. Paul's converts on his first visit to Corinth, whom he baptized himself; and in <a href="/romans/16-23.htm">Romans 16:23</a> (written from Corinth) we have mention of Gains as St. Paul's host, and of the whole Church, likely, therefore, to be the same person. Then we have the Gains to whom St. John's Third Epistle is addressed, and whose hospitality to the brethren was a conspicuous feature in his character, and one tending to identify him with the Gaius of <a href="/romans/16-23.htm">Romans 16:23</a>. We seem, therefore, to have, in immediate connection with St, Paul, Gaius of Corinth, Gains of Macedonia, and Gains of Derbe. But Gaius (or Caius, as it is written in Latin) was such a common name, and the Jews so often shifted their residence from one city to another, that it is not safe either to infer identity from identity of name, or diversity from diversity of description. <span class="accented">Aristarchus</span>, here described as of <span class="cmt_word">Macedonia</span>, is more precisely spoken of in <a href="/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a> as a Thessalonian. In <a href="/acts/27-2.htm">Acts 27:2</a>, where we find him accompanying St. Paul from Caesarea to Rome, he is described as "a Macedonian of Thessalonica." In <a href="/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a> he is St. Paul's "fellow-prisoner,' as voluntarily sharing his prison (Alford, on <a href="/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>), and in <a href="/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a> he is his fellow-laborer. His history, therefore, is that, having been converted on St Paul's visit to Thessalonica, he attached himself to him as one of his missionary staff, and continued with him through good report and evil report, through persecution, violence, imprisonment, shipwreck, and bonds, to the latest moment on which the light of Bible history shines.
