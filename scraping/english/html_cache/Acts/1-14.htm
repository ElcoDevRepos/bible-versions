This unity is a recurring theme in the Book of Acts, highlighting the importance of collective purpose and agreement in the early church. It reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' prayer for unity among His followers (<a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>). The Greek word "homothumadon" used here suggests a deep, unanimous agreement and shared passion, which was crucial for the church's mission.<p><b>they all continued in prayer</b><br>The early believers' commitment to prayer underscores its foundational role in the life of the church. This continuous prayer reflects their dependence on God for guidance and strength, especially as they awaited the promised Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). The practice of persistent prayer is a model for believers, as seen throughout Scripture, including Jesus' own example (<a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>) and Paul's exhortation to "pray without ceasing" (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>).<p><b>along with the women</b><br>The inclusion of women in this gathering is significant, as it highlights their important role in the early church. Women were among Jesus' followers and were present at key moments in His ministry, including His crucifixion and resurrection (<a href="/luke/8.htm">Luke 8:1-3</a>, <a href="/john/20.htm">John 20:1-18</a>). This mention affirms the breaking of social barriers and the inclusive nature of the gospel, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where Paul states that in Christ, there is neither male nor female.<p><b>and Mary the mother of Jesus</b><br>Mary's presence among the disciples underscores her continued faith and involvement in the early church. As the mother of Jesus, she holds a unique place in the narrative of His life and ministry. Her presence here fulfills the prophecy of Simeon, who foretold that a sword would pierce her soul (<a href="/luke/2-35.htm">Luke 2:35</a>), as she witnessed both the suffering and the triumph of her Son. Her role also connects to the broader biblical theme of faithful women who play pivotal roles in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>and with His brothers</b><br>The mention of Jesus' brothers, who were initially skeptical of His ministry (<a href="/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a>), indicates a significant transformation. Their presence in this prayerful assembly suggests they had come to believe in Jesus as the Messiah, likely influenced by His resurrection appearances (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-7.htm">1 Corinthians 15:7</a>). This transformation is further evidenced by James, one of Jesus' brothers, who became a leader in the Jerusalem church (<a href="/acts/15-13.htm">Acts 15:13</a>) and authored the Epistle of James.

This may, perhaps, account for the variations in the list just noticed. The women were less likely than the disciples to lay stress on what we may call the accurate coupling of the Twelve. The mention of "the women" as a definite body is characteristic of St. Luke as the only Evangelist who names them. (See Notes on <a href="/context/luke/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,">Luke 8:1-3</a>; <a href="/luke/23-49.htm" title="And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.">Luke 23:49</a>.) We may reasonably think of the company as including Mary Magdalene, Salome, Susanna, Joanna, Mary and Martha of Bethany, possibly also the woman that had been a sinner, of <a href="/luke/7-37.htm" title="And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,">Luke 7:37</a>. Here we lose sight of them, and all that follows is conjectural. It is probable that they continued to share the work and the sufferings of the growing Church at Jerusalem, living together, perhaps at Bethany, in a kind of sisterhood. The persecution headed by Saul was likely to disperse them for a time, and some may well have been among the "women" who suffered in it (<a href="/acts/8-3.htm" title="As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.">Acts 8:3</a>); but they may have returned when it ceased. St. Luke, when he came to Palestine, would seem to have met with one or more of them.<p><span class= "bld">Mary the mother of Jesus.</span>--Brief as the record is, it has the interest of giving the last known fact, as distinct from legend or tradition, in the life of the mother of our Lord. St. John, we know, had taken her to his own home, probably to a private dwelling in Jerusalem (see Note on <a href="/john/19-27.htm" title="Then said he to the disciple, Behold your mother! And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home.">John 19:27</a>), and she had now come with him to the first meeting of the <span class= "ital">Ecclesia.</span> Here also we trace the influence of the women as St. Luke's informants. They could not have left unnoticed the presence of her who was the centre of their group. The legends of some apocryphal books represent her as staying at Jerusalem with St. John till her death, twenty-two years after the Ascension; while others represent her as going with him to Ephesus and dying there; the Apostles gather around her death-bed; she is buried, and the next day the grave is found emptied, and sweet flowers have grown around it; Mary also had been taken up into heaven. The festival of the Assumption, which owes its origin to this legend, dates from the sixth or seventh century. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> <span class="accented">- With one accord continued steadfastly</span> for <span class="accented">continued with one accord</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">prayer</span> for <span class="accented">prayer and supplication</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">The women</span>.

We notice the same tendency in the Acts, here, and in <a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17, 18</a>; <a href="/acts/5-14.htm">Acts 5:14</a>; <a href="/acts/9-36.htm">Acts 9:36</a>; <a href="/acts/12-13.htm">Acts 12:13</a>; <a href="/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14, 16</a>; <a href="/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4, 34</a>; <a href="/acts/18-26.htm">Acts 18:26</a>; <a href="/acts/21-9.htm">Acts 21:9</a>; <a href="/acts/24-24.htm">Acts 24:24</a>; <a href="/acts/25-23.htm">Acts 25:23</a>; etc. <span class="cmt_word">Mary the mother of Jesus</span> appears here not as an object of worship, but as humbly joining in the prayers of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">And with his brethren</span>. The Lord's brethren are spoken of by name in <a href="/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55</a> as "James, and Joses ['Joseph,' R.V.], and Simon, and Judas." So also <a href="/mark/6-3.htm">Mark 6:3</a> (see too <a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31-35</a>). "James the Lord's brother" is mentioned by St. Paul (<a href="/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>); "the brethren of the Lord "are mentioned <a href="/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>; and again in <a href="/john/7-3.htm">John 7:3, 5, 10</a>, "the brethren of Jesus" are spoken cf. This is not the place to enter upon the difficult question of their parentage. But it may suffice to say that if James and Judas are the two apostles of that name (which Alford, however, thinks they certainly were not, referring- to <a href="/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a>, compared with John 6:67), then the brethren here spoken of as distinct from the apostles would be Joses and Simon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/1-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">With one accord</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#952;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#948;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(homothymadon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3661.htm">Strong's 3661: </a> </span><span class="str2">Adverb from a compound of the base of homou and thumos; unanimously.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(houtoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pantes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
