This event follows Philip's successful evangelism in Samaria, where many believed and were baptized. The giving of the Spirit signifies the confirmation of the believers' faith and the unity of the church. The Holy Spirit's presence is a fulfillment of Jesus' promise in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where He said the disciples would receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon them.<p><b>through the laying on of the apostles&#8217; hands</b><br>The laying on of hands is a significant act in the early church, symbolizing the transmission of authority and blessing. It is a practice rooted in Jewish tradition, seen in the Old Testament when Moses laid hands on Joshua (<a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18-23</a>). In the New Testament, it is associated with healing, blessing, and the impartation of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/6-6.htm">Acts 6:6</a>, <a href="/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a>). The apostles, as direct witnesses of Christ's ministry, had a unique role in establishing the church and confirming new believers through this act.<p><b>he offered them money</b><br>Simon's offer of money to receive the power to impart the Holy Spirit reveals a misunderstanding of the nature of God's gifts. This act, known as simony, is the attempt to buy or sell spiritual things, which is condemned in scripture. It reflects a worldly mindset, contrasting with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized that the kingdom of God is not about material wealth but spiritual richness (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). Simon's action highlights the tension between his old life as a sorcerer and his new faith, illustrating the challenge of fully embracing the transformative power of the gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_the_sorcerer.htm">Simon the Sorcerer</a></b><br>A man from Samaria who practiced sorcery and amazed the people.

Simon skips the repentance and focuses on the gift.<p>&#8226; The Spirit&#8217;s coming marks genuine conversion (<a href="/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>); without Him, no one belongs to Christ.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44-47</a> the Spirit falls on Gentiles without human manipulation, reinforcing that God alone dispenses His Spirit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>through the laying on of the apostles&#8217; hands</b><p>Here God uses apostolic hands as a means, underscoring their unique, God-given authority.<p>&#8226; Earlier, the apostles laid hands on the Seven (<a href="/acts/6-6.htm">Acts 6:6</a>), and Paul later recalls a similar impartation (<a href="/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The act is symbolic: authority flows from Christ through His appointed servants, not from human skill (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment confirms that Samaritan believers are fully included in Christ&#8217;s body (<a href="/acts/8-14.htm">Acts 8:14-17</a>), countering centuries of division (<a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he offered them money</b><p>Simon treats divine power as a commodity, revealing a heart still bound by sin.<p>&#8226; Peter will confront him: &#8220;Your heart is not right before God&#8230;pray that the intent of your heart may be forgiven&#8221; (<a href="/acts/8-21.htm">Acts 8:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226; The impulse mirrors Gehazi&#8217;s greed for Naaman&#8217;s silver (<a href="/2_kings/5-20.htm">2 Kings 5:20-27</a>) and contrasts sharply with Peter&#8217;s earlier refusal of money for healing (<a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture warns that love of money corrupts faith (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>) and that one cannot serve both God and wealth (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Simon&#8217;s offer exposes a transactional mindset: power for payment, grace for gold&#8212;utterly opposed to salvation &#8220;without money and without cost&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/8-18.htm">Acts 8:18</a> reveals a clash between God&#8217;s free gift and human attempts to purchase spiritual power. Simon&#8217;s eyes are on the spectacular; the apostles&#8217; hands are instruments of divine grace; the Holy Spirit remains sovereign, bestowed by God alone. The episode warns that external amazement can mask an unconverted heart, and it calls believers to value the Giver above the gifts, guarding against any hint of treating God&#8217;s work as a marketable commodity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18, 19) <span class= "bld">When Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands. . . .</span>--The words imply that the result was something visible and conspicuous.
