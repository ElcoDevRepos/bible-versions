This event is not detailed in other biblical texts but is noted by the Jewish historian Josephus, who describes a Theudas leading a failed uprising. The timing of this event is debated, but it serves as a backdrop to illustrate the futility of movements not ordained by God.<p><b>claiming to be somebody</b><br>Theudas claimed a significant status, possibly as a messianic figure or a prophet. This reflects a common occurrence in first-century Judea, where various leaders arose, claiming divine authority or messianic roles, often leading to conflict with Roman authorities and Jewish leaders.<p><b>and about four hundred men joined him</b><br>The number of followers indicates a substantial, though not overwhelming, support. This reflects the socio-political unrest of the time, where many were eager for liberation from Roman rule and were willing to follow charismatic leaders promising change.<p><b>He was killed</b><br>Theudas's death signifies the typical end for many such leaders who opposed Roman authority. Execution or assassination was a common fate for those who led revolts, underscoring the perilous nature of such endeavors.<p><b>all his followers were dispersed</b><br>The dispersal of Theudas's followers highlights the lack of lasting impact of his movement. Without a central figure, the group quickly disbanded, illustrating the transient nature of human-led initiatives without divine backing.<p><b>and it all came to nothing</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the ultimate failure of Theudas's revolt. It serves as a cautionary example within the narrative of Acts, contrasting human efforts with the enduring and divinely supported mission of the apostles. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that only what is rooted in God's will endures, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/127.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/theudas.htm">Theudas</a></b><br>A self-proclaimed leader who gathered a following of about four hundred men.

He, however, places it, not "before the taxing"--i.e., circ. A.D. 6--but in the reign of Claudius, and under the procuratorship of Cuspius Fadus, A.D. 44, ten or twelve years after this speech of Gamaliel's. The Theudas of whom he speaks claimed to be a prophet, and promised to lead his followers across the Jordan. Fadus sent a troop of horse against him, and he was taken and beheaded. It has accordingly been inferred by some critics that we have here a blunder so portentous as to prove that the speech was made up long years after its alleged date by a writer ignorant of history, that the whole narrative of this part of the Acts is accordingly untrustworthy, and that the book requires to be sifted throughout, with a suspicious caution. On the other side, it is urged (1) that the circumstances of the two cases are not the same, Josephus speaking of a "very great multitude" as following his Theudas, while Gamaliel distinctly fixes the number of adherents at "about four hundred"; (2) that the name Theudas, whether considered as a form of the Aramaic name <span class= "ital">Thadd?us</span> (see Note on <a href="/matthew/10-3.htm" title="Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;">Matthew 10:3</a>), or the Greek <span class= "ital">Theodorus, </span>was common enough to make it probable that there had been more than one rebel of that name; (3) that Josephus mentions no less than three insurrections of this type as occurring shortly after the death of Herod the Great (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xvii. 10)--one headed by Judas (a name which appears from <a href="/matthew/10-3.htm" title="Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;">Matthew 10:3</a>, <a href="/luke/6-16.htm" title="And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.">Luke 6:16</a>, to have been interchangeable with Thaddaeus or Theudas), the head of a band of robbers who seized upon the fortress of Sepphoris; one by Simon, previously a slave of Herod's, who proclaimed himself king and burnt Herod's palaces at Jericho and elsewhere; one by Athronges and four brothers, each of whom ruled over a band, more or less numerous, of his own--and adds further, that besides these there were numerous pretenders to the name of king, who murdered and robbed at large, and that one of these may well have been identical with the Theudas of whom Gamaliel speaks; (4) that it is hardly conceivable that a writer of St. Luke's culture and general accuracy, writing in the reign of Nero, could have been guilty of such inaccuracy as that imputed to him, still less that such a mistake should have been made by any author writing after Josephus's history was in the hands of men. A writer in the reign of Henry VIII. would hardly have inverted the order of Wat Tyler and Jack Cade. The description given by Gamaliel, <span class= "ital">saying that he was some one</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>some great personage--agrees with the sufficiently vague account given by Josephus of the leaders of the revolts on the death of Herod, especially, perhaps, with that of Simon (who may have taken the name of Theudas as an <span class= "ital">alias</span> to conceal his servile origin) of whom he says that "he thought himself more worthy than any other" of kingly power.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> <span class="accented">- Giving himself out</span> for <span class="accented">boasting himself</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">dispersed</span> for <span class="accented">scattered</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">came</span> for <span class="accented">brought</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Rose up Theudas</span>. A very serious chronological difficulty arises hero. The only Theudas known to history is the one about whom Josephus writes ('Ant. Jud.,' 20:5), quoted in full by Eusebius ('Ecclesiastes Hist.,'2:11) as having pretended to be a prophet, having lured a number of people to follow him to the banks of the Jordan, by the assurance that he would part the waters of the river, and as having been pursued by order of Cuspius Fadus, the Procurator of Judaea, when numbers of his followers were slain and taken prisoners, and Theudas himself had his head cut off. But Fadus was procurator in the reign of Claudius Caesar, immediately after the death of King Agrippa, ten or twelve years after the time when Gamaliel was speaking, and about thirty years after the time at which Gamaliel places Theudas. Assuming St. Luke to be as accurate and correct here as he has been proved to be in other instances where his historical accuracy has been impugned, three ways present themselves of explaining the discrepancy. 1. Josephus may have misplaced the adventure of Theudas by some accidental error. Considering the vast number of Jewish insurrections from the death of Herod the Great to the destruction of Jerusalem, such a mistake is not very improbable. 2. There may have been two adventurers of the name of Theudas, one in the reign of Augustus Caesar, and the other in the reign of Claudius; and so both the historians may be right, and the apparent discrepancy may have no real existence (see Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). 3. The person named Theudas by Gamaliel may be the same whom Josephus speaks of ('Bell. Jud.,' it. 4:2) by the common name of Simon, as gathering a band of robbers around him, and making himself king at Herod's death ('Sonntag,' cited by Meyer, etc.). But he was killed by Gratus, and the insurrection suppressed. A variety in this last mode has also been suggested (Kitto's 'Cyclopaedia'), viz. to understand Theudas to be an Aramaic form of Theodotus, and the equivalent Hebrew form of Theodotus to be <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, Matthias, and so the person meant by <span class="accented">Theudas</span> to be a certain <span class="accented">Matthias</span> who with one Judas made an insurrection, when Herod the Great was dying, by tearing down the golden eagle which Herod had put over the great gate of the temple, and who was burnt alive with his companions, after defending his deed in a speech of great boldness and constancy ('Ant. Jud' 17:6). A consideration of these methods of explaining the apparent contradiction between the two historians shows that no certainty can without further light be arrived at. But it may be observed that it is quite impossible to suppose that any one so well informed and so accurate as St. Luke is could imagine that an event that he must have remembered perfectly, if it happened under the procuratorship of Fadus, had happened before the disturbances caused by Judas of Galilee, at least thirty years before. But it is most certain that Josephus's account of Theudas agrees better with Gamaliel's notice than that of either of the other persons suggested, irrespective of the identity of name. The first way of explaining the difficulty above proposed has, therefore, most probability in it. But some further corroboration of this explanation may be found in some of the details of Theudas's proceedings given by Josephus. He tells us that Theudes persuaded a great number of people to "collect all their possessions" and follow him to the banks of the Jordan, where he promised, like a second Elijah, to part the waters for them to pass over; that they did so, but that Fadus sent a troop of horse after them, who slew numbers of them, and amongst them their leader. Now, if this happened when the business of the census was beginning to be agitated, after the deposition of Archelaus (A.D. 6 or 7), all is plain. Theudas declaimed as a prophet against submitting to the census of their goods ordered by Augustus. The people were of the same mind. Theudas persuaded them that, if they brought all their goods to the banks of the Jordan, he would divide the stream and enable them to carry them over to the other side out of reach of the tax-gatherer. And so they made the attempt. But this was an act of rebellion against the Roman power, and a method of defeating the purpose of the census, which must be crushed at once. And so the people were pursued and slaughtered. But apart from the census of their goods, one sees no motive either for the attempt to carry away their property, or for the slaughter of an unarmed multitude by the Roman cavalry. So that the internal evidence is in favor of St. Luke's collocation of the incident, at the same time that his authority as a contemporary historian is much higher than that of Josephus. Still, one desiderates some more satisfactory proof of the error of Josephus, and some account of how he fell into it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/5-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Some time ago</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(pro)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4253.htm">Strong's 4253: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition; 'fore', i.e. In front of, prior to.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Theudas</span><br /><span class="grk">&#920;&#949;&#965;&#948;&#8118;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Theudas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2333.htm">Strong's 2333: </a> </span><span class="str2">Theudas, a Jewish pretender of date about 4 B.C., otherwise unknown.
