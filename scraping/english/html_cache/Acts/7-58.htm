This practice was also a reflection of the Old Testament law that required the removal of blasphemers from the community (<a href="/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14</a>). Stephen, accused of blasphemy, was taken outside Jerusalem, symbolizing his rejection by the religious leaders. This act parallels the treatment of Jesus, who was crucified outside the city (<a href="/john/19-17.htm">John 19:17-20</a>), highlighting the rejection of God's messengers by the religious authorities.<p><b>and began to stone him.</b><br>Stoning was a common method of execution for blasphemy and other serious offenses under Jewish law (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-7.htm">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>). It was a communal act, with the first stones typically thrown by the witnesses of the alleged crime (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">Deuteronomy 17:6-7</a>). This method of execution was brutal and public, serving as a deterrent to others. Stephen's stoning marks him as the first Christian martyr, echoing Jesus' own words about the persecution of prophets (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>). His death fulfills Jesus' prophecy that His followers would face persecution (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).<p><b>Meanwhile the witnesses laid their garments</b><br>The act of laying down garments indicates preparation for the physical exertion of stoning, as removing outer garments would allow for greater freedom of movement. This detail underscores the premeditated and deliberate nature of the execution. The witnesses, by laying down their garments, were also symbolically transferring responsibility for the act, as they were the ones who testified against Stephen, in accordance with the law that required witnesses to initiate the execution (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-7.htm">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>).<p><b>at the feet of a young man named Saul.</b><br>This introduction of Saul is significant, as he later becomes the Apostle Paul, a pivotal figure in the spread of Christianity. At this point, Saul is a zealous Pharisee, consenting to Stephen's death and actively persecuting the early church (<a href="/acts/8.htm">Acts 8:1</a>, <a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5-6</a>). His presence at Stephen's stoning foreshadows his dramatic conversion and future role in the church (<a href="/acts/9.htm">Acts 9:1-19</a>). Saul's transformation from persecutor to apostle exemplifies the power of God's grace and the fulfillment of His purposes, as seen in the life of Paul, who later reflects on his past with remorse (<a href="/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>A deacon in the early church, full of faith and the Holy Spirit, who was performing great wonders and signs among the people.

At Tarsus the boy would probably receive a two-fold education, instructed at home in the Holy Scriptures daily, and in Greek literature and philosophy in the schools for which the city was famous. Traces of the knowledge thus acquired are found in his quotations from the Cilician poet Aratus (see Note on <a href="/acts/17-28.htm" title="For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.">Acts 17:28</a>), Menander (see <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm" title="Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.">1Corinthians 15:33</a>), Epimenides (see <a href="/titus/1-12.htm" title="One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.">Titus 1:12</a>), and the Festival Hymn quoted by him at Lystra (see Note on <a href="/acts/14-17.htm" title="Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.">Acts 14:17</a>). At twelve he would become a child of the Law (see Note on <a href="/luke/2-42.htm" title="And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.">Luke 2:42</a>); and showing great devotion to the studies which thus opened on him, was probably dedicated by his parents to the calling of a scribe. This, however, did not involve the abandonment of secular occupation; and after some years spent in Jerusalem, studying under Gamaliel (we may say, with almost absolute certainty, before the commencement of our Lord's ministry), he returned to his native city, and became a "tent-maker" (<a href="/acts/18-3.htm" title="And because he was of the same craft, he stayed with them, and worked: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.">Acts 18:3</a>)--a manufacturer, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of the coarse goats' hair sail-cloth, for which Cilicia was famous. There seems reason to believe that somewhere about this time he became acquainted with Barnabas (see Note on <a href="/acts/4-36.htm" title="And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,">Acts 4:36</a>), and possibly also with St. Luke (see Note on <a href="/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1</a>; <a href="/acts/16-10.htm" title="And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel to them.">Acts 16:10</a>, and <span class= "ital">Introduction to St. Luke's Gospel</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> In the interval between the Ascension and the appointment of the Seven Deacons, he came up to Jerusalem. He finds a new sect, as it would seem, added to the three--the Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes--whom he had known before. In some respects their teaching is such as Hillel, the grandfather of Gamaliel, would have approved. They pray and fast, and give alms. They proclaim a resurrection and a judgment after death. They connect that proclamation with the belief that a teacher of Nazareth, who had died a malefactor's death, was the long-expected Messiah. What is he to think of these startling claims? What were others thinking? Gamaliel, his master, counselled caution and a policy of expectation (<a href="/context/acts/5-35.htm" title="And said to them, You men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do as touching these men.">Acts 5:35-39</a>); Barnabas, his early friend, had joined the new society (<a href="/acts/4-36.htm" title="And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,">Acts 4:36</a>); Andronicus and Junias, his kinsmen, had followed the example (<a href="/romans/16-7.htm" title="Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.">Romans 16:7</a>). But Saul had a zeal which was more fiery than theirs. He was a Pharisee after the straitest sect, and the teaching of Stephen, more conspicuously, it would seem, than that of Peter, was a protest against Pharisaism, and told of its coming downfall. He, therefore, could make no truce with that teaching, and burst impatiently from the cautions of his master. For good or for evil, he was at least "thorough," and had the courage of his convictions. Even the face as of an angel and the words of ecstatic joy did but kindle in him the fire of a burning indignation. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 58.</span> - <span class="accented">They cast</span> for <span class="accented">cast</span>, A.V. ; <span class="accented">garments</span> for <span class="accented">clothes</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the feet of a young man</span> for <span class="accented">a young man's feet</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">named Saul</span> for <span class="accented">whose name was Saul</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">They cast</span>.

A man might be called a <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> probably to the age of thirty. This appearance of Saul upon the stage of St. Luke's narrative is an element which will soon change the whole current of the narrative, and divert it from Jerusalem to the whole earth. Nothing can be more striking than this introduction of the young man Saul to our view as an accomplice (albeit "ignorantly in unbelief") in the martyrdom of Stephen. Who that stood there and saw him keeping the clothes of the witnesses would have imagined that he would become the foremost apostle of the faith which he sought to destroy from off the face of the earth? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/7-58.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They dragged [him]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;&#946;&#945;&#955;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(ekbalontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1544.htm">Strong's 1544: </a> </span><span class="str2">To throw (cast, put) out; I banish; I bring forth, produce.
