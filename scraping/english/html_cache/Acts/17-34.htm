Despite the intellectual and philosophical challenges he faced, some individuals were moved by his message. This reflects the broader pattern in Acts where the Gospel elicits varied reactions, from rejection to acceptance. The act of joining and believing signifies a commitment to the teachings of Christ, a theme consistent throughout the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a>, <a href="/acts/4-4.htm">Acts 4:4</a>).<p><b>including Dionysius the Areopagite</b><br>Dionysius is identified as an Areopagite, indicating he was a member of the Areopagus, the high court of Athens. This suggests that Paul's message reached influential and educated individuals. The Areopagus was a significant cultural and judicial center, and Dionysius's conversion is notable as it represents the Gospel's penetration into the heart of Greek intellectualism. His conversion is a testament to the power of the Gospel to transcend cultural and philosophical barriers.<p><b>a woman named Damaris</b><br>The mention of Damaris is significant as it highlights the inclusive nature of the early Christian movement, which welcomed both men and women. In a patriarchal society, the acknowledgment of a woman's conversion underscores the radical nature of the Gospel, which offers salvation to all, regardless of gender. This aligns with other New Testament passages that emphasize the role of women in the early church (e.g., <a href="/romans/16.htm">Romans 16:1-2</a>, <a href="/philippians/4-2.htm">Philippians 4:2-3</a>).<p><b>and others who were with them</b><br>This phrase indicates that Dionysius and Damaris were not alone in their belief; there were others who also accepted Paul's message. This suggests the beginning of a Christian community in Athens, a city known for its philosophical diversity. The formation of such communities is a recurring theme in Acts, illustrating the spread of Christianity across different regions and cultures.

According to a tradition, ascribed by Eusebius (<span class= "ital">Hist.</span> iii. 4, iv. 23) to Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth, he became Bishop of Athens. An elaborate treatise on the Hierarchy of Heaven, Cherubim, Seraphim, Thrones, Dominations, and the like, is extant under his name, but is obviously of much later date, probably of the fourth or fifth century. The legend of the Seven Champions of Christendom has transformed him into the St. Denys of France. A church dedicated to him stands on the Areopagus of modern Athens.<p><span class= "bld">Damaris.</span>--Chrysostom says that she was the wife of Dionysius, but this is obviously only a conjecture.<p><span class= "bld">And others with them.</span>--The contrast between this and the "great multitude," the "many" at Thessalonica and Ber?a, is very significant. Not less striking is the absence of any reference to Athens in St. Paul's Epistles. Of all the cities which he visited, it was that with which he had least sympathy. All that can be said is that he may have included them among "the saints which are in all Achaia" (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:">2Corinthians 1:1</a>) in his prayers and hopes. It would almost seem as if he felt that little was gained by entering into a discussion on the great questions of natural theology; and therefore he came to Corinth, determined to know nothing "but Jesus Christ, and Him crucified" (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-2.htm" title="For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.">1Corinthians 2:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> <span class="accented">- But</span> for <span class="accented">howbeit</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">whom also</span> for <span class="accented">the which</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Dionysius the Areopagite</span>. The earliest notice we have of him in ecclesiastical writers is the well-known one of Eusebius, 'Eccl. Hist.,' 3. 4, in which he says, "We are told by an ancient writer, Dionysius the pastor of the diocese of Corinth (ob. ), that his namesake Dionysius the Areopagite, of whom St. Luke says in the Acts that he was the first who embraced the faith after St. Paul's discourse in the Areopagus, became the first bishop of the Church in Athens." Eusebius repeats the statement in his long notice of Dionysius of Corinth, in 4. 23. Other uncertain traditions speak of him (Suidas) as one who rose to the height of Greek erudition, and as having suffered a cruel martyrdom (Niceph., 3:11). "The works which go by his name are undoubtedly spurious" (Alford). <span class="cmt_word">Damaris</span>; "wholly unknown" (Meyer), but certainly not the wife of Dionysius, as Chrysostom (' De Sacerd.,' 4:7) and others have thought ('Dictionary of the Bible'). <span class="cmt_word">And others with them</span>. These would seem to be but few from St. Luke's way of mentioning them, and from our hearing nothing more in the Acts about the Church at Athens. It is remarkable that this small number of converts coincides with the weakness of the synagogue at Athens - too weak to persecute, and too weak to make proselytes among the Greeks of Athens. It scorns clear that nowhere else had St. Paul won so few souls to Christ. And yet God's Word did not return to him wholly void. The seed fell on some good ground, to bring forth fruit unto eternal life. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/17-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">some</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#957;&#8050;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tines)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
