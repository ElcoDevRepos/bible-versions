In biblical narratives, standing often symbolizes preparation for service or receiving a commission (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/2.htm">Ezekiel 2:1</a>). The context here is Paul's encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus, a pivotal moment in his conversion and mission. The physical act of standing reflects a spiritual awakening and readiness to fulfill God's purpose.<p><b>For I have appeared to you</b><br>The appearance of Jesus to Paul is a direct divine intervention, emphasizing the personal nature of God's call. This encounter is a theophany, similar to other biblical instances where God reveals Himself to individuals (e.g., Moses at the burning bush in <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a>). It underscores the authority and authenticity of Paul's apostleship, as he later defends in his letters (<a href="/galatians/1-12.htm">Galatians 1:12</a>).<p><b>to appoint you as a servant</b><br>The term "servant" denotes humility and submission to God's will. In the New Testament, servanthood is a key aspect of Christian discipleship, modeled by Jesus Himself (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). Paul's role as a servant aligns with the prophetic tradition of being chosen to carry out God's mission, akin to the prophets of the Old Testament.<p><b>and as a witness</b><br>Being a witness involves testifying to the truth of the Gospel. Paul's mission is to bear witness to both Jews and Gentiles, as seen throughout Acts. This role is foundational to the early church's expansion and is a fulfillment of Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>. The concept of witnessing is central to Christian evangelism and the spread of the faith.<p><b>of what you have seen from Me</b><br>This phrase refers to Paul's firsthand experience of the risen Christ, which is a cornerstone of his testimony. The personal encounter with Jesus is crucial for Paul's authority and message, as he often recounts this experience to validate his mission (<a href="/acts/22-6.htm">Acts 22:6-11</a>). It highlights the transformative power of encountering Christ.<p><b>and what I will show you.</b><br>This indicates ongoing revelation and guidance from Jesus to Paul. It suggests that Paul's understanding and mission will continue to unfold through divine instruction. This promise of future revelation is consistent with the biblical theme of progressive revelation, where God gradually reveals His plans and purposes (e.g., the unfolding of prophecy in the Old Testament).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul (formerly Saul of Tarsus)</a></b><br>A Pharisee and persecutor of Christians who encountered Jesus on the road to Damascus and became a pivotal apostle to the Gentiles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The risen Lord who appeared to Paul, commissioning him for a specific mission to spread the Gospel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/road_to_damascus.htm">Road to Damascus</a></b><br>The location where Paul experienced his transformative encounter with Jesus, leading to his conversion and calling.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_agrippa.htm">King Agrippa</a></b><br>The ruler before whom Paul is making his defense, recounting his conversion and mission.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/witness_and_servant.htm">Witness and Servant</a></b><br>The roles Jesus assigns to Paul, emphasizing his duty to testify about Jesus and serve His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_appointment.htm">Divine Appointment</a></b><br>God has specific purposes for each believer, just as He appointed Paul.

And the Lord said to me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told you of all things which are appointed for you to do.">Acts 22:10</a>, and may fairly be thought of as embodying what followed on the actual words so recorded, the substance of "the visions and revelations of the Lord" (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.">2Corinthians 12:1</a>), by which, in those days of blindness and ecstasy, the future of his life was marked out for him, and the gospel which he was to preach revealed in its fulness. In such states of consciousness, the man who is in contact with the supernatural life does not take note of the sequence of thoughts with the precision of a short-hand reporter.<p><span class= "bld">A minister and a witness.</span>--The first word is the same as that which the Apostle uses of himself in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.">1Corinthians 4:1</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <span class="accented">- Arise</span> for <span class="accented">rise</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to this end have I</span>, etc., for <span class="accented">I have</span>, etc., <span class="accented">for this purpose</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">appoint</span> for <span class="accented">make</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the things wherein thou hast seen me</span> for <span class="accented">these things which thou hast seen</span>, A.V. and T.R.; the <span class="accented">things wherein</span> for <span class="accented">those things in the which</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">For to this end have I appeared</span>, etc. On comparing this statement with those in <a href="/acts/9-6.htm">Acts 9:6</a> and <a href="/acts/22-10.htm">Acts 22:10, 14, 15</a>, it appears that in this condensed account given before King Agrippa, St. Paul blends into one message the words spoken to him when the Lord first appeared to him, and the instruction subsequently given to him through Ananias, and the words spoken to him in the trance (<a href="/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17-21</a>).
