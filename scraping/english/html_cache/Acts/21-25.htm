The early church faced challenges integrating Gentiles, who were not bound by Jewish law, into a predominantly Jewish community. This distinction is crucial as it highlights the early church's efforts to maintain unity while respecting cultural differences.<p><b>we have written to them our decision</b><br>The decision mentioned here refers to the Jerusalem Council's decree in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>. This council was a pivotal moment in church history, addressing whether Gentile converts needed to follow Jewish law. The apostles and elders, guided by the Holy Spirit, concluded that imposing the full Mosaic Law on Gentiles was unnecessary, emphasizing grace over legalism.<p><b>that they must abstain from food sacrificed to idols</b><br>This prohibition is rooted in the concern for idolatry, a major issue in the Greco-Roman world. Eating such food could imply participation in pagan worship, which was incompatible with Christian faith. Paul later addresses this in <a href="/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>, discussing the conscience and the impact on weaker believers.<p><b>from blood</b><br>The command to abstain from blood has its origins in the Noahic covenant (<a href="/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>) and was reinforced in Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>). This reflects a respect for life and God's creation, as blood symbolizes life itself.<p><b>from the meat of strangled animals</b><br>Strangled animals retain blood, thus violating the prohibition against consuming blood. This practice was common in pagan rituals, and abstaining from it helped Gentile believers distance themselves from their former pagan practices.<p><b>and from sexual immorality</b><br>Sexual immorality was rampant in the pagan world, often linked to idol worship. The early church upheld the sanctity of marriage and sexual purity, aligning with Old Testament teachings (Leviticus 18) and Jesus' teachings on marriage and purity (<a href="/matthew/5-27.htm">Matthew 5:27-32</a>).<br><br>This decree aimed to foster unity and holiness within the diverse body of Christ, balancing freedom in Christ with sensitivity to Jewish customs and the moral law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentile_believers.htm">Gentile Believers</a></b><br>Non-Jewish converts to Christianity who were part of the early church.

He has no desire to withdraw any concession that was then made, and the Judaisers who in Galatia and elsewhere were, in his name, urging the necessity of circumcision, were acting without authority. He thinks it fair to call on St. Paul to show that he too adheres to the compact, and has no wish to disparage the "customs" of the Law. St Paul, it will be seen, readily acts upon the suggestion.
