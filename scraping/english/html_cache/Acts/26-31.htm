In the context of <a href="/acts/26.htm">Acts 26</a>, Paul has just presented his defense before King Agrippa, Festus, and other dignitaries. The setting is likely the audience hall in Caesarea, a significant Roman administrative center. The phrase suggests a transition from the formal setting of judgment to a more private discussion among the officials.<p><b>they said to one another</b><br>This implies a private conversation among the officials, away from the public eye. It reflects the common practice of Roman and Jewish leaders to confer among themselves after hearing a case. This dialogue indicates a consensus or shared opinion among those present, highlighting the informal yet significant nature of their discussion.<p><b>&#8220;This man has done nothing worthy of death or imprisonment.&#8221;</b><br>This statement is a declaration of Paul's innocence regarding the charges brought against him. It echoes the Roman legal principle of justice, where punishment must fit the crime. The phrase aligns with other instances in Acts where Roman authorities find no fault in Paul (<a href="/acts/23-29.htm">Acts 23:29</a>, <a href="/acts/25-25.htm">Acts 25:25</a>). It also parallels the trial of Jesus, where Pilate found no basis for a death sentence (<a href="/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4</a>, <a href="/john/18-38.htm">John 18:38</a>).
