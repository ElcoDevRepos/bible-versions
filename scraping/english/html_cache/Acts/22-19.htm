The use of "Lord" reflects reverence and submission. In the context of <a href="/acts/22.htm">Acts 22</a>, Paul is recounting his conversion experience and his dialogue with Jesus. This mirrors other biblical instances where individuals respond to divine encounters, such as Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) and Isaiah's vision (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>).<p><b>&#8216;they know very well</b><br>Paul refers to the Jewish leaders and community who were aware of his previous zeal in persecuting Christians. This acknowledgment highlights Paul's former reputation and the drastic change in his life. It underscores the authenticity of his testimony, as his transformation was public and undeniable. This is similar to the transformation of other biblical figures, such as Zacchaeus (<a href="/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>) and the Apostle Peter (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>).<p><b>that in one synagogue after another</b><br>Synagogues were central to Jewish religious life and community gatherings. They served as places of worship, teaching, and legal matters. Paul's mention of synagogues emphasizes the widespread nature of his persecution efforts. This reflects the historical context of the early church, where synagogues were often the first places the apostles visited to preach the Gospel (<a href="/acts/13-5.htm">Acts 13:5, 14</a>).<p><b>I imprisoned and beat</b><br>Paul's actions before his conversion were marked by violence and legal authority against Christians. This phrase highlights the severity of his persecution, which included imprisonment and physical punishment. It reflects the historical reality of early Christian persecution by Jewish authorities, as seen in the accounts of Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-54.htm">Acts 7:54-60</a>) and other early believers (<a href="/acts/8.htm">Acts 8:1-3</a>).<p><b>those who believed in You.</b><br>This refers to the early Christians who professed faith in Jesus as the Messiah. The phrase underscores the central conflict between the nascent Christian movement and traditional Jewish beliefs. It also highlights the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy that His followers would face persecution (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>). Paul's later writings, such as in <a href="/philippians/3-6.htm">Philippians 3:6-7</a>, reflect his deep remorse and transformation from persecutor to apostle.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul (formerly Saul)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, Paul is recounting his past actions before his conversion to Christianity.

The title also reflects submission; just as believers such as Ananias (<a href="/acts/9-13.htm">Acts 9:13</a>) and Peter (<a href="/acts/10-14.htm">Acts 10:14</a>) responded to divine visions with &#8220;Lord,&#8221; Paul&#8217;s plea is framed in worshipful obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I answered,</b><p>This phrase shows Paul in conversation, not confrontation, with the risen Jesus. His willingness to &#8220;answer&#8221; demonstrates a relationship in which questions, confessions, and explanations are welcomed (see <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, where the Lord says, &#8220;Come now, let us reason together&#8221;). <a href="/acts/26-15.htm">Acts 26:15</a> repeats this responsive dialogue, underscoring that genuine faith invites ongoing, honest interaction with God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they know very well</b><p>Paul appeals to the public nature of his past. His former life was no secret; Jerusalem&#8217;s residents could testify to his zeal (<a href="/acts/9-13.htm">Acts 9:13</a>&#8208;14). This transparency magnifies the credibility of his conversion: the greater the notoriety of his persecution, the stronger the evidence for the transforming power of Christ (<a href="/galatians/1-23.htm">Galatians 1:23</a>&#8208;24).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that in one synagogue after another</b><p>Persecution was not a momentary lapse but an organized campaign. Synagogues, the local hubs of Jewish life, became Paul&#8217;s primary arenas for hunting believers (<a href="/acts/26-11.htm">Acts 26:11</a>). The phrase signals relentless pursuit&#8212;city after city, gathering after gathering (compare <a href="/acts/8-3.htm">Acts 8:3</a>, where he &#8220;ravaged the church, entering house after house&#8221;). Paul did not merely oppose an idea; he executed a strategy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I imprisoned and beat</b><p>These verbs reveal severity. He used legal authority to lock up saints (<a href="/acts/26-10.htm">Acts 26:10</a>) and physical violence to intimidate them (<a href="/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13</a> calls him &#8220;a violent man&#8221;). The law allowed thirty&#8208;nine lashes (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-2.htm">Deuteronomy 25:2</a>&#8208;3), and Paul once enforced that very penalty on the faithful he would later love (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-24.htm">2 Corinthians 11:24</a> shows him enduring the same). His admission underscores how deep sin can go&#8212;and how deeper grace can reach.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>those who believed in You.</b><p>To strike the disciples is to strike Jesus Himself (<a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a>, &#8220;Why do you persecute Me?&#8221;). By targeting &#8220;those who believed,&#8221; Paul was attacking the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>). Jesus had warned, &#8220;A servant is not greater than his master; if they persecuted Me, they will persecute you also&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>). Paul&#8217;s confession now affirms that truth and highlights the unity between the risen Lord and His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/22-19.htm">Acts 22:19</a> records Paul&#8217;s honest reminder to Jesus of his notorious past: &#8220;Lord, I answered, they know very well that in one synagogue after another I imprisoned and beat those who believed in You.&#8221; Each phrase reveals a tapestry of grace: acknowledgment of Christ&#8217;s lordship, open dialogue with God, public testimony of radical change, relentless former zeal redirected to gospel mission, deep awareness of former brutality, and recognition that persecuting believers is persecuting Christ. The verse is Paul&#8217;s humble confession and a powerful witness that no sin is beyond the reach of the Savior he now serves.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Lord, they know that I imprisoned</span> <span class= "bld">. .</span>--This was said at the time, and it was repeated now. as with a two-fold bearing. It was partly an extenuation of the unbelief of the people. They were, as he had once been, sinning in ignorance, which, though as yet unconquered, was not invincible. Partly it expressed the hope that they too might listen when they saw him whom they had known as a vehement persecutor preaching the faith which he had once destroyed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> <span class="accented">- They themselves</span> for <span class="accented">they</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">In every synagogue</span>.

A delation to any synagogue that any member of it was a blasphemer (i.e. a Christian) would lead to such a punishment. But probably the meaning here rather is that he went or sent to every synagogue to find out who there was among them that believed in Jesus, and then had them punished at Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/22-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8216;Lord,&#8217;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Kyrie)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2962.htm">Strong's 2962: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lord, master, sir; the Lord.
