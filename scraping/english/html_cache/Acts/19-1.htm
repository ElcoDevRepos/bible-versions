His presence in Corinth indicates the spread of early Christianity beyond Jerusalem and Judea into the Gentile world. Corinth was a major city in ancient Greece, known for its commerce and immorality, making it a significant location for the early church. Apollos' ministry there highlights the diverse backgrounds of early Christian leaders and the importance of teaching and discipleship in the growth of the church.<p><b>Paul passed through the interior</b><br>Paul's journey through the interior refers to his travels through the regions of Asia Minor, which is modern-day Turkey. This area was a crossroads of cultures and religions, providing fertile ground for the spread of the Gospel. Paul's missionary journeys were strategic, often targeting major cities and trade routes to maximize the impact of his ministry. His travels demonstrate his commitment to fulfilling the Great Commission by reaching both Jews and Gentiles.<p><b>and came to Ephesus</b><br>Ephesus was a prominent city in the Roman province of Asia, known for its temple to Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It was a center of commerce, religion, and culture, making it a key location for Paul's missionary work. Ephesus later became an important center for early Christianity, as evidenced by Paul's extended stay there and his subsequent letter to the Ephesians. The city's spiritual climate, marked by pagan worship and magic, provided a backdrop for the power of the Gospel to transform lives.<p><b>There he found some disciples</b><br>The disciples Paul encountered in Ephesus were likely followers of John the Baptist, as indicated by the subsequent verses. This encounter underscores the transitional period of the early church, where some believers had not yet received the full revelation of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. Paul's interaction with these disciples highlights the importance of sound doctrine and the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of a believer. It also reflects the ongoing work of the apostles to ensure that the message of Christ was accurately understood and embraced.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/apollos.htm">Apollos</a></b><br>A learned Jew from Alexandria, known for his eloquence and knowledge of the Scriptures.
