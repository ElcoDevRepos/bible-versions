Philip's immediate response highlights the importance of obedience to divine guidance, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture, such as in the call of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-4</a>) and the commissioning of the disciples (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<p><b>and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch</b><br>The Ethiopian eunuch represents a significant figure in the narrative, as he is a Gentile and a high-ranking official. Ethiopia, in biblical times, referred to the region south of Egypt, often associated with the ancient kingdom of Cush. Eunuchs were often employed in royal courts due to their perceived trustworthiness and inability to establish a competing dynasty. This encounter signifies the expanding reach of the Gospel beyond Jewish boundaries, aligning with the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3-5</a> about eunuchs being included in God's people.<p><b>a court official in charge of the entire treasury of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians</b><br>The title "Candace" was not a personal name but a dynastic title for the queen mothers of Ethiopia, similar to "Pharaoh" in Egypt. The eunuch's role as a treasurer indicates his high status and influence. This detail underscores the fulfillment of the Great Commission (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>), as the Gospel begins to reach the ends of the earth, symbolized by Ethiopia, considered a distant land.<p><b>He had gone to Jerusalem to worship</b><br>This phrase suggests that the eunuch was a God-fearer or a proselyte, someone who revered the God of Israel and followed certain Jewish practices. His journey to Jerusalem for worship indicates a deep spiritual hunger and devotion, despite the limitations he would have faced in the temple due to his status as a eunuch (<a href="/deuteronomy/23.htm">Deuteronomy 23:1</a>).

Its connection with the Jewish people presents many points of interest. There seems reason to believe that in the time of Manasseh, who (according to the statement in the narrative of Aristeas as to the LXX. translation) formed an alliance with Psammetichus king of Egypt, a considerable body of Jews were sent off to protect the outposts of his kingdom, and it is in reference, probably, to these that Zephaniah speaks of the suppliants of "the daughter of my dispersed beyond the rivers of Ethiopia" (<a href="/zephaniah/3-10.htm" title="From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring my offering.">Zephaniah 3:10</a>). Jewish influences had accordingly been at work there for some centuries. They may probably be traced in the piety of the Ethiopian eunuch, Ebed-melech, in the time of Jeremiah (<a href="/context/jeremiah/38-7.htm" title="Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;">Jeremiah 38:7-13</a>; <a href="/context/jeremiah/39-16.htm" title="Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words on this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that day before you.">Jeremiah 39:16-18</a>). Even at an earlier period the hopes of Israel had looked forward to, perhaps had actually seen, the admission of Ethiopians among the citizens of Zion (<a href="/psalms/87-4.htm" title="I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.">Psalm 87:4</a>), Ethiopia stretching forth her hands unto God (<a href="/psalms/68-31.htm" title="Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands to God.">Psalm 68:31</a>). The fact that the traveller had come as a pilgrim or a proselyte, shows (if, as the narrative implies, the latter) that he was a circumcised "proselyte of righteousness." His baptism was not, like that of Cornelius, the admission of a Gentile as such. The word "eunuch" has been taken by some commentators as meaning only "chamberlain," which is, indeed, the strict etymological sense of the word. Its use in <a href="/matthew/19-12.htm" title="For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.">Matthew 19:12</a>, and indeed in later Greek writers generally, is, however, in favour of the literal sense of the word. The strict letter of <a href="/deuteronomy/23-1.htm" title="He that is wounded in the stones, or has his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.">Deuteronomy 23:1</a>, forbidding the admission of such persons into the congregation of the Lord, had been already modified (probably on the assumption that the state was not one which they had brought about by their own act) in favour of the sons of the stranger, the eunuchs "who keep my Sabbaths," by Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/56-4.htm" title="For thus said the LORD to the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant;">Isaiah 56:4</a>); and we may well think of St. Luke, as glad to record a proof that the discipline of the Church of Christ was as liberal on this point as the teaching of the Evangelical prophet. It is interesting to note that the first act of the first (Ecumenical Council was to formulate a like rule in dealing with such cases of the kind as then presented themselves (<span class= "ital">Conc. Nic. Song of Solomon 1</span>), admitting those who were not self-mutilated even into the ranks of the clergy. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - Was <span class="accented">over</span> for <span class="accented">had the charge of</span>, A.V. ; <span class="accented">who</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.
