In the context of first-century Judea, a group of over forty individuals would represent a substantial faction, likely composed of zealots or those fervently opposed to Roman rule and any perceived collaborators. The number forty is often symbolic in the Bible, representing periods of testing or judgment, such as the forty days of rain during the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>) or the forty years the Israelites wandered in the desert (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33</a>).<p><b>were involved in this plot</b><br>The plot refers to the conspiracy to kill Paul, who was seen as a threat to Jewish traditions and the authority of the Sanhedrin. This reflects the intense opposition Paul faced from Jewish leaders who viewed his teachings about Jesus as blasphemous and a threat to their power. The involvement in a plot to kill Paul highlights the extreme measures some were willing to take to silence him, reminiscent of the plots against Jesus (<a href="/matthew/26-3.htm">Matthew 26:3-4</a>). This also underscores the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy that His followers would face persecution (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>). The historical context of Roman occupation and the Jewish desire for autonomy further fueled such conspiracies, as any disruption to the status quo could provoke Roman intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_conspirators.htm">The Conspirators</a></b><br>A group of more than forty Jewish men who took an oath to neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.

Luke notes the size so we grasp the gravity of the threat; a sworn band of over forty men is large enough to overwhelm a small Roman escort or ambush Paul on the road (cf. <a href="/acts/23-23.htm">Acts 23:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often highlights numbers to show either divine reduction for dependence on God (<a href="/judges/7-4.htm">Judges 7:4&#8211;7</a>) or human escalation against His servants (<a href="/luke/22-47.htm">Luke 22:47&#8211;48</a>). Here, the escalation underscores how fiercely the gospel provokes opposition (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of them</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Them&#8221; refers to the Jews who &#8220;formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath&#8221; (<a href="/acts/23-12.htm">Acts 23:12</a>). They were likely Zealot-minded men from the Sanhedrin&#8217;s circle, not random onlookers.<p>&#8226; Their religious identity is sobering: people who prized the Law plotted murder, echoing earlier hostility toward Jesus (<a href="/matthew/26-3.htm">Matthew 26:3&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/john/11-53.htm">John 11:53</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul himself had once been &#8220;of them&#8221; in persecuting believers (<a href="/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3&#8211;5</a>), showing how zeal apart from the Spirit can turn violent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were involved</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Involved&#8221; signals deliberate participation, not passive agreement. These men &#8220;bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul&#8221; (<a href="/acts/23-12.htm">Acts 23:12</a>), invoking a self-imposed curse if they failed.<p>&#8226; Scripture warns against joining hands with the wicked (<a href="/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10&#8211;16</a>) and condemns rash vows (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4&#8211;6</a>). Their collective vow magnifies their accountability.<p>&#8226; Similar group conspiracies appear against righteous servants: Daniel (<a href="/daniel/6-4.htm">Daniel 6:4&#8211;9</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/11-18.htm">Jeremiah 11:18&#8211;19</a>). God delivered both, as He will now protect Paul.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in this plot</b><p>&#8226; The plot&#8217;s aim was simple: assassinate the apostle before he could stand trial. This mirrors later requests to have Paul &#8220;brought down to Jerusalem&#8230; so that they could kill him on the way&#8221; (<a href="/acts/25-3.htm">Acts 25:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Behind human scheming lies spiritual warfare (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>). Paul later writes of being &#8220;in danger from my own countrymen&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-26.htm">2 Corinthians 11:26</a>), recalling moments like this.<p>&#8226; Yet God&#8217;s sovereignty overrules plots. He had told Paul, &#8220;Take courage&#8230; you must also testify in Rome&#8221; (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>). The Lord turns human malice into stages for gospel advance, just as with Joseph (&#8220;You meant evil against me, but God intended it for good,&#8221; <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/23-13.htm">Acts 23:13</a> reveals a determined, numerically significant conspiracy&#8212;over forty zealous Jews united by oath to murder Paul. Their identity, oath, and carefully laid plan show how fiercely the unregenerate heart can oppose the gospel. At the same time, the verse highlights God&#8217;s protective hand: no matter how many plotters, His purpose for Paul to witness in Rome stands firm.
