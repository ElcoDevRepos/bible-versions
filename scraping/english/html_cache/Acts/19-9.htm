The term "stubbornly refused" indicates a hardened heart, reminiscent of Pharaoh's resistance in Exodus. This resistance is a common theme in Acts, where the Jewish leaders often reject the message of Jesus as the Messiah. The Greek word used here implies a willful disobedience and a refusal to be persuaded, reflecting a spiritual blindness that Paul addresses in <a href="/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>.<p><b>and publicly maligned the Way</b><br>"The Way" was an early term for Christianity, emphasizing the path of following Jesus, who declared Himself "the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). Public maligning suggests open opposition and slander, which was a significant challenge for the early church. This opposition is similar to the persecution faced by the prophets in the Old Testament and foreshadows the trials Christians would endure throughout history.<p><b>Paul took his disciples and left the synagogue</b><br>Paul's departure from the synagogue marks a strategic shift in his ministry. Synagogues were central to Jewish life, serving as places of worship and community. By leaving, Paul acknowledges the closed hearts of the Jewish leaders and turns his focus to the Gentiles, fulfilling his role as the apostle to the Gentiles (<a href="/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>). This move is consistent with Jesus' instruction to shake the dust off one's feet when a message is rejected (<a href="/matthew/10-14.htm">Matthew 10:14</a>).<p><b>to conduct daily discussions in the lecture hall of Tyrannus</b><br>The lecture hall of Tyrannus was likely a public space used for teaching and philosophical discussions, common in Greco-Roman cities. This setting allowed Paul to reach a broader audience, including Gentiles and those interested in philosophical and religious ideas. The daily discussions indicate a committed and systematic approach to teaching, similar to the rabbinic tradition of daily study. This method of teaching aligns with the Great Commission's call to make disciples of all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is central to the events in <a href="/bsb/acts/19.htm">Acts 19</a>.

Originally meaning "leisure," it was applied to leisure as bestowed on study, then, as here, to the place in which study was pursued; lastly, as in our phrase, "the school of Zeno or Epicurus," as a collective term for the followers of a conspicuous teacher. In this case, it was probably a lecture-room which, as the private property of the owner, was lent or let to the Apostle.<p>Of the Tyrannus here mentioned nothing more is known with certainty, but the name is connected with one or two interesting coincidences that are more or less suggestive.

Both names and professions in this class were very commonly hereditary, and the hypothesis that this Tyrannus was also a physician, and that, as such, he may have known St. Luke, or, possibly, may have been among the Jews whom the decree of Claudius (<a href="/acts/18-2.htm" title="And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came to them.">Acts 18:2</a>) had driven from Rome, and so shared the faith of Aquila and Priscilla, fits in with and explains the facts recorded.

Lightfoot, Meyer, Alford, and others think that the Tyrannus here spoken of was a Jew; Lange, Olshausen, Howson, Farrar, Lewin, etc., think he was a Greek philosopher or rhetorician. Some think that "the school of Tyrannus" was the name of the lecture-room from some former teacher (see Renan. p. 345). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/19-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8033;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5613.htm">Strong's 5613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably adverb of comparative from hos; which how, i.e. In that manner.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">some of them</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tines)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
