Caesarea was a hub of Roman administration and culture, which made it a strategic location for the spread of Christianity. The disciples' willingness to accompany Paul and his companions reflects the early Christian practice of hospitality and support for fellow believers, as seen in other parts of the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/acts/9-30.htm">Acts 9:30</a>, <a href="/acts/15-3.htm">Acts 15:3</a>). This also highlights the unity and fellowship among early Christians, transcending geographical and cultural boundaries.<p><b>and they took us to stay at the home of Mnason the Cypriot</b><br>Mnason is described as a Cypriot, indicating his origins from Cyprus, an island with a significant early Christian presence, partly due to the missionary work of Barnabas and Paul (<a href="/acts/13-4.htm">Acts 13:4-12</a>). The mention of Mnason's home suggests he was a person of some means, able to offer lodging to Paul and his companions. This act of hospitality is consistent with the early church's emphasis on supporting itinerant preachers and missionaries (<a href="/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13, 3</a> <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5-8</a>). The practice of staying in the homes of fellow believers was common, as it provided safety and fellowship in a time when Christians were often viewed with suspicion.<p><b>an early disciple</b><br>Mnason is noted as an "early disciple," implying he was among the first converts to Christianity, possibly dating back to the time of Pentecost or shortly thereafter. This designation suggests a deep-rooted faith and possibly a firsthand experience of the early church's formative events. His status as an early disciple would have lent credibility and authority within the Christian community, as those who had been with Jesus or the apostles from the beginning were often held in high regard (<a href="/acts/1-21.htm">Acts 1:21-22</a>). This connection to the early days of the church underscores the continuity and preservation of apostolic teaching and tradition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples_from_caesarea.htm">Disciples from Caesarea</a></b><br>These are followers of Jesus who lived in Caesarea, a significant city in the early Christian church.

Providing rest and refreshment strengthened Paul for what lay ahead, much like Lydia&#8217;s invitation in Philippi (<a href="/acts/16-15.htm">Acts 16:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture links hospitality with faithfulness; Jesus Himself commended those who welcome His servants (<a href="/matthew/10-40.htm">Matthew 10:40-42</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the home of Mnason the Cypriot</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;at the home of Mnason the Cypriot&#8230;&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Mnason was from Cyprus, the same island that produced Barnabas (<a href="/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>), suggesting a longstanding line of fruitful gospel witness there (<a href="/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Owning a home sizable enough to host Paul&#8217;s group implies God had provided Mnason with resources he gladly leveraged for Kingdom purposes (<a href="/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming the host, Luke honors a faithful lay believer whose generosity became part of God&#8217;s inspired record.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>an early disciple</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;an early disciple.&#8221;.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Early&#8221; indicates Mnason had trusted Christ near the beginning of the church age, perhaps even since Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41-47</a>).<p>&#8226; His longevity in the faith meant wisdom and maturity, qualities Paul would soon need amid the tensions awaiting him in Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/21-20.htm">Acts 21:20-26</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse links generations of believers: early converts like Mnason supporting later missionaries like Paul&#8212;illustrating <a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a> in action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/21-16.htm">Acts 21:16</a> paints a vivid, literal snapshot of the body of Christ in motion: mature believers from Caesarea walking with Paul, personally ensuring his safe lodging with Mnason of Cyprus, a seasoned disciple whose hospitality advanced God&#8217;s plan. The verse highlights unity, hospitality, and multigenerational faithfulness, reminding us that every act of service&#8212;whether traveling together or opening a home&#8212;fits into the Lord&#8217;s sovereign design for the spread of the gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">One Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.</span>--Better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">an early disciple.</span> The word for "old" refers less to personal age than to his having been a disciple from the beginning of the Church's history. He may accordingly have been among those "men of Cyprus" who came to Antioch, and were among the first to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. (See Note on <a href="/acts/11-20.htm" title="And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.">Acts 11:20</a>.) We may fairly infer that he was one of those who had been "from the beginning" among the eye-witnesses and ministers of the word to whom St. Luke refers as his informants (<a href="/luke/1-2.htm" title="Even as they delivered them to us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;">Luke 1:2</a>). If so, it is interesting, as showing that our Lord's disciples were not limited to the natives of Galilee and Judaea. It lies on the surface of the narrative that Mnason had a house at Jerusalem in which he could receive St. Paul and his companions. The arrangement seems to have been made as the best course that could be taken to minimise the inevitable danger to which the Apostle was exposing himself. In that house at least he might be sure of personal safety, and the men from Caesarea would form a kind of escort as he went to and fro in the city.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <span class="accented">- And there went</span> for <span class="accented">there went</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">from</span> for <span class="accented">of</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">bringing</span> for <span class="accented">and brought</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">early</span> for <span class="accented">old</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Mnason of Cyprus</span>; only mentioned here. He may very probably be one of those Cypriots mentioned in <a href="/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19, 20</a>, and so have been a disciple before the death of Stephen, and hence properly called <span class="accented">an old</span> or <span class="accented">early</span> disciple. If he had been one of St. Paul's converts in the visit to Cyprus recorded in <a href="/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a>, St. Paul would have needed no introduction to him. The construction of the sentence is involved, and the exact meaning consequently obscure. Kuincel, Meyer, Howson (in 'Dict. of Bible'), and many more, translate it "conducting us to Mnason," etc., which seems the better translation; not, however, so as to make <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span> equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, which Greek usage will not admit of, but explaining the dative by attraction of the relative <span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;</span>, which is governed by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>.

If Mnason, who, consistently with <a href="/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>, had a house at Jerusalem, had been at Caesarea at this time, it would be quite unmeaning that disciples from Caesarea should bring Mnason with them. The sentence would rather have run "among whom was Mnason," etc. But if he was at Jerusalem, it was quite proper that any Christians of Caesarea who knew him should conduct Paul to his house, and introduce him and his party to him.
