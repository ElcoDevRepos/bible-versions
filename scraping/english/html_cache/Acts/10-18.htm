This action of calling out indicates a sense of urgency and respect, as they were seeking someone of importance. In the ancient world, calling out was a common way to announce one's presence, especially when approaching a household. This reflects the cultural norms of communication and hospitality in the first-century Mediterranean world.<p><b>to ask if Simon called Peter</b><br>Simon Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is often referred to by both his given name, Simon, and the name Jesus gave him, Peter, which means "rock" (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>). This dual naming highlights his transformation and role in the early church. The use of both names here emphasizes his identity and authority as an apostle. Peter's presence in Joppa, a significant port city, underscores the spread of the Gospel beyond Jerusalem, aligning with Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be witnesses "to the ends of the earth."<p><b>was staying there</b><br>Peter was staying at the house of Simon the tanner in Joppa, as mentioned earlier in <a href="/acts/9-43.htm">Acts 9:43</a>. Tanning was considered an unclean profession by Jewish standards due to the handling of dead animals, which shows Peter's growing openness to associating with those outside traditional Jewish purity laws. This setting foreshadows the upcoming revelation of the inclusion of Gentiles into the Christian faith, a pivotal moment in the early church's history. The geographical location of Joppa, a coastal city, also symbolizes the outreach of the Gospel to the Gentile world, as it was a gateway for trade and cultural exchange.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_peter.htm">Simon Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles, known for his leadership in the early church.

Publicly calling from the street honored household boundaries common in that culture, a gentle approach that mirrors other respectful appeals (<a href="/luke/18-38.htm">Luke 18:38</a>; <a href="/john/1-38.htm">John 1:38</a>).<p>&#8226; Their actions show how God orchestrates human steps to fulfill His plans, just as He earlier directed Philip toward the Ethiopian (<a href="/acts/8-29.htm">Acts 8:29&#8211;30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to ask</b><p>&#8226; The purpose of their call is inquiry, not intrusion&#8212;illustrating that divine appointments often begin with simple questions (<a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>; <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Asking affirms dependency on God&#8217;s revealed guidance: an angel sent them (<a href="/acts/10-3.htm">Acts 10:3&#8211;6</a>), but they still need confirmation at each stage (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; God welcomes earnest seekers; this request prepares Peter for the vision&#8217;s outworking in the next verses (<a href="/acts/10-19.htm">Acts 10:19&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>if Simon, called Peter</b><p>&#8226; Using both names connects the apostle&#8217;s old identity with his God-given mission (<a href="/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>).<p>&#8226; Repetition of the full designation (<a href="/acts/10-5.htm">Acts 10:5, 32</a>) underscores divine precision; the messengers cannot mistake another Simon in the same house (<a href="/acts/10-6.htm">Acts 10:6, 17</a>).<p>&#8226; God singles people out for specific tasks&#8212;here, Peter will unlock the gospel to Gentiles, fulfilling Jesus&#8217; earlier words about the &#8220;keys of the kingdom&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/16-19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a>; <a href="/acts/15-7.htm">Acts 15:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was staying there</b><p>&#8226; The question confirms location: Peter is lodging &#8220;with Simon the tanner&#8221; (<a href="/acts/9-43.htm">Acts 9:43</a>), already pushing Jewish purity boundaries by staying in a tanner&#8217;s home (<a href="/leviticus/11-39.htm">Leviticus 11:39&#8211;40</a>).<p>&#8226; God places His servant where the next step of revelation becomes unavoidable; being &#8220;there&#8221; positions Peter for the Spirit&#8217;s directive (<a href="/acts/10-19.htm">Acts 10:19&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; Divine timing meets human hospitality, echoing other moments when the Lord arranged critical stays&#8212;Jesus at Zacchaeus&#8217; house (<a href="/luke/19-5.htm">Luke 19:5</a>) or Paul with Lydia (<a href="/acts/16-15.htm">Acts 16:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/10-18.htm">Acts 10:18</a> captures a divinely arranged intersection: Cornelius&#8217; men respectfully call from the street, seeking the precise man God has prepared. Their inquiry illustrates obedient faith, while Peter&#8217;s presence in an unconventional setting signals God&#8217;s widening embrace of the nations. The verse, though brief, sets the stage for the outpouring of salvation to Gentiles and reminds us that God&#8217;s sovereign details&#8212;names, addresses, and the humble act of asking&#8212;advance His redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> <span class="accented">- Lodging</span> for <span class="accented">lodged</span>, A.V. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/10-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They called out</span><br /><span class="grk">&#966;&#969;&#957;&#942;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(ph&#333;n&#275;santes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5455.htm">Strong's 5455: </a> </span><span class="str2">From phone; to emit a sound; by implication, to address in words or by name, also in imitation.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to ask</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#965;&#957;&#952;&#940;&#957;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(epynthanonto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4441.htm">Strong's 4441: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ask, inquire, ascertain by inquiry, understand. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">if</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
