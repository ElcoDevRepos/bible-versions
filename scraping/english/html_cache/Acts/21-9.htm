Philip settled in Caesarea, a significant city in the Roman province of Judea, known for its diverse population and as a center of early Christian activity. The mention of his four daughters highlights the presence and role of women in the early church. Their unmarried status may indicate their dedication to ministry, as marriage was a common expectation in Jewish culture.

(1) The four daughters were "virgins." The word then, as afterwards, probably indicated, not merely the bare fact that they were as yet unmarried, but that they had devoted themselves, if not by irrevocable vows, yet by a steadfast purpose, to that form of service. In the organisation of women's work in the Church they formed apparently a distinct class, the complement of that of the widows of <a href="/1_timothy/5-10.htm" title="Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.">1Timothy 5:10</a>. St. Paul had distinctly sanctioned such a life, as presenting a higher standard of excellence than the duties of domestic life (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-8.htm" title="I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.">1Corinthians 7:8</a>), and on grounds which, in their general character, went beyond the "present distress" of a time of persecution (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-26.htm" title="I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.">1Corinthians 7:26</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-34.htm" title="There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.">1Corinthians 7:34</a>). It was, indeed, a matter on which he had no commandment from the Lord (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-25.htm" title="Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.">1Corinthians 7:25</a>), and in which he was therefore open to the teachings of experience, and these seem to have modified his judgment at a later date, and led him to the conclusion that it was better that the younger "widows" should marry (<a href="/1_timothy/5-14.htm" title="I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.">1Timothy 5:14</a>), and that they should only be received into the list of those who were maintained by the Church in return for their services as "widows," at a more advanced age (<a href="/1_timothy/5-9.htm" title="Let not a widow be taken into the number under three score years old, having been the wife of one man.">1Timothy 5:9</a>). The order of "virgin," however, continued to exist, and the term <span class= "ital">Virgo, </span>sometimes with <span class= "ital">Ancilla Domini</span> (the handmaid of the Lord; comp. <a href="/romans/16-1.htm" title="I commend to you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:">Romans 16:1</a>) added to it, is found in the inscriptions from the catacombs now in the Museums of the Collegio Romano and the Lateran. So Pliny, in his letter to Trajan (<span class= "ital">Ep.</span> 10 ? 6), speaks of the women who were then called <span class= "ital">ministrae</span> among the Christians, the latter term being probably used as the equivalent for "deaconesses." (2) These virgins "prophesied." The word comprised much more than mere prediction of the future, and included all words that came into the mind of the speaker as an inspiration, and to the hearers as a message from God. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/acts/2-17.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, said God, I will pour out of my Spirit on all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:">Acts 2:17</a>; <a href="/acts/19-6.htm" title="And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.">Acts 19:6</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-24.htm" title="But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believes not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:">1Corinthians 14:24-25</a>.) In other words, they preached. We ask when, and where? Did they prophesy in the assemblies of the Church? It is true that St. Paul had forbidden this at Corinth (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-34.htm" title="Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted to them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also said the law.">1Corinthians 14:34</a>), and forbade it afterwards at Ephesus (<a href="/1_timothy/2-12.htm" title="But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.">1Timothy 2:12</a>); but the very prohibition proves that the practice was common (see also <a href="/1_corinthians/11-5.htm" title="But every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.">1Corinthians 11:5</a>), and it does not follow that St. Paul's rules of discipline as yet obtained in all the churches. It is perfectly possible, however, that they may have confined their ministrations to those of their own sex, and, accompanying their father in his missionary journeys, have gained access to women, both among Jews and Gentiles, and brought them to the knowledge of the Truth. It is obvious that the services of women, acting as deaconesses, would be needed as a matter of decorum in the baptism of female converts. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- Now this man</span> for <span class="accented">and the same man</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Virgins</span>. This certainly conveys the impression that they had dedicated their lives to the service of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-34.htm">1 Corinthians 7:34-38</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which did prophesy</span>. The question arises - Did they exercise their gift of prophecy in the Church or in private? The passage <a href="/1_corinthians/11-5.htm">1 Corinthians 11:5</a> seems to indicate that in the Church of Corinth women did pray and prophesy in the congregation, while, on the other hand, <a href="/1_corinthians/14-34.htm">1 Corinthians 14:34, 35</a> seems peremptorily to forbid women to speak or teach in Church, as does <a href="/1_timothy/2-11.htm">1 Timothy 2:11, 12</a>. How, then, is this apparent contradiction to be reconciled? It must be either by supposing <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the gift of prophecy spoken of here and in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-5.htm">1 Corinthians 11:5</a> was exercised in private only; or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the prohibition did not apply to the extraordinary operation of the Holy Spirit speaking by prophet or prophetesses as the case might be. The latter seems the most probable (see <a href="/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>, note). On the office of prophets in the early Church, see <a href="/acts/11-27.htm">Acts 11:27</a>; <a href="/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>; <a href="/acts/15-32.htm">Acts 15:32</a>; <a href="/acts/19-6.htm">Acts 19:6</a>; <a href="/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10, 28, 29</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2, 8</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-6.htm">1 Corinthians 14:6, 29</a>, etc.; <a href="/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-20.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:20</a> (see Alford, on <a href="/acts/11-27.htm">Acts 11:27</a>). As regards these daughters of Philip, there are conflicting statements in early Church writers. Eusebius ('Eccl. Hist.,' 3:30) quotes Clement of Alexandria as saying that both Peter and Philip among the apostles were married and had children, and that Philip moreover gave his daughters in marriage to husbands. But in the next chapter <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> he quotes Polycrates, Bishop of Ephesus at the end of the second century, as saying that Philip the apostle and his two daughters, who had grown old in their virginity, were buried at Hierapolis; and that another daughter of his, "who had her conversation in the Holy Spirit," was buried at Ephesus. Eusebius himself thinks that these daughters of Philip the evangelist were meant. If they were, it does not necessarily follow that those who, according to Clemens Alexandrinus, were married were of the four mentioned here. They might be sisters. Polycrates seems to speak of three sisters who lived a religious life (in the technical sense); the fourth may have died young. But it is quite possible that Clemens may really be speaking of Philip the apostle, and Polycrates also; the more so as Philip the apostle, according to the tradition recorded by Nicephorns, suffered martyrdom at Hierapolis. However, the confusion between the two Philips is quite certain in the Menaeum (or Calendar) of the Greek Church, where we read, "On the 4th of September is the commemoration of Saint Hermione, one of the four daughters of the Apostle Philip, who baptized the eunuch of Candace. She and her sister Eutychis came into Asia after the death of the Apostle John. She was buried at Ephesus." A fragment of Caius (in Eusebius, 'Eccl. Hist.,' 3:31) increases the confusion by speaking of" the four daughters of Philip, prophetesses, who were buried in Hierapolis" (see Routh's 'Reliq. Sac.,' vol. 1. pp. 378-380). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/21-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[He]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#8179;</span> <span class="translit">(tout&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">had</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7974;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;san)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
