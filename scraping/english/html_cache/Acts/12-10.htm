The presence of multiple guards indicates the high security and the importance of Peter as a prisoner. In Roman times, guards were typically stationed in shifts, and the fact that Peter passed them without detection suggests divine intervention. This echoes other biblical instances where God delivers His people from seemingly impossible situations, such as Daniel in the lion's den (Daniel 6) or the Israelites crossing the Red Sea (Exodus 14).<p><b>and came to the iron gate leading to the city</b><br>The iron gate symbolizes a formidable barrier, emphasizing the impossibility of escape through human means. Iron was a strong and durable material, often used for security purposes in ancient times. The gate leading to the city signifies the transition from captivity to freedom. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual liberation, where God opens doors that no man can shut (<a href="/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>).<p><b>which opened for them by itself</b><br>The automatic opening of the gate underscores the supernatural aspect of Peter's release. This event is reminiscent of other miraculous openings in Scripture, such as the parting of the Jordan River (<a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14-17</a>). It signifies God's power over physical barriers and His ability to make a way where there seems to be none. This act can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the door to salvation (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>).<p><b>When they had gone outside and walked the length of one block</b><br>The mention of walking a block indicates a brief but significant journey from the place of confinement to freedom. This short distance highlights the immediacy and completeness of God's deliverance. In biblical terms, walking often symbolizes a journey of faith, as seen in Abraham's journey to the Promised Land (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-9</a>).<p><b>the angel suddenly left him</b><br>The departure of the angel signifies the completion of the divine mission. Angels in Scripture are often messengers or agents of God's will, as seen in the announcement of Jesus' birth (<a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26-38</a>) or the protection of Daniel (<a href="/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22</a>). The suddenness of the angel's departure emphasizes that Peter's continued journey requires his own faith and action, reflecting the balance between divine intervention and human responsibility.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles, imprisoned by Herod Agrippa I, and miraculously freed by an angel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/angel_of_the_lord.htm">Angel of the Lord</a></b><br>A divine messenger sent by God to rescue Peter from prison.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_agrippa_i.htm">Herod Agrippa I</a></b><br>The king who had Peter arrested, intending to persecute him after Passover.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events took place, significant as the center of early Christian activity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/iron_gate.htm">Iron Gate</a></b><br>The gate leading to the city, symbolizing barriers that God can overcome.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_intervention.htm">Divine Intervention</a></b><br>God is actively involved in the lives of His people, often working in miraculous ways to deliver and protect them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_timing.htm">Faith in God's Timing</a></b><br>Peter's deliverance came at the last moment, teaching us to trust in God's perfect timing even when situations seem dire.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/overcoming_barriers.htm">Overcoming Barriers</a></b><br>The iron gate symbolizes obstacles in our lives that God can open or remove, encouraging us to rely on His power rather than our own.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_angels.htm">Role of Angels</a></b><br>Angels are ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation, reminding us of God's unseen help in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_of_believers.htm">Community of Believers</a></b><br>The early church was praying fervently for Peter, highlighting the importance of intercessory prayer within the Christian community.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_12_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 12:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Acts_12_10_God_s_power_over_obstacles.htm">How does Acts 12:10 demonstrate God's power in overcoming human obstacles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Faith_s_role_in_Peter_s_escape_in_Acts_12_10.htm">What role does faith play in Peter's miraculous escape in Acts 12:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Acts_12_10_Trust_in_God_s_deliverance.htm">How can Acts 12:10 inspire trust in God's deliverance in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Acts_12_10_vs_Ex_14_21_God_s_path-making.htm">Compare Acts 12:10 with Exodus 14:21.
