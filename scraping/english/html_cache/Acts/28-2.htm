Historically, Malta was known for its strategic location in the Mediterranean Sea, which made it a melting pot of various cultures. The kindness shown by the islanders is significant, as it reflects the universal human capacity for compassion, transcending cultural and religious boundaries. This act of kindness can be seen as a fulfillment of the biblical principle of hospitality, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>, which encourages believers to show hospitality to strangers.<p><b>They kindled a fire and welcomed all of us</b><br>The act of kindling a fire is practical, providing warmth and comfort to the shipwrecked group. In a broader biblical context, fire often symbolizes God's presence and purification, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a> with the burning bush. The welcoming of "all of us" indicates the inclusive nature of the islanders' hospitality, which mirrors the inclusive message of the Gospel that Paul preached, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for all are one in Christ Jesus.<p><b>because it was raining and cold.</b><br>The mention of rain and cold highlights the harsh conditions faced by Paul and his companions, emphasizing their vulnerability and need for assistance. This scenario can be likened to the trials and tribulations faced by believers, as described in <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>, where perseverance through trials leads to spiritual maturity. The physical coldness contrasts with the warmth of the islanders' hospitality, symbolizing the light of Christ's love shining through human actions, as believers are called to be the light of the world in <a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/islanders.htm">Islanders (Barbarians)</a></b><br>The term used here in Greek is (barbaroi), which referred to non-Greek speakers.

It is obvious, however, that St. Luke uses the term, as St. Paul does (<a href="/romans/1-14.htm" title="I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.">Romans 1:14</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-11.htm" title="Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks shall be a barbarian to me.">1Corinthians 14:11</a>), and as was then common, as applicable to all races that did not speak Greek, and that such a term as "Scythian" (<a href="/colossians/3-11.htm" title=" Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.">Colossians 3:11</a>) was used to describe what we should call "barbarians" or "savages." For him "barbarian" was like the term "native," which our travellers apply indiscriminately to Fiji Islanders and Cingalese. The language of Malta at the time, if not absolutely Punic, was probably a very bastard Greek.
