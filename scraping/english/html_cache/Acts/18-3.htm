This reflects the early Christian practice of communal living and support, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>.

It also underscores the value of vocational skills in supporting ministry work.<p><b>just as he was</b><br>Paul's background as a tentmaker is significant, as it illustrates his ability to relate to ordinary working people. This connection to a trade also reflects his Jewish heritage, where it was customary for rabbis to have a trade.

The material was one used for the sails of ships and for tents, and on the whole, though some have supposed that leather was used for the latter, it seems more probable that this was the material which St. Paul worked at. It may be added that Pontus, from which Aquila came, was also famous for the same manufacture, the material in each case being furnished by the goats which fed upon the slopes of the Taurus, and the mountain ranges of that province. The fact that St. Paul had learnt this trade is not inconsistent with the comparative opulence suggested by his education both in boyhood at Tarsus and at the feet of Gamaliel in Jerusalem. The Rabbinic proverb, that "He who does not teach his son a trade, teaches him to be a thief," made such instruction almost universal. So the great Hillel was a carpenter. Here, it is clear, he took the course of working for his livelihood, as he had done at Thessalonica, that he might keep himself from the suspicion of self-interest in his work as a teacher (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/9-15.htm" title="But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done to me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.">1Corinthians 9:15-19</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/11-7.htm" title="Have I committed an offense in abasing myself that you might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?">2Corinthians 11:7-13</a>). Such was the beginning of his labours at Corinth. A new artisan was working for wages, or as a partner, probably the latter, as afterwards with Philemon (<a href="/philemon/1-17.htm" title="If you count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.">Philemon 1:17</a>), in the workshop of the Jew, not as yet known to the outer world as more than a Jew, who had recently arrived in Corinth from Rome.<p>(3) We may add to this motive the principle on which St. Paul acted of being "all things to all men," and, therefore, as a Jew to Jews (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-20.htm" title="And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;">1Corinthians 9:20</a>). A Nazarite vow would testify to all his brethren by blood that he did not despise the Law himself nor teach other Jews to despise it. (See Notes on <a href="/context/acts/21-21.htm" title="And they are informed of you, that you teach all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.">Acts 21:21-24</a>.) Such a vow, involving, as it did, for a time a greater asceticism than that of common life, furnishes a link in the succession of thoughts in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/9-22.htm" title="To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.">1Corinthians 9:22-25</a>, between the Apostle's being made "all things to all men" and his "keeping under his body, and bringing it into subjection." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="accented">Trade</span> for <span class="accented">craft</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">they wrought</span> for (he) <span class="accented">wrought</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">trade</span> for <span class="accented">occupation</span>, A.V.
