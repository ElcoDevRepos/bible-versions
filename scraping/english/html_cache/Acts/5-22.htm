The apostles had been arrested for preaching about Jesus and performing miracles, which angered the religious leaders. The "jail" refers to the public prison in Jerusalem, a place where the apostles were held under guard. This event highlights the tension between the early Christian movement and the Jewish authorities. The apostles' imprisonment and subsequent escape underscore the divine intervention that often accompanied the early church's mission.<p><b>the officers did not find them there</b><br>The "officers" were likely members of the temple guard, responsible for maintaining order in the temple precincts and executing the orders of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council. Their failure to find the apostles in the jail is a testament to the miraculous nature of their escape, as described earlier in the chapter, where an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail. This incident emphasizes the power of God to deliver His servants and the futility of human efforts to thwart His plans.<p><b>So they returned with the report</b><br>The officers' return to the Sanhedrin with the report of the empty jail would have been both surprising and alarming to the religious leaders. This report signifies the inability of the Jewish authorities to control the spread of the Gospel and the growing influence of the apostles. It also sets the stage for the subsequent questioning of the apostles and the bold proclamation of their faith. This moment reflects the ongoing conflict between the nascent Christian church and the established religious order, a theme prevalent throughout the book of Acts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>Key figures in the early Christian church, specifically Peter and John, who were imprisoned for preaching about Jesus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_officers.htm">The Officers</a></b><br>Temple guards or officials responsible for maintaining order and executing the orders of the Sanhedrin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jail.htm">The Jail</a></b><br>The place where the apostles were held, symbolizing the opposition and persecution faced by early Christians.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanhedrin.htm">The Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The Jewish ruling council that opposed the apostles' teachings and sought to suppress the spread of Christianity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the Lord</a></b><br>Although not mentioned in this specific verse, earlier in the chapter, an angel freed the apostles from jail, demonstrating divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_intervention.htm">Divine Intervention</a></b><br>God is sovereign and can intervene in human affairs to accomplish His purposes.

While human leaders plot, the Lord &#8220;sits enthroned in the heavens&#8221; and carries out His will (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the officers did not find them there</b><p>- The officers encounter an undeniable fact: the apostles are gone. Angels had already opened the doors and released them (<a href="/acts/5-19.htm">Acts 5:19</a>).<p>- Absence becomes testimony.<p>&#8226; It exposes the futility of opposing the gospel (<a href="/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>).<p>&#8226; It validates the apostles&#8217; divine commission, echoing Jesus&#8217; promise that His followers could not be ultimately restrained (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>).<p>- This moment also mirrors earlier biblical rescues&#8212;Daniel from the lions (<a href="/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19&#8211;23</a>) and the three Hebrews from the furnace (<a href="/daniel/3-25.htm">Daniel 3:25&#8211;28</a>)&#8212;each time, God visibly overrides human constraint.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So they returned with the report</b><p>- The officers, obligated to give account, report the baffling news to the Sanhedrin. Their words amplify the miracle: secure doors, guarded cells, yet no prisoners (<a href="/acts/5-23.htm">Acts 5:23&#8211;24</a>).<p>- The report spreads amazement and fear among the leaders, just as the guards&#8217; report of the empty tomb unsettled the chief priests decades earlier (<a href="/matthew/28-11.htm">Matthew 28:11&#8211;15</a>).<p>- God uses the officers&#8217; honest testimony to advance the gospel. Instead of silencing the apostles, the authorities must now summon them again&#8212;this time from the temple courts where they boldly continue preaching (<a href="/acts/5-25.htm">Acts 5:25</a>).<p>- The episode highlights a principle: every attempt to hinder God&#8217;s Word ultimately advertises its power (<a href="/2_timothy/2-9.htm">2 Timothy 2:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/5-22.htm">Acts 5:22</a> shows that when the officers reached the jail, the apostles were gone, forcing the officials to admit a supernatural intervention they could not explain away.
