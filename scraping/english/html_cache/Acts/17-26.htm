It underscores the biblical teaching that all people, regardless of race or ethnicity, share a common ancestry. This concept is foundational to the understanding of human equality and dignity, as all are made in the image of God. The unity of humanity is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in the genealogies of Genesis and the universal offer of salvation through Jesus Christ (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12-19</a>).<p><b>that they should inhabit the whole earth;</b><br>This part of the verse reflects God's command to humanity to "be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth" (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). It highlights God's sovereign plan for human habitation and the spread of people across the globe. The dispersion of nations is further illustrated in the account of the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>), where God confounded human language, leading to the scattering of people. This dispersion was part of God's design to populate the earth and establish diverse cultures and societies.<p><b>and He determined their appointed times</b><br>This phrase indicates God's sovereignty over history and the affairs of nations. It suggests that God has a predetermined plan for the rise and fall of nations, as well as the specific periods during which they exist. This is echoed in <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, where it is stated that God "changes times and seasons; He removes kings and sets up kings." The concept of appointed times also points to God's control over historical events, ensuring that His purposes are fulfilled in the fullness of time (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).<p><b>and the boundaries of their lands.</b><br>Here, the focus is on God's authority over geographical boundaries and the distribution of land among nations. This is seen in the Old Testament, where God allocated specific territories to the tribes of Israel (Joshua 13-21) and set boundaries for other nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>). The establishment of boundaries serves to maintain order and fulfill God's purposes for each nation. It also reflects the idea that God is actively involved in the governance of the world, ensuring that His divine plan is carried out through the nations He has established.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Paul is addressing the people of Athens at the Areopagus, explaining the nature of God and His creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/athens.htm">Athens</a></b><br>A significant cultural and intellectual center of the ancient world, where Paul delivers his sermon to the Athenians, who were known for their philosophical pursuits.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/areopagus.htm">Areopagus</a></b><br>A prominent rock outcropping in Athens, serving as the meeting place for the council of elders, where Paul presents his message about the one true God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations_of_men.htm">Nations of Men</a></b><br>Refers to the various ethnic groups and peoples that God created from one man, emphasizing the unity and diversity of humanity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The event of God determining the times and boundaries of nations highlights His sovereign control over history and geography.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_of_humanity.htm">Unity of Humanity</a></b><br>All humans are created by God from one man, emphasizing the inherent unity and equality of all people, regardless of race or nationality.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sovereignty.htm">Divine Sovereignty</a></b><br>God&#8217;s control over the times and boundaries of nations reminds us of His ultimate authority and plan for history, encouraging trust in His providence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purposeful_living.htm">Purposeful Living</a></b><br>Understanding that God has determined our times and places should inspire us to seek His purpose for our lives in our current context.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_engagement.htm">Cultural Engagement</a></b><br>Like Paul, we are called to engage with the culture around us, sharing the truth of God&#8217;s sovereignty and the gospel message with wisdom and respect.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_plan_for_nations.htm">God's Plan for Nations</a></b><br>Recognizing that God has a plan for every nation encourages us to pray for and support global missions, knowing that God desires all people to seek Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_17_26_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 17:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Acts_17_26_God_s_control_over_nations.htm">How does Acts 17:26 emphasize God's sovereignty over nations and their boundaries?

This gives his Philosophy of History. And the position was one which no Greek, above all, no Athenian, was likely to accept. For him the distinction between the Greek and the barbarian was radical and essential. The one was by nature meant to be the slave of the other. (Aristot. <span class= "ital">Pol.</span> i. 2, 6.) In rising above his own prejudices of fancied superiority of race, the Apostle felt that he could attack, as from a vantage-ground, the prejudices of others. He naturally accepted the truth as it was presented to him in the Mosaic history of the Creation; but the truth itself, stated in its fullest form, would remain, even if we were to accept other theories of the origin of species and the history of man. There is a oneness of physical structure, of conditions and modes of life, of possible or actual development, which forbids any one race or nation, Hebrew, Hellenic, Latin, or Teutonic, to assume for itself that it is the cream and flower of humanity.<p><span class= "bld">Hath determined the times before appointed.</span>--The better MSS. give simply, "the appointed seasons." Few words, even in St. Paul's teaching, are more pregnant with significance. They justify all that the wise of heart have said as to the "manifold wisdom of God," as seen in history and in the education of mankind. The special gifts of character of each race--Hebrew thought of God, Greek sense of beauty, Roman sense of law, Teutonic truthfulness, Keltic impulsiveness,  docility--have all their work to do. All local circumstances of soil and climate that influence character come under the head of the "bounds of men's habitation." All conditions of time--the period at which each race has been called to play its part in the drama of the world's history--come under the head of the "appointed seasons."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - He <span class="accented">made</span> for <span class="accented">hath made</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">of one</span> for <span class="accented">of one blood</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">every nation</span> for <span class="accented">all nations</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">having determined their appointed seasons</span> for <span class="accented">and hath determined the times before appointed</span>, A.V.
