It reflects a common biblical motif where God calls individuals to action, reminiscent of God's call to Abraham to leave his homeland (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>) and to Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>). The imperative "get up" signifies a transition from contemplation to action, a theme prevalent in the New Testament as believers are often called to rise and follow Christ (<a href="/matthew/9-9.htm">Matthew 9:9</a>).<p><b>Go downstairs</b><br>The instruction to "go downstairs" is literal, as Peter is on the rooftop praying. This detail highlights the physical setting of the narrative, which takes place in Joppa, a coastal city with multi-level homes typical of the period. The act of going downstairs symbolizes Peter's movement from a place of solitude and prayer to engagement with the world, reflecting the Christian call to balance spiritual devotion with active ministry.<p><b>and accompany them</b><br>Peter is instructed to accompany the men sent by Cornelius, a Roman centurion. This directive challenges Jewish customs of the time, as Jews typically avoided close association with Gentiles to maintain ritual purity. The command to accompany these Gentiles signifies a pivotal moment in the early church, foreshadowing the inclusion of Gentiles into the Christian faith, as later affirmed in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a> at the Jerusalem Council.<p><b>without hesitation</b><br>The phrase "without hesitation" underscores the importance of obedience to God's will, even when it defies cultural norms or personal prejudices. This mirrors the call to unwavering faith seen in the lives of biblical figures like Noah, who built the ark despite societal ridicule (<a href="/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>), and Abraham, who was willing to sacrifice Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2-3</a>). It also prefigures Peter's later defense of his actions in <a href="/acts/11-12.htm">Acts 11:12</a>, where he recounts the Spirit's instruction to go without misgivings.<p><b>because I have sent them.</b><br>This phrase reveals the divine orchestration behind the encounter, affirming that the men were sent by God, not merely by Cornelius. It highlights the sovereignty of God in guiding the spread of the Gospel, as seen throughout Acts. This divine sending echoes the mission of Jesus, who was sent by the Father (<a href="/john/20-21.htm">John 20:21</a>), and the apostles, who are sent into the world (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). It underscores the theme of divine mission and the unfolding plan of salvation that includes all nations, fulfilling the promise to Abraham that all peoples on earth will be blessed through him (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles, known for his leadership in the early church.

Peter must descend from the rooftop to meet visitors at the gate. Obedience often starts with small, seemingly mundane acts.<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/19-5.htm">Luke 19:5</a>&#8212;Jesus tells Zacchaeus, &#8220;Come down immediately,&#8221; then fellowship follows.<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/24-17.htm">Genesis 24:17</a> reveals Rebekah &#8220;running down to the spring&#8221; before God&#8217;s larger plan for Isaac unfolds.<p>Faithfulness in the ordinary prepares us for participation in God&#8217;s extraordinary purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Accompany them</b><p>Peter is not merely to greet the men but to travel with them.

Each phrase calls believers to immediate, practical, barrier-breaking obedience rooted in the assurance that God orchestrates every encounter for the advance of the gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Go with them, doubting nothing.</span>--The command was specially addressed to the perplexed questionings of the disciple. For a time he was to walk, as it were, blindfold, but trusting in the full assurance of faith in the Hand that was guiding him. As once before (<a href="/john/13-7.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, What I do you know not now; but you shall know hereafter.">John 13:7</a>), he knew not yet what his Lord was doing, but was to know hereafter. He and the messengers from Cornelius were alike acting on the promptings of the Divine Spirit.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> <span class="accented">- But arise</span> for <span class="accented">arise therefore</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">nothing doubting</span> for <span class="accented">doubting nothing</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">But arise</span>.
