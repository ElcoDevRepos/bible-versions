Worship here implies a communal gathering, likely involving prayer, singing, and reading of Scripture. Fasting, a practice rooted in Jewish tradition, signifies humility and dependence on God. This setting underscores the seriousness and devotion of the church in Antioch, a key center for early Christianity. The act of fasting often accompanied significant spiritual events, as seen in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>) and in Jesus' own ministry (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>).<p><b>the Holy Spirit said</b><br>The Holy Spirit's direct communication highlights His active role in guiding the early church. This divine intervention emphasizes the Trinity's involvement in church affairs, with the Spirit acting as a counselor and guide (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>). The Spirit's voice here is authoritative, indicating a clear and unmistakable directive. This moment reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' promise that the Spirit would lead His followers into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>).<p><b>Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul</b><br>The phrase "set apart" indicates a divine selection for a specific purpose, echoing the Old Testament practice of consecrating individuals for God's work (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>). Barnabas and Saul (later Paul) were chosen for a mission that would expand the church's reach beyond Jewish communities. Barnabas, known for his encouragement and leadership, and Saul, a former persecutor turned apostle, were uniquely equipped for this task. Their selection underscores God's sovereignty in choosing and equipping His servants.<p><b>for the work to which I have called them</b><br>This work refers to the missionary journeys that would spread the Gospel to the Gentile world, fulfilling the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). The calling is both specific and divine, indicating that God had prepared Barnabas and Saul for this mission. Their work would involve preaching, teaching, and establishing churches, as seen in subsequent chapters of Acts. This calling also reflects the prophetic nature of God's plan, as the inclusion of Gentiles was foretold in the Old Testament (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/barnabas.htm">Barnabas</a></b><br>A key figure in the early church, known for his encouragement and support of new believers, including Saul (Paul).

In <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm" title="Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?">Hebrews 1:14</a>, the corresponding adjective is used to distinguish the ministry of worship from that of service to man. When St. Paul uses it figuratively of himself (<a href="/romans/15-16.htm" title="That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.">Romans 15:16</a>), it is in connection with the idea of a sacrifice or oblation. In later ecclesiastical language, it was connected specially with the celebration of the Supper of the Lord, and the order for that service was, strictly speaking, <span class= "ital">the</span> "Liturgy" of the Church. It would, perhaps, be too much to say that the word necessarily conveys that meaning here; but it is, at least, probable that a solemn meeting, such as is here described, would end in the "breaking of bread," and that, up to that point, those who were so engaged would naturally be fasting.<p><span class= "bld">The Holy Ghost said.</span>--The mode of communication we may believe to have been, as in <a href="/acts/20-23.htm" title="Save that the Holy Ghost witnesses in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.">Acts 20:23</a>, through the lips of the prophets, speaking as by a sudden burst of simultaneous inspiration.

In the Old Testament the LXX. use it as the rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>, to minister (often with the addition "to God," or "to the Lord "), which is a general word applying to the ministrations of priests and Levites (<a href="/exodus/28-35.htm">Exodus 28:35</a>; <a href="/numbers/8-26.htm">Numbers 8:26</a>, etc.). Hence its use in <a href="/hebrews/10-11.htm">Hebrews 10:11</a> (see too <a href="/luke/1-23.htm">Luke 1:23</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-21.htm">Hebrews 9:21</a>). Joshua too is called Moses'minister (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>) in <a href="/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1</a>, etc., and the angels are called <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, "ministering spirits" (<a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>). Just as the Church transferred from the Jewish congregation so many other words and things, so also the use of the words <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, to Sicily "Divine service," without specifying the particular office, whether prayer, or preaching, or Holy Communion, or ordination, or any ether part of the worship of God. Its classical use was to designate any office performed by an individual for the public good. Hence in the New Testament its application to Church alms (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-12.htm">2 Corinthians 9:12</a>), to gifts for the support of the ministry (<a href="/philippians/2-30.htm">Philippians 2:30</a>), to the office of magistrates (<a href="/romans/13-6.htm">Romans 13:6</a>), etc. The restricted application of the term <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to the service used in the celebration of the Eucharist was of much later growth, as is evident from Chrysostom explaining the word here of preaching. "What means ministering? Preaching" (Hom. 27.). It seems to have arisen from the fact that the first forms of prayer were those come posed for the office of the Holy Communion. This passage, therefore, does not give the slightest support to fasting Communion. What was the exact occasion of the service and fast here spoken of it is impossible to say. <span class="cmt_word">The Holy Ghost said</span>, etc. This is the origin of the question in the Ordination of Deacons, "Do you trust that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon you this office?" <span class="cmt_word">Separate me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). The act of separation, or ordination, would be by the laying on of the hands of Symeon and Lucius and Manaen, as Chrysostom says (at least of the two last named), in the presence of the whole Church, but the separation by the Holy Ghost, at least as regards Saul (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>), bad been from his mother's womb (<a href="/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15</a>). Observe, too, the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> of <a href="/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15</a>, and the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> here. This is another instance of the very close resemblance between parts of the Acts and the Epistle to the Galatians, which looks as if St. Paul was writing it about the same time as he was giving to St. Luke the details of his own history (see <a href="/acts/8-19.htm">Acts 8:19</a>, note). The ordination was to the apostolate (Chrysostom). Barnabas and Saul are never called apostles till after their ordination or consecration (<a href="/acts/14-14.htm">Acts 14:14</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/13-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[While]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
