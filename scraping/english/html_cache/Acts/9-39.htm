The "widows" of the Church were the object of a special provision. (See Note on <a href="/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a>.) The "coats," were the close-fitting tunics worn next the body, the "garments" the looser outer cloaks that were worn over them. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/5-40.htm" title="And if any man will sue you at the law, and take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.">Matthew 5:40</a>.) These were now exhibited by those who were mourning over the loss of their benefactress. It is probable that the garments were for the use of men and boys, as well as women, and that the "widows" had been fellow-workers with her in making them. She was, as it were, at the head of a Sisterhood of Mercy.<p><span class= "bld">Which Dorcas made.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">used to make.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and when</span> for <span class="accented">when</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">All the widows</span>.
