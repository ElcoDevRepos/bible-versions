The act of stretching out suggests the use of a whipping post or similar device. This reflects the harsh treatment often faced by prisoners, especially those perceived as troublemakers or threats to Roman order. The physical act of stretching out also symbolizes the vulnerability and impending suffering Paul was about to endure.<p><b>Paul said to the centurion standing there</b><br>Paul's direct address to the centurion highlights his awareness of Roman legal rights and his strategic use of them. A centurion was a Roman officer in charge of a hundred soldiers, indicating that Paul was speaking to someone with authority. This interaction underscores Paul's boldness and presence of mind even in dire circumstances. It also reflects the hierarchical structure of Roman military and governance, where centurions played crucial roles in maintaining order.<p><b>&#8220;Is it lawful for you to flog a Roman citizen without a trial?&#8221;</b><br>This question is a pivotal moment, as it invokes Roman law, which protected citizens from such treatment without due process. Roman citizenship was a privileged status that afforded individuals certain legal protections, including the right to a fair trial. Paul's question not only asserts his rights but also exposes the potential legal repercussions for the centurion and those involved in the unlawful punishment. This appeal to citizenship is a strategic move that reflects Paul's understanding of his identity and rights within the Roman Empire. It also connects to other instances in Acts where Paul uses his citizenship to navigate legal challenges (<a href="/acts/16-37.htm">Acts 16:37-39</a>, <a href="/acts/25-10.htm">Acts 25:10-12</a>).

Here the state, not the crowd, is preparing to inflict harm, showing how human institutions can also act unjustly (cf. <a href="/psalms/94-20.htm">Psalm 94:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Paul said to the centurion standing there</b><p>&#8226; Despite his physical vulnerability, Paul calmly addresses the officer in charge, modeling <a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>&#8212;&#8220;A gentle answer turns away wrath.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Centurions appear in Scripture as men of integrity (<a href="/acts/10-1.htm">Acts 10:1-2</a>; 27:43; <a href="/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5-13</a>).

The Authorised version is, however, it is believed, right. The Greek word for "thong" is always used in the New Testament in connection with the idea of tying (<a href="/mark/1-7.htm" title="And preached, saying, There comes one mightier than I after me, the lace of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.">Mark 1:7</a>; <a href="/luke/3-16.htm" title="John answered, saying to them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I comes, the lace of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:">Luke 3:16</a>; <a href="/john/1-27.htm" title="He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's lace I am not worthy to unloose.">John 1:27</a>).
