In the cultural context of the time, being dressed and having sandals on was necessary for travel or movement. The angel's command to Peter suggests immediate action, reflecting the divine intervention in Peter's imprisonment. The act of getting dressed symbolizes readiness to follow God's call, reminiscent of the Israelites preparing to leave Egypt in haste during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11</a>).<p><b>said the angel.</b><br>Angels are often depicted in the Bible as messengers of God, delivering divine instructions or assistance. In <a href="/acts/12.htm">Acts 12</a>, the angel's appearance signifies God's direct intervention in human affairs, particularly in the deliverance of Peter from prison. This aligns with other biblical instances where angels assist or guide God's people, such as the angel leading the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20</a>).<p><b>Peter did so,</b><br>Peter's obedience to the angel's command highlights his faith and trust in God's plan. Despite being in a dire situation, Peter's compliance without question demonstrates his reliance on divine guidance. This obedience is a recurring theme in Scripture, where faith is often shown through action, as seen in Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>).<p><b>and the angel told him,</b><br>The repetition of the angel giving instructions emphasizes the importance of divine guidance in Peter's escape. It underscores the role of angels as God's agents in executing His will. This mirrors other biblical narratives where angels provide direction, such as the angel instructing Joseph in dreams (<a href="/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20, 2</a>:13).<p><b>Wrap your cloak around you</b><br>The cloak, or outer garment, was an essential piece of clothing in the ancient Near East, providing warmth and protection. The instruction to wrap the cloak suggests preparation for a journey, indicating that Peter's escape would not be a short or simple task. This act can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual readiness, akin to putting on the "armor of God" (<a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>).<p><b>and follow me.</b><br>The call to follow is a central theme in the New Testament, often associated with discipleship and obedience to Christ. Here, the angel's command to follow signifies Peter's deliverance and the path God has set for him. This echoes Jesus' call to His disciples to follow Him (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>), symbolizing a journey of faith and trust in God's providence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' original twelve apostles, known for his leadership in the early church.

God overturns that expectation, reaffirming <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a> that His ways surpass ours.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Peter did so</b><p>&#8226; Obedience is immediate; no debate, no delay.<p>&#8226; Jesus said, &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). Peter&#8217;s instant compliance reflects that love.<p>&#8226; Earlier he failed to act decisively (<a href="/luke/22-57.htm">Luke 22:57</a>), but grace restores him to a pattern of prompt obedience, fulfilling <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the angel told him</b><p>&#8226; Angels serve believers: &#8220;Are they not all ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; God could have delivered Peter silently, yet He chooses an angelic messenger, echoing <a href="/acts/5-19.htm">Acts 5:19</a> where another angel opened prison doors.<p>&#8226; The spoken word confirms <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>&#8212;faith is reinforced through hearing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Wrap your cloak around you</b><p>&#8226; The cloak was Peter&#8217;s outer garment, protection against the night air outside the prison.
