The term "brothers" refers to fellow believers, emphasizing the familial bond among Christians. The early church was known for its strong communication networks, which allowed news of Paul's journey to spread quickly. This reflects the unity and support within the early Christian community, as seen in other passages like <a href="/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>, where Paul commends the faith of the Roman believers.<p><b>and traveled as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us.</b><br>The Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns were locations along the Appian Way, an important Roman road. The Forum of Appius was about 43 miles from Rome, and the Three Taverns was approximately 33 miles from the city. These locations were significant rest stops for travelers. The willingness of the believers to travel such distances highlights their eagerness to support and welcome Paul, demonstrating the early church's commitment to fellowship and hospitality, as encouraged in <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>.<p><b>When Paul saw them, he was encouraged</b><br>Paul's encouragement upon seeing the believers reflects the importance of Christian fellowship and mutual support. Despite his impending trial in Rome, the presence of fellow believers provided him with strength and comfort. This mirrors the principle found in <a href="/proverbs/27-17.htm">Proverbs 27:17</a>, "As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another," emphasizing the role of community in spiritual growth and perseverance.<p><b>and gave thanks to God.</b><br>Paul's response of thanksgiving underscores his recognition of God's providence and faithfulness. Throughout his letters, Paul frequently expresses gratitude, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>, where he instructs believers to "give thanks in all circumstances." This attitude of gratitude is a hallmark of Paul's ministry and serves as an example for believers to acknowledge God's hand in their lives, even amidst trials.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is on his journey to Rome as a prisoner, yet remains a pivotal figure in spreading the Gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_brothers.htm">The Brothers</a></b><br>Fellow Christians who traveled to meet Paul, demonstrating the early Christian community's support and fellowship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/forum_of_appius.htm">Forum of Appius</a></b><br>A marketplace located about 43 miles from Rome, significant as a meeting point for travelers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/three_taverns.htm">Three Taverns</a></b><br>A location approximately 33 miles from Rome, known for being a resting place for travelers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul's_encouragement.htm">Paul's Encouragement</a></b><br>The event where Paul, upon meeting the brothers, finds encouragement and gives thanks to God, highlighting the importance of Christian fellowship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_christian_fellowship.htm">The Power of Christian Fellowship</a></b><br>Fellowship among believers provides strength and encouragement, especially in times of trial.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_community_support.htm">The Importance of Community Support</a></b><br>The early Christians' journey to meet Paul exemplifies the importance of supporting one another in faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_in_all_circumstances.htm">Gratitude in All Circumstances</a></b><br>Paul's response of giving thanks to God, even as a prisoner, teaches us to maintain a heart of gratitude regardless of our circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_encouragement_in_ministry.htm">The Role of Encouragement in Ministry</a></b><br>Encouragement from fellow believers can rejuvenate and sustain those in ministry, highlighting the communal aspect of the Christian faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_witness_in_adversity.htm">Faithful Witness in Adversity</a></b><br>Paul's journey to Rome, despite being a prisoner, shows his commitment to his mission and serves as a model for enduring faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_28_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 28:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Acts_28_15_Fellowship_s_importance.htm">How does Acts 28:15 demonstrate the importance of Christian fellowship and encouragement?

The verse invites believers to stay informed, go the extra mile for one another, and turn every blessing into praise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">And from thence, when the brethren heard of us</span> . . .--Better, <span class= "ital">the brethren having heard about us.</span> The seven days at Puteoli had given ample time for the news of the Apostle's arrival to reach the disciples at Rome. Among these "brethren" were many, we may believe, of those whom he had known at Corinth, and to whom he had sent messages of greeting in Romans 16 : Aquila and Epaenetus, Andronicus and Junias, Herodion, and those of the household of Narcissus. Most of these were Jews by birth, of the <span class= "ital">libertini</span> or freed-man class. All had probably read or heard the Epistle to the Romans. They were yearning, some for the presence of the friend whom they had known seven years before at Corinth, some for a glimpse of one whom, though they had not known him, they had learnt to love. It is clear, from the salutations sent to Aquila and Priscilla and the rest in Romans 16, that the decree of Claudius banishing the Jews from Rome had been rescinded or allowed to lapse. The influence of Poppaea, now dominant at Rome, was probably in their favour, and secured their protection. Herself a proselyte to Judaism, after the fashion of her class she would extend her protection to the Jews of Rome, as she did, about the same time, to those of Jerusalem. (See Note on <a href="/acts/26-32.htm" title="Then said Agrippa to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar.">Acts 26:32</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">They came to meet us.--</span>The practice of going some miles from the city to meet one whom men delighted to honour was a common one. So the Jews of Rome had gone out to meet the Pseudo-Alexander who claimed to be a son of Herod (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xvii.</span> 12, ? 1). So the Romans had poured forth to meet Germanicus (Sueton. <span class= "ital">Calig.</span> c. 4) when he lived, and to do honour to his remains after his death (Tacit. <span class= "ital">Ann.</span> iii. 5). So in earlier days, Cicero had been welcomed on his return from exile, journeying from Brundusium on the self-same Appian Way on which St. Paul was now travelling, senate and people alike going forth to meet him (Cic. <span class= "ital">pro Sext.</span> 63, <span class= "ital">in Pison.</span> 22).<p><span class= "bld">Appii forum.</span>--There was an obvious reason for their not going further than this, as they could not tell whether the Apostle and his companions would come by the canal or the road. The town took its name probably from the Appius under whom the road had been made, and was so called as being a centre of local jurisdiction--an assize-town, as it were. So we have Forum Julium (now <span class= "ital">Friuli</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>Forum Flaminium, &c. Horace (<span class= "ital">Sat.</span> i. 5, i. 4), had condemned the town to a perpetual infamy, as<p>"Inde Forum Appi,<p>Differtum nautis, cauponibus atque malignis."<p>["With sailors filled, and scoundrel publicans."]<p>Now, we must believe, on the evening when the two parties met, the wretched little town, notorious for its general vileness, was the scene of a prayer-meeting, thanksgivings and praises pouring forth from rejoicing hearts.<p><span class= "bld">The three taverns.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">the Three Tabern?.</span> The Latin word has a wider range than the English, and is applied to a booth or shop of any kind, requiring the addition of an adjective such as "<span class= "ital">diversoria</span>" or "<span class= "ital">cauponaria</span>" before it becomes a "tavern" in the modern sense. The Roman itineraries place this town at a distance of ten miles from Appii Forum, and therefore thirty-three from Rome, Aricia forming a kind of half-way stage between the Three Tabernae and the capital. It is mentioned more than once by Cicero in his letters, and appears to have been on the Via Appia, at a point where a road from Antium fell into it (<span class= "ital">Ad Att.</span> ii. 10). It was accordingly a town of considerable importance. No traces of the name are found now near that position, but it could not have been far from the modern <span class= "ital">Cisterna.</span> The transfer of traffic from the old Via Appia to the new road of the same name (the <span class= "ital">Via Appia Nuova</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which takes a more circuitous route from Castella to Terracina, probably deprived it of its importance and led to its decay. A local tradition, indeed, but probably of very late date, finds the name of <span class= "ital">Tre Taberne</span> at a distance of about twelve miles from Rome, on the old Via Appia. Here, it is clear, a second detachment of friends met him, who had either started later than the others or had felt unequal to the additional ten miles.<p><span class= "bld">He thanked God, and took courage.</span>--The words imply a previous tendency to anxiety and fear. There had been no possibility of any communication with Rome since he had left Caesarea, and questions more or less anxious would naturally present themselves. Would he find friends there who would welcome him, or would he have to enter Rome as a criminal, with no escort but that of the soldiers who kept him? Were those Roman disciples to whom he had written so warmly still safe and well, and sound in the faith? Had persecution driven them from their homes, or had the Judaisers perverted their belief? The language of <a href="/context/romans/1-10.htm" title="Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come to you.">Romans 1:10-12</a>, shows how prominent they were in his thoughts and prayers. To these questions the arrival of the disciples was a full and satisfying answer, and the Apostle resumed his journey with an eager and buoyant hope. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - The <span class="accented">brethren, when, etc., came</span> for <span class="accented">when the brethren</span>, etc., <span class="accented">they came</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">The Market of Appius</span> for <span class="accented">Appii forum</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The brethren, when they heard of us</span>. During the seven days' stay at Putcoli, the news of the arrival of the illustrious confessors reached the Church at Rome. The writer of that wonderful Epistle which they had received some three years before, and in which he had expressed his earnest desire to visit them, and his hope that he should come to them in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ (<a href="/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11, 12, 15</a>; <a href="/romans/15-22.htm">Romans 15:22, 24, 28-32</a>), was now almost at their gates as a prisoner of state, and they would soon see him face to face. They naturally determined to go and meet him, to honor him as an apostle, and show their love to him as a brother. The younger and more active would go as far as Appii Forum, "a village on the Via Appia, forty-three miles from Rome" (Meyer). The rest only came as far as <span class="cmt_word">The Three Taverns</span>, ten miles nearer to Rome. Alford quotes a passage from Cicero's letters to Atticus (it. 10), in which he mentions both "Appii Forum" and the "Tres Tabernae;" and refers to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 17. 12:1) for a similar account of Jews at Rome, who, on hearing of the arrival of the pretended Alexander at Puteoli, went out in a body to meet him (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). He also quotes from Suetonius the passage in which he tells us that, on Caligula's return from Germany, "populi Romans sexum, aetatem, ordinem omnem, usque ad Vicesimum lapidem effadisse se" ('Calig.,' c. 4). Appii Forum was not far from the coast, and was a great place for sailors and innkeepers (Horace, 'Sat.,' 1:5, 3). The Via Appia was made by Appius Claudius, <span class="date">B.C. 442</span>. It led from the Ports Capena in Rome through the Pontino marshes to Capua. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/28-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
