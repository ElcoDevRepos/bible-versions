This respect was rooted in the Jewish tradition of honoring those who demonstrated divine power, reminiscent of the prophets of the Old Testament. The apostles' ability to heal and perform miracles was seen as evidence of God's favor, similar to how Elijah and Elisha were regarded. This high regard also reflects the early church's reputation for integrity and compassion, as they cared for the needy and lived out the teachings of Jesus.<p><b>no one else dared to join them</b><br>Despite the respect the apostles commanded, there was a palpable fear among the people. This fear was likely due to the recent events involving Ananias and Sapphira (<a href="/acts/5.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>), where deceit led to divine judgment. The community understood that joining the apostles was not merely a social or religious affiliation but a commitment to a life of holiness and truth. This fear can also be seen as a fulfillment of Jesus' words in <a href="/luke/12.htm">Luke 12:1-3</a>, where He warned of the hypocrisy of the Pharisees and the need for genuine faith. The reluctance to join the apostles highlights the seriousness with which the early church was viewed, as well as the cost of discipleship that Jesus spoke of in <a href="/luke/14-25.htm">Luke 14:25-33</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The early leaders of the Christian church, performing signs and wonders among the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The general populace in Jerusalem who observed the apostles' actions and teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon's_colonnade.htm">Solomon's Colonnade</a></b><br>A part of the temple complex in Jerusalem where the apostles gathered and taught.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The community of believers who were growing in number and faith during this time.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_authorities.htm">The Jewish Authorities</a></b><br>Religious leaders who were increasingly concerned about the apostles' influence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_and_fear.htm">Reverence and Fear</a></b><br>The high regard for the apostles shows the power of a godly testimony, but fear can hinder participation in God's work.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_faith.htm">Courage in Faith</a></b><br>Believers are called to overcome fear and boldly associate with the community of faith, trusting in God's protection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_impact.htm">Community Impact</a></b><br>The early church's influence was significant, demonstrating the importance of living out one's faith visibly and authentically.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_amidst_opposition.htm">Perseverance Amidst Opposition</a></b><br>The apostles continued their mission despite external pressures, serving as a model for enduring faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_association.htm">Discernment in Association</a></b><br>While the people respected the apostles, discernment was necessary to understand the cost of discipleship.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_5_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 5:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_others_not_join_them_in_Acts_5_13.htm">Why did "no one else dare join them" in Acts 5:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_to_identify_true_reverence_for_God.htm">How can we discern true reverence for God in our church today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Acts_5_13_Early_church_s_outsider_view.htm">What does Acts 5:13 teach about the early church's reputation among outsiders?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Acts_5_13_and_Proverbs_Fear_of_the_Lord.htm">How does Acts 5:13 connect to the fear of the Lord in Proverbs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_balance_respect_and_welcome_newcomers.htm">How can we cultivate a community that balances reverence and openness to newcomers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_avoid_apostles_in_Acts_5_13.htm">Why did no one dare join the apostles in Acts 5:13 despite their miracles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Acts_5_13_Early_church_dynamics.htm">How does Acts 5:13 reflect early church dynamics and community perception?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Acts_5_13_Early_Christians_divine_fear.htm">What does Acts 5:13 reveal about the fear of divine power among early Christians?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_acts_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Acts 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_christ_in_you_the_hope_of_glory.htm">Is Christ in you the hope of glory?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_is_ruth_accepted_despite_nehemiah_13.htm">How can we reconcile Nehemiah 13:1-3 banning Ammonites and Moabites from the assembly with earlier passages showing Ruth, a Moabite, fully accepted among God's people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_did_paul_insult_the_high_priest.htm">Acts 23:2-5 -

The latter view seems every way the more probable, 'and so the passage stands parallel with those which tell us how the people heard our Lord gladly and "came early to hear him" (<a href="/luke/21-38.htm" title="And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.">Luke 21:38</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="accented">- But</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">howbeit</span> for <span class="accented">but</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The rest</span> seems most naturally to mean those who were not included in the <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, viz. the Jews as distinguished from the disciples.
