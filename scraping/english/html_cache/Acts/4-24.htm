The context is the growing tension between the Jewish authorities and the nascent Christian movement. The believers' immediate reaction to turn to prayer highlights the importance of communal prayer in the early church, a practice rooted in Jewish tradition (<a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>).<p><b>they lifted up their voices to God with one accord</b><br>The unity of the believers is emphasized here, reflecting the early church's commitment to communal life and shared faith (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>). This unity is a fulfillment of Jesus' prayer for His followers to be one (<a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>). The phrase "with one accord" suggests a deep spiritual harmony and collective purpose, which is a recurring theme in Acts (<a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14, 2</a>:46).<p><b>&#8220;Sovereign Lord,&#8221; they said</b><br>The term "Sovereign Lord" (Greek: Despotes) underscores God's absolute authority and control over all creation. This acknowledgment of God's sovereignty is a common theme in Jewish prayers and is reflected in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/135-6.htm">Psalm 135:6</a>). It sets the tone for the prayer, recognizing God's ultimate power over the events that have transpired.<p><b>&#8220;You made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them</b><br>This phrase echoes the creation account in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a> and affirms God as the Creator of all things. It reflects a common Jewish understanding of God as the Creator, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a> and <a href="/psalms/146-6.htm">Psalm 146:6</a>. By acknowledging God's creative power, the believers are expressing their trust in His ability to intervene in their situation. This also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's sovereignty over creation, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/45-12.htm">Isaiah 45:12</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/32-17.htm">Jeremiah 32:17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The primary figures in this passage are the apostles, who have just been released from questioning by the Sanhedrin.

Their listeners&#8212;fellow believers&#8212;immediately processed the news through faith, not fear. They remembered Jesus&#8217; own warning in <a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>, &#8220;If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you as well.&#8221; The Church&#8217;s first instinct is to turn to God, trusting His sovereign plan (compare <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a> and <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they lifted up their voices to God</b><p>Prayer was their reflex.

Here again, prayer puts the situation into God&#8217;s hands before any human strategy is formed, echoing <a href="/psalms/55-22.htm">Psalm 55:22</a>, &#8220;Cast your burden upon the LORD and He will sustain you.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with one accord.</b><p>Unity is a hallmark of Spirit-filled community. <a href="/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1</a> says the disciples were &#8220;all together in one place&#8221; when the Spirit was given, and <a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32</a> notes &#8220;the multitude of believers was one in heart and soul.&#8221; This oneness mirrors Jesus&#8217; prayer in <a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a> &#8220;that they may all be one.&#8221; Their shared purpose amplifies their plea, illustrating <a href="/matthew/18-19.htm">Matthew 18:19</a>: &#8220;If two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by My Father in heaven.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Sovereign Lord,&#8221; they said,</b><p>They address God as the absolute Master, acknowledging His ultimate authority over the Sanhedrin and every earthly power. <a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a> reminds us, &#8220;I am God, and there is none like Me&#8230; My purpose will stand.&#8221; By starting with God&#8217;s sovereignty, they steady their hearts; the threats seem small in light of the One who reigns.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;You made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them.&#8221;</b><p>They ground their confidence in creation itself. Quoting <a href="/psalms/146-6.htm">Psalm 146:6</a> (&#8220;the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them&#8221;), they affirm that the God who spoke galaxies into existence can surely handle opposition. <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a> adds, &#8220;All things were created through Him and for Him&#8230; in Him all things hold together,&#8221; underscoring that their Creator is also their Sustainer in this trial.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/4-24.htm">Acts 4:24</a> pictures a church that hears bad news, immediately unites in prayer, exalts God&#8217;s sovereignty, and anchors its faith in His role as Creator. The verse teaches us to respond to hostility not with panic but with united, God-exalting prayer, confident that the One who made everything rules over everything.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">They lifted up their voice to God with one accord.</span>--The phrase seems to imply an intonation, or chant, different from that of common speech (<a href="/acts/14-11.htm" title="And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.">Acts 14:11</a>; <a href="/acts/22-22.htm" title="And they gave him audience to this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.">Acts 22:22</a>). The joint utterance described may be conceived as the result either (1) of a direct inspiration, suggesting the same words to all who were present; (2) of the people following St. Peter, clause by clause; (3) of the hymn being already familiar to the disciples. On the whole, (2) seems the most probable, the special fitness of the hymn for the occasion being against (3), and (1) involving a miracle of so startling a nature that we can hardly take it for granted without a more definite statement. The recurrence of St. Luke's favourite phrase (see Note on <a href="/acts/1-14.htm" title="These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.">Acts 1:14</a>) should not be passed over.<p><span class= "bld">Lord.</span>--The Greek word is not the common one for Lord (<span class= "ital">Kyrios</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>but <span class= "ital">Despotes, </span>the absolute Master of the Universe. It is a coincidence worth noting that, though but seldom used of God in the New Testament, it occurs again, as used by the two Apostles who take part in it, as in <a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a>, and <a href="/revelation/6-10.htm" title="And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?">Revelation 6:10</a>. (See Note on <a href="/luke/2-29.htm" title="Lord, now let you your servant depart in peace, according to your word:">Luke 2:29</a>.) In the Greek version of the Old Testament it is found applied to the Angel of Jehovah in <a href="/joshua/5-14.htm" title="And he said, No; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said to him, What said my Lord to his servant?">Joshua 5:14</a>, and to Jehovah Himself in <a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm" title="The fear of man brings a snare: but whoever puts his trust in the LORD shall be safe.">Proverbs 29:25</a>. The hymn has the special interest of being the earliest recorded utterance of the praises of the Christian Church. As such, it is significant that it begins, as so many of the Psalms begin, with setting forth the glory of God as the Creator, and rises from that to the higher redemptive work. More strict, "<span class= "ital">the</span> heaven, <span class= "ital">the</span> earth, and <span class= "ital">the</span> sea," each region of creation being contemplated in its distinctness. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> <span class="accented">- They, when they heard it, lifted</span> for <span class="accented">when they heard that they lifted</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">O Lord, thou that didst make</span>, or as in margin, <span class="accented">thou art he that did make</span>, for <span class="accented">Lord, thou art God, which hast made</span>, T.R. and A.V.; the <span class="accented">heaven and the earth</span> for heaven <span class="accented">and earth</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">With one accord</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>) occurs eleven times in the Acts (ten times in the R.T.) and only once elsewhere in the New Testament, viz. in <a href="/romans/15-6.htm">Romans 15:6</a>. O Lord, etc. Either the margin or the A.V. is preferable to the R.V., which gives an unmeaning vocative pendent. The word here used for "Lord" is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, from which our English word "despot" comes. It means "master, owner," in respect of slaves, and "a lord" or "king," whose power over his subjects is similar to that of a master over slaves. Here, with reference to creation and God's unlimited power overall that he has made, the Church in danger finds support and solace in the thought of God's absolute sovereignty. The term is applied to God in the New Testament elsewhere only in <a href="/luke/2-29.htm">Luke 2:29</a> (where observe its relation to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>; <a href="/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a>, R.T. (of our Savior); and <a href="/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> immediately follows, as here in ver. 29 does "thy servants." In the LXX. it sometimes answers to <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, and sometimes to <span class="accented">Adonai.</span> As regards the question how the whole assembly joined in this prayer, whether by a common inspiration, or by repeating the words after him that prayed them aloud (Alford), or by merely singing the second psalm (Baumgarten), or by all using what was already a formulary prepared for the needs of the Church (Meyer), it is difficult to speak positively, nor is it of any moment. Another possible explanation is that several members of the congregation, under the influence of the Holy Ghost, uttered brief prayers and praises, the consenting matter of which Luke thus puts together. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/4-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the believers] heard this,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(akousantes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
