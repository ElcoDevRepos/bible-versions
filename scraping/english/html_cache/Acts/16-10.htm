This vision, often referred to as the "Macedonian Call," is a divine intervention guiding Paul and his companions. Visions were a common way God communicated with His people in the Bible, as seen with prophets like Isaiah and Ezekiel. This particular vision underscores the urgency and divine authority behind Paul's mission. It also highlights the role of the Holy Spirit in directing the early church's expansion.<p><b>we got ready to leave for Macedonia</b><br>The use of "we" indicates that the author of Acts, traditionally believed to be Luke, has joined Paul on this journey. This marks the beginning of the "we" passages in Acts, suggesting Luke's firsthand account. Macedonia, a region in northern Greece, was a significant cultural and economic center in the Roman Empire. The decision to go to Macedonia represents the gospel's movement into Europe, a major step in the spread of Christianity. This readiness to leave reflects the obedience and immediacy in responding to God's call, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture.<p><b>concluding that God had called us</b><br>The term "concluding" suggests a process of discernment and confirmation among Paul and his companions. This reflects the communal aspect of decision-making in the early church, emphasizing the importance of collective wisdom and guidance by the Holy Spirit. The phrase indicates a clear understanding and acceptance of God's will, aligning with the biblical principle that God directs the paths of those who seek Him (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><b>to preach the gospel to them</b><br>The primary mission of Paul and his companions was to preach the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection for the salvation of humanity. This mission aligns with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations. The focus on preaching underscores the transformative power of the gospel message and its centrality in the mission of the early church. The phrase "to them" indicates the specific calling to the people of Macedonia, highlighting the inclusive nature of the gospel, which transcends cultural and geographical boundaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A key apostle in the early church, known for his missionary journeys and spreading the gospel to the Gentiles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/v/vision.htm">Vision</a></b><br>Paul receives a vision of a man from Macedonia pleading for help, which is a divine call to spread the gospel there.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/macedonia.htm">Macedonia</a></b><br>A region in Northern Greece, significant as the first European area where Paul preached the gospel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/luke.htm">Luke</a></b><br>The author of Acts, who joins Paul on this journey, as indicated by the shift to "we" in the account.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gospel_preaching.htm">Gospel Preaching</a></b><br>The central mission of Paul and his companions, emphasizing the spread of the Christian message.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_guidance.htm">Divine Guidance</a></b><br>God often guides His people through various means, including visions and circumstances.

(See <span class= "ital">Introduction to St. Luke's</span> <span class= "ital">Gospel.</span>) The other hypothesis, that he incorporates a narrative written by Silas or Timotheus, is not probable in itself, and would naturally have involved an earlier change in the form of the narrative. Accepting the received view, it seems to follow, as there is no mention of the conversion of the Evangelist, that St. Paul and St. Luke must have been already known to each other, probably either at Tarsus or Antioch, the fulness with which the history of the latter Church is given pointing to it as the scene of their previous intimacy. On this assumption, the narrator must have left Antioch after the Council of Jerusalem, probably after the dispute between Paul and Barnabas, and travelled through the interior of Asia Minor, in part, perhaps, in the track of St. Paul's earlier journey; and so gathered materials for his history till he came to Troas, and there carried on his work as an evangelist. The manner in which St. Luke introduces himself ("the Lord had called <span class= "ital">us</span>") implies, it may be noted, that he too was a preacher of the gospel. There is no record here of any mission-work done by St. Paul; but the language in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened to me of the Lord,">2Corinthians 2:12</a>, and, yet more, the facts of <a href="/acts/20-6.htm" title="And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days; where we stayed seven days.">Acts 20:6</a>, imply the existence of a Christian community. We may look, accordingly, on St. Luke as the founder of the Church of Troas, and place this among the "labours in the gospel" to which St. Paul refers in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-18.htm" title="And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;">2Corinthians 8:18</a>. The "we endeavoured" (literally, <span class= "ital">we sought</span>) implies an immediate inquiry as to what ship was sailing, bound for any port of Macedonia. Such a call as that which had been given in the vision admitted of no delay. It came from the Lord Jesus, as the sequel of that given in the vision in the Temple (<a href="/context/acts/22-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;">Acts 22:17-21</a>), and was, therefore, to be obeyed at once.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - When for <span class="accented">after</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">straightway</span> for <span class="accented">immediately</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">sought</span> for endeavor<span class="accented">ed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">go forth</span> for <span class="accented">go</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">concluding</span> fur <span class="accented">assuredly gathering</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">God</span> for the <span class="accented">Lord</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Concluding</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, only here in the sense of "concluding or "gathering." In <a href="/acts/9-22.htm">Acts 9:22</a> it is "proving." In <a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a> and <a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a> it means to "join together." In classical Greek to "bring together" in the sense of" reconciling," sometimes of" agreeing" to a proposition. In the LXX., to ,' instruct," "teach" (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-16.htm">1 Corinthians 2:16</a>). In this verse we first remark the very important introduction of the pronoun we into the narrative, marking the presence of the historian himself, and showing that he first joined St. Paul at Tread He went with him to Philippi (ver. 12), and there he appears to have stopped till St. Paul returned there in his third missionary journey on his way from Achaia to Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/20-5.htm">Acts 20:5, 6</a>), where we find him still with the apostle (<a href="/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17, 18</a>). We again find him with St. Paul at Caesarea, while he was a prisoner there (<a href="/acts/27-1.htm">Acts 27:1</a>), and he accompanied him on the voyage to Rome, which is the last place where we heir of him (<a href="/acts/27-2.htm">Acts 27:2, 3</a>. etc.; Acts 28:2, 11, 14-16; <a href="/colossians/4-14.htm">Colossians 4:14</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a>). It is quite characteristic of Holy Scripture that things are told, or appear on the face of the narrative, without any explanation. Who Luke was, what brought him to Troas, how he became a companion of St. Paul, whether as his medical adviser or otherwise, we know not.
