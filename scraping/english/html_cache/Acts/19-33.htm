The Jews, likely concerned about being associated with the uproar caused by Paul's teachings, chose Alexander to represent them. Alexander's role here may suggest he was a person of some standing or eloquence within the Jewish community. This action reflects the tension between the early Christian movement and traditional Jewish beliefs, as seen in other parts of Acts where Jewish leaders often opposed the apostles' teachings.<p><b>to explain himself</b><br>The need for explanation suggests that the Jews were anxious to distance themselves from the controversy surrounding Paul and the Christian message. This reflects the broader context of Jewish-Gentile relations in the Roman Empire, where Jews often sought to maintain their distinct identity while avoiding conflict with local authorities. The phrase also highlights the importance of public speaking and rhetoric in ancient cultures, where one's ability to articulate a defense could significantly impact public perception.<p><b>and he motioned for silence</b><br>Alexander's gesture for silence indicates his intention to address the crowd in an orderly manner, a common practice in ancient public speaking. This action underscores the chaotic nature of the scene, as the crowd was likely in an uproar due to the disturbance caused by the preaching of Paul and his companions. The ability to command attention and silence a crowd was a valued skill in the Greco-Roman world, reflecting the cultural emphasis on oratory.<p><b>so he could make his defense to the people</b><br>The concept of making a defense, or "apologia," is a recurring theme in the New Testament, where believers often had to defend their faith against accusations and misunderstandings. This mirrors other instances in Acts, such as Paul's defenses before various authorities. The need for a defense highlights the early Christians' precarious position within the Roman Empire, where they were often misunderstood and faced hostility from both Jews and Gentiles. This phrase also foreshadows the many defenses Paul himself would make, emphasizing the theme of perseverance in the face of opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/alexander.htm">Alexander</a></b><br>A Jewish man who was pushed forward by the Jews in the crowd during the uproar in Ephesus.

If we identify this Alexander with the "coppersmith" of <a href="/2_timothy/4-14.htm" title="Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:">2Timothy 4:14</a>, who wrought so much evil against the Apostle on his third and last visit to Ephesus, we may assume some trade-connection with Demetrius which would give him influence with the crowd of artisans. His <span class= "ital">apologia, </span>or defence, was obviously made by him as the representative of the Jews. The whole scene is again painted vividly--the vain attempt to gain a hearing by signs and gestures, the fury of the people on recognising his Jewish features and dress, their ready assumption that all Jews were alike in abhorring idols. Perhaps, also, they may have known or suspected that that abhorrence was sometimes accompanied by a readiness to traffic in what had been stolen from the idol's temple. St. Paul's words in <a href="/romans/2-22.htm" title="You that say a man should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? you that abhor idols, do you commit sacrilege?">Romans 2:22</a> may have had a personal application.

Some think he is the same as "Alexander the coppersmith," of whose conduct St. Paul complains so bitterly (<a href="/2_timothy/4-14.htm">2 Timothy 4:14, 15</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a>), and he may or may not be. It seems likely that, as St. Paul's offence was speaking against the gods and their temples, the Jews, who were commonly accused of being atheists, and one of whose nation Paul was, came in for their share of the popular odium. They were anxious, therefore, to excuse themselves before the people of having had any share in St. Paul's work, and put forward Alexander, no doubt a clever man and a good speaker, to make their defense. But as soon as the people knew that he was a Jew, they refused to listen to him, and drowned his voice with incessant shouts of "Great is Diana of the Ephesians." Meyer, however, thinks he was a Christian, because of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The people</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as ver. 30).
