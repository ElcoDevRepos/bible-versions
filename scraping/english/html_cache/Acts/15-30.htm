The sending off signifies the early church's practice of commissioning individuals for specific tasks, reflecting the importance of unity and shared mission. This act of sending is reminiscent of the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus sends His disciples to spread the Gospel.<p><b>and went down to Antioch</b><br>Antioch in Syria was a significant center for early Christianity, often considered the birthplace of the term "Christian" (<a href="/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>). Geographically, "went down" refers to the descent from the higher elevation of Jerusalem to the lower elevation of Antioch. Antioch served as a hub for missionary activity and was a diverse city, reflecting the growing inclusivity of the early church.<p><b>where they assembled the congregation</b><br>The assembly of the congregation highlights the communal nature of the early church, where believers gathered to hear important news and teachings.

This decision was pivotal in affirming that salvation is through grace and faith in Jesus Christ, not adherence to the Law (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).
