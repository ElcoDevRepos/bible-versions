It served as a significant hub for maritime travel in the ancient world. The city was founded by Attalus II, a king of Pergamon, and was known for its strategic location. This port was crucial for Paul and Barnabas as they concluded their first missionary journey, highlighting the importance of travel and trade routes in the spread of the Gospel.<p><b>they sailed to Antioch</b><br>Antioch in Syria was a major center for early Christianity and the base for Paul and Barnabas's missionary activities. It was the third-largest city in the Roman Empire and a melting pot of cultures and religions. This city was where believers were first called Christians (<a href="/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>), and it played a pivotal role in the early church as a launching point for missions. The return to Antioch signifies the completion of their mission and the importance of the church community in supporting and sending out missionaries.<p><b>where they had been commended to the grace of God</b><br>The phrase indicates that Paul and Barnabas were entrusted to God's grace by the church in Antioch before they embarked on their journey. This act of commendation reflects the early church's practice of prayer and laying on of hands as a means of seeking divine guidance and protection (<a href="/acts/13-3.htm">Acts 13:3</a>). It underscores the belief in God's sovereignty and provision in the mission work, emphasizing reliance on divine grace rather than human effort.<p><b>for the work they had just completed</b><br>The work refers to the missionary journey that Paul and Barnabas undertook, which included preaching the Gospel, establishing churches, and strengthening the faith of new believers. This journey is detailed in <a href="/acts/13.htm">Acts 13 and 14</a>, where they faced both opposition and success. The completion of this work highlights the fulfillment of their mission and the spread of Christianity beyond Jewish communities to Gentile regions, aligning with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). It also reflects the early church's commitment to evangelism and discipleship, setting a precedent for future missions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/attalia.htm">Attalia</a></b><br>A port city in Pamphylia, modern-day Antalya in Turkey, from where Paul and Barnabas set sail back to Antioch.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/antioch.htm">Antioch</a></b><br>A significant city in early Christianity, located in modern-day Turkey.

(<a href="/john/4-4.htm">John 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Jonah boarding ship at Joppa (<a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>) or the early church believers fleeing to Phoenicia and Cyprus (<a href="/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>), each movement serves God&#8217;s wider plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They sailed to Antioch</b><p>&#8226;
