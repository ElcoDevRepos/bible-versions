His ministry was marked by integrity and dedication, serving as a model for others. This reflects the biblical principle of leading by example, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/11.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>, where Paul urges believers to imitate him as he imitates Christ.<p><b>that by this kind of hard work</b><br>Paul's reference to hard work underscores the value of diligence and labor in Christian ministry. In the Greco-Roman world, manual labor was often looked down upon, but Paul, a tentmaker by trade (<a href="/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>), dignifies it as a means of supporting oneself and others. This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/14-23.htm">Proverbs 14:23</a>, which states that hard work brings profit.<p><b>we must help the weak</b><br>Helping the weak is a recurring theme in Scripture, reflecting God's heart for the vulnerable. In the early church, this included widows, orphans, and the poor (<a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>). Paul's exhortation echoes Jesus' teachings on serving the least of these (<a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>) and aligns with the Old Testament laws that provided for the needy (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>).<p><b>remembering the words of the Lord Jesus Himself</b><br>Though this specific saying of Jesus is not recorded in the Gospels, it is consistent with His teachings on generosity and selflessness. The early church preserved oral traditions of Jesus' sayings, and this one encapsulates His message of sacrificial love and giving.<p><b>&#8216;It is more blessed to give than to receive.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This principle is foundational to Christian ethics, emphasizing the joy and spiritual reward found in giving. It contrasts with the world's view of accumulating wealth and possessions. The concept is supported by other scriptures, such as <a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>, which promises that giving will result in receiving, and <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>, which highlights the cheerful giver.

But perhaps its force here is equivalent to the phrase in <a href="/john/13-15.htm">John 13:15</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x7d;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you," as the R.V. takes it. <span class="cmt_word">So laboring</span>; viz. as ye have seen me do. <span class="cmt_word">To help the weak</span>. Meyer, following Bengel and others, understands this to mean the weak in faith," like <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-22.htm">1 Corinthians 9:22</a>. They say that St. Paul's self-denial in refusing the help he had a right to claim as an apostle, and supporting himself by his labor, was a great argument to convince the weak in faith of his disinterestedness and of the truth of his gospel, and so he recommends the elders of the Church to follow his example. But the word here is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> rather suggest the idea of bodily weakness (<a href="/matthew/25-36.htm">Matthew 25:36</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-8.htm">Matthew 10:8</a>, etc.; <a href="/luke/5-15.htm">Luke 5:15</a>, etc.), and the words of the Lord Jesus which follow suggest almsgiving to the needy. So that it is better to understand the word of the weakly and poor, those unable to work for themselves. Doubtless St. Paul, out of his scanty earnings, found something to give to the sick and needy. The sentiment in our text is thus exactly analogous to the precept in <a href="/ephesians/4-28.htm">Ephesians 4:28</a>. The very word there used, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>, recalls the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of ver. 34. <span class="cmt_word">To remember the words of the Lord Jesus</span>. This is a solitary instance era saying of our Lord's, not recorded in the Gospels, being referred to in Scripture. There are many alleged sayings of Christ recorded in apocryphal Gospels or in the writings of Fathers as Papias and others (Routh, 'Reliq. Sac.,' 1:9, 10, 12), some of which may be authentic; but this alone is warranted by Scripture. How it came to St Paul's knowledge, and that of the Ephesian elders to whom he seems to have taken for granted that it was familiar, it is impossible to say. But it seems likely that, in those very early days, some of the Lord's unwritten words may have floated in the memory of men, and been preserved by word of mouth. Clement (1 Corinthians it.) seems to refer to the saying when he writes in praise of the former character of the Corinthians, that they were then <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. But he probably had it from the Acts of the Apostles, as had the author of the 'Apostol. Constitut.' (4. 3, 1). Similar apophthegms are quoted from heathen writers, as those cited by Kuinoel: <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (Artemidor., 'Onirocr.,' 4, 3); <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1fb6;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> (Arist., 'Nieom.,' 4, 1), "It is more becoming to a free man to give to whom he ought to give, than to receive from whom he ought to receive." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/20-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In everything,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(panta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
