This devotion indicates a continuous and steadfast adherence to the doctrine that the apostles imparted, which was rooted in the teachings of Jesus and the Hebrew Scriptures. The apostles' teaching formed the foundation of Christian doctrine and practice, emphasizing the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies in Christ. This dedication to learning reflects the Jewish tradition of studying the Torah, but now with the revelation of Christ as the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets.<p><b>and to the fellowship</b><br>The term "fellowship" (Greek: koinonia) implies a deep, communal bond among believers, characterized by mutual support, sharing, and unity. This fellowship was not merely social but spiritual, reflecting the unity of the body of Christ. The early church's fellowship was a radical departure from the individualism of the surrounding Greco-Roman culture, emphasizing instead a community that shared resources and supported one another. This communal life is reminiscent of the communal aspects of Jewish life, such as the shared meals and festivals, but now centered around the shared faith in Christ.<p><b>to the breaking of bread</b><br>The breaking of bread likely refers to both the communal meals shared among believers and the observance of the Lord's Supper, or Communion. This practice was a tangible expression of their unity in Christ and a remembrance of His sacrifice. The breaking of bread is rooted in Jewish customs, such as the Passover meal, which Jesus reinterpreted at the Last Supper as a symbol of the new covenant in His blood. This act of breaking bread together was a proclamation of the Lord's death until He comes, as Paul later explains in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-26.htm">1 Corinthians 11:26</a>.<p><b>and to prayer</b><br>Prayer was a central aspect of the early church's life, reflecting their dependence on God and their desire for His guidance and power. The early Christians continued the Jewish tradition of regular prayer, but with a new focus on the name of Jesus and the coming of the Holy Spirit. Prayer was both a personal and communal activity, encompassing praise, thanksgiving, intercession, and supplication. The emphasis on prayer highlights the church's reliance on the Holy Spirit, who empowered them for witness and service, fulfilling Jesus' promise in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The original disciples of Jesus Christ who were chosen to spread His teachings.
