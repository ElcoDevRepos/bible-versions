The context is a legal proceeding where Paul is being accused by Jewish leaders. The emphasis on personal examination highlights the Roman legal system's value on firsthand evidence and testimony. This approach is consistent with Roman practices, where the governor would hear cases directly. It also reflects the biblical principle of seeking truth through careful and personal inquiry, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/18-17.htm">Proverbs 18:17</a>, which advises hearing both sides of a matter.<p><b>you will be able to learn the truth</b><br>The appeal to "learn the truth" underscores the importance of truth in judicial proceedings, a value deeply rooted in both Jewish and Christian teachings. In <a href="/john/8-32.htm">John 8:32</a>, Jesus speaks of knowing the truth and being set free by it, indicating the transformative power of truth. The phrase also reflects the biblical theme of God as the ultimate source of truth, as seen in <a href="/psalms/25-5.htm">Psalm 25:5</a>, where the psalmist asks God to guide them in truth.<p><b>about all our charges against him.</b><br>The "charges" refer to the accusations brought by the Jewish leaders against Paul, which included claims of stirring up riots, leading a sect, and attempting to desecrate the temple (<a href="/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5-6</a>). These charges were serious under Roman law, as they involved potential threats to public order and religious sanctity. The historical context reveals tensions between Jewish authorities and early Christians, who were often seen as a disruptive force. This situation also parallels the trials of Jesus, where false charges were brought against Him (<a href="/mark/14-55.htm">Mark 14:55-59</a>), highlighting a recurring theme of unjust accusations faced by God's servants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who is on trial, accused by Jewish leaders of causing unrest and profaning the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tertullus.htm">Tertullus</a></b><br>- A lawyer representing the Jewish leaders, presenting the case against Paul to the Roman governor.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/felix.htm">Felix</a></b><br>- The Roman governor presiding over Paul's trial, known for his corruption and indecisiveness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The city where the alleged offenses took place, central to Jewish religious life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/caesarea.htm">Caesarea</a></b><br>- The location of the trial, a Roman administrative center in Judea.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_truth.htm">The Importance of Truth</a></b><br>Truth is central to the Christian faith.

Tertullus apparently suggests that the judge should interrogate the prisoner--perhaps, by using a technical term, with a well-understood significance, that he should examine him by scourging, or some other mode of torture. Strictly speaking, the "examination" of Which Tertullus speaks was a preliminary inquiry, previous to the actual trial, to ascertain whether there were sufficient grounds for further proceedings. It will be observed that he keeps back the fact of St. Paul's being a Roman, and it does not follow that Tertullus knew that Lysias had informed Felix of it. It is possible, however, after all, if we admit the genuineness of <a href="/acts/24-7.htm" title="But the chief captain Lysias came on us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,">Acts 24:7</a>, that the relative pronoun may refer to Lysias and not to the Apostle; and this agrees with the language of Felix in <a href="/acts/24-22.htm" title="And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.">Acts 24:22</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> <span class="accented">- From whom thou wilt be able, by examining him thyself, to take</span> for <span class="accented">by examining of whom thyself mayest take</span>, A.V.
