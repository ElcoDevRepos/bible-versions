It highlights the direct communication between God and the patriarchs, emphasizing the personal relationship God had with them. This divine instruction is foundational in the narrative of God's covenant with Abraham, which is a central theme in the Bible.<p><b>&#8216;Leave your country</b><br>Abraham was originally from Ur of the Chaldeans, a prosperous city in ancient Mesopotamia. This command required Abraham to leave behind his familiar surroundings, which signifies a call to faith and obedience. It reflects the theme of separation from worldly ties to pursue God's promises, a recurring motif in Scripture.<p><b>and your kindred</b><br>This instruction to leave his family underscores the radical nature of Abraham's call. It required prioritizing God's command over familial bonds, illustrating the cost of discipleship. This mirrors Jesus' teaching in the New Testament about the necessity of placing God above family ties (<a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>).<p><b>and go to the land I will show you.&#8217;</b><br>The land refers to Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants. This promise is central to the Abrahamic Covenant, which is foundational for understanding the biblical narrative of Israel. The land is not specified initially, requiring Abraham to trust in God's guidance. This act of faith is later commended in <a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8</a>, where Abraham's obedience is highlighted as an example of faith in action.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>The speaker in <a href="/bsb/acts/7.htm">Acts 7</a>, Stephen is one of the first deacons of the early church and the first Christian martyr.
