This aligns with the biblical theme that God is the ultimate source of power and authority. Miracles in the Bible often serve to authenticate the message and the messenger, as seen in the ministries of Moses (<a href="/exodus/4.htm">Exodus 4:1-9</a>) and Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/17-17.htm">1 Kings 17:17-24</a>). The term "extraordinary" suggests that these miracles were beyond the usual, indicating a special move of God during this period.<p><b>through the hands of Paul</b><br>Paul, an apostle to the Gentiles, was chosen by God to spread the Gospel, and his ministry was marked by signs and wonders (<a href="/romans/15-18.htm">Romans 15:18-19</a>). The phrase "through the hands of Paul" indicates that Paul was the human instrument through whom God worked. This reflects the biblical principle that God often uses human agents to accomplish His purposes, as seen with the prophets and apostles. The miracles performed through Paul in Ephesus, a city known for its pagan practices and magic (<a href="/acts/19-19.htm">Acts 19:19</a>), served to demonstrate the superiority of the power of God over other spiritual forces.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate source of power and authority, who performs miracles through His chosen instruments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>An apostle of Jesus Christ, known for his missionary journeys and significant role in spreading the Gospel to the Gentiles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where Paul performed these extraordinary miracles, known for its temple of Artemis and a center of pagan worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/extraordinary_miracles.htm">Extraordinary Miracles</a></b><br>Unusual and remarkable acts of divine intervention that go beyond the ordinary, demonstrating God's power and authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_miracles.htm">God's Sovereignty in Miracles</a></b><br>God is the source of all miracles, and He chooses when and through whom they occur.

This reminds us that our first response to any testimony of power is worship, not hero-worship of the servant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>did</b><p>&#8226; The verb is simple yet weighty&#8212;God acted.

In Ephesus, God exceeded even those expectations.<p>&#8226; Such displays serve a gospel purpose: to authenticate the message and open hearts (<a href="/hebrews/2-3.htm">Hebrews 2:3-4</a>). They are never for entertainment but for conviction and conversion (<a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30-31</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul later recalls that &#8220;the signs of an apostle&#8221; were done among the Corinthians &#8220;with great perseverance&#8212;signs and wonders and mighty works&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-12.htm">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>), linking the Ephesian season to his broader ministry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>through the hands</b><p>&#8226; God chose a tangible channel&#8212;Paul&#8217;s hands&#8212;echoing earlier moments when &#8220;many signs and wonders came about among the people through the hands of the apostles&#8221; (<a href="/acts/5-12.htm">Acts 5:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often portrays hands as instruments of divine purpose: Moses&#8217; staff (<a href="/exodus/4-17.htm">Exodus 4:17</a>), Jesus touching the leper (<a href="/matthew/8-3.htm">Matthew 8:3</a>), believers laying hands for healing (<a href="/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; This phrasing keeps the spotlight on divine initiative while acknowledging human cooperation: spiritual gifts are given &#8220;as He determines&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-11.htm">1 Corinthians 12:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of Paul</b><p>&#8226; The apostle Paul, once the persecutor, now becomes the vessel.
