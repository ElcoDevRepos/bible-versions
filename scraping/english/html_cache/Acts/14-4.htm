The division among the people reflects a common theme in the early church's mission: the gospel often caused division as it challenged existing beliefs and social structures. This division is reminiscent of Jesus' own words in <a href="/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34-36</a>, where He speaks of bringing not peace but a sword, indicating that His message would divide families and communities. The division also highlights the spiritual battle between the acceptance and rejection of the gospel message.<p><b>Some sided with the Jews,</b><br>The Jews in this context likely refer to the Jewish leaders and those who were resistant to the message of Jesus as the Messiah. Historically, the Jewish community in the Diaspora often held significant influence in cities like Iconium. Their opposition to Paul and Barnabas is consistent with other accounts in Acts, where Jewish leaders frequently opposed the apostles' teachings, fearing the loss of their religious authority and the disruption of traditional Jewish beliefs. This opposition is seen in other parts of Acts, such as in Thessalonica (<a href="/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5</a>) and Corinth (<a href="/acts/18-6.htm">Acts 18:6</a>).<p><b>and others with the apostles.</b><br>The term "apostles" here refers to Paul and Barnabas, who were sent out by the Holy Spirit and the church in Antioch to spread the gospel (<a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2-3</a>). Those who sided with the apostles were likely Gentiles and some Jews who were open to the message of salvation through Jesus Christ. This division indicates the growing acceptance of the gospel among Gentiles, fulfilling the prophecy that the Messiah would be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>). The support for the apostles also underscores the power of the Holy Spirit in drawing people to the truth of the gospel, as seen throughout the book of Acts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_the_city.htm">The People of the City</a></b><br>Refers to the inhabitants of Iconium, a city in the region of Galatia, who were divided in their response to the message of the apostles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>This group likely includes Jewish leaders and those who were resistant to the message of Paul and Barnabas, opposing their teaching about Jesus as the Messiah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>Specifically refers to Paul and Barnabas, who were preaching the Gospel in Iconium and performing signs and wonders to affirm their message.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/iconium.htm">Iconium</a></b><br>A significant city in the Roman province of Galatia, where Paul and Barnabas faced both acceptance and opposition during their missionary journey.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/division.htm">Division</a></b><br>The event of division among the city's people highlights the differing responses to the Gospel message, a common occurrence in the early church's expansion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_the_gospel.htm">The Nature of the Gospel</a></b><br>The Gospel inherently divides because it demands a response.

Whenever the gospel is proclaimed, neutrality evaporates; people must decide for or against Christ (<a href="/matthew/12-30.htm">Matthew 12:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Some sided with the Jews</b><p>Opposition in Iconium was led by unbelieving Jews (<a href="/acts/14-2.htm">Acts 14:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Jealousy stirred many to resist the message, as in Pisidian Antioch: &#8220;When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and contradicted what Paul was saying&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-45.htm">Acts 13:45</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul later reminded the Thessalonians of &#8220;those Jews who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets&#8230;hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; This siding reveals the hardness of heart Isaiah described: &#8220;You will be ever hearing but never understanding&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>; echoed in <a href="/acts/28-26.htm">Acts 28:26-27</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet God&#8217;s sovereignty remains: even rejection serves to push the gospel outward (<a href="/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and others with the apostles</b><p>While some resisted, many embraced the truth and stood with Paul and Barnabas.<p>&#8226; In the previous city, &#8220;All who were appointed for eternal life believed&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-48.htm">Acts 13:48</a>); the same gracious calling was at work in Iconium.<p>&#8226; Luke likens the gospel&#8217;s aroma to life for some, death for others (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Bereans &#8220;received the message with great eagerness&#8221; and &#8220;many believed&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11-12</a>); Crispus and his household believed in Corinth (<a href="/acts/18-8.htm">Acts 18:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Those who side with the apostles are in fact siding with Christ Himself: &#8220;Whoever listens to you listens to Me&#8221; (<a href="/luke/10-16.htm">Luke 10:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Their faith brings new identity&#8212;&#8220;To all who did receive Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/14-4.htm">Acts 14:4</a> shows that the gospel inevitably divides. In Iconium some clung to tradition and unbelief, while others embraced the apostles and the Savior they proclaimed. Scripture presents this split as normal whenever truth meets fallen hearts. For every resistant crowd there is also a believing remnant, demonstrating both human responsibility and God&#8217;s sovereign grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">The multitude of the city was divided.</span>--The context shows that St. Luke writes of the bulk of the heathen population.

The "rulers" who are named would seem, from the form of punishment selected, to have been those of the Jewish synagogue, and the crime of which the preachers were accused, as in the case of Stephen, to have been blasphemy.
