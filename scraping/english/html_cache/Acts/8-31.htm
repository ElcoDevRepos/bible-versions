His question highlights the necessity of guidance in understanding Scripture, reflecting the broader biblical theme that spiritual truths often require explanation and teaching. This aligns with <a href="/romans/10-14.htm">Romans 10:14</a>, which emphasizes the need for preaching and teaching for faith to arise. The eunuch's humility in admitting his need for guidance contrasts with the pride often seen in religious leaders of the time, such as the Pharisees, who believed they had all knowledge. This moment also underscores the role of the Holy Spirit in guiding believers into all truth, as promised in <a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>.<p><b>And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.</b><br>Philip, one of the seven deacons chosen in <a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6</a>, is led by the Holy Spirit to this divine appointment. The eunuch's invitation to Philip signifies openness and a desire to learn, which is crucial for spiritual growth. This act of inviting Philip to sit with him symbolizes fellowship and the breaking down of social and cultural barriers, as Philip, a Jew, engages with an Ethiopian Gentile. This moment foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles into the early Christian church, a theme that becomes more prominent in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> with Peter and Cornelius. The physical act of sitting together to study Scripture reflects the rabbinic tradition of learning in community, emphasizing the importance of communal study and interpretation of God's Word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philip.htm">Philip</a></b><br>One of the seven deacons chosen in <a href="/bsb/acts/6.htm">Acts 6</a>, Philip is an evangelist who is led by the Holy Spirit to meet the Ethiopian eunuch on the road from Jerusalem to Gaza.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ethiopian_eunuch.htm">Ethiopian Eunuch</a></b><br>A high-ranking official in charge of the treasury of the Kandake (queen) of the Ethiopians.

The word for "guide" connects itself with the title of "a guide of the blind," which the Rabbis were fond of claiming (<a href="/matthew/15-14.htm" title="Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind.
