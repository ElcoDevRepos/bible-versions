His presence was well-known, suggesting he had been begging there for a significant period. This recognition underscores the authenticity of the miracle, as the people could attest to his previous condition.<p><b>who used to sit begging</b><br>Begging was a common practice for those with disabilities in ancient times, as there were limited means of support. The man's condition left him reliant on the charity of temple-goers. This setting highlights the social and economic challenges faced by individuals with disabilities in first-century Judea.<p><b>at the Beautiful Gate of the temple</b><br>The Beautiful Gate is believed to be one of the main entrances to the temple, possibly the Nicanor Gate, which was adorned with Corinthian bronze. Its location was strategic for beggars, as it was a place of high traffic where worshippers entered to pray, making it an ideal spot for almsgiving.<p><b>and they were filled with wonder and amazement</b><br>The reaction of the people reflects the impact of witnessing a genuine miracle. Such signs were intended to provoke awe and point to the divine power at work through the apostles. This response is consistent with other biblical accounts where miracles lead to amazement and often to faith.<p><b>at what had happened to him</b><br>The transformation of the man from a beggar to someone who could walk was undeniable evidence of divine intervention. This miracle served as a testament to the power of Jesus Christ working through His apostles, fulfilling the promise of signs and wonders accompanying the spread of the Gospel. It also echoes the messianic prophecies of healing and restoration found in Isaiah, pointing to the kingdom of God breaking into the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter_and_john.htm">Peter and John</a></b><br>Apostles of Jesus Christ who were instrumental in the early church's growth.
