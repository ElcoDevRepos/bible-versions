This phrase indicates that the sermon recorded in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a> is a summary, and Peter likely shared more detailed teachings and explanations. The act of testifying is significant in the early church, as it involves bearing witness to the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This aligns with the role of the apostles as witnesses (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). The use of "many other words" suggests a comprehensive effort to communicate the gospel message, emphasizing the importance of thorough teaching in the early church.<p><b>and he urged them</b><br>Peter's urging reflects a sense of urgency and importance. The Greek word used here implies a strong exhortation or encouragement. This reflects the apostolic mission to persuade and lead people to repentance and faith in Christ. The urgency is heightened by the eschatological context of the early church, which lived with the expectation of Christ's imminent return. This call to action is consistent with the prophetic tradition, where prophets often urged the people to return to God (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/25-4.htm">Jeremiah 25:4-5</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Be saved from this corrupt generation.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase echoes the prophetic call to separate from the sinful practices of the surrounding culture. The term "corrupt generation" reflects the moral and spiritual decay present in society, reminiscent of the language used by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/12-39.htm">Matthew 12:39</a>. The call to "be saved" indicates a need for divine intervention and deliverance, which is a central theme in the New Testament. Salvation is presented as both a present reality and a future hope, achieved through faith in Jesus Christ. This call to be distinct from the world aligns with the biblical theme of holiness and the call to be a "peculiar people" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, Peter is the primary speaker in <a href="/bsb/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>.
