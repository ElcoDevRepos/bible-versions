Such disagreements were common in the early church as the message of Jesus challenged traditional Jewish beliefs. This internal conflict reflects the broader tension between adherence to the Mosaic Law and the new covenant in Christ, as seen in <a href="/acts/15-5.htm">Acts 15:5-11</a>.<p><b>and began to leave</b><br>The act of leaving signifies a rejection or unwillingness to accept Paul's message. This mirrors other instances in Acts where audiences were divided, such as in <a href="/acts/17-32.htm">Acts 17:32-34</a> in Athens. It underscores the recurring theme of resistance to the Gospel, especially among those who were steeped in traditional Jewish teachings.<p><b>after Paul had made this final statement</b><br>Paul's final statement serves as a pivotal moment, emphasizing the gravity and finality of his message. It reflects his role as a prophet-like figure, delivering God's message to the people, similar to the prophets of the Old Testament who often faced rejection.<p><b>&#8220;The Holy Spirit was right when He spoke</b><br>This acknowledges the divine inspiration of the Scriptures, affirming the belief that the Holy Spirit guided the prophets.
