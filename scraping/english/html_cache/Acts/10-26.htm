Cornelius, a Roman centurion, had fallen at Peter's feet in reverence. This act of humility by Cornelius, a man of authority, shows the respect he had for Peter, recognizing him as a messenger of God. Peter's response, however, is a demonstration of humility and equality in Christ. The act of helping someone up can be seen as a physical representation of the spiritual lifting that occurs when the gospel is shared. This moment also reflects the breaking down of barriers between Jews and Gentiles, a central theme in Acts, as Peter reaches out to a Gentile, symbolizing the inclusivity of the gospel message.<p><b>&#8220;Stand up,&#8221; he said,</b><br>Peter's command for Cornelius to stand up is a rejection of any form of worship directed towards him. In the cultural context of the time, it was not uncommon for people to show reverence to those they considered holy or divine. However, Peter's insistence that Cornelius stand up underscores the Christian teaching that worship is due to God alone. This moment is reminiscent of other biblical instances where humans are corrected for attempting to worship angels or apostles, such as in <a href="/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>, where John is told not to worship the angel. Peter's directive emphasizes the monotheistic belief central to Christianity and the understanding that all believers are equal before God.<p><b>&#8220;I am only a man myself.&#8221;</b><br>Peter's declaration of his humanity is a profound statement of humility and theological truth. By acknowledging that he is "only a man," Peter aligns himself with the rest of humanity, despite his role as an apostle. This reflects the Christian doctrine that all humans are equal in their need for salvation and grace, regardless of their position or authority. It also serves as a reminder of the humanity of Jesus Christ, who, though divine, took on human form (<a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a>). Peter's words here can be seen as a rejection of any form of idolatry or elevation of humans to divine status, reinforcing the idea that all glory and honor belong to God alone. This statement also prefigures the later teachings of Paul, who emphasizes the equality of all believers in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, Peter is a central figure in the early Christian church.
