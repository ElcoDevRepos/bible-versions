In the ancient world, venomous snakebites were often deadly, and the people of Malta would have witnessed such outcomes before. This expectation reflects a common belief in immediate divine retribution or judgment, a theme seen throughout Scripture, such as in the story of Job's friends who assumed his suffering was due to sin (<a href="/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7-8</a>).<p><b>But after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him,</b><br>The patience of the islanders in observing Paul suggests a mix of curiosity and superstition. Their waiting period indicates a significant amount of time passed, enough to confirm that Paul was unharmed. This mirrors other biblical accounts where God's protection is evident, such as Daniel in the lion's den (<a href="/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22</a>). It also highlights the miraculous nature of Paul's survival, aligning with Jesus' promise in <a href="/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a> that believers would handle snakes without harm.<p><b>they changed their minds and said he was a god.</b><br>The islanders' shift from expecting death to declaring Paul a god reflects the ancient tendency to deify individuals who displayed extraordinary powers or survived against the odds. This reaction is similar to the people of Lystra, who attempted to worship Paul and Barnabas as gods after witnessing a miracle (<a href="/acts/14-11.htm">Acts 14:11-13</a>). It underscores the human inclination to attribute divine status to those who exhibit supernatural protection or abilities, contrasting with the Christian understanding of God's power working through His servants. This moment also foreshadows the spread of the Gospel, as it opens a door for Paul to share the truth about the one true God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who was bitten by a viper but suffered no harm, leading the islanders to change their perception of him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_islanders_of_malta.htm">The Islanders of Malta</a></b><br>The local inhabitants who initially thought Paul would die from the snake bite but later considered him a god when he remained unharmed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/malta.htm">Malta</a></b><br>The island where Paul and his companions were shipwrecked and where this event took place.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_viper.htm">The Viper</a></b><br>The snake that bit Paul, which was expected to cause harm but did not, demonstrating God's protection over Paul.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shipwreck.htm">The Shipwreck</a></b><br>The preceding event that brought Paul and his companions to Malta, setting the stage for this miraculous incident.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_protection.htm">God's Protection</a></b><br>God's providence and protection are evident in Paul's survival.

The episode contrasts unstable human judgments with the unchanging power of the living God, pointing observers&#8212;and us&#8212;to worship the Creator rather than the creature.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">They looked when he should have swollen . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and they were expecting that . . .</span> The verb for "swollen" implies literally "inflammation," and one of the enormous serpents of Africa took its name. Prestes ("the inflamer"), from it. Lucan (ix. 790) describes the effect of its bite--<p>"Percussit Prestes, illi ruber igneus ora<p>Succendit, tenditque cutem, pereunte figura."<p>[" The Prestes bit him, and a fiery flush<p>Lit up his face, and set the skin a-stretch,<p>And all its comely grace had passed away."]<p><span class= "bld">They changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</span>--The miraculous escape naturally made an even stronger impression on the minds of the Melitese than what had seemed a supernatural judgment. Their thoughts may have travelled quickly to the attributes of the deities who, like Apollo or 'sculapius, were depicted as subduing serpents. The sudden change of belief may be noted as presenting a kind of inverted parallelism with that which had come over the people of Lystra.

And this is the more remarkable here because there are no fewer than three other medical phrases in this verse, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">be</span>sides those immediately preceding <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (according to several good manuscripts and editions) <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. So that it looks as if, having once got into a medical train of thought from the subject he was writing about, medical language naturally came uppermost in his mind. <span class="cmt_word">Have swollen</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, only here in the Bible, and not found in this sense in older classical writers. But it is the usual medical word for "inflammation" in any part of the body. <span class="cmt_word">Fallen down</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, only here and in <a href="/acts/26-14.htm">Acts 26:14</a>, and twice in the LXX.; but common in Homer and elsewhere, and especially frequent in medical writers of persons falling down in fits, or weakness, or wounded, or the like. <span class="cmt_word">Nothing amiss</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). Mr. Hobart quotes a remarkable parallel to this phrase from Damocrites, quoted by Galen. He says that whosoever, having been bitten by a mad dog, drinks a certain antidote (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1fb3;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), "shall suffer no harm." It is used in medical writers in two senses - of" unusual symptoms," and of fatal consequences. In the New Testament it only occurs elsewhere in <a href="/luke/23-41.htm">Luke 23:41</a>, "Nothing amiss;" and <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:2</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>. It is also used in the LXX. for wickedness, doing wickedly, etc. <span class="cmt_word">They changed their minds</span>; as in an opposite direction the Lycaonians did (<a href="/acts/14-11.htm">Acts 14:11, 19</a>). It is a graphic picture of the fickleness of an untutored mind yielding to every impulse. The impunity with which St. Paul endured the bite of the viper was a direct fulfillment of our Lord's promise in <a href="/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a> (see further note on ver. 8). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/28-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[The islanders] were expecting</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#948;&#972;&#954;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(prosedok&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4328.htm">Strong's 4328: </a> </span><span class="str2">To expect, wait for, await, think, anticipate.
