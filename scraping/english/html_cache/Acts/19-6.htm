In the Old Testament, it was used in the consecration of priests (<a href="/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14</a>) and in the transfer of leadership, as seen with Moses and Joshua (<a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18-23</a>). In the New Testament, it is frequently associated with healing (<a href="/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a>) and the impartation of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/8-17.htm">Acts 8:17</a>). Here, Paul's action signifies the apostolic authority and the transmission of spiritual gifts.<p><b>the Holy Spirit came upon them</b><br>The coming of the Holy Spirit is a fulfillment of Jesus' promise that the Spirit would empower believers (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). This event mirrors the Pentecost experience (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>), where the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles, marking the birth of the Church. The Holy Spirit's arrival signifies God's presence and empowerment for ministry, aligning with the prophecy of <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a> about the outpouring of the Spirit in the last days.<p><b>and they spoke in tongues</b><br>Speaking in tongues, or glossolalia, is a spiritual gift mentioned in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>. It serves as a sign of the Holy Spirit's presence and is often associated with the initial evidence of Spirit baptism. This phenomenon first occurred at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>) and is seen as a means of edification for the individual and the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-4.htm">1 Corinthians 14:4-5</a>). It also serves as a sign to unbelievers (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>).<p><b>and prophesied</b><br>Prophesying involves speaking forth God's message, often with an element of foretelling or exhortation. In the New Testament, prophecy is a gift of the Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>) and is meant for the edification, encouragement, and comfort of the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-3.htm">1 Corinthians 14:3</a>). The ability to prophesy indicates the active presence of the Holy Spirit and aligns with the prophetic tradition seen throughout Scripture, from the Old Testament prophets to the New Testament church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>An apostle of Jesus Christ, instrumental in spreading the Gospel to the Gentiles.

Then answered Peter,">Acts 10:46</a>. Here all the facts of the case confirm the view which has there been stated. The mere power of speaking foreign languages without learning them, as other men learn, seems a much less adequate result of the new gift than that which we find in the new enthusiasm and intensity of spiritual joy, of which the gift of tongues was the natural expression. It is not without interest to remember that the discussion of the two gifts in 1 Corinthians 14, in which the connection of the "tongues" with jubilant and ecstatic praise is unmistakable (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-14.htm" title="For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.">1Corinthians 14:14-16</a>), was written not very long after this incident, and while the facts must yet have been fresh in St. Paul's memory.
