This period allowed him to strengthen the church and address issues within the Corinthian congregation, as evidenced by his letters to them. The duration of his stay suggests a time of fruitful ministry and possibly the writing of the Epistle to the Romans, which outlines key theological doctrines.<p><b>And when the Jews formed a plot against him</b><br>Throughout Paul's ministry, he faced opposition from Jewish leaders who saw his teachings as a threat to traditional Jewish beliefs. This opposition is consistent with the pattern seen in other parts of Acts, where Jewish leaders often incited hostility against Paul. The plot indicates the intensity of the resistance he faced and highlights the spiritual warfare present in his mission.<p><b>as he was about to sail for Syria,</b><br>Paul's intended journey to Syria reflects his strategic planning in spreading the Gospel. Syria, with its significant city of Antioch, was a major center for early Christianity. This route would have facilitated further missionary work and the strengthening of existing churches. The mention of sailing underscores the importance of maritime travel in the spread of Christianity during the first century.<p><b>he decided to go back through Macedonia.</b><br>Paul's decision to return through Macedonia demonstrates his adaptability and strategic thinking in response to threats. Macedonia was home to several churches Paul had previously established, such as those in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea. This route allowed him to revisit and encourage these communities, reinforcing their faith and addressing any issues. It also reflects the interconnectedness of the early Christian communities and Paul's role in maintaining those connections.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is central to this passage.

After the riot in Ephesus (<a href="/acts/19-23.htm">Acts 19:23-41</a>) Paul needed a season of calm. God granted it.<p>&#8226; Discipleship and consolidation: Paul would have strengthened the local believers as he once did in Corinth during his earlier eighteen-month stay (<a href="/acts/18-11.htm">Acts 18:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Writing ministry: Most scholars place the writing of the epistle to the Romans in this three-month window (<a href="/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>; 15:22-29), showing how fruitfully Paul used a pause in travel.<p>&#8226; Providential timing: A winter in Greece made sense; sailing on the Mediterranean was dangerous in that season (<a href="/acts/27-9.htm">Acts 27:9</a>).

Paul&#8217;s three-month stay built up believers; the Jewish plot exposed ongoing opposition; the aborted voyage underscored the need for vigilance; and the Macedonian back-track revealed both prudence and providence.

His intention was, however, frustrated. The malignant Jews of Corinth watched their opportunity. At Cenchreae, amid the stir and bustle of a port, they might do what they had failed to do before. Here there was no Gallio to curb their fury, and throw the aegis of his tolerant equity over their victim. Their plans were laid, and their victim was to be seized and made away with as he was on the point of embarking. On hearing of the plot, the Apostle had to change his plans, and started with his companions for Macedonia, either travelling by land or taking a ship bound for one of its ports, instead of the one bound for Caesarea, or Tyre, or Joppa. It is clear that the latter course would have baffled his murderers quite as much as the former.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- When he had spent ... there</span> for <span class="accented">there abode</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a plot was laid against him by the Jews</span> for <span class="accented">when the Jews laid wait for him</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">for</span> for <span class="accented">into</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">determined</span> for <span class="accented">purposed</span>, A.V.
