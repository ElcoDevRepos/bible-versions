His influence is evident as the council heeded his advice. Gamaliel's counsel to leave the apostles alone was based on the principle that if their movement was of human origin, it would fail, but if it was from God, it could not be stopped. This reflects a cautious and pragmatic approach, showing the tension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, who were more aggressive in their opposition to the apostles. Gamaliel's role highlights the diversity of thought within the Jewish leadership and provides a backdrop for understanding the early church's challenges.<p><b>They called the apostles in and had them flogged.</b><br>Flogging was a common form of punishment in the ancient world, often used to maintain order and discipline. The apostles' flogging was likely the traditional Jewish punishment of 39 lashes, as prescribed by the Law of Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-3.htm">Deuteronomy 25:3</a>). This act was intended to serve as a deterrent and a warning to the apostles. Despite the physical pain and public humiliation, the apostles' willingness to endure such suffering underscores their commitment to their mission and their faith in Jesus Christ. This event foreshadows the persecution that the early church would face and echoes the suffering of Christ, who was also flogged before His crucifixion.<p><b>Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus,</b><br>The prohibition against speaking in the name of Jesus highlights the central conflict between the early church and the Jewish authorities. The name of Jesus represents His authority and power, and the apostles' preaching in His name was seen as a direct challenge to the religious establishment. This command reflects the authorities' fear of losing control and the growing influence of the Christian message. The apostles' defiance of this order, as seen in subsequent passages, demonstrates their unwavering dedication to their divine commission and their belief in the necessity of proclaiming the gospel.<p><b>and released them.</b><br>The release of the apostles, despite the flogging and the order to cease preaching, indicates the limited power of the Sanhedrin to suppress the burgeoning Christian movement. This release can be seen as a temporary reprieve, allowing the apostles to continue their mission. It also illustrates the providence of God in protecting His messengers and ensuring the spread of the gospel. The apostles' subsequent actions, as recorded in the Book of Acts, show their resilience and determination to fulfill the Great Commission, regardless of the opposition they faced.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gamaliel.htm">Gamaliel</a></b><br>A respected Pharisee and teacher of the law, who advised the Sanhedrin to be cautious in dealing with the apostles, suggesting that if their movement was of human origin, it would fail, but if it was from God, they could not stop it.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The early followers of Jesus Christ, specifically Peter and John, who were spreading the message of Jesus' resurrection and performing miracles in His name.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanhedrin.htm">The Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The Jewish ruling council, composed of religious leaders who were responsible for maintaining Jewish law and order.

His words became a providential brake on murderous intentions. <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a> says, &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is a watercourse in the hand of the LORD; He directs it wherever He pleases,&#8221; and here the Lord quietly steers the leaders away from execution. Gamaliel&#8217;s stature (<a href="/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>) lends weight, but ultimately it is God who turns the tide so the gospel can keep advancing (<a href="/isaiah/14-27.htm">Isaiah 14:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They called the apostles in</b><p>After agreeing with Gamaliel, the Sanhedrin summons the twelve from custody (<a href="/acts/5-27.htm">Acts 5:27</a>). This recalls an earlier moment: &#8220;They called them in and ordered them not to speak&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-18.htm">Acts 4:18</a>). The repetition underscores a pattern: earthly powers keep hauling believers back, yet cannot silence them. Jesus foretold such hearings&#8212;&#8220;You will be brought before governors and kings for My sake&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-18.htm">Matthew 10:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and had them flogged.</b><p>Flogging was the standard Jewish punishment limited to forty lashes (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-3.htm">Deuteronomy 25:3</a>). The apostles experience the very abuse <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a> foreshadowed: &#8220;By His stripes we are healed.&#8221; Paul later writes, &#8220;Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-24.htm">2 Corinthians 11:24</a>), connecting his sufferings to this same scene. Notice:<p>&#8226; Physical pain did not mean divine disfavor; it fulfilled Jesus&#8217; warning in <a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>.<p>&#8226; The beating highlighted the courage produced by the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus,</b><p>This gag order directly contradicts Christ&#8217;s command, &#8220;Go into all the world and preach the gospel&#8221; (<a href="/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>). Peter had already settled the matter: &#8220;We must obey God rather than men&#8221; (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>). The council could bruise backs but could not bind tongues. Such intimidation continues today, yet believers echo the apostles&#8217; resolve (<a href="/2_timothy/1-7.htm">2 Timothy 1:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and released them.</b><p>The leaders thought release was concession enough; God turned it into a launch pad. The very next verse shows the apostles &#8220;rejoicing that they had been counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the Name&#8221; (<a href="/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>) and teaching &#8220;every day, in the temple courts and from house to house&#8221; (<a href="/acts/5-42.htm">Acts 5:42</a>). Human freedom is nice, but true liberty comes from Christ: &#8220;So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/5-40.htm">Acts 5:40</a> records a pivotal moment where political restraint, divine oversight, and apostolic courage intersect. God uses Gamaliel to stay execution, allows a flogging that deepens the apostles&#8217; resolve, and then turns a hostile command into fresh opportunity. The verse teaches that God directs even hostile authorities, that suffering for Christ is honor, and that no earthly power can muzzle the gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(40) <span class= "bld">And to him they agreed.</span>--The Sadducees, after their manner, would probably have preferred a more violent course, but the Pharisees were strong in the Sanhedrin, and the <span class= "ital">via media</span> recommended by Gamaliel was, under such circumstances, likely to command a majority, and was, therefore, apparently accepted without a division.<p><span class= "bld">And beaten them.</span>--Here we trace the action of Caiaphas and the priests.
