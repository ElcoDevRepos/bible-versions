Paul had been in Ephesus, a major city in Asia Minor known for its temple to Artemis, which was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. His departure signifies the end of a significant period of ministry in this influential city. The context of <a href="/acts/18.htm">Acts 18</a> shows that Paul had been reasoning in the synagogue, which was his custom, engaging both Jews and Greeks in discussions about Jesus as the Messiah.<p><b>&#8220;I will come back to you if God is willing.&#8221;</b><br>Paul's statement reflects a deep reliance on God's sovereignty and a recognition of divine providence. This echoes <a href="/james/4-15.htm">James 4:15</a>, where believers are encouraged to say, "If it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that." It underscores the biblical principle that human plans are subject to God's will. Paul's intention to return also highlights his commitment to the believers in Ephesus, showing pastoral care and a desire to continue teaching and strengthening the church there.<p><b>And he set sail from Ephesus.</b><br>Ephesus was a key port city, making it a strategic location for travel and trade in the Roman Empire. Paul's departure by sea indicates the interconnectedness of the ancient world and the use of maritime routes for missionary work. This journey is part of Paul's second missionary journey, which is detailed in <a href="/acts/15-36.htm">Acts 15:36-18</a>:22. The act of setting sail also symbolizes the spread of the Gospel beyond the confines of one city, as Paul continues to fulfill the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) by taking the message of Christ to new regions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is central to this passage.

Though the Jews there &#8220;asked him to stay for a longer time, he declined&#8221; (v. 20), signaling that his itinerary is Spirit-directed, not audience-driven (cf. <a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6-10</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores forward momentum in ministry&#8212;Paul rarely lingers where the Spirit has already opened the next door (<a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2-3</a>; 20:22-24).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he said, &#8220;I will come back to you&#8221;</b><p>Paul&#8217;s promise reveals both pastoral affection and strategic planning.<p>&#8226;

3 <a href="/bsb/john/14.htm">John 14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>if God is willing</b><p>These four words ground every plan in divine sovereignty.<p>&#8226; Paul lives what he teaches: &#8220;I hope, by the will of God, to come to you&#8221;

It reflects <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>: &#8220;A man&#8217;s heart plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps,&#8221; underscoring humility and dependence.<p>&#8226; For believers today, &#8220;if God is willing&#8221; is not pious jargon but a realistic confession that Jesus is Lord over schedules, opportunities, and travel mercies (cf. <a href="/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he set sail from Ephesus</b><p>The narrative shifts from promise to action.<p>&#8226; Paul boards a ship bound for Caesarea, intending to greet the church in Jerusalem before returning to Antioch (<a href="/acts/18-22.htm">Acts 18:22</a>).<p>&#8226; His immediate obedience models faith that acts, not merely speaks (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Leaving Ephesus now enables a richer ministry later; Paul will spend nearly three years there on his third journey, &#8220;preaching the kingdom&#8221; and seeing &#8220;the word of the Lord spread widely&#8221; (<a href="/acts/19-8.htm">Acts 19:8-10, 20</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that the gospel advances through both presence and periodic absence&#8212;God orchestrates timing for maximum impact (<a href="/acts/21-14.htm">Acts 21:14</a>;

If he missed that, there would be no other feast till that of Tabernacles; and then, in October, travelling, whether by sea or land, became dangerous and difficult.

But Alford, Meyer, Wordsworth, and others consider it to be genuine. It is certainly difficult to account for such words being inserted in the text if they were not genuine; whereas it is easy to account for their omission, either by accident or from the fact that the brevity of the allusion to his visit to Jerusalem in ver. 22 might easily mislead a copyist into thinking that St. Paul did not go to Jerusalem at this time, and therefore that the words were misplaced. Observe how St. Paul's fixed purpose to reach Jerusalem as soon as possible tallies with the account of his vow. <span class="cmt_word">This feast</span> (A.V.). It is not clear what feast is meant. Alford, Wordsworth, ' Speaker's Commentary,' and others, following Wieseler, think it was the Feast of Pentecost, being influenced by the consideration that sailing was dangerous and very unusual so early as before the Passover.
