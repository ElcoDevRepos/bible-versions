Epicureans believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain, emphasizing materialism and the absence of divine intervention. Stoics, on the other hand, focused on virtue, reason, and living in harmony with nature, often accepting a form of divine providence. The presence of these philosophers highlights the intellectual environment of Athens, a city known for its rich philosophical heritage. This encounter reflects the cultural and religious diversity Paul faced, as he engaged with thinkers who held worldviews vastly different from the monotheistic and redemptive message of Christianity.<p><b>Some of them asked, &#8220;What is this babbler trying to say?&#8221;</b><br>The term "babbler" translates from the Greek word "spermologos," which literally means "seed picker." It was a derogatory term used to describe someone who picks up scraps of knowledge and presents them without understanding. This reflects the philosophers' dismissive attitude towards Paul, perceiving him as an amateur or a charlatan. This skepticism is reminiscent of how prophets and messengers were often received with scorn or disbelief, as seen in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7-8</a>).<p><b>Others said, &#8220;He seems to be advocating foreign gods.&#8221;</b><br>The accusation of advocating foreign gods was serious in Athens, a city with a pantheon of established deities. Introducing new gods was often met with suspicion and could lead to legal repercussions, as seen in the trial of Socrates. This charge against Paul echoes the challenges faced by early Christians who proclaimed a message that was perceived as subversive to traditional religious practices. The reference to "foreign gods" also underscores the exclusivity of the Christian message, which proclaimed Jesus as the one true God, in contrast to the polytheistic beliefs of the time.<p><b>They said this because Paul was proclaiming the good news of Jesus and the resurrection.</b><br>Paul's message centered on the "good news" or gospel, which is the core of Christian teaching. The resurrection of Jesus is a foundational doctrine, affirming His divinity and the promise of eternal life for believers. This concept was particularly challenging for Greek philosophers, as the idea of bodily resurrection was foreign to their understanding of the afterlife. The resurrection is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies (e.g., <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>) and is central to the apostolic preaching (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>). It also serves as a type of Christ's victory over death, offering hope and redemption to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ and the resurrection in Athens.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/epicurean_philosophers.htm">Epicurean Philosophers</a></b><br>Followers of Epicurus, who believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain as the primary goals of life, often denying the existence of an afterlife.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/stoic_philosophers.htm">Stoic Philosophers</a></b><br>Followers of Stoicism, a philosophy that emphasized rationality and self-control, often pantheistic in their view of God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/athens.htm">Athens</a></b><br>A city known for its rich history in philosophy and learning, where Paul engages with the local thinkers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/debate.htm">Debate</a></b><br>The event where Paul is questioned and challenged by the philosophers regarding his teachings about Jesus and the resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/engage_with_culture_thoughtfully.htm">Engage with Culture Thoughtfully</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s approach in Athens shows the importance of understanding and engaging with the cultural and philosophical context of those we are trying to reach.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/proclaim_the_core_of_the_gospel.htm">Proclaim the Core of the Gospel</a></b><br>Despite the philosophical differences, Paul remains focused on the core message of Jesus and the resurrection, which should be central in our witness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/expect_varied_reactions.htm">Expect Varied Reactions</a></b><br>Just as Paul encountered different responses, we should be prepared for a range of reactions when sharing the gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/use_wisdom_in_dialogue.htm">Use Wisdom in Dialogue</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s interaction with the philosophers demonstrates the need for wisdom and discernment in how we present the truth of the gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/stand_firm_in_faith.htm">Stand Firm in Faith</a></b><br>Despite being called a "babbler," Paul stands firm in his faith, reminding us to remain steadfast in our beliefs even when faced with skepticism.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_17_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 17:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_engage_with_differing_beliefs.htm">How can we effectively engage with those who have different beliefs today?

The former took its name from its founder, Epicurus, who lived a long and tranquil life at Athens, from B.C. 342 to 270. As holding their meetings in a garden, which he had left b<span class= "ital">y</span> his will in trust as a place of study for his disciples, they were sometimes known as the School of the Garden, and as such were distinguished from those of the Porch (Diog. Laert. <span class= "ital">Epic.</span> c. 10). His speculations embraced at once a physical and an ethical solution of the problems of the universe. Rejecting, as all thinking men did, the popular Polytheism, which yet they did not dare openly to renounce, he taught that the gods, in their eternal tranquillity, were too far off from man to trouble themselves about his sorrows or his sins. They needed no sacrifices and answered no prayers. The superstition which enslaved the minds of most men was the great evil of the world, the source of its crimes and miseries. The last enemy to be destroyed was with him, as in our own time with Strauss, the belief in an immortality of retribution. A man's first step towards happiness and wisdom was to emancipate himself from its thraldom; the next was to recognise that happiness consisted in the greatest aggregate of pleasurable emotions. Experience taught that what are called pleasures are often more than counterbalanced by the pains that follow, and sensual excesses were therefore to be avoided. Epicurus's own life seems to have been distinguished by generosity, self-control, and general kindliness, and even by piety and patriotism (Diog. Laert. <span class= "ital">Epic.</span> c. 5). But as no law was recognised as written in the heart, and human laws were looked on as mere conventional arrangements, each man was left to form his own estimate of what would give him most pleasure, and most men decided for a life of ease and self-indulgence; sometimes balanced by prudential calculations, sometimes sinking into mere voluptuousness. The poetry of Horace presents, perhaps, the most attractive phase of popular Epicureanism; the sense which has come to be attached to the modern word "Epicure," as applied to one whose life is devoted to the indulgence of the sense of taste, shows to what a depth of degradation it might sink.<p>In the world of physics, Epicurus has been claimed as anticipating some of the results of modern science. The ideas of creation and control were alike excluded. Matter had existed from eternity, and the infinite atoms of which it was composed had, under the action of attractive and Tepelling forces as yet unknown, entered into manifold combinations, out of which had issued, as the last stage of the evolution, the world of nature as it now lies before us. The poem of Lucretius, <span class= "ital">De Rerum Natura, </span>may be regarded as the grandest utterance of this negative and practically atheistic system, but its real nobleness lies chiefly in its indignant protest against the superstition which had cast its veil of thick darkness over all the nations.<p>It may be well to give one or two characteristic examples of each of these phases. On the one side we have the ever-recurring advice of the popular poet of society to remember that life is short, and to make the most of it:--<p>"Quid sit futurum cras, fuge quaerere: et,<p>Quern Fors dierum cunque dabit, lucro<p>Appone."<p>["Strive not the morrow's chance to know,<p>But count whate'er the Fates bestow<p>As given thee for thy gain."]--Hor. <span class= "ital">Od.</span> i. 9.<p>"Sapias, vina liques, et spatio brevi<p>Spem longam reseces.

Hence it is used of idle hangers-on in the markets, who get a livelihood by what they can pick up, and so generally of empty, worthless fellows.
