These believers accompanied Peter from Joppa to Caesarea, a journey that underscores the early church's mission to spread the gospel beyond Jerusalem. The presence of these Jewish Christians is significant as it sets the stage for the unfolding revelation that God's salvation extends beyond the Jewish people. This group serves as witnesses to the pivotal moment in the early church when the inclusion of Gentiles into the faith community is divinely affirmed.<p><b>were astounded</b><br>The astonishment of the Jewish believers indicates the unexpected nature of the event they witnessed. Despite the teachings of Jesus and the prophecies in the Hebrew Scriptures about the inclusion of the Gentiles (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>), the reality of this inclusion was still surprising to them. This reaction highlights the deeply ingrained cultural and religious barriers that existed between Jews and Gentiles at the time. Their amazement underscores the radical nature of the gospel, which breaks down these barriers and fulfills the promise of a universal salvation.<p><b>that the gift of the Holy Spirit</b><br>The "gift of the Holy Spirit" refers to the outpouring of the Spirit, which is a sign of God's acceptance and empowerment. This event mirrors the Pentecost experience in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, where the Holy Spirit was first given to Jewish believers. The Holy Spirit's presence is a fulfillment of Jesus' promise in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> and serves as a divine endorsement of the Gentiles' inclusion in the church. Theologically, this gift signifies the new covenant, where the Spirit is given to all believers, regardless of ethnic background, as prophesied in <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>.<p><b>had been poured out</b><br>The imagery of the Spirit being "poured out" suggests abundance and generosity, echoing Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a> and <a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>. This language emphasizes the transformative and inclusive nature of God's action. The pouring out of the Spirit is a key theme in Acts, symbolizing the fulfillment of God's promises and the inauguration of the church's mission to all nations. It also reflects the baptism of the Holy Spirit, which empowers believers for witness and service.<p><b>even on the Gentiles</b><br>This phrase marks a significant turning point in the early church, as it confirms that Gentiles are fully included in God's plan of salvation. The inclusion of Gentiles fulfills the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised that all nations would be blessed through Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). This event challenges the prevailing Jewish understanding of God's covenant and redefines the boundaries of the faith community. It also prefigures the later decisions of the Jerusalem Council in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, which formally recognized the Gentile mission. Theologically, this inclusion underscores the universality of the gospel and the breaking down of ethnic and cultural divisions in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles, a key leader in the early church, who received a vision from God to visit Cornelius, a Gentile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/circumcised_believers.htm">Circumcised Believers</a></b><br>Jewish Christians who accompanied Peter to Cornelius' house.

Those who came with Peter were apparently not sharers at the time in the exultant joy which they were yet compelled to recognise as the Spirit's work. They listened with amazement as they heard the rapturous chant burst from the lips of the as yet unbaptised heathens. Here, accordingly, was one definite fulfilment of Peter's vision. Those who so spake had been, as it were, carried up into heaven, as the four-footed beasts and creeping things had been, and so a proof was given that no man might henceforth call them common or unclean. Peter himself had indeed learnt that lesson so fully (<a href="/acts/10-28.htm" title="And he said to them, You know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come to one of another nation; but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.">Acts 10:28</a>) as not to need this special attestation, but for those who came with him this evidence was needed and was sufficient.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> <span class="accented">- Amazed</span> for <span class="accented">astonished</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">They of the circumcision</span> would doubtless be the brethren from Joppa who accompanied Peter (ver. 23).
