In the context of <a href="/acts/23.htm">Acts 23</a>, Paul is being transported under Roman protection due to a plot against his life. The timing reflects the urgency and seriousness of the situation, as the Roman authorities are taking swift action to ensure Paul's safety.<p><b>they returned to the barracks</b><br>The "they" refers to the soldiers who were part of the escort for Paul. The barracks would be the Antonia Fortress in Jerusalem, a military installation where Roman soldiers were stationed. This location is significant as it highlights the Roman military presence in Jerusalem, which was a source of tension between the Jewish population and their Roman occupiers. The return to the barracks indicates that the soldiers' immediate task of escorting Paul was complete, at least for this leg of the journey.<p><b>and let the horsemen go on with him</b><br>The horsemen were a part of the larger contingent assigned to protect Paul. The decision to let the horsemen continue with Paul underscores the importance of his safe passage to Caesarea, where he would stand trial before the Roman governor. This detail reflects the Roman practice of using cavalry for rapid and secure transportation, especially for important or high-risk individuals. The presence of horsemen also signifies the high level of threat perceived by the Roman authorities regarding Paul's situation. This protection can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to Paul that he would testify in Rome, as mentioned earlier in <a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is being transported under Roman protection due to a plot against his life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/horsemen.htm">Horsemen</a></b><br>Roman soldiers assigned to escort Paul safely to Governor Felix in Caesarea.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/barracks.htm">Barracks</a></b><br>The place where the Roman soldiers returned after escorting Paul partway.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city from which Paul is being transported due to the threat against him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/caesarea.htm">Caesarea</a></b><br>The destination where Paul is being taken to stand trial before Governor Felix.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_protection.htm">God's Sovereignty in Protection</a></b><br>Even in dire circumstances, God orchestrates events to protect His servants.

Just as Paul had been assured the previous night in <a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a> that he would testify in Rome, the &#8220;next day&#8221; shows the Lord already moving events toward that promise, echoing <a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>, &#8220;joy comes in the morning,&#8221; and <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, where His mercies are &#8220;new every morning.&#8221;<p>- Scripture repeatedly records pivotal &#8220;next day&#8221; moments&#8212;<a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24</a>, <a href="/joshua/3-1.htm">Joshua 3:1</a>&#8212;reminding us that progress in God&#8217;s plan often unfolds in ordinary calendar steps. Believers can trust that today&#8217;s obedience positions tomorrow&#8217;s deliverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they returned to the barracks</b><p>- The 200 soldiers and 200 spearmen (<a href="/acts/23-23.htm">Acts 23:23</a>) bring Paul safely out of Jerusalem, then head back to the Antonia Fortress. Their return underscores <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-4</a>, where governing authorities are &#8220;God&#8217;s servants for your good.&#8221; Even pagan soldiers unknowingly serve God&#8217;s purpose.<p>- This retreat also highlights God&#8217;s economy of protection: once the immediate threat in Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/23-12.htm">Acts 23:12-15</a>) is neutralized, the full detachment is no longer necessary. Like Gideon&#8217;s reduced army in <a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2-7</a>, God delivers with exactly the resources required&#8212;no more, no less&#8212;so He gets the glory.<p>- For Paul, seeing the troops march back could have been a test of faith. Yet previous rescues&#8212;<a href="/acts/21-34.htm">Acts 21:34, 22</a>:24&#8212;prove that the same Lord who used soldiers before will continue to shield him. The believer today can recall past deliverances to steady present trust.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and let the horsemen go on with him.</b><p>- Seventy horsemen (<a href="/acts/23-23.htm">Acts 23:23</a>) continue the journey, a faster, lighter escort suited to open roads. This reflects strategic wisdom; while we rest in Providence, we still employ prudent means (<a href="/nehemiah/4-9.htm">Nehemiah 4:9</a> balances prayer with practical defense).<p>- The phrase &#8220;go on with him&#8221; keeps the spotlight on Paul&#8217;s mission, not merely his safety. God preserves His servant so the gospel advances, paralleling <a href="/acts/18-9.htm">Acts 18:9-10</a> where the Lord told Paul, &#8220;I am with you&#8230;and no one will attack you to harm you.&#8221;<p>- Caesarea, their destination (<a href="/acts/23-33.htm">Acts 23:33-35</a>), is a Gentile center, matching <a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a> where Paul is a chosen vessel &#8220;to carry My name before the Gentiles.&#8221; Each mile under cavalry guard inches closer to that calling, illustrating <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>&#8212;&#8220;A man&#8217;s heart plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/23-32.htm">Acts 23:32</a> may sound like a travel log, yet every detail showcases God&#8217;s precise, protective oversight. A new day dawns; soldiers return as their task ends; horsemen press on so Paul can fulfill Christ&#8217;s commission. The verse invites believers to rest in the same sovereign care, confident that the Lord orchestrates timing, resources, and journey toward His promised purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> <span class="accented">- But on</span> for on, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">On the morrow</span>, after their departure from Jerusalem, not, as Alford suggests, after their departure from Antipatris.
