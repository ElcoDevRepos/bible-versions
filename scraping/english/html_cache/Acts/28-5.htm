This event occurs on the island of Malta after Paul's shipwreck, highlighting God's providence in preserving Paul for his mission. The act of shaking off the creature can be seen as a metaphor for resisting evil and temptation, reminiscent of Jesus' instruction to His disciples to shake the dust off their feet when leaving a place that does not welcome them (<a href="/matthew/10-14.htm">Matthew 10:14</a>). The fire symbolizes purification and judgment, often seen in Scripture as a means of refining and testing (<a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>).<p><b>and suffered no ill effects.</b><br>Paul's lack of harm from the viper bite is a testament to God's miraculous protection, fulfilling Jesus' promise that His followers would be unharmed by deadly things (<a href="/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a>). This incident serves as a sign to the Maltese people of Paul's divine mission and authority, leading them to view him with reverence. It also echoes the protection given to the Israelites in the wilderness, where God safeguarded them from serpents (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>).
