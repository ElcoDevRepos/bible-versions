His staying with the disciples in Jerusalem signifies his acceptance into the early Christian community, despite his former persecution of Christians. This acceptance was facilitated by Barnabas, who vouched for Saul's genuine conversion (<a href="/acts/9-27.htm">Acts 9:27</a>). This moment marks a significant turning point in Saul's life and the early Church, as he transitions from persecutor to proponent of the faith.<p><b>moving about freely in Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem was the center of Jewish religious life and the early Christian Church. Saul's ability to move freely indicates that he was not immediately under threat from Jewish leaders, despite his previous role in persecuting Christians. This freedom suggests a period of relative peace for the Church in Jerusalem, allowing Saul to engage with the community and spread the Gospel. It also highlights the early Church's growing influence and the protection they might have received from Roman authorities, who were often indifferent to intra-Jewish religious disputes.<p><b>and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord</b><br>Saul's boldness in preaching reflects the transformative power of his encounter with Christ. His message centered on Jesus as the Messiah, a claim that was controversial and dangerous, especially in Jerusalem where Jesus had been crucified. This boldness is a fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy that His followers would be His witnesses (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). Saul's preaching also aligns with the apostolic mission to spread the Gospel, as seen in Peter and John's earlier boldness in <a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>. Saul's actions foreshadow his future role as a leading apostle to the Gentiles, emphasizing the power of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers to proclaim the Gospel fearlessly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul (Paul)</a></b><br>Former persecutor of Christians who experienced a dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus.

Just days earlier, these same disciples feared him (<a href="/acts/9-26.htm">Acts 9:26</a>), yet now they welcome him.<p>- This mirrors Barnabas&#8217;s earlier role at Damascus&#8212;he bridges distrust and testifies to the reality of Saul&#8217;s conversion (<a href="/acts/9-27.htm">Acts 9:27</a>).<p>- Similar hospitality is urged throughout Scripture: believers are to receive one another as Christ received us (<a href="/romans/15-7.htm">Romans 15:7</a>) and to show brotherly love (<a href="/hebrews/13-1.htm">Hebrews 13:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>- Saul&#8217;s remaining &#8220;with them&#8221; underscores the importance of community for every new believer (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>). Discipleship thrives in fellowship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>moving about freely in Jerusalem</b><p>- The phrase highlights God&#8217;s protection. The city where Saul once hunted Christians is now a field for open ministry. <a href="/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a> reminds us, &#8220;The LORD is my light and my salvation&#8212;whom shall I fear?&#8221;<p>- &#8220;Freely&#8221; implies unhindered movement&#8212;no chains, no secrecy. Just as Peter walked out of prison later in <a href="/acts/12-7.htm">Acts 12:7&#8211;10</a>, Saul moves under divine guardianship.<p>- Notice the reversal: earlier, believers fled Jerusalem because of Saul&#8217;s persecution (<a href="/acts/8-1.htm">Acts 8:1</a>), but now Saul walks the same streets fearlessly. Only the risen Christ can bring that turnaround.<p>- This freedom exemplifies the promise of <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>&#8212;witnesses in Jerusalem first&#8212;fulfilled even in former enemies.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord</b><p>- Bold speech marks Spirit-filled witness (<a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>). Saul&#8217;s courage is not natural bravado but empowerment from the Holy Spirit (<a href="/2_timothy/1-7.htm">2 Timothy 1:7</a>).<p>- &#8220;In the name of the Lord&#8221; shows the authority source. Like Peter and John who healed &#8220;in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth&#8221; (<a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6</a>), Saul proclaims under Christ&#8217;s lordship.<p>- Boldness means clarity and conviction, not harshness. <a href="/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3&#8211;4</a> illustrates this balance&#8212;open doors and clear speech.<p>- By preaching Jesus openly in Jerusalem, Saul aligns with earlier apostolic testimony (<a href="/acts/5-28.htm">Acts 5:28&#8211;29</a>). The same gospel, one unified mission.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/9-28.htm">Acts 9:28</a> paints a vivid portrait of transformation: the former persecutor now abides in Christian fellowship, enjoys God-given freedom in the very city he once terrorized, and proclaims Jesus with fearless conviction.
