The context is the spread of the Gospel beyond Jewish territories, following the persecution of the church in Jerusalem. Samaria was a region with historical tensions between Jews and Samaritans, dating back to the division of the kingdom after Solomon's reign and the Assyrian conquest. The arrival of the apostles signifies the breaking down of these barriers, fulfilling Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be witnesses in "Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."<p><b>they prayed for them</b><br>Prayer is a central practice in the early church, reflecting dependence on God for spiritual empowerment and guidance. The apostles' prayer for the Samaritans highlights the importance of intercession in the life of the church. This act also demonstrates the unity and fellowship among believers, as the Jewish apostles pray for the Samaritan converts, emphasizing the inclusivity of the Gospel.<p><b>to receive the Holy Spirit</b><br>The reception of the Holy Spirit is a significant event in the life of a believer, marking the indwelling presence of God. In the context of Acts, the Holy Spirit's coming upon the Samaritans is a pivotal moment, showing that the gift of the Spirit is not limited to Jewish believers but is available to all who accept Christ. This event parallels the Pentecost experience in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, where the Holy Spirit was first poured out on the apostles. It fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, about the outpouring of the Spirit on all people. Theologically, it underscores the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers for witness and service, as seen throughout the book of Acts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter_and_john.htm">Peter and John</a></b><br>Two of Jesus' apostles who were sent to Samaria to support the new believers.

The verse reminds us that the church advances through prayer-filled dependence on God, welcoming all who trust Christ into the same Spirit-formed family.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Prayed for them, that they might</span> <span class= "bld">receive the Holy Ghost.</span>--The prayer clearly pointed to such a gift of the power of the Spirit as had been bestowed on the Day of Pentecost. It assumed that such gifts had been received by the disciples generally at Jerusalem, and that they were distinct from the new birth of water and the Spirit (<a href="/john/3-5.htm" title="Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.">John 3:5</a>) which was given through baptism. The Apostles looked on the Samaritans as qualified for that higher gift as well as for admission into the kingdom, and it was given to them, and not to Philip in his subordinate position as an evangelist, to be the channels of communicating it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they might receive the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Holy Ghost.</span> Why was it needful that two apostles should come down to Samaria and pray, with laying on of hands, for the newly baptized that they might receive the Holy Ghost? There is no mention of such prayer or such imposition of hands in the case of the first three thousand who were baptized. They were told by St. Peter, "Be baptized every one of you, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost" (<a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>), and they were baptized, and doubtless did receive the Holy Ghost, Neither is there any mention of such things in the case of the subsequent thousands who were baptized at Jerusalem on the apostles' preaching. Why, then, was it so in Samaria? To answer this question, we must observe the difference in the circumstances. The baptisms at Jerusalem were performed by the apostles themselves. The Holy Ghost was given upon their promise and assurance. But in Samaria the preaching and the baptizing were done by the scattered disciples. There was a danger of many independent bodies springing up, owing no allegiance to the apostles, and cemented by no bonds to the mother Church. But Christ's Church was to be one - many members, but one body. The apostolate was to be the governing power of the whole Church, by the will and ordinance of Christ. Hence there was a manifest reason why, when the gospel spread beyond Judaea, these visible spiritual gifts should be given only through the laying on of the apostles' hands, and by the intervention of their prayers. This had a manifest and striking influence in marking and preserving the unity of the Church, and in marking and maintaining the sovereignty of the apostolic rule. For precisely the same reason has the Catholic and Apostolic Church in all ages (<a href="/acts/19-5.htm">Acts 19:5, 6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-2.htm">Hebrews 6:2</a>) maintained the rite of confirmation, "after the example of the holy apostles." Besides the other great benefits connected with it, its influence in binding up in the unity of the Church the numerous parishes of the diocese, instead of letting them become independent congregations, is very great. Observe, too, how prayer and the laying on of hands are tied together. Neither is valid without the other. In this case, as at Pentecost, the extraordinary gift of the Holy Ghost was conferred. In confirmation, now that miracles have ceased, it is the ordinary and invisible grace of the Holy Spirit that is to be looked for. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/8-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">On their arrival,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#946;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(katabantes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2597.htm">Strong's 2597: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go down, come down, either from the sky or from higher land, descend.
