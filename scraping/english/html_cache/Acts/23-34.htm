Letters were a common means of communication in the Roman Empire, especially for official matters. This letter was from Claudius Lysias, the Roman commander in Jerusalem, explaining the situation with Paul. The act of reading the letter indicates the Roman practice of thorough legal procedures, ensuring that the governor was informed of the circumstances before making any decisions.<p><b>and asked what province Paul was from.</b><br>Roman governance was organized into provinces, each with its own legal jurisdiction. By asking about Paul's province, Felix was determining the appropriate legal authority over Paul's case. This reflects the Roman legal system's complexity and the importance of jurisdiction. It also highlights the Roman concern for legal propriety and the rights of Roman citizens, which Paul was.<p><b>Learning that he was from Cilicia,</b><br>Cilicia was a Roman province in what is now modern-day Turkey. It was known for its strategic location and as a center of commerce and culture. Tarsus, Paul's birthplace, was a prominent city in Cilicia, known for its educational institutions. By identifying Paul as a Cilician, Felix recognized him as a Roman citizen, which afforded Paul certain legal protections and privileges.

If Paul hailed from a province outside Felix&#8217;s authority, the governor would transfer him (<a href="/acts/25-1.htm">Acts 25:1-12</a> shows Festus doing exactly that with Nero).<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s Roman citizenship (<a href="/acts/22-25.htm">Acts 22:25-29</a>) guaranteed him formal legal protections. By seeking Paul&#8217;s provincial origin, Felix is honoring those rights&#8212;further evidence that God is using Roman orderliness to advance Gospel purposes (<a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; This step also signals a pause in the hostility. Jewish opposition moved swiftly; Roman procedure forces everyone to slow down and follow established steps (compare <a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Learning that he was from Cilicia</b><p>When Felix discovers Paul is from Cilicia, he realizes the case does fall under his purview.<p>&#8226; Cilicia, together with Syria, formed a larger imperial province overseen ultimately by the legate of Syria; Felix, as procurator of Judea, served under that same chain of command. He therefore has authority to hear Paul&#8217;s case.<p>&#8226; Luke subtly shows the Lord steering events toward Rome. If Paul had belonged to an entirely separate province, a different governor might have seized control, delaying God&#8217;s timeline. Instead, Paul remains in Caesarea, where he will testify before Felix (<a href="/acts/24-1.htm">Acts 24:1-27</a>) and later before Festus and Agrippa (<a href="/bsb/acts/25.htm">Acts 25&#8211;26</a>), each hearing widening the audience for the Gospel (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s care is evident: Paul is neither rushed back into the volatile atmosphere of Jerusalem nor shuffled off to an unknown jurisdiction. Instead, he enjoys relative security in a coastal city, free to speak of Christ to rulers and soldiers alike (<a href="/acts/23-35.htm">Acts 23:35</a>; 24:23).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/23-34.htm">Acts 23:34</a> records a routine legal detail, yet it reveals the Lord&#8217;s sovereign hand guiding every step: Felix reads the commander&#8217;s letter, confirms jurisdiction by asking Paul&#8217;s province, and&#8212;upon learning it is Cilicia&#8212;keeps the apostle under his own protection. Roman orderliness becomes a shield for God&#8217;s servant, ensuring the Gospel continues its appointed journey toward Rome.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">He asked of what province he was.</span>--The question was a natural one for a procurator of Judaea to ask as to any prisoner brought before him. (Comp. Pilate's question in <a href="/luke/23-6.htm" title="When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.">Luke 23:6</a>.) It does not appear why Felix was ready to take cognisance of a matter which apparently, to judge by the precedent set by Pilate, belonged to the jurisdiction of another. Perhaps he had no motive for conciliating the favour of the governor of Cilicia, or thought that the nature of the accusation over-ruled the nationality of the accused.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> <span class="accented">- He</span> for <span class="accented">the governor</span>, A.V. and <span class="accented">T.R.</span>; <span class="accented">it</span> for <span class="accented">the fetter</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Province</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, only here and in <a href="/acts/25-1.htm">Acts 25:1</a>.
