In the context of <a href="/acts/22.htm">Acts 22</a>, Paul recounts his conversion experience on the road to Damascus. The urgency reflects the importance of responding to God's call without delay. This mirrors the urgency seen in other biblical calls to action, such as Jesus' call to His disciples (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19-20</a>).<p><b>Get up,</b><br>The command to "get up" signifies a transition from a passive state to an active one. It symbolizes a spiritual awakening and readiness to follow God's will. This is reminiscent of other biblical moments where individuals are called to rise and act, such as the healing of the paralytic (<a href="/mark/2-11.htm">Mark 2:11</a>).<p><b>be baptized,</b><br>Baptism is a significant act of obedience and public declaration of faith. In the early church, it was closely associated with conversion and the forgiveness of sins (<a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>). Baptism symbolizes the believer's identification with the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>).<p><b>and wash your sins away,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the cleansing power of baptism as an outward sign of inward grace. It reflects the Old Testament concept of purification (<a href="/psalms/51-2.htm">Psalm 51:2</a>) and the New Testament teaching of spiritual renewal (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>). The washing away of sins signifies the believer's new life in Christ.<p><b>calling on His name.&#8217;</b><br>Calling on the name of the Lord is an expression of faith and dependence on Jesus for salvation. It echoes the promise in <a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>, "Everyone who calls on the name of the LORD will be saved," and is reiterated in <a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>. This act of calling signifies a personal relationship with Jesus and acknowledgment of His lordship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul (formerly Saul)</a></b><br>The apostle who is recounting his conversion experience.
