His position indicates a man of significant authority and influence. The event he witnessed was the blinding of Elymas the sorcerer, a demonstration of divine power through Paul. This act served as a sign authenticating the message of the apostles, similar to the miracles performed by Jesus and the apostles in other parts of Acts. The proconsul's role as a Roman leader highlights the spread of the Gospel beyond Jewish communities to Gentile territories, fulfilling the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>he believed</b><br>Sergius Paulus's belief marks a significant moment in the early church, as it represents the acceptance of the Gospel by a Gentile of high status. This conversion is a testament to the power of the Gospel to transcend cultural and social barriers. It echoes the conversion of Cornelius in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>, another Gentile who embraced the faith, illustrating the inclusivity of the Christian message. The belief of such a prominent figure would have had a considerable impact on the spread of Christianity in the region.<p><b>for he was astonished at the teaching about the Lord</b><br>The teaching about the Lord refers to the message of Jesus Christ, His death, resurrection, and the salvation offered through Him. The astonishment of Sergius Paulus suggests that the Gospel message was compelling and transformative, challenging the prevailing religious and philosophical beliefs of the time. This teaching would have contrasted sharply with the pagan beliefs and practices common in Roman society. The astonishment also indicates the power of the Holy Spirit working through the apostles, as seen in other instances where the Gospel was preached with boldness and authority (<a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/proconsul_sergius_paulus.htm">Proconsul Sergius Paulus</a></b><br>A Roman official in Cyprus who is described as an intelligent man.
