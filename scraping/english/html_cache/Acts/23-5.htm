This term reflects his respect and connection to the Jewish leaders, despite the tension. Paul, a Pharisee by background, often used familial language to establish rapport and emphasize common ground (<a href="/acts/22.htm">Acts 22:1</a>).<p><b>&#8220;I was not aware that he was the high priest,</b><br>Paul's claim of ignorance regarding the high priest's identity has been interpreted in various ways. Some suggest it was due to poor eyesight, as inferred from <a href="/galatians/4-15.htm">Galatians 4:15</a>, while others propose the chaotic nature of the meeting or the irregular appointment of the high priest at the time. Historically, the high priesthood was a position of significant authority, but political turmoil often led to frequent changes in leadership, which might have contributed to Paul's unawareness.<p><b>for it is written:</b><br>Paul references the Old Testament, demonstrating his deep knowledge of Scripture and its authority. This phrase introduces a direct quotation from the Law, underscoring Paul's commitment to biblical principles even in legal and confrontational settings.<p><b>&#8216;Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This quote is from <a href="/exodus/22-28.htm">Exodus 22:28</a>, where the Israelites are commanded to respect their leaders. Paul acknowledges the scriptural mandate to honor authority, even when he disagrees with or is mistreated by them. This reflects a broader biblical theme of respecting God-ordained leadership, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-7</a> and <a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13-17</a>.

(2) That the words were a somewhat ironical protest against the authority of Ananias as having been improperly appointed. (3) That the "I wist not" stands for "I did not consider," and is an apologetic recantation of what had been uttered with a full knowledge that the words had been spoken by the high priest. Of these the first seems by far the most probable. The solemn sneer pointed by words from Scripture suggested by (2) is at variance with St. Paul's character; and (3) puts upon the words a greater strain than they will bear. It is obvious that St. Paul might well think that greater reverence was due to the high priest than to one filling an inferior position in the councils.<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.</span>--The passage (<a href="/exodus/22-28.htm" title="You shall not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of your people.">Exodus 22:28</a>) is interesting as one of those in which the Hebrew word <span class= "ital">Elohim, </span>commonly translated "God," is used of earthly rulers. St. Paul probably quoted it in Hebrew (see <a href="/acts/22-2.htm" title="(And when they heard that he spoke in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he said,)">Acts 22:2</a>), while St. Luke reproduces it from the LXX. version. It need hardly be said that to act on that law towards the rulers, not, of "the people" only, but of the heathen; to see below all the corruptions of human society and the vices of princes, the scheme of a divine order; to recognise that "the powers that be are ordained of God," was throughout the ruling principle of the Apostle's conduct, and, for the most part, of that of the early Christians (<a href="/context/romans/13-1.htm" title="Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.">Romans 13:1-6</a>; <a href="/context/1_peter/2-13.htm" title="Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;">1Peter 2:13-17</a>). Christianity was a great revolution, but they were not, politically or socially, revolutionists. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- And Paul said</span> for <span class="accented">then said Paul</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">high</span> for <span class="accented">the high</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a ruler</span> for <span class="accented">the ruler</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">I wist not</span>, etc. These words express, as distinctly as words can express anything, that St. Paul was not aware, when he called Ananias a "whited wall," that he was addressing the high priest. Different reasons for this ignorance have been given. Some think that it arose from the uncertainty that existed whether Ananias really was high priest or not at this time, or whether the office was not in abeyance. Others attribute to Paul's weakness of sight the fact that he did not see that Ananias was sitting in the presidential chair, neither was able to recognize his features. Others, giving to <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;</span> sense which it never bus, render, "I did not reflect," or "bear in mind, that he was high priest." What is certain is that for some reason or other Paul did not know that he was speaking to the high priest.
