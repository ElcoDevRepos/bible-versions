The context is Paul's nephew informing the commander of a plot against Paul. The use of "persuade" suggests that the conspirators might attempt to manipulate or convince the authorities to act against Paul. This reflects the tension between the Jewish leaders and Paul, who was seen as a threat to their religious authority. The commander's role is crucial as he must discern the truth and act justly, reminiscent of Pilate's role in Jesus' trial.<p><b>because more than forty men are waiting to ambush him</b><br>The mention of "more than forty men" indicates a significant and organized conspiracy. This number suggests a serious threat, as such a group would be formidable. The term "ambush" implies a premeditated and violent plan, reflecting the intense opposition Paul faced. This mirrors the hostility Jesus encountered from religious leaders. The plotters' determination underscores the lengths to which Paul's opponents would go to stop his ministry, highlighting the spiritual warfare against the spread of the Gospel.<p><b>They have bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him</b><br>The oath signifies the plotters' extreme commitment, reflecting the seriousness of their intent. In Jewish culture, oaths were sacred and binding, often invoking God's name. This highlights the religious zeal and desperation of Paul's adversaries. The vow to fast until Paul's death shows their willingness to sacrifice personal well-being for their cause. This echoes the Pharisees' and Sadducees' determination to eliminate Jesus, viewing Him as a threat to their authority and traditions.<p><b>they are ready now, awaiting your consent</b><br>The immediacy of "they are ready now" emphasizes the urgency of the situation. The conspirators' readiness indicates their impatience and determination to act swiftly. "Awaiting your consent" shows their need for the commander's cooperation, highlighting the political and legal complexities of the situation. This reflects the delicate balance of power between Roman authorities and Jewish leaders. The commander's decision would have significant implications, much like Pilate's decision regarding Jesus' fate.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who is the target of the assassination plot.

The word occurs above fifty times in the New Testament, and is always rendered "promise" in the A.V., except in <a href="/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>, where it is rendered both in the A.V. and the R.V. "message," which is the literal meaning of the word. In Polybius it means "a summons." Either of these meanings suits this passage better than "promise." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/23-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{Do} not {let}</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3361.htm">Strong's 3361: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, lest.
