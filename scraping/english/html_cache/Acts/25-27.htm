In the Roman judicial system, it was considered unjust to punish or send someone for trial without clear charges. This principle aligns with biblical teachings on justice, such as in <a href="/proverbs/21-15.htm">Proverbs 21:15</a>, which states that justice brings joy to the righteous. The speaker, Festus, is expressing a concern for legal propriety, which was a valued aspect of Roman governance.<p><b>to send on a prisoner</b><br>The context here involves the Apostle Paul, who is being held as a prisoner. Paul&#8217;s imprisonment is a significant theme in Acts, highlighting the early church's struggles and the spread of the Gospel despite opposition. The term "prisoner" also connects to Paul's own writings, where he often refers to himself as a "prisoner of Christ" (<a href="/ephesians/3.htm">Ephesians 3:1</a>), indicating his commitment to the Gospel above his personal freedom.<p><b>without specifying the charges against him.</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of transparency and accountability in legal proceedings. In Roman law, it was crucial to have specific accusations before a trial could proceed. This reflects the biblical principle of truthfulness and clarity, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, which requires clear evidence for accusations. The lack of specific charges against Paul highlights the baseless nature of the accusations from the Jewish leaders, emphasizing the theme of unjust persecution faced by early Christians. This situation also foreshadows the trials of Jesus, who was similarly accused without legitimate charges, drawing a parallel between the experiences of Christ and His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is imprisoned and awaiting trial.

He cannot tolerate a legal process that lacks clarity (compare <a href="/acts/23-29.htm">Acts 23:29</a>, where Lysias said he found &#8220;no charge deserving death or imprisonment&#8221;).<p>- <a href="/romans/13-3.htm">Romans 13:3-4</a> reminds us that governing authorities are meant to reward good and punish evil; to do so, they need clear evidence and charges.<p>- <a href="/john/7-51.htm">John 7:51</a> shows Nicodemus objecting to judging a man without first hearing him, echoing this same principle of fairness.<p>- The verse underscores God&#8217;s character: He, too, never acts arbitrarily (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to send on a prisoner</b><p>- Paul is about to be sent from Caesarea to Rome, fulfilling the Lord&#8217;s promise in <a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a> that Paul would &#8220;testify in Rome.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/acts/25-12.htm">Acts 25:12</a> records Festus&#8217;s agreement to Paul&#8217;s appeal&#8212;&#8220;You have appealed to Caesar.

Festus refuses to rubber-stamp vague accusations, a stance that mirrors <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>&#8217;s requirement for clear testimony.<p>- <a href="/luke/23-14.htm">Luke 23:14-15</a> records Pilate saying he found no fault in Jesus; now Festus finds no fault in Paul. Both scenes highlight the innocence of God&#8217;s servants and the blindness of their accusers.<p>- This phrase also points to God&#8217;s larger vindication plan: when accusations are empty, His people are ultimately exonerated (<a href="/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/25-27.htm">Acts 25:27</a> captures a pagan governor insisting on legal integrity, unknowingly furthering God&#8217;s design to bring Paul to Rome.
