The city clerk was a significant official, responsible for maintaining order and records. His speech was a response to the uproar caused by the silversmiths, who were upset over the impact of Paul's ministry on their trade related to the temple of Artemis. The clerk's words were intended to calm the crowd and prevent further disorder, which could attract Roman intervention. This reflects the Roman emphasis on maintaining public order and the potential consequences of civil unrest.<p><b>he dismissed the assembly</b><br>The assembly here refers to the gathering of people in Ephesus, which had become chaotic due to the silversmiths' agitation. The Greek word for assembly is "ekklesia," which is also used in the New Testament to refer to the church, though in this context, it denotes a civic gathering. The dismissal by the city clerk highlights the importance of lawful conduct and the avoidance of mob rule. This incident underscores the tension between the early Christian movement and established religious and economic systems. It also illustrates the protective role of Roman law, which, at times, inadvertently shielded early Christians from persecution.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_town_clerk.htm">The Town Clerk</a></b><br>A key figure in the city of Ephesus, responsible for maintaining order and managing civic affairs.
