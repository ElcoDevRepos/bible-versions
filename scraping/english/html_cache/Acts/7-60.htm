Kneeling is a physical expression of reverence and earnestness, seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a> and <a href="/ephesians/3-14.htm">Ephesians 3:14</a>. It signifies Stephen's complete surrender to God's will, even in the face of death.<p><b>he cried out in a loud voice</b><br>The loud voice signifies urgency and the intensity of Stephen's prayer.

It also ensures that those around him, including his persecutors, hear his final words, emphasizing the public nature of his testimony.<p><b>&#8220;Lord, do not hold this sin against them.&#8221;</b><br>Stephen's plea for forgiveness for his executioners echoes Jesus' words on the cross in <a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>, demonstrating a spirit of forgiveness and love for enemies, a core Christian teaching. This reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' command to love one's enemies (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>) and shows Stephen's deep spiritual maturity and alignment with Christ's teachings.<p><b>And when he had said this, he fell asleep.</b><br>The term "fell asleep" is a euphemism for death, used in the New Testament to describe the death of believers (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13-14</a>, <a href="/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11-14</a>).

The resemblance to the prayer of Christ, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" (<a href="/luke/23-34.htm" title="Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.">Luke 23:34</a>), could hardly have been accidental. We may well think of the prayer as having for its chief object him who was the foremost of the accusers. The old words of Augustine (<span class= "ital">Serm.</span> 314-318), that we owe the conversion of Saul to the prayers of Stephen, may be accepted as the expression of a great spiritual fact. This prayer, like that which preceded it, was addressed, it will be noted, to the Lord Jesus.<p><span class= "bld">He fell asleep.</span>--The thought and the phrase were not altogether new. (Comp. <a href="/john/11-11.htm" title="These things said he: and after that he said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.">John 11:11</a>, and Note.)
