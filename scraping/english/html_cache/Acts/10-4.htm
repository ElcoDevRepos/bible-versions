His fear upon seeing the angel reflects the common biblical reaction to angelic appearances, indicating the awe and reverence associated with divine encounters. This fear underscores the holiness and authority of the angelic messenger, aligning with similar reactions in <a href="/daniel/10-7.htm">Daniel 10:7</a> and <a href="/luke/1-12.htm">Luke 1:12</a>.<p><b>and asked, &#8220;What is it, Lord?&#8221;</b><br>Cornelius's address of the angel as "Lord" shows his recognition of the angel's authority and possibly divine origin. This term is often used in the New Testament to denote respect and acknowledgment of a higher power, as seen in <a href="/acts/9-5.htm">Acts 9:5</a> when Saul addresses Jesus. Cornelius's question indicates his readiness to receive divine instruction, reflecting his openness to God's will.<p><b>The angel answered, &#8220;Your prayers and gifts to the poor</b><br>The angel acknowledges Cornelius's prayers and almsgiving, highlighting the importance of both personal piety and social justice in the eyes of God. This reflects the Jewish understanding of righteousness, which includes acts of charity, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>. Cornelius's actions demonstrate his sincere faith and align with the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/6.htm">Matthew 6:1-4</a> about giving to the needy.<p><b>have ascended as a memorial offering before God.</b><br>The imagery of prayers and alms ascending as a memorial offering draws from Old Testament sacrificial language, where offerings were made to God as a pleasing aroma (<a href="/leviticus/2-2.htm">Leviticus 2:2</a>). This suggests that Cornelius's deeds are not only noticed by God but are also pleasing to Him, akin to the sacrifices of the faithful in the Old Testament. This concept is echoed in <a href="/revelation/8-4.htm">Revelation 8:4</a>, where the prayers of the saints rise before God. Cornelius's actions serve as a precursor to the inclusion of Gentiles in the early Church, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a> about God's house being a house of prayer for all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cornelius.htm">Cornelius</a></b><br>A centurion in the Roman army, stationed in Caesarea.

The scene teaches that God attentively watches devout seekers, values compassionate action, and moves heaven and earth to bring the message of Christ to any heart prepared to receive Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Are come up for a memorial before God.</span>--The word so used was emphatically sacrificial and liturgical, as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in <a href="/leviticus/2-2.htm" title="And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take out of there his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it on the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD:">Leviticus 2:2</a>; <a href="/leviticus/2-9.htm" title="And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn it on the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.">Leviticus 2:9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/2-16.htm" title="And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire to the LORD.">Leviticus 2:16</a>; <a href="/leviticus/5-12.htm" title="Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire to the LORD: it is a sin offering.">Leviticus 5:12</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-15.htm" title="And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is on the meat offering, and shall burn it on the altar for a sweet smell, even the memorial of it, to the LORD.">Leviticus 6:15</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/45-16.htm" title="He chose him out of all men living to offer sacrifices to the Lord, incense, and a sweet savour, for a memorial, to make reconciliation for his people.">Ecclesiasticus 45:16</a>; and elsewhere. The words implied, therefore, that the "prayers and alms" were accepted as a true sacrifice, more acceptable than the blood of bulls and goats. If we ask, in the technical language of a later theology, how they could be accepted when they were offered prior to a clear faith in Christ, and therefore before justification, the answer is that the good works were wrought by the power of God's grace already working in him. He was believing in the Light that lighteth every man, though as yet he did not identify that Light with its manifestation in Jesus as the Christ (<a href="/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a>). He had the faith which from the beginning of the world has justified--the belief that God is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm" title="But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that comes to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.">Hebrews 11:6</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- He, fastening his eyes upon</span> for <span class="accented">when he looked on</span>, A.V.
