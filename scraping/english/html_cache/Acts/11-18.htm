The context is Peter's explanation of his vision and the subsequent conversion of Cornelius, a Gentile. This moment marks a significant turning point in the early church, as it begins to understand the inclusivity of the Gospel message.<p><b>they had no further objections</b><br>The Jewish believers' initial resistance was rooted in their cultural and religious traditions, which emphasized separation from Gentiles. However, upon hearing Peter's account, they recognized the work of the Holy Spirit and ceased their opposition. This reflects the transformative power of God's revelation and the unity it brings among believers.<p><b>and they glorified God</b><br>The response of glorifying God indicates their acceptance and joy in God's plan. It shows a shift from skepticism to worship, acknowledging God's sovereignty and grace. This act of glorification is a common response in Scripture when God's will is revealed and understood, as seen in <a href="/luke/2-20.htm">Luke 2:20</a> and <a href="/acts/13-48.htm">Acts 13:48</a>.<p><b>saying, &#8220;So then, God has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life.&#8221;</b><br>This statement highlights the theological breakthrough that salvation through Jesus Christ is available to all, not just the Jews. The phrase "repentance unto life" underscores the transformative nature of repentance, leading to eternal life.

The fact was obviously one of immense importance in its bearing on the question at issue between St. Paul and the Judaisers, of which St. Luke had seen so much and which he sought, by his narrative, to settle. Not only had the first step in the free admission of the Gentiles been taken by the chief of the Apostles, and under direct guidance from above, but it had received the formal approval of the Apostles and other members of the Church of the Circumcision at Jerusalem. The Judaisers, in opposing St. Paul, were acting against the Church from which they pretended to derive their authority.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - And <span class="accented">when</span> for <span class="accented">when</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">then to the Gentiles also hath God granted</span> for <span class="accented">then hath God also to the Gentiles granted</span>, A.V. The fitness of the method adopted by the Divine wisdom for effecting this first reception of Gentiles into the Church upon an equal footing with the Jews is apparent from its success in quieting the jealous prejudices of the Jews, and preserving the peace of the Church.
