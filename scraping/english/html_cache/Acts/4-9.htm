The apostles Peter and John are being questioned after healing a lame man, an event that drew significant public attention. The setting is Jerusalem, a city central to Jewish religious life and the early Christian movement. The examination reflects the tension between the early church and Jewish authorities, who were concerned about the growing influence of Jesus' followers.<p><b>about a kind service</b><br>The "kind service" refers to the miraculous healing of a man who had been lame from birth. This act of compassion aligns with Jesus' ministry, which often included healing and acts of mercy. The apostles' actions demonstrate the continuation of Jesus' work through the Holy Spirit. The term "kind service" underscores the benevolent nature of the miracle, emphasizing the apostles' intent to help rather than to incite controversy.<p><b>to a man who was lame</b><br>The man in question was well-known in Jerusalem, as he regularly begged at the temple gate called Beautiful. His healing was a public event, witnessed by many, which added credibility to the apostles' message. The healing of a lame man fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>, which speaks of the lame leaping like a deer, symbolizing the coming of God's kingdom.<p><b>to determine how he was healed</b><br>The focus of the examination is on the method and power behind the healing. The Jewish leaders are concerned about the source of the apostles' authority, as they had not sanctioned this miracle. This question sets the stage for Peter's bold proclamation of Jesus Christ as the source of healing, emphasizing the power of Jesus' name and the apostles' role as His witnesses. The inquiry reflects a broader theme in Acts: the validation of the apostles' message through signs and wonders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter_and_john.htm">Peter and John</a></b><br>Apostles of Jesus Christ who were speaking to the people and were arrested by the priests, the captain of the temple guard, and the Sadducees for proclaiming the resurrection of Jesus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanhedrin.htm">The Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The Jewish ruling council that included the high priests, elders, and scribes.
