Paul had arrived in Ephesus, a major city in Asia Minor known for its temple to Artemis, a center of pagan worship. The request for Paul to stay indicates the interest and openness of the Ephesian Jews to his teachings. This is significant as it contrasts with the resistance he often faced in other cities. The request also highlights the early church's desire for apostolic teaching and guidance, reflecting the hunger for spiritual truth and leadership in the nascent Christian communities.<p><b>he declined</b><br>Paul's decision to decline the invitation to stay longer in Ephesus may seem surprising given the positive reception. However, it reflects his commitment to his mission and the leading of the Holy Spirit. Paul was likely aware of the need to return to Jerusalem for a feast, as suggested by <a href="/acts/18-21.htm">Acts 18:21</a>, showing his dedication to maintaining connections with the Jewish roots of Christianity. This decision also underscores the importance of following divine guidance over human requests, a theme seen throughout Paul's ministry. His eventual return to Ephesus, where he would spend significant time, indicates that his initial departure was part of a larger divine plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is central to this passage.
