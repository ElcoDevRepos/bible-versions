In biblical times, daylight was often associated with action and the beginning of daily activities. The use of "daylight" here contrasts with the darkness of the plot being formed, highlighting the moral and spiritual darkness of the conspirators' intentions.<p><b>the Jews formed a conspiracy</b><br>The term "the Jews" in this context refers to a specific group of Jewish leaders and individuals who were opposed to Paul's teachings and missionary work. This conspiracy reflects the intense opposition Paul faced from certain Jewish factions who saw his message as a threat to their religious traditions and authority. Historically, conspiracies and plots were not uncommon in the political and religious landscape of the time, as various groups sought to protect their interests.<p><b>and bound themselves with an oath</b><br>Taking an oath was a serious and binding commitment in Jewish culture, often invoking God's name as a witness to the promise. This indicates the depth of their resolve and the seriousness with which they approached their plan to kill Paul. Oaths were considered sacred and breaking them was seen as a grave sin, underscoring the conspirators' determination.<p><b>not to eat or drink</b><br>Fasting was a common practice in Jewish tradition, often associated with prayer, repentance, or seeking divine intervention. In this case, the fast was a sign of their commitment to the plot, showing that they were willing to endure personal hardship to achieve their goal. This self-imposed fast highlights the extremity of their hatred and the lengths they were willing to go to eliminate Paul.<p><b>until they had killed Paul</b><br>Paul, formerly known as Saul, was a prominent figure in the early Christian church and a former persecutor of Christians. His conversion and subsequent missionary work made him a target for those who opposed the spread of Christianity. The plot to kill Paul reflects the broader conflict between the early Christian movement and traditional Jewish authorities. This phrase also echoes the numerous attempts on Paul's life throughout his ministry, as seen in other parts of Acts and his epistles, illustrating the constant danger he faced for the sake of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>A group of Jewish individuals who were opposed to Paul's teachings and mission.

So, they may have argued, Mattathias, the founder of the Maccabean dynasty, had slain the apostate Jew who offered sacrifice at the altar at Modin (<a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/2-24.htm" title="Which thing when Mattathias saw, he was inflamed with zeal, and his reins trembled, neither could he forbear to shew his anger according to judgment: wherefore he ran, and slew him upon the altar.">1 Maccabees 2:24</a>); so ten Zealots of Jerusalem had conspired to assassinate Herod the Great because he had built an amphi-theatre and held gladiatorial games in the Holy City (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xii.</span> 6, ? 2; xv. 8, ? 3). It is melancholy but instructive to remember how often the casuistry of Christian theologians has run in the same groove. In this respect the Jesuit teaching, absolving subjects from their allegiance to heretic rulers, and the practical issue of that teaching in the history of the Gunpowder Plot, and of the murders perpetrated by Clement and Ravaillac, present only too painful a parallel. Those who now thus acted were probably of the number of the Zealots, or Sicarii.<p><span class= "bld">Under a curse.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">they placed themselves under an anathema.</span> This was the Jewish <span class= "ital">kherem, </span>and the person or thing on which it fell was regarded as devoted to the wrath of God.

This word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> is found in the New Testament only here and <a href="/acts/19-40.htm">Acts 19:40</a>, where it is rendered "concourse." The sense of "a conspiracy," which it has here, is common in the LXX. (see <a href="/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10</a>; <a href="/2_kings/15-15.htm">2 Kings 15:15</a>, etc.). The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in the LXX. has the sense of "to conspire" (<a href="/2_samuel/15-31.htm">2 Samuel 15:31</a>; <a href="/2_kings/10-9.htm">2 Kings 10:9</a>; <a href="/2_kings/15-30.htm">2 Kings 15:30</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Bound themselves under a curse</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>). The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (<span class="accented">Romans</span> 9:3; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-22.htm">1 Corinthians 16:22</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8, 9</a>) corresponds to the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;</span>, the devotion of anything to destruction; and hence "the thing itself so devoted." And the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> corresponds to the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;</span>, to devote to destruction, without the possibility of redemption. Here they made themselves an <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> if they did not kill Paul before partaking of any food. It seems, however, that there was a way of escape if they failed to keep the vow. Lightfoot, on this passage, quotes from the Talmud: "He that hath made a vow not to eat anything, woe to him if he eat, and woe to him if he do not eat. If he eat he sinneth against his vow; if he do not eat he sinneth against his life. What must such a man do in this case? Let him go to the wise men, and they will loose his vow" ('Hebrews and Talmud. Exercit. upon the Acts'). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/23-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When daylight came,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#915;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Genomen&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1096.htm">Strong's 1096: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolongation and middle voice form of a primary verb; to cause to be, i.e. to become, used with great latitude.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
