Although deposed by the Romans, he retained considerable influence, often referred to as "high priest" due to his continued authority and respect. His involvement in Jesus' trial (<a href="/john/18-13.htm">John 18:13</a>) highlights his ongoing power. The high priest's role was central in Jewish worship, overseeing temple activities and sacrifices, and serving as a mediator between God and the people.<p><b>Caiaphas</b><br>Caiaphas, the son-in-law of Annas, was the acting high priest during the time of Jesus' crucifixion and the early church. He held the position from AD 18 to 36, appointed by the Roman prefect Valerius Gratus. Caiaphas played a crucial role in the plot to arrest and execute Jesus (<a href="/john/11-49.htm">John 11:49-53</a>), demonstrating the political and religious tensions of the time. His presence in <a href="/acts/4-6.htm">Acts 4:6</a> underscores the continuity of opposition faced by the early Christians from the same authorities who condemned Jesus.<p><b>John</b><br>The identity of "John" in this context is not explicitly clear, as the name was common. Some scholars suggest he could be a member of the high priestly family or a prominent figure in the Sanhedrin. His inclusion indicates the presence of influential leaders in the Jewish council, emphasizing the gravity of the situation faced by Peter and John.<p><b>Alexander</b><br>Like John, Alexander's specific identity is uncertain. He may have been a member of the high priestly family or a notable figure within the Jewish leadership. His mention alongside other prominent leaders suggests a gathering of significant authority figures, highlighting the serious nature of the inquiry into the apostles' activities.<p><b>and many others from the high priest&#8217;s family</b><br>The reference to "many others from the high priest&#8217;s family" indicates the dynastic nature of the high priesthood during this period. The high priestly office often remained within a few influential families, consolidating religious and political power. This assembly of leaders reflects the entrenched opposition to the early Christian movement, as the apostles' teachings challenged the established religious order.

Yet Peter, filled with the Spirit (<a href="/acts/4-8.htm">Acts 4:8</a>), will testify boldly before him, fulfilling <a href="/luke/21-12.htm">Luke 21:12-15</a>, where Jesus promised words and wisdom no adversary could refute.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>John</b><p>&#8226;

The order of the first two names is the same as in <a href="/luke/3-2.htm" title="Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.">Luke 3:2</a>, and as that implied in <a href="/john/18-13.htm" title="And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.">John 18:13</a>; <a href="/john/18-24.htm" title="Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.">John 18:24</a>. Annas, or Ananus, had been made high priest by Quirinus, the Governor of Syria, filled the office A.D. 7-15, and lived to see five of his sons occupy it after him. At this time, Joseph Caiaphas was the actual high priest (see Note on <a href="/john/11-49.htm" title="And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said to them, You know nothing at all,">John 11:49</a>), having been appointed in A.D. 17. He was deposed A.D. 37. He had married the daughter of Annas; and the latter seems to have exercised a dominant influence, perhaps, as the <span class= "ital">Nasi, </span>the Prince, or President, of the Sanhedrin, during the remainder of his life. If he presided on this occasion, it may explain St. Luke's calling him "the high priest."<p><span class= "bld">John.</span>--This may have been the Johanan ben Zaccai, who is reported by Jewish writers to have been at the height of his fame forty years before the destruction of the Temple, and to have been President of the Great Synagogue after its removal to Jamnia. The identification is, at the best, uncertain; but the story told of his death-bed, in itself full of pathos, becomes, on this assumption, singularly interesting. His disciples asked him why he wept: "O light or Israel, . . . . whence these tears?" And he replied: "If I were going to appear before a king of flesh and blood, he is one who to-day is and to-morrow is in the grave; if he were wroth with me, his wrath is not eternal; if he were to cast me into chains, those chains are not for ever; if he slay me, that death is not eternal; I might soothe him with words or appease him with a gift. But they are about to bring me before the King of kings, the Lord, the Holy and Blessed One, who liveth and abideth for ever. And if He is wroth with me, His wrath is eternal; and if He bind, His bonds are eternal; if He slay, it is eternal death; and Him I cannot soothe with words or appease with gifts. And besides all this, there are before me two paths, one to Paradise and the other to Gehenna, and I know not in which they are about to lead me. How can I do aught else but weep?"

(See Notes on <a href="/matthew/2-4.htm" title="And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.">Matthew 2:4</a>; <a href="/luke/1-5.htm" title="THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.">Luke 1:5</a>.)

It is possible, however, that Annas may have continued to be president of the Sanhedrim, and be called high priest, even when not actually so. He seems to have lived to old age. He is mentioned by Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 20, 60:1) as having had the singular felicity not only of enjoying the high priesthood himself for a great length of time, but of having five sons promoted to the dignity of high priest, viz.
