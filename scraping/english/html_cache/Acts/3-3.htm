Peter and John, two of Jesus' closest disciples, are central figures in the early church. Their presence at the temple highlights the continuity between Jewish worship and the emerging Christian faith. The temple was a place of prayer and teaching, and the apostles often used it as a platform for spreading the gospel. This moment occurs shortly after Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit empowered the apostles, marking the beginning of their public ministry.<p><b>he asked them for money</b><br>The man, described earlier in the chapter as lame from birth, represents the marginalized and needy in society. Begging at the temple gate was common, as almsgiving was a significant aspect of Jewish piety, rooted in the Torah's commands to care for the poor (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>). This act of asking for money reflects the man's immediate physical need, but it also sets the stage for a deeper spiritual encounter. The request for alms is a catalyst for the miracle that follows, illustrating the transformative power of faith and the apostles' role in continuing Jesus' ministry of healing and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, known for his leadership in the early church and his boldness in preaching the gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/john.htm">John</a></b><br>Another of Jesus' apostles, often associated with love and deep spiritual insight, and a close companion of Peter in ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lame_beggar.htm">The Lame Beggar</a></b><br>A man who was lame from birth, sitting at the temple gate called Beautiful, seeking alms from those entering the temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_gate_called_beautiful.htm">The Temple Gate Called Beautiful</a></b><br>A significant location in Jerusalem where many gathered for prayer and worship, and where the beggar positioned himself to ask for alms.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_asking_for_alms.htm">The Event of Asking for Alms</a></b><br>The beggar's request for money from Peter and John, which sets the stage for the miraculous healing that follows.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_expectation.htm">The Power of Expectation</a></b><br>The beggar expected to receive something from Peter and John.

Sitting daily at the Beautiful Gate (<a href="/acts/3-2.htm">Acts 3:2</a>), he has become accustomed to scanning the crowd for generosity.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly shows the importance of spiritual sight: &#8220;Open my eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of Your law&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/119-18.htm">Psalm 119:18</a>). Here, however, the man&#8217;s sight is fixed on human help, not yet on the Lord who can truly rescue.<p>&#8226; Like the crowd who &#8220;saw the signs&#8221; yet missed Jesus&#8217; deeper message (<a href="/john/6-26.htm">John 6:26</a>), this man&#8217;s seeing is limited; still, it is the starting point God will use.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Peter and John</b><p>&#8226; These two apostles often appear together (<a href="/luke/22-8.htm">Luke 22:8</a>; <a href="/john/20-2.htm">John 20:2</a>), representing unity in Christ&#8217;s body. Their partnership echoes Jesus&#8217; sending disciples &#8220;two by two&#8221; (<a href="/mark/6-7.htm">Mark 6:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter, known for bold speech (<a href="/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14</a>), and John, marked by love (<a href="/john/13-23.htm">John 13:23</a>), illustrate complementary gifts serving one purpose.<p>&#8226; Their arrival fulfills Jesus&#8217; promise: &#8220;You will be My witnesses in Jerusalem&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). The man&#8217;s need becomes the stage for apostolic witness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>About to enter</b><p>&#8226; The timing matters. At the threshold of the temple, a place of worship, God highlights a man excluded by disability (<a href="/leviticus/21-18.htm">Leviticus 21:18</a>) yet now on the brink of inclusion.<p>&#8226; Entry language recalls Jesus&#8217; own words: &#8220;I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>). The apostles stand as His representatives, ready to usher someone from begging to blessing.<p>&#8226; This moment underscores divine appointments&#8212;ordinary routines turned holy encounters (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He asked</b><p>&#8226; Requesting alms was the man&#8217;s daily survival strategy. <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a> commends generosity to the poor, so temple-goers would expect such appeals.<p>&#8226; Yet God often answers needs in ways exceeding our requests (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>). The man seeks coins; the Lord plans complete healing.<p>&#8226; His verbal ask opens the door for gospel proclamation. &#8220;How can they believe in the One of whom they have not heard?&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-14.htm">Romans 10:14</a>). A simple cry for help invites the message of Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For money</b><p>&#8226; Physical provision is legitimate; Jesus taught compassion toward the needy (<a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Still, silver and gold are limited (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>). <a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6</a> will contrast earthly wealth with the priceless name of Jesus.<p>&#8226; This request highlights humanity&#8217;s tendency to focus on immediate material lack rather than ultimate spiritual need (<a href="/isaiah/55-2.htm">Isaiah 55:2</a>). God responds by meeting both.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/3-3.htm">Acts 3:3</a> captures a routine plea intersected by divine power. A lame man&#8217;s sight, two unified apostles, a temple doorway, a voiced request, and a desire for money form the setup for God&#8217;s greater gift&#8212;healing and salvation in Jesus&#8217; name.
