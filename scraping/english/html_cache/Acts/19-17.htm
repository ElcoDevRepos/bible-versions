Ephesus was a major city in the Roman province of Asia, known for its temple to Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The city's population was diverse, including both Jews and Greeks, reflecting the widespread influence of Hellenistic culture. The incident's notoriety underscores the impact of the early Christian movement in a city steeped in pagan worship and magic practices, highlighting the spiritual confrontation between the gospel and local beliefs.<p><b>and fear came over all of them</b><br>The fear mentioned here is a reverential awe rather than mere terror. This reaction is consistent with other biblical accounts where God's power is displayed, leading to a recognition of His authority (e.g., <a href="/acts/5-11.htm">Acts 5:11</a>, after the deaths of Ananias and Sapphira). The fear of the Lord is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with wisdom and the beginning of knowledge (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). In this context, it signifies a profound respect for the power inherent in the name of Jesus, contrasting with the impotence of the sons of Sceva's attempt.<p><b>So the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor</b><br>The name of Jesus being held in high honor indicates a shift in the spiritual atmosphere of Ephesus. In biblical times, a name was more than a label; it represented the essence and authority of a person. The honor given to Jesus' name reflects the recognition of His divine authority and power, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where every knee shall bow at the name of Jesus. This acknowledgment by both Jews and Greeks in Ephesus marks a significant moment in the spread of Christianity, as it demonstrates the supremacy of Christ over other spiritual forces and deities worshiped in the city.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in the Roman province of Asia, known for its temple to Artemis and a hub of early Christian activity.

Comp. <a href="/acts/5-11.htm">Acts 5:11-14</a>, where the same effects are ascribed to the death of Ananias and Sapphire and the signs and wonders which were wrought by the apostles at that time. This fear produced by the putting forth of God's power paralyzed for a time the enemies of the gospel, and enabled believers, as it were, to take possession of their new heritage, just as the miracles at the Red Sea and the destruction of Sihon and Og paralyzed the courage of the Canaanites and enabled the Israelites to take possession of their land (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>). With respect to the incident which caused this fear, it might at first seem inconsistent with our Lord's saying to the apostles (<a href="/luke/9-49.htm">Luke 9:49, 50</a>). But the cases were very different. He who cast out devils in the name of Jesus, in the Gospel, does not seem to have had any hostility to the faith, for our Lord speaks of him as one who "is not against us." But these sons of Sceva were among the unbelieving Jews who were "hardened and disobedient;" and if their exorcisms had been permitted to succeed, they would have had power to withstand Paul, as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, and the very purpose for which miraculous power was given to St. Paul would have been frustrated. There- fore they were discomfited, and the subtle design of Satan to destroy, while seeming to magnify, the Name of Jesus was signally defeated. Comp. the somewhat similar incident at Philippi (<a href="/acts/16-16.htm">Acts 16:16-18</a>). Justin Martyr, in his 'Diologue with Trypho,' quoted by Alford on <a href="/matthew/12-27.htm">Matthew 12:27</a>, speaks of the Jews as exorcising, sometimes in the name of kings (referring, doubtless, to Solomon), sometimes of just men, or of prophets, or of patriarchs. So these men took up the name of Jesus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/19-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(Touto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">became</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(egeneto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1096.htm">Strong's 1096: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolongation and middle voice form of a primary verb; to cause to be, i.e. to become, used with great latitude.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">known</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(gn&#333;ston)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1110.htm">Strong's 1110: </a> </span><span class="str2">Known, an acquaintance.
