Prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Daniel spoke of a Savior who would bring redemption. <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, for example, describes the suffering servant who would bear the sins of many. This prophetic testimony is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is the central figure of the prophetic writings. The prophets' consistent message underscores the divine plan of salvation that spans the entirety of Scripture.<p><b>that everyone who believes in Him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the inclusivity of the gospel message. Salvation is not limited to a specific ethnic group or social class but is available to all who have faith in Jesus Christ. This was a radical concept in the first-century Jewish context, where the covenant relationship with God was primarily associated with the Jewish people. The universality of belief is echoed in passages like <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, which states that "whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life."<p><b>receives forgiveness of sins</b><br>Forgiveness of sins is a central theme in Christian theology, signifying the removal of the barrier between humanity and God. In the Old Testament, forgiveness was often associated with sacrificial offerings, as seen in Leviticus. However, the New Testament reveals that Jesus' sacrifice on the cross is the ultimate atonement for sin. <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a> states, "without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness," highlighting the necessity of Christ's sacrifice for the remission of sins.<p><b>through His name.</b><br>The name of Jesus holds significant power and authority in Christian belief. In biblical times, a name represented a person's character and essence. <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a> speaks of God exalting Jesus and giving Him "the name that is above every name." The invocation of Jesus' name in prayer and baptism signifies the believer's identification with His death and resurrection. <a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a> reinforces this by declaring, "there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle who is speaking in this passage.
