The Jerusalem Council, led by apostles and elders, decided to send a letter to Gentile believers to address this issue. This phrase indicates a decision to communicate clearly and authoritatively, emphasizing the importance of unity and guidance from church leadership.<p><b>to abstain from food polluted by idols</b><br>In the Greco-Roman world, idol worship was prevalent, and food offered to idols was a common practice. Abstaining from such food was crucial to avoid participating in idolatry, which was strictly forbidden in Jewish law (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). This directive aimed to prevent Gentile Christians from being associated with pagan rituals and to maintain a clear distinction from idolatrous practices.<p><b>from sexual immorality</b><br>Sexual immorality was rampant in the pagan cultures surrounding the early church. The Greek word used here, "porneia," encompasses various forms of illicit sexual behavior. This command aligns with the moral teachings found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/leviticus/18.htm">Leviticus 18</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18-20</a>, emphasizing the call to holiness and purity for believers.<p><b>from the meat of strangled animals</b><br>Jewish dietary laws, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/17-13.htm">Leviticus 17:13-14</a>, prohibited consuming blood, which included meat from strangled animals since the blood was not properly drained. This instruction was given to respect Jewish sensibilities and promote fellowship between Jewish and Gentile Christians, ensuring that Gentile believers did not offend their Jewish brethren.<p><b>and from blood</b><br>The prohibition against consuming blood dates back to <a href="/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>, where God commanded Noah not to eat flesh with its lifeblood still in it. This command was reiterated in the Mosaic Law and was significant for maintaining ritual purity. For the early church, this directive served to uphold a standard that would facilitate unity and respect between Jewish and Gentile believers, reflecting the continuity of God's moral law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The leader of the Jerusalem church who proposed the decision to write to the Gentile believers, advising them on certain practices.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem_council.htm">Jerusalem Council</a></b><br>A significant meeting of early church leaders in Jerusalem to discuss the requirements for Gentile converts.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentile_believers.htm">Gentile Believers</a></b><br>Non-Jewish converts to Christianity who were the recipients of the letter from the Jerusalem Council.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/antioch.htm">Antioch</a></b><br>The city where the letter was sent, a major center of early Christianity and a diverse church community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_barnabas.htm">Paul and Barnabas</a></b><br>Apostles who were present at the council and played a key role in advocating for the Gentile believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_sensitivity_and_unity.htm">Cultural Sensitivity and Unity</a></b><br>The decision of the Jerusalem Council highlights the importance of cultural sensitivity and unity within the church.

Guided by the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/15-28.htm">Acts 15:28</a>), he affirms salvation by grace alone (<a href="/acts/15-11.htm">Acts 15:11</a>) while recommending four practical prohibitions that would:<p>&#8226; guard new Gentile converts from falling back into pagan practices,<p>&#8226; foster unity with Jewish believers who still observed longstanding scriptural principles,<p>&#8226; uphold the enduring moral core of God&#8217;s Law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to abstain from food polluted by idols,</b><p>In pagan temples, meat was commonly dedicated to false gods. Eating such food could blur the line between the worship of Christ and idolatry. Paul later clarifies that an idol is &#8220;nothing at all&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>), yet he also warns that participating in idol feasts can become &#8220;sharing in demons&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>). For the sake of weaker consciences (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-7.htm">1 Corinthians 8:7-13</a>) and public testimony (<a href="/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14, 20</a>), believers were to refrain. The principle endures: anything that entangles us with idolatry&#8212;whether an actual ritual or a modern equivalent&#8212;must be avoided.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from sexual immorality,</b><p>Unlike the ceremonial law, God&#8217;s moral standards never change (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/18.htm">Leviticus 18</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>). Pagan religion often combined worship with ritual prostitution, so James underscores that followers of Jesus must live in holiness. Scripture repeatedly calls for sexual purity: &#8220;For this is the will of God&#8212;your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-7</a>). Our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, bought with a price; therefore, we glorify God in them (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the meat of strangled animals,</b><p>Strangulation leaves the blood in the flesh, violating the longstanding divine command not to consume blood (<a href="/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>). By stressing this point, James reinforces respect for God&#8217;s design that &#8220;the life of a creature is in the blood&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/17-13.htm">Leviticus 17:13-14</a>). Observing this guideline also made table fellowship possible between Jewish and Gentile Christians, promoting unity (<a href="/romans/14-15.htm">Romans 14:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and from blood.</b><p>From Noah onward, the Lord prohibited eating blood (<a href="/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>). Leviticus explains why: &#8220;For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement&#8221; (17:11). Blood prefigures Christ&#8217;s own sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>). Respecting this command acknowledged both the sacredness of life and the solemn cost of redemption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/15-20.htm">Acts 15:20</a> sets out four foundational prohibitions&#8212;not as a means of salvation, but as Spirit-led guidelines to help Gentile believers turn decisively from paganism, honor God&#8217;s enduring moral law, and maintain fellowship with Jewish Christians. The verse calls every generation to reject idolatry, pursue sexual purity, respect the sanctity of life symbolized in blood, and live in a way that builds unity within the body of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">But that we write unto them.</span>--The grounds on which the measure thus defined was proposed are not far to seek. (1) It was of the nature of a compromise. The Gentiles could not complain that the burden imposed on them was anything very grievous. The Pharisee section of the Church could not refuse admission to those who fulfilled these conditions, when they had admitted the proselytes of the gate on like conditions to their synagogues, and had so treated them as no longer unclean. (2) The rules on which stress was now laid found a place among the seven precepts traditionally ascribed to Noah, and based upon the commands recorded in <a href="/genesis/9-5.htm" title="And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.">Genesis 9:5</a>. These were held to be binding upon all mankind; while the Law, as such, was binding on Israel only. These, therefore, had been thought sufficient for the proselytes of the gate before, and were urged now as sufficient for the Gentile converts by the teacher who represented the most rigid type of Judaism. (See, once more, the history of Ananias and Izates in the Note on <a href="/acts/9-10.htm" title="And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.">Acts 9:10</a>.) Special reasons attached, as will be seen, to each precept.<p><span class= "bld">From pollutions of idols.</span>--The Greek of the first noun is found only in the LXX. and the New Testament; and perhaps its primary idea is that of "wallowing" in blood and mire, and so incurring pollution. As distinguished from the acts that follow, it indicates any participation, publicly or privately, in idolatrous rites. One who acted on the rule would have to refrain from entering a temple, and to dislodge busts or statues of the gods from his house and gardens. The presence of such things, when they presented themselves on entering a house, was a great stumbling-block to devout Jews, and the Gentile convert who, left to himself, might have been disposed to keep them, though no longer as objects of worship, but as works of art, was required to renounce them. The statues of Zeus and Artemis and Hermes were to be to him henceforth as abominations. In the decree itself, however, we find "things sacrificed to idols" instead of the more general term, and we may accordingly deal here with that question also. So interpreted, the rule brings before us a new phase of the life of the early Christian converts. Under the religion of Greece and Rome, sacrifices were so common that it might fairly be taken for granted that the flesh at any festive meal had been so offered. But a small portion of the flesh was burnt upon the altar, and the rest was cooked for the household meal, or sent to the market for sale. Such meat was, in the eyes of the strict Jews, polluted, and the history of Daniel and his companions (<a href="/daniel/1-8.htm" title="But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.">Daniel 1:8</a>) was regarded as a precedent to avoiding it. Partly on this ground, partly on that referred to in the next Note but one, the Jew never bought meat in the market, nor of other than a Jewish butcher. He travelled with his <span class= "ital">cophinus, </span>or basket, <span class= "ital">on</span> his back, and carried his provisions with him. So Juvenal (<span class= "ital">Sat. iii.</span> 14) speaks of--<p>"Judaeis, quorum cophinus f?numque supellex."<p>["Basket, and wisp of straw to serve as pillow,--<p>That's the Jew's luggage."]<p>Here, therefore, was a new stumbling-block, and the Gentile was required to avoid this also. It involved many sacrifices, and what would seem privations. The convert had to refuse invitations to birthday, and marriage, and funeral feasts; or, if present, to refuse to eat at them. A man with a sensitive conscience would refuse to partake of what was set before him in a private house or offered for sale in the market, unless he had satisfied himself that it had not so been offered. It was natural that this restriction, which did not rest directly on a moral ground, should give rise to some resistance, and the controversy connected with it assumed many different phases. At Corinth men claimed the right to eat what they chose, and St. Paul conceded the right in the abstract, but urged abstinence on the ground of charity (1 Corinthians 8-10.). At Pergamos and Thyatira, somewhat later in the apostolic age (<a href="/revelation/2-14.htm" title="But I have a few things against you, because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.">Revelation 2:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding I have a few things against you, because you suffer that woman Jezebel, which calls herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.">Revelation 2:20</a>), the lawfulness of eating things sacrificed to idols was openly maintained in contravention alike of the teaching of St. Paul and of the apostolic decree, and was joined with a like claim to be exempted from the law which forbade illicit sexual intercourse. At Corinth, it would seem from <a href="/1_corinthians/8-10.htm" title="For if any man see you which have knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;">1Corinthians 8:10</a>, the assertion of freedom had led men so far as not only to eat of the flesh that had been sacrificed, but actually to sit down to a feast in the idol's temple. (Comp. <a href="/romans/2-22.htm" title="You that say a man should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? you that abhor idols, do you commit sacrilege?">Romans 2:22</a>, as expressing the Jewish feeling.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> <span class="accented">- The pollutions</span> for <span class="accented">pollutions</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">what is strangled</span> for <span class="accented">things strangled</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The pollutions</span>.

Later St. Paul somewhat enlarged the liberty of Gentile converts in respect to meats offered to idols (see <a href="/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4-13</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-25.htm">1 Corinthians 10:25-28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">What is strangled</span>, etc. The things forbidden are all practices not looked upon as sins by Gentiles, but now enjoined upon them as portions of the Law of Moses which were to be binding upon them, at least for a time, with a view to their living in communion and fellowship with their Jewish brethren. The necessity for some of the prohibitions would cease when the condition of the Church as regards Jews and Gentiles was altered; others were of eternal obligation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/15-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Instead,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(alla)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
