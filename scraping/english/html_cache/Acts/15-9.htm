In the early church, there was significant debate over whether Gentile converts needed to adhere to Jewish laws, such as circumcision. This statement, made by Peter during the Jerusalem Council, emphasizes that God does not show favoritism (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>). Theologically, it underscores the unity of all believers in Christ, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where Paul states that there is neither Jew nor Greek in Christ. This reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of salvation reaching the ends of the earth.<p><b>for He cleansed their hearts by faith</b><br>The cleansing of hearts by faith signifies the internal transformation that occurs through belief in Jesus Christ, rather than adherence to the law. This echoes the promise of the New Covenant found in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, where God writes His law on the hearts of His people. The concept of cleansing is also tied to the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, where physical purification was required for worship. However, in the New Testament, this purification is spiritual and achieved through faith in Christ's atoning sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>). This cleansing is a type of the work of Jesus, who, as the ultimate High Priest, purifies believers, making them acceptable before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>- One of the apostles and a key leader in the early church, who speaks at the Jerusalem Council to affirm that God shows no partiality between Jews and Gentiles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem_council.htm">Jerusalem Council</a></b><br>- A significant meeting of early church leaders in Jerusalem to discuss whether Gentile converts must follow Jewish law, particularly circumcision.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentile_believers.htm">Gentile Believers</a></b><br>- Non-Jewish individuals who have come to faith in Jesus Christ, central to the discussion at the Jerusalem Council.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_believers.htm">Jewish Believers</a></b><br>- Jewish Christians who were grappling with the integration of Gentile believers into the faith community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_spirit.htm">Holy Spirit</a></b><br>- The third person of the Trinity, who plays a crucial role in affirming the inclusion of Gentiles by cleansing their hearts through faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_christ.htm">Unity in Christ</a></b><br>The passage emphasizes that God makes no distinction between Jew and Gentile, highlighting the unity of all believers in Christ.

It was not only in the "gifts" of the Spirit, the tongues and prophecy, that the Apostle saw the witness which God had borne to the acceptance of the Gentiles, but even more than this, in the new purity growing out of a new faith in God and a new hope. Underlying the words we trace the assertion of a higher ideal of purity than that on which the Pharisees were insisting. They looked on the Gentiles as impure because they did not observe the ceremonial law and the traditions of the elders as to purity. He had learnt to call no man common or unclean (<a href="/acts/10-28.htm" title="And he said to them, You know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come to one of another nation; but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.">Acts 10:28</a>) and to see that it was in the heart, and not in the flesh, that the work of purifying was to be accomplished.
