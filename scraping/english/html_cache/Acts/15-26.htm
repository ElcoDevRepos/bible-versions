The Acts of the Apostles records numerous instances where they encountered threats, such as in Lystra where Paul was stoned (<a href="/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a>) and in other cities where they faced opposition from both Jewish and Gentile communities. This willingness to risk their lives underscores the seriousness of their mission and the depth of their commitment to spreading the Gospel.<p><b>for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ</b><br>The "name" in biblical terms often represents the character and authority of a person. Here, it signifies the authority and mission of Jesus Christ, whom the apostles served. The use of "our Lord Jesus Christ" emphasizes the divine lordship and messianic role of Jesus, a central tenet of Christian faith. This phrase connects to the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in His name. The apostles' actions fulfill this command, demonstrating their allegiance to Christ's authority and their role in the early church's expansion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_barnabas.htm">Paul and Barnabas</a></b><br>These are the men referred to in <a href="/acts/15-26.htm">Acts 15:26</a>. They were prominent leaders in the early church who undertook missionary journeys to spread the Gospel, often facing significant danger and opposition.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem_council.htm">Jerusalem Council</a></b><br>This event is the context of <a href="/bsb/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>.

They are presented simply as &#8220;men,&#8221; the same word used of Peter and John in <a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a> when the Sanhedrin realized that &#8220;these men had been with Jesus.&#8221; God&#8217;s mission advances through people who are willing to be available&#8212;just as Isaiah said, &#8220;Here am I. Send me!&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who have risked</b><p>Risk implies deliberate choice, not accident. Paul&#8217;s history reads like a catalog of risks: stoned at Lystra (<a href="/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a>), beaten and imprisoned at Philippi (<a href="/acts/16-22.htm">Acts 16:22&#8211;24</a>), shipwrecked three times (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>). Barnabas likewise braved danger by sponsoring Saul the former persecutor (<a href="/acts/9-27.htm">Acts 9:27</a>). Their willingness illustrates Jesus&#8217; warning: &#8220;Whoever does not take up his cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-38.htm">Matthew 10:38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Their lives</b><p>The apostles placed their very existence on the line. Epaphroditus &#8220;nearly died for the work of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-30.htm">Philippians 2:30</a>). Stephen actually lost his life (<a href="/acts/7-59.htm">Acts 7:59&#8211;60</a>). The point is total commitment: &#8220;We live or die, we belong to the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/romans/14-8.htm">Romans 14:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the name</b><p>&#8220;Name&#8221; represents authority and reputation. Peter rejoiced that he was &#8220;counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the Name&#8221; (<a href="/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>). The disciples were baptized &#8220;in the name of Jesus Christ&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>). Everything they did, including risking life itself, was centered on honoring that Name.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Of our Lord</b><p>Calling Jesus &#8220;Lord&#8221; means absolute sovereignty. &#8220;If you confess with your mouth, &#8216;Jesus is Lord,&#8217; and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9</a>). Paul and Barnabas acknowledged no higher authority; therefore, obedience outweighed personal safety.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus Christ</b><p>The full title unites His humanity (Jesus) and His messiahship (Christ). Their sacrifices pointed to the One who first sacrificed Himself: &#8220;Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21</a>). Because He gave His life, His followers willingly mirror that pattern (<a href="/john/13-14.htm">John 13:14&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/15-26.htm">Acts 15:26</a> celebrates Paul and Barnabas as real people who deliberately accepted mortal danger so that the supreme Name of the sovereign Redeemer would be honored. Their example calls believers to hold nothing back, counting Christ&#8217;s mission and glory worth more than life itself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Men that have</span> <span class= "bld">hazarded their lives.</span>--It is clear from this that the narrative of the hairbreadth escapes at the Pisidian Antioch (<a href="/acts/13-50.htm" title="But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.">Acts 13:50</a>) and Lystra (<a href="/acts/14-19.htm" title="And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead.">Acts 14:19</a>) must have been laid before the Church.
