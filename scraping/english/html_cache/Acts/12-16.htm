This act of knocking can be seen as a metaphor for prayer and seeking God's intervention, as Jesus taught in <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>, "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you." Peter's continuous knocking also highlights the reality of his physical presence, countering any notion that his appearance was merely a vision or ghost, as some might have thought.<p><b>and when they opened the door and saw him</b><br>The opening of the door signifies the moment of revelation and recognition. The believers inside were gathered in prayer, likely interceding for Peter's safety, as indicated earlier in the chapter. This moment parallels the resurrection appearances of Jesus, where His followers initially struggled to recognize Him until He revealed Himself. The act of opening the door can also symbolize the opening of hearts to the miraculous works of God, as seen in <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>, where Jesus stands at the door and knocks, waiting to be invited in.<p><b>they were astounded</b><br>The astonishment of the believers underscores the unexpected nature of God's intervention. Despite their prayers, they were not fully prepared for such a miraculous answer, reflecting a common human tendency to doubt even while praying for divine help. This reaction is reminiscent of the disciples' amazement when Jesus calmed the storm in <a href="/mark/4-41.htm">Mark 4:41</a>, highlighting the theme of God's power surpassing human understanding. The astonishment also serves to authenticate the miracle, as the witnesses were genuinely surprised by Peter's presence, reinforcing the truth of his divine deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' original twelve apostles, Peter is a central figure in the early Christian church.
