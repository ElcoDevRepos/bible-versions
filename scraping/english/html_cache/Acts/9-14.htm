Saul's presence in Damascus is not a future event but a current reality. This reflects the rapid spread of the early Christian movement and the swift response by Jewish authorities to suppress it. Saul's journey from Jerusalem to Damascus, approximately 135 miles, underscores his determination to carry out his mission against the followers of Jesus.<p><b>with authority from the chief priests</b><br>The chief priests were influential leaders within the Jewish religious hierarchy, responsible for maintaining religious order and authority. Their granting of authority to Saul highlights the seriousness with which they viewed the threat of the nascent Christian movement. This authority likely included letters or documents that empowered Saul to act on their behalf, reflecting the centralized religious power structure of the time.<p><b>to arrest all who call on Your name</b><br>"Call on Your name" is a reference to the early Christians who invoked the name of Jesus in prayer and worship, signifying their allegiance to Him as Lord. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of calling on the name of the Lord for salvation, as seen in passages like <a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a> and <a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>.

Going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;arrest&#8221; underscores physical force, but it also hints at spiritual bondage. Saul intends chains for others, yet he himself is the one enslaved to sin (<a href="/romans/7-24.htm">Romans 7:24</a>).<p>&#8226; God will overturn this intent; the same hands meant for shackles will soon be lifted in prayer and healing (<a href="/acts/28-8.htm">Acts 28:8&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers today can expect hostility (<a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>), yet the Lord often turns persecution into the very avenue that spreads the gospel (<a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all who call on Your name</b><p>This phrase identifies Christians by their most basic act: calling on Jesus as Lord.<p>&#8226; Peter preached the identical wording at Pentecost, quoting <a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>: &#8220;Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-21.htm">Acts 2:21</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Calling on the name&#8221; is a confession of worship and dependence, seen again in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-2.htm">1 Corinthians 1:2</a> where believers are described as &#8220;those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Ananias&#8217; choice of words quietly affirms Jesus&#8217; deity; the name that saves is God&#8217;s own name (<a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s rage is therefore aimed directly at the Lord Himself (<a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a>: &#8220;Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The Lord defends His people; anyone who touches them touches &#8220;the apple of His eye&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/9-14.htm">Acts 9:14</a> captures Ananias&#8217; alarm: the feared persecutor has arrived, backed by religious authority, intent on imprisoning every follower of Jesus. Yet the verse also sets the stage for God&#8217;s breathtaking reversal. Saul&#8217;s earthly credentials cannot outrank Christ&#8217;s heavenly commission; the hunter will become the herald. For believers then and now, the line reminds us that no opposition, however official or imminent, can thwart the risen Lord who claims those who call on His name and turns enemies into instruments of His grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">All that call on thy name.</span>--Here again we have to trace the growth of a new terminology.
