Antioch and Iconium were cities where Paul had previously preached, and his message had stirred significant controversy. The Jews' arrival from these cities indicates a concerted effort to undermine Paul's ministry. This reflects the broader pattern of Jewish opposition to the early Christian movement, as seen in <a href="/acts/13-45.htm">Acts 13:45</a> and <a href="/acts/14-2.htm">Acts 14:2</a>, where jealousy and resistance to the Gospel were prevalent.<p><b>and won over the crowds.</b><br>The ability of these Jews to sway the crowds suggests the volatile nature of public opinion in the ancient world. It also underscores the influence of persuasive rhetoric and the deep-seated tensions between Jewish traditions and the emerging Christian faith. This mirrors the events in <a href="/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5-8</a>, where similar tactics were used to incite opposition against Paul and Silas.<p><b>They stoned Paul</b><br>Stoning was a traditional Jewish method of execution for blasphemy, as prescribed in <a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>. This act indicates the severity of the accusations against Paul, who was seen as a threat to Jewish religious authority. The stoning of Paul echoes the martyrdom of Stephen in <a href="/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58-60</a>, highlighting the recurring theme of persecution faced by early Christians.<p><b>and dragged him outside the city,</b><br>Dragging Paul outside the city aligns with the Jewish custom of executing punishment outside the community, as seen in the stoning of Stephen. This act also reflects the cultural practice of removing perceived impurity from the city, as described in <a href="/numbers/15-35.htm">Numbers 15:35-36</a>. It symbolizes the rejection of Paul's message by the local populace.<p><b>presuming he was dead.</b><br>The presumption of Paul's death signifies the severity of the attack and the miraculous nature of his survival, which is further elaborated in the following verses. This event foreshadows Paul's later writings in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>, where he recounts his sufferings for the sake of the Gospel. It also serves as a type of Christ's own death and resurrection, illustrating the theme of suffering and deliverance that permeates the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A key figure in the early Christian church, Paul was a missionary and apostle who spread the Gospel to the Gentiles.

The quick swing from adoration to violence mirrors Jerusalem&#8217;s shift from &#8220;Hosanna&#8221; to &#8220;Crucify Him&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>; 27:20).<p>&#8226; Crowds are easily swayed when truth is not rooted in Scripture (<a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The incident reminds us that ministry fruitfulness does not immunize anyone from sudden opposition (<a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They stoned Paul</b><p>&#8226; Stoning was the traditional Jewish method for punishing perceived blasphemy (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>; <a href="/john/10-33.htm">John 10:33</a>). Ironically, Paul had once approved of Stephen&#8217;s stoning (<a href="/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>); now he endures the same treatment for preaching Christ.<p>&#8226; This fulfills Jesus&#8217; words that His followers would drink the same cup of suffering He drank (<a href="/mark/10-39.htm">Mark 10:39</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul later lists this beating among his hardships (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>), testifying that physical persecution did not deter his mission.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and dragged him outside the city, presuming he was dead</b><p>&#8226; Leaving the body outside the walls avoided ceremonial defilement for the city (<a href="/numbers/15-35.htm">Numbers 15:35&#8211;36</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Their assumption that Paul was dead underscores the severity of the attack, yet God preserved his life (<a href="/psalms/118-17.htm">Psalm 118:17</a>). In the next verse he simply gets up and walks back into Lystra (<a href="/acts/14-20.htm">Acts 14:20</a>), illustrating divine empowerment and remarkable courage.<p>&#8226; The episode becomes a living parable of resurrection life: struck down but not destroyed (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a> records determined adversaries traveling long distances to silence the gospel, a fickle crowd swaying from worship to violence, and Paul&#8217;s near-death experience that showcases both human hostility and divine preservation.

The strength of the hostility is shown by the facts, (1) that the Jews of the two cities were acting in concert, and (2) that those of the former had travelled not less than one hundred and thirty miles to hinder the Apostle's work.<p><span class= "bld">Who persuaded the people.</span>--The sudden change of feeling is almost as startling as that which transformed the hosannas of the multitudes at Jerusalem into the cry of "Crucify Him!"

We find a like sudden change in an opposite direction in the people of Melita (<a href="/acts/28-6.htm" title="However, they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.">Acts 28:6</a>). If the strangers who were endowed with such mysterious powers were not "gods in the likeness of men," they might be sorcerers, or even demons, in the evil sense of that word. The Jews, ever ready to impute signs and wonders to Beelzebub, the chief of the demons (see Notes on <a href="/matthew/10-34.htm" title="Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.">Matthew 10:34</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-24.htm" title="But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow does not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.">Matthew 12:24</a>), would readily work on this feeling, and terrify the people into the cruel ferocity of panic. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> <span class="accented">- But there came Jews thither</span> for <span class="accented">and there came thither certain Jews</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned for who persuaded the people, and having stoned</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and dragged</span> for <span class="accented">drew</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that he was dead</span> for <span class="accented">he had been dead</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">But there came Jews</span>, etc. Observe the persistent enmity of the unbelieving Jews. The same fickleness of the multitude which led those who had cried, "Hosanna!" to turn round and say, "Crucify him!" here led those who would have worshipped Paul as a god, now to stone him as a blasphemer. This is, doubtless, the instance to which St. Paul alludes when he says "Once was I stoned," (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/14-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[some] Jews</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Ioudaioi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2453.htm">Strong's 2453: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jewish.
