This group was primarily composed of Jewish converts at this time, as the events of <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a> occur shortly after Pentecost, a Jewish festival. The term "believers" underscores their faith in Jesus as the Messiah, a central tenet of early Christian identity. This community was characterized by a shared faith and commitment to the teachings of the apostles.<p><b>were together</b><br>The physical and spiritual unity of the believers is emphasized here. This togetherness was not just a matter of proximity but also of purpose and mission. The early church gathered regularly for prayer, teaching, and fellowship, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>. This unity fulfilled Jesus' prayer for His followers to be one (<a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>). The communal life of the early Christians was a powerful witness to the surrounding culture, demonstrating the transformative power of the Gospel.<p><b>and had everything in common.</b><br>This phrase indicates a radical form of communal living where personal possessions were shared among the community. This practice was voluntary and motivated by love and concern for one another, reflecting the teachings of Jesus about caring for the needy (<a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>). It also echoes the Old Testament ideal of community life, as seen in the laws of Jubilee (Leviticus 25). This sharing was not a form of socialism but rather a spontaneous expression of the believers' unity and love, facilitated by the Holy Spirit. The practice of having "everything in common" was a practical response to the needs within the community, ensuring that no one lacked basic necessities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>The early Christians who had accepted Jesus as the Messiah and were part of the nascent church in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the early church was forming, following the events of Pentecost.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pentecost.htm">Pentecost</a></b><br>The event where the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles, empowering them to preach the gospel, leading to the conversion of many.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/apostles.htm">Apostles</a></b><br>The primary leaders of the early church, who were teaching and guiding the new believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/community_life.htm">Community Life</a></b><br>The shared life and fellowship among the believers, characterized by unity and mutual support.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_the_body_of_christ.htm">Unity in the Body of Christ</a></b><br>The early church exemplified a profound unity that transcended individual differences.

Here there was a literal fulfilment of his Lord's words (<a href="/luke/12-33.htm" title="Sell that you have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that fails not, where no thief approaches, neither moth corrupts.">Luke 12:33</a>), a society founded, not on the law of self-interest and competition, but on sympathy and self-denial. They had all things in common, not by a compulsory abolition of the rights of property (see <a href="/acts/5-4.htm" title="Whiles it remained, was it not your own? and after it was sold, was it not in your own power? why have you conceived this thing in your heart? you have not lied to men, but to God.">Acts 5:4</a>), but by the spontaneous energy of love. The gift of the Spirit showed its power, not only in tongues and prophecy, but in the more excellent way of charity. It was well that that inimitable glow of love should manifest itself for a time to be a beacon-light to after ages, even if experience taught the Church in course of time that this generous and general distribution was not the wisest method of accomplishing permanent good, and that here also a discriminate economy, such as St. Paul taught (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.">2Thessalonians 3:10</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Likewise must the deacons be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;">1Timothy 3:8</a>), was necessary as a safe-guard against abuse. It was, we may perhaps believe, partly in consequence of the rapid exhaustion of its resources thus brought about, that the Church at Jerusalem became dependent for many years upon the bounty of the churches of the Gentiles. (See Note on <a href="/acts/11-29.htm" title="Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brothers which dwelled in Judaea:">Acts 11:29</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Were together</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;</span>; see <a href="/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a>, note, and above, ver. 42). Had all things common. Just as the Transfiguration gave a passing glimpse of the state of glory, so here we have a specimen of what Christian love and unity in its perfection, and unchecked by contact with the world without, would, and perhaps some day will, produce. But even at Jerusalem this bright vision of a paradise on earth was soon troubled by the earthly dissensions recorded in <a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6</a>; and the Christian community received a timely lesson that things good in themselves are not always practicable in an evil world, where sluggish virtues require the stimulants of bodily wants to draw them out and strengthen them, and where hypocrisy often claims the kindly offices which are due only to disciples indeed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/2-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Pantes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
