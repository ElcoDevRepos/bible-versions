This term reflects the early Christians' belief in Jesus as the way to salvation, echoing Jesus' own words in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>. Paul's persecution "even to the death" indicates his involvement in severe actions against Christians, including the approval of Stephen's martyrdom (<a href="/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58-8</a>:1). This highlights the intensity of his opposition before his conversion on the road to Damascus (<a href="/acts/9.htm">Acts 9:1-19</a>).<p><b>detaining both men and women</b><br>Paul's actions were not limited by gender, showing the indiscriminate nature of his persecution. This reflects the early church's inclusivity, as both men and women were active participants in the Christian community. The mention of women underscores the significant role they played in the early church, as seen in other New Testament passages like <a href="/romans/16.htm">Romans 16:1-7</a>, where women are acknowledged as deacons and fellow workers in Christ.<p><b>and throwing them into prison</b><br>Imprisonment was a common punishment for those seen as threats to the religious and social order. In the context of first-century Judaism, the Sanhedrin had authority over religious matters, and Paul, as a zealous Pharisee, acted under their jurisdiction. This phrase also foreshadows Paul's own future imprisonments for the sake of the gospel (<a href="/acts/16-23.htm">Acts 16:23</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23</a>), illustrating a dramatic transformation from persecutor to persecuted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul (formerly Saul)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, Paul is recounting his past actions before his conversion to Christianity.
