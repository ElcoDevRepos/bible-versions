Leaders must first ensure their own spiritual health and integrity before they can effectively guide others. This echoes the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/7-5.htm">Matthew 7:5</a>, where He instructs to remove the plank from one's own eye before addressing the speck in another's. The call to self-watchfulness is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting the need for personal holiness and accountability.<p><b>and the entire flock</b><br>The "flock" refers to the community of believers, often depicted as sheep in biblical literature. This imagery is rooted in the pastoral culture of ancient Israel, where shepherds were responsible for the care and protection of their sheep. The metaphor underscores the vulnerability of believers and the responsibility of leaders to provide guidance and protection. This concept is also seen in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, where Jesus describes Himself as the Good Shepherd who lays down His life for the sheep.<p><b>of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers</b><br>The role of overseers, or elders, is divinely appointed by the Holy Spirit, indicating that church leadership is not merely a human institution but a spiritual calling. This aligns with the broader New Testament teaching on spiritual gifts and roles within the church, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a> and <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>. The Holy Spirit's involvement underscores the sacredness and seriousness of the leadership role.<p><b>Be shepherds of the church of God</b><br>The call to "be shepherds" reinforces the pastoral responsibility of leaders to nurture, guide, and protect the congregation. This directive is consistent with the charge given to Peter in <a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>, where Jesus instructs him to feed and tend His sheep. The church is described as belonging to God, emphasizing its divine ownership and the leaders' role as stewards rather than proprietors.<p><b>which He purchased with His own blood</b><br>This phrase highlights the sacrificial nature of Christ's atonement, underscoring the immense value and cost of the church. The reference to blood signifies the new covenant established through Jesus' death, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-14</a>. This echoes the Passover lamb in Exodus, a type of Christ, whose blood was a means of deliverance. The purchase language also reflects the concept of redemption, where believers are bought back from sin and death, as articulated in <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Paul is addressing the Ephesian elders in Miletus, providing them with final instructions and warnings as he prepares to leave them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesian_elders.htm">Ephesian Elders</a></b><br>Leaders of the church in Ephesus, responsible for the spiritual oversight and care of the congregation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_spirit.htm">Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The divine person who appoints and empowers the elders as overseers of the church.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/church_of_god.htm">Church of God</a></b><br>The community of believers, described as a flock, emphasizing their need for guidance and protection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/miletus.htm">Miletus</a></b><br>The location where Paul delivers his farewell speech to the Ephesian elders.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_overseers.htm">The Role of Overseers</a></b><br>Elders and leaders in the church are appointed by the Holy Spirit and are responsible for the spiritual well-being of the congregation.<br><br>Leadership in the church is a divine calling that requires vigilance and dedication.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_the_church.htm">The Value of the Church</a></b><br>The church is precious, having been purchased with the blood of Christ.

It will be noticed that the word is commonly used in the New Testament as associated with this imagery. So in <a href="/1_peter/2-25.htm" title="For you were as sheep going astray; but are now returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.">1Peter 2:25</a>, we have "the Shepherd and <span class= "ital">Bishop</span> of your souls," and the corresponding verb in <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm" title="Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;">1Peter 5:2</a>, "feed the flock of God . . . <span class= "ital">taking the oversight</span> thereof." The appointment, as referred to the Holy Ghost, implies, probably, (1) the inward call, the impulse which drew the man to the office; (2) the attestation of that call by the voices of the prophets, as in <a href="/acts/13-2.htm" title="As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.">Acts 13:2</a>, <a href="/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1Timothy 4:1</a>; (3) the bestowal of gifts fitting them for the work.<p><span class= "bld">To feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.</span>--It is clear that the words as they stand in the text are of immense importance, as bearing their witness to the belief of the Apostolic Church at once in the absolute divinity of Christ and in the nature of His redemptive work. The MSS., however, vary in their readings. Some of the best uncials and versions give "God;" others, of almost equal authority, give "Lord;" others, again, combine the two "Lord and God." The fact that elsewhere St. Paul invariably speaks of "the Church of God" (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/1_corinthians/1-2.htm" title="To the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and our's:">1Corinthians 1:2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:">2Corinthians 1:1</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-13.htm" title="For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:">Galatians 1:13</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:">1Thessalonians 2:14</a>, <span class= "ital">et</span> <span class= "ital">al</span>.), and never "the Church of the Lord," may be allowed, from one point of view, some weight as internal evidence in favour of the Received reading; while from another it may be urged that it might have tempted a transcriber to substitute a familiar for an unfamiliar phrase. Accepting that reading, the words not only confirm the great truths of the Church's creed, but give an implicit sanction to the language of theology or devotion, when it applies to the divine nature of our Lord predicates that belong strictly to the human nature which was associated with it. So Ignatius (<span class= "ital">Romans 6</span>) spoke of "the passion of my God," and Tertullian (<span class= "ital">Ad Uxor, </span>ii. 3) and Clement of Alexandria (<span class= "ital">Quis dives, </span>c. 34) use the very phrase "the blood of God" which this passage suggests, and the Eastern Church at the council of Ephesus gave to the Blessed Virgin the title of <span class= "ital">Theot?kos Deipara, </span>the mother of the very God. So in the liturgy which bears the name of St. James the brother of the Lord, he is described as <span class= "ital">Adelphotheos, </span>the brother of God, and that name is still current among the Greek Christians of Jerusalem. The general drift of the language of the New Testament writers was, however, in the other direction, and predicated human acts and attributes of the man Christ Jesus, Divine acts and attributes of the eternal Son; and it is obvious that this tends at once to greater accuracy of thought, and is really more reverential than the other. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> <span class="accented">- Take heed</span> for <span class="accented">take heed therefore</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">in</span> for <span class="accented">over</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">bishops</span> for <span class="accented">overseers</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">purchased</span> for <span class="accented">hath purchased</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Take heed</span>, etc.; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, peculiar to Luke (Acts 5:53; <a href="/luke/12-1.htm">Luke 12:1</a>; <a href="/luke/17-3.htm">Luke 17:3</a>; <a href="/luke/21-34.htm">Luke 21:34</a>). Now follows the weighty charge of this great bishop to the clergy assembled at his visitation. With the true feeling of a chief pastor, he thinks of the whole flock, but deals with them chiefly through the under-shepherds. If he can awaken in these individually a deep concern for the souls committed to their charge, he will have done the best that can be done for the fleck at large. The first step to such concern for the flock is that each be thoroughly alive to the worth and the wants of his own soul. "Take heed unto yourselves." He that is careless about his own salvation will never lie careful about the souls of others (comp. <a href="/1_timothy/4-16.htm">1 Timothy 4:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the which the Holy Ghost</span>, etc. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1ff7;</span>, no doubt, does not strictly contain the idea of "over which;" but the idea of authoritative oversight is contained in the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and therefore the rendering of the A.V., and of Alford's A.V. revised, is substantially correct. Perhaps the exact force of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1ff7;</span> is "among which," like <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="/acts/2-29.htm">Acts 2:29</a>, and elsewhere). The call and appointment to the ministry is the special function of the Holy Ghost (<a href="/john/20-22.htm">John 20:22, 23</a>; <a href="/acts/12-2.htm">Acts 12:2</a>; Ordination Service). <span class="cmt_word">To feed</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, the proper word for "tending" in relation to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, the flock, as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, the pastor, or shepherd, is for him who so feeds the flock of Christ (see <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11, 16</a>; <a href="/john/21-17.htm">John 21:17</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-20.htm">Hebrews 13:20</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2, 3</a>). St. Peter applies the titles of "Shepherd and Bishop of souls" to the Lord Jesus (<a href="/1_peter/2-25.htm">1 Peter 2:25</a>). St. Paul does not use the metaphor elsewhere, except indirectly, and in a different aspect (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Church of God</span>; margin, <span class="accented">Church of the Lord.</span> There is, perhaps, no single passage in Scripture which has caused more controversy and evoked more difference of opinion than this. The T.R. has <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, but most uncials have <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Kuinoel asserts that the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> rests on the authority, besides that of the oldest manuscripts, of the old versions, and of many el' the most ancient Fathers, and says that it is undoubtedly the true reading. Meyer, too, thinks that the external evidence for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> is decisive, and that the internal evidence from the fact that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> Occurs nowhere else in St. Paul's writings, is decisive also. But on the other hand, both the Codex Vaticanus (B) and the Codex Sinaitieus (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>), the two oldest manuscripts, have <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3c5;</span>). The Vulgate, too, and the Syriac have it; and such early Fathers as Ignatius (in his Epistle to the Ephesians) and Tertullian use the phrase, "the blood of God," which seems to have been derived from this passage. And Alford reasons powerfully in favor of <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, dwelling upon the fact that the phrase <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> occurs <span class="accented">ten times</span> in St. Paul's writings, that of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> not once. The chief authorities on each side of the question are: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in favor of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, Lachmann, Tischendorf, Bornemann, Lunge, Olshausen, Davidson, Meyer, Hackett, as also Grotius, Griesbaeh (doubtfully), Wetstein, Le Clerc, and others; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in favor of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, Bengel, Mill, Whitby, Wolf, Scholz, Knapp, Alford, Wordsworth, etc., and the R.T. It should be added that the evidence for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> has been much strengthened by the publication by Tischendorf, in 1563, of rite Codex Sinaiticus, and in 1867 of the Codex Vaticanus, from his own collation. The result is that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> seems to be the true reading (see the first of the two collects for the Ember weeks in the Book of Common Prayer. With regard to the difficulty that this reading seems to imply the unscriptural phrase, "<span class="accented">the</span> blood of God," and to savor of the Monophysite heresy, it is obvious to reply that there is a wide difference between the phrase as it stands and such a one as the direct "<span class="accented">blood</span> of <span class="accented">God</span>," which Athanasius and others objected to. The mental insertion of "the Lord" or "Christ," as the subject of the verb "<span class="accented">purchased</span>," is very easy, the transition from God the Father to God incarnate being one that might be made almost imperceptibly. Others (including the R.T.) take the reading of several good manuscripts, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, and understand <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> to be an ellipse for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, the phrase used in <a href="/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>; and so render it "<span class="accented">which</span> he purchased by the blood of his own Son." <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, his own, is used without a substantive in <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>.
