(See Note on <a href="/acts/6-3.htm" title="Why, brothers, look you out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.">Acts 6:3</a>.) He was no longer known, if, indeed, that title had ever been applied to him, as Philip the deacon, but as Philip the evangelist. The office so described is recognised by St. Paul in his enumeration of spiritual gifts and functions, in <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm" title="And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;">Ephesians 4:11</a>, as coming next in order of importance to those of apostles and prophets, and before pastors and teachers. It would seem, accordingly, to have been distinct from the "orders," in the later sense, of presbyter or deacon, though capable of being united with either of them. Timotheus was exhorted by St. Paul when he was left at Ephesus, with the authority of a bishop, or, more strictly, of a vicar apostolic, to "do the work of an evangelist," as that to which he had been called (<a href="/2_timothy/4-5.htm" title="But watch you in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry.">2Timothy 4:5</a>). It followed, from the nature of the office, as analogous to that of the missionary of later times, that, though residing mainly at Caesarea, Philip's labours extended beyond its limits; and we have seen reason to trace his work (see Notes on <a href="/acts/8-40.htm" title="But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.">Acts 8:40</a>; <a href="/acts/15-3.htm" title="And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy to all the brothers.">Acts 15:3</a>; <a href="/acts/21-3.htm" title="Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.">Acts 21:3</a>; <a href="/acts/21-7.htm" title="And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brothers, and stayed with them one day.">Acts 21:7</a>) all along the coasts of Palestine and Phoenicia. As far as we know, Philip and St. Luke had not met before, and we can imagine the satisfaction with which the latter, himself, probably, an evangelist in both senses of the word (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-18.htm" title="And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;">2Corinthians 8:18</a>), and already contemplating his work as an historian, would welcome the acquaintance of the former, how he would ask many questions as to the early history of the Church, and learn from him all, or nearly all, that we find in the first eleven chapters of this book. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> <span class="accented">- On the morrow</span> for <span class="accented">the next day</span> A.V.; <span class="accented">we</span> for <span class="accented">we that were of Paul's company</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">entering we</span> for <span class="accented">we entered</span>... <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">who</span> for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Unto Caesarea</span>.

When last we heard of him (<a href="/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>) he had just reached Caesarea; apparently he had been working there as an evangelist ever since. His old home at Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>) had been broken up by the persecution (<a href="/acts/8-5.htm">Acts 8:5</a>), and thus the deacon had become an evangelist (<a href="/acts/8-12.htm">Acts 8:12</a>). <span class="accented">Evangelists</span> are mentioned by St. Paul(<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>) as one of the higher orders of the Christian ministry; and Timothy is bid "do the work of an evangelist" (<a href="/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>). In later times the term was restricted to the four writers of the Gospels. Philip's old association with Stephen in the diaconate must have been keenly remembered by St. Paul. <span class="cmt_word">We abode with him</span>. This seems to imply that Philip was well to do, and had a good house. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/21-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Leaving</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#958;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(exelthontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1831.htm">Strong's 1831: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go out, come out.
