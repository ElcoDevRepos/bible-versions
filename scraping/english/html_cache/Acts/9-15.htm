This reflects the nature of God's call, which often requires prompt obedience. The context here is the Lord speaking to Ananias in a vision, instructing him to visit Saul of Tarsus. This mirrors other biblical instances where God calls individuals to action, such as Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>) and Jonah being sent to Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/1-2.htm">Jonah 1:2</a>).<p><b>&#8220;This man is My chosen instrument</b><br>Saul, later known as Paul, is identified as God's "chosen instrument," indicating divine selection and purpose. This echoes the concept of election found throughout Scripture, where God chooses individuals for specific tasks, such as Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>) and David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12</a>). The term "instrument" suggests a tool or vessel through which God will accomplish His work, highlighting the idea that God uses people to fulfill His divine plans.<p><b>to carry My name</b><br>The phrase "to carry My name" signifies the mission of proclaiming and representing the name of Jesus Christ. In biblical terms, a name encompasses character and authority. Saul's mission is to spread the gospel, bearing the name of Christ, which aligns with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). This task involves both verbal proclamation and living a life that reflects Christ's teachings.<p><b>before the Gentiles and their kings,</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the scope of Saul's mission, which includes the Gentiles and their rulers. It marks a significant shift in the early Christian mission, as the gospel extends beyond the Jewish community to the Gentile world. This fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the inclusion of the Gentiles (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>). Saul's future interactions with Gentile leaders, such as King Agrippa (<a href="/acts/26.htm">Acts 26:1-28</a>), demonstrate the fulfillment of this mission.<p><b>and before the people of Israel.</b><br>Despite the focus on the Gentiles, Saul's mission also includes the people of Israel. This dual focus reflects the early church's struggle and mission to reach both Jews and Gentiles, as seen in Paul's pattern of preaching first in synagogues (<a href="/acts/13-5.htm">Acts 13:5, 14</a>). It underscores the continuity of God's covenant with Israel and the fulfillment of His promises through Jesus Christ, who is the Messiah for both Jews and Gentiles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, who is speaking to Ananias in a vision.

Jonah&#8217;s flight (<a href="/jonah/1-1.htm">Jonah 1:1-3</a>) contrasts Ananias&#8217;s compliance, reminding us that resisting God&#8217;s clear call only delays His plan&#8212;not defeats it.<p>God often moves His servants out of comfort zones so His larger purposes advance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Said the Lord</b><p>The speaker is the risen Christ, making this a divine mandate.<p>&#8226;

So in <a href="/isaiah/22-7.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that your choicest valleys shall be full of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate.">Isaiah 22:7</a>, we have in the LXX. "valleys of election" for the "choicest valleys" of the English version. The term "vessel" is used in the Old Testament of arms (<a href="/genesis/27-3.htm" title="Now therefore take, I pray you, your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;">Genesis 27:3</a>), of garments (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-5.htm" title="The woman shall not wear that which pertains to a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination to the LORD your God.">Deuteronomy 22:5</a>), of household goods (<a href="/context/genesis/31-36.htm" title="And Jacob was wroth, and strived with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that you have so hotly pursued after me?">Genesis 31:36-37</a>). In the New Testament its range of meaning is yet wider, as in <a href="/matthew/12-29.htm" title="Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.">Matthew 12:29</a>; <a href="/luke/8-16.htm" title="No man, when he has lighted a candle, covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed; but sets it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.">Luke 8:16</a>; <a href="/john/19-29.htm" title="Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it on hyssop, and put it to his mouth.">John 19:29</a>; <a href="/romans/9-22.htm" title="What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:">Romans 9:22</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm" title="But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.">2Corinthians 4:7</a>. Here our word "instrument" or "implement" comes, perhaps, nearest to its meaning. The persecutor had been chosen by the Lord as the "tool" with which He would work out His gracious will for him and for the Gentiles. In this sense it was used by classical writers of useful and trusty slaves, just as we speak of one man being the "tool" of another. Possibly, however, the words may be interpreted as containing the germ of the parable of the potter's vessel on which St. Paul dwells in <a href="/context/romans/9-21.htm" title="Has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel to honor, and another to dishonor?">Romans 9:21-23</a>, and implied that the convert was not only chosen, but moulded, for his future work. The word "election," which occurs here for the first time in the New Testament, and is afterwards so prominent in the teaching of St. Paul (<a href="/romans/9-11.htm" title="(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calls;)">Romans 9:11</a>; <a href="/romans/11-5.htm" title="Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.">Romans 11:5</a>; <a href="/context/romans/11-7.htm" title="What then? Israel has not obtained that which he seeks for; but the election has obtained it, and the rest were blinded.">Romans 11:7-8</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm" title="Knowing, brothers beloved, your election of God.">1Thessalonians 1:4</a>), affords yet another instance of the influence exercised on the Apostle by the thoughts and language of the instructor through whom alone he could have learnt what is here recorded. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A chosen vessel</span> (comp. <a href="/galatians/2-15.htm">Galatians 2:15</a>; <a href="/romans/9-21.htm">Romans 9:21, 22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To bear my name before the Gentiles</span> (see <a href="/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21</a>; <a href="/acts/26-17.htm">Acts 26:17, 18</a>; <a href="/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-7.htm">Galatians 2:7-9</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">and kings</span> (<a href="/acts/25.htm">Acts 25</a>; <a href="/acts/26.htm">Acts 26</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-16.htm">2 Timothy 4:16, 17</a>, with reference to Nero), <span class="cmt_word">and the children of Israel</span>.
