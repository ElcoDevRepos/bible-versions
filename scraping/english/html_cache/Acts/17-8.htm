The context is that Paul and Silas were preaching the gospel in Thessalonica, and some Jews, feeling threatened by their message, incited a mob against them. The "this" they heard likely includes the claim that Paul and Silas were promoting another king, Jesus, which was seen as a challenge to Roman authority and the emperor.<p><b>the crowd and city officials</b><br>The "crowd" likely consisted of local Thessalonians, including Jews who were opposed to Paul's message, as well as Gentiles who were stirred up by the accusations. The "city officials" refers to the politarchs, a specific title for city rulers in Thessalonica, confirmed by archaeological findings such as inscriptions. This indicates a structured civic authority in the city, responsible for maintaining order and allegiance to Rome.<p><b>were greatly disturbed</b><br>The disturbance was due to the potential political implications of the message of Jesus as king. In the Roman Empire, any claim of another king was seen as a threat to Caesar's rule, which could lead to unrest or rebellion. The officials' concern was likely about maintaining peace and their own positions under Roman oversight. This reaction is similar to other instances in Acts where the gospel message challenges existing power structures, such as in <a href="/acts/16-20.htm">Acts 16:20-21</a> in Philippi.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_silas.htm">Paul and Silas</a></b><br>Early Christian missionaries spreading the Gospel in Thessalonica.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>A major city in Macedonia where Paul and Silas preached.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The local populace of Thessalonica, stirred by the accusations against Paul and Silas.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/city_officials.htm">City Officials</a></b><br>The governing authorities in Thessalonica, responsible for maintaining order.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jason.htm">Jason</a></b><br>A local believer who hosted Paul and Silas, implicated in the disturbance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">The Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>Following Christ can lead to opposition and disturbance in society.

(<a href="/acts/17-7.htm">Acts 17:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The accusation is serious treason in the Roman world, so the moment the words reach public ears, everyone snaps to attention.<p>&#8226; Similar flash-points appear whenever the gospel confronts earthly authority&#8212;compare <a href="/acts/4-2.htm">Acts 4:2-3</a>; <a href="/acts/5-28.htm">Acts 5:28</a>.<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us that faith comes by &#8220;hearing&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>), yet hearts respond differently: some believe, others bristle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The crowd</b><p>&#8226; Thessalonica&#8217;s marketplace thronged with merchants, travelers, and locals eager for news; sudden political rumors spread like wildfire (<a href="/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Crowds often swing with emotion rather than truth&#8212;see <a href="/matthew/27-20.htm">Matthew 27:20</a> and <a href="/acts/19-28.htm">Acts 19:28-32</a>.<p>&#8226; Here, the multitude senses a possible threat to civic peace and, by extension, their own security; fear drives their agitation rather than careful examination of the gospel claims (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>City officials</b><p>&#8226; Luke singles out the &#8220;city officials,&#8221; civic magistrates responsible for keeping order under Rome (<a href="/acts/13-50.htm">Acts 13:50</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/13-3.htm">Romans 13:3</a> notes that rulers fear upheaval because their charge is to maintain peace; any hint of sedition places them in jeopardy with higher imperial powers.<p>&#8226; The officials&#8217; reaction shows how the gospel inevitably intersects with public policy when it proclaims Jesus as Lord above every earthly power (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Were greatly disturbed</b><p>&#8226; The verb pictures inner turmoil: hearts churning, minds racing, civic nerves jangling.<p>&#8226; Like the Sanhedrin &#8220;greatly disturbed that they were teaching the people&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-2.htm">Acts 4:2</a>), these leaders perceive the message of Christ as destabilizing.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/11-48.htm">John 11:48</a> records a parallel fear: &#8220;If we let Him go on like this&#8230; the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The gospel comforts the humble yet unsettles the self-reliant; disturbance often precedes repentance&#8212;or persecution (<a href="/acts/17-13.htm">Acts 17:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/17-8.htm">Acts 17:8</a> records the immediate emotional fallout when Christ&#8217;s exclusive kingship confronts a city invested in Rome&#8217;s authority and its own status quo. Hearing the charge that there is &#8220;another king, Jesus,&#8221; both crowd and officials experience a deep anxiety over political and personal security. Their disturbed reaction underscores two timeless truths: the gospel necessarily challenges every rival allegiance, and the human heart must choose either surrender to Jesus or resistance rooted in fear.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> <span class="accented">- Multitude</span> for <span class="accented">people</span>, A.V.
