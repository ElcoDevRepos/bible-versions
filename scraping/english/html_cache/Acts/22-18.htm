The Lord here refers to Jesus Christ, affirming His divine authority and continued guidance in Paul's ministry. This vision is consistent with other biblical accounts where God communicates directly with His chosen servants, such as Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3) and Isaiah's vision in the temple (Isaiah 6). The personal nature of this communication underscores the intimate relationship between Paul and Christ, a theme prevalent throughout Paul's epistles.<p><b>&#8216;Hurry! Leave Jerusalem quickly</b><br>The urgency in the command "Hurry!" reflects the immediate danger Paul faced in Jerusalem. Historically, Jerusalem was a center of Jewish religious life and a place of significant tension for early Christians. The city was known for its resistance to the Gospel, as seen in the persecution of the apostles and the martyrdom of Stephen (Acts 7). The directive to leave quickly suggests that Paul's life was at risk, and it highlights the protective nature of God's guidance. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where God instructs His people to flee from danger, such as Joseph and Mary fleeing to Egypt with Jesus (<a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13</a>).<p><b>because the people here will not accept your testimony about Me.&#8217;</b><br>The phrase "the people here" refers to the Jewish population in Jerusalem, who were often resistant to the message of Jesus as the Messiah. This rejection is a recurring theme in the New Testament, as many Jews struggled to reconcile Jesus' teachings with their traditional beliefs. Paul's testimony about Christ was rooted in his dramatic conversion experience on the road to Damascus (Acts 9), which he frequently recounted as evidence of Jesus' transformative power. The rejection of Paul's testimony by the Jews in Jerusalem fulfills the prophetic words of Jesus, who predicted that His followers would face opposition (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-21</a>). This rejection also foreshadows the broader mission to the Gentiles, as Paul would later become known as the Apostle to the Gentiles (<a href="/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul (Saul of Tarsus)</a></b><br>The apostle who is recounting his conversion experience and subsequent vision in Jerusalem.

<a href="/1_corinthians/15-8.htm">1 Corinthians 15:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture shows that such theophanies propel God&#8217;s servants into specific assignments&#8212;think of Isaiah&#8217;s vision (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-8</a>) and Ezekiel&#8217;s (<a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28&#8211;2</a>:3).<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s initiative underscores that Paul&#8217;s gospel and his calling are divine, not self-chosen (<a href="/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hurry!</b><p>&#8226;

Delay could cost Paul his life and hinder the spread of the gospel to Gentile regions that still awaited the message (<a href="/romans/15-19.htm">Romans 15:19-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Urgency is a reminder that obedience is measured in minutes, not months (<a href="/psalms/119-60.htm">Psalm 119:60</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Leave Jerusalem quickly</b><p>&#8226; Jerusalem was the heart of Paul&#8217;s own heritage, yet Jesus directs him away.<p>&#8226; Earlier, believers helped Paul escape another assassination attempt there (<a href="/acts/9-29.htm">Acts 9:29-30</a>); the pattern repeats because the hostility remains.<p>&#8226; Like the disciples who were told to shake the dust off and move on when rejected (<a href="/matthew/10-14.htm">Matthew 10:14-15</a>), Paul is to steward his time where the harvest is ripe.<p>&#8226;

The statement echoes <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a> (&#8220;He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him&#8221;) and reminds us that rejection of God&#8217;s messengers is sadly common (<a href="/luke/13-34.htm">Luke 13:34</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul must accept that results rest with God; his role is faithfulness, not forcing conversions (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; The refusal in Jerusalem contrasts with the openness Paul will meet among Gentiles (<a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46-48</a>), fulfilling Jesus&#8217; promise that he is &#8220;a chosen vessel&#8230;to carry My name before the Gentiles&#8221; (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/22-18.htm">Acts 22:18</a> reveals a personal encounter in which Jesus gives Paul urgent, protective, and strategic instructions.
