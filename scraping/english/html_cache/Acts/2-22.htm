The term "Men of Israel" signifies the direct appeal to the Jewish people, emphasizing their shared heritage and covenant with God. The call to "listen" underscores the importance of the message, echoing the prophetic tradition where prophets would call the people to hear God's word (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>).<p><b>Jesus of Nazareth was a man certified by God to you:</b><br>"Jesus of Nazareth" identifies Jesus with His earthly origins, fulfilling prophecies about the Messiah's humble beginnings (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2-3</a>). The phrase "certified by God" indicates divine approval and authentication of Jesus' ministry. This certification is crucial for the Jewish audience, as it aligns with the expectation of a divinely appointed Messiah.<p><b>by miracles, wonders, and signs:</b><br>These terms refer to the supernatural acts performed by Jesus, which served as evidence of His divine authority and messianic identity. "Miracles" (dunamis) emphasize power, "wonders" (teras) highlight the awe they inspired, and "signs" (semeion) point to their significance in revealing God's kingdom. These acts fulfilled Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>).<p><b>which God did among you through Him:</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that the miracles were acts of God, performed through Jesus, underscoring the divine-human partnership in Jesus' ministry. It highlights the presence of God's power in their midst, affirming Jesus' role as the mediator of God's will and the fulfillment of the messianic promise.<p><b>as you yourselves know:</b><br>This appeal to the audience's personal knowledge serves as a rhetorical device to affirm the truth of the message. The Jewish people present had either witnessed or heard of Jesus' works, making them firsthand or reliable secondhand witnesses to His ministry.

Observe the distinct reference to the miracles of Christ, as the proofs that he came from God, the authenticating evidences of his Divine mission. So St. Peter again, in his address to Cornelius, declares how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him (<a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>). The miracles of the gospel are, and were intended to be, a demonstration of the truth of Christianity, and it is at their peril that Christians allow themselves to give up this argument at the bidding of the skeptic. <span class="cmt_word">Mighty works and wonders and signs</span>. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> are <span class="accented">powers</span>, acts of healing and such like, done by the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit (see the above reference to <a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> are <span class="accented">wonders</span> or <span class="accented">portents</span>, such as are spoken of by the Prophet Joel, "wonders in heaven above," the darkening of the sun, the discoloration or the moon, or any ether wonder considered only with reference to its portentous character; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> are <span class="accented">signs</span>, not necessarily miraculous, but things which are proofs, either by their miraculous character or from the time or mode of their occurrence, of the truth of the things spoken. "Miracles, wonders, and signs" occur together in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-12.htm">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>. The three seem to include every kind of miracle, or, as Meyer says, miracles viewed <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> according to their <span class="accented">nature,</span> <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> according to their <span class="accented">appearance,</span> <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> according to their <span class="accented">destination</span> or proposed end. <span class="cmt_word">Which God did by him</span>. So we read <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>, "Through [or 'by'] whom also he made the worlds." And so our Lord said of himself, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work;" and "The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do" (<a href="/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17, 19</a>; comp. <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). On the other hand, our Lord often speaks of his own power, as <a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>; <a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a> (comp. <a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>). As Mediator, Christ did all things by his Father's appointment, and for his Father's glory, Even as ye yours, elves know. Mark the confidence with which Peter appeals to their personal knowledge of the miracles of Christ. This was a fitting preparation for the announcement of that mighty power, wonder, and sign which he was now about to proclaim to them - the resurrection of the Lord Jesus from the dead. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/2-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Men</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7948;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Andres)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_435.htm">Strong's 435: </a> </span><span class="str2">A male human being; a man, husband.
