The phrase "did not shrink back" suggests courage and perseverance, reflecting Paul's dedication despite opposition and hardship. This echoes his earlier experiences, such as in <a href="/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19-20</a>, where he was stoned and left for dead but continued his mission. It also aligns with the exhortation in <a href="/hebrews/10-39.htm">Hebrews 10:39</a>, encouraging believers not to shrink back in faith.<p><b>from declaring to you</b><br>Paul's role as an apostle was to proclaim the message of the Gospel. The term "declaring" indicates a public and authoritative announcement, akin to a herald. This reflects the apostolic duty to communicate God's message clearly and without reservation, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-16.htm">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>, where Paul states, "Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!"<p><b>the whole will of God</b><br>This phrase underscores the comprehensive nature of Paul's teaching. He did not selectively present parts of God's message but delivered the full counsel, including both comforting and challenging truths. This aligns with the biblical mandate to teach "the whole counsel of God" (<a href="/acts/20-20.htm">Acts 20:20</a>), ensuring that believers are fully equipped. The "will of God" encompasses His redemptive plan through Jesus Christ, moral directives, and eschatological promises, as seen throughout Scripture, including <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a> and <a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9-10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Paul is addressing the Ephesian elders.

Compare <a href="/ezekiel/33-7.htm">Ezekiel 33:7-9</a>, where the watchman avoids guilt by faithfully warning others.<p>- It reminds us that obedience in teaching is not optional&#8212;our accountability to God derives from His command, as seen again in <a href="/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I did not shrink back</b><p>- Paul refused to dodge, dilute, or soften the message. <a href="/acts/20-20.htm">Acts 20:20</a> echoes this: &#8220;I did not shrink back from proclaiming anything that was profitable.&#8221;<p>- Courage in ministry is a hallmark of fidelity. Consider <a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>: &#8220;Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke, and encourage&#8230;&#8221;<p>- Shrinking back is contrasted with the boldness described in <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>, &#8220;I am not ashamed of the gospel.&#8221;<p>- Faithful shepherds must embrace every topic Scripture raises, even those that confront cultural norms (<a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from declaring</b><p>- &#8220;Declaring&#8221; is open, public, and verbal. Paul&#8217;s ministry was transparent (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>).<p>- Declaration involves teaching, warning, urging, and comforting (<a href="/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>).<p>- The verb underscores that truth must be spoken&#8212;not merely implied or lived out silently (<a href="/romans/10-14.htm">Romans 10:14-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to you</b><p>- Paul&#8217;s audience was personal: the Ephesian elders he had discipled. Ministry is relational, not detached.<p>- It shows specificity&#8212;truth addressed to real people with real needs (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:8</a>).<p>- Shepherds feed the flock God has entrusted to them, just as Jesus instructed Peter in <a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the whole will of God</b><p>- &#8220;Whole&#8221; underscores completeness: nothing omitted, nothing added. <a href="/psalms/119-160.htm">Psalm 119:160</a> affirms, &#8220;The entirety of Your word is truth.&#8221;<p>- &#8220;Will of God&#8221; encompasses the redemptive plan (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>), sound doctrine (<a href="/1_timothy/4-16.htm">1 Timothy 4:16</a>), moral commands (<a href="/ephesians/5-17.htm">Ephesians 5:17-18</a>), warnings of judgment (<a href="/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30-31</a>), and promises of hope (<a href="/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11-14</a>).<p>- Partial teaching breeds shallow disciples. Full counsel matures believers (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-15</a>).<p>- Paul modeled this by proclaiming repentance and faith (<a href="/acts/20-21.htm">Acts 20:21</a>), teaching on the kingdom (<a href="/acts/20-25.htm">Acts 20:25</a>), and urging holiness (<a href="/acts/20-32.htm">Acts 20:32</a>).<p>- Ultimately, the whole will of God centers on Christ crucified and risen (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>) and leads to obedience (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul connects his clear conscience to an unswerving commitment: he boldly, verbally, and relationally delivered every facet of God&#8217;s revealed plan to those under his care.
