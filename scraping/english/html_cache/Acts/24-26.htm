It suggests ongoing events and a continuous state of affairs, highlighting the political and judicial context of the Roman Empire, where governors often held significant power over legal proceedings.<p><b>he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe</b><br>Felix's expectation of a bribe reflects the corruption prevalent in Roman governance. Bribery was a common practice, and Felix's character is consistent with historical accounts of his rule, which was marked by greed and injustice. This expectation also underscores the financial and social pressures faced by early Christians, who were often marginalized and exploited.<p><b>So he sent for Paul frequently</b><br>Felix's repeated summoning of Paul suggests a sustained interest, possibly due to Paul's articulate defense and the compelling nature of his testimony. This frequent interaction provided Paul with opportunities to witness about Christ, fulfilling his mission to spread the Gospel even in adverse circumstances. It also reflects the Roman legal system's procedural delays and the governor's personal curiosity or ulterior motives.<p><b>and talked with him</b><br>The dialogues between Felix and Paul likely covered theological, philosophical, and legal topics. Paul's ability to engage with Felix demonstrates his rhetorical skills and deep understanding of both Jewish law and Roman culture. This interaction is reminiscent of other biblical figures who spoke truth to power, such as Daniel in Babylon. It also highlights the early Christian commitment to evangelism, regardless of the audience's status or intentions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is imprisoned and on trial, known for his missionary journeys and spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/felix.htm">Felix</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who presides over Paul's trial.

Roman officials often levied &#8220;fees,&#8221; and Felix already had a reputation for greed; Scripture simply states the fact.<p>&#8226;Bribery directly violates God&#8217;s law: &#8220;You shall not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>).<p>&#8226;Greed enslaves: &#8220;The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226;Earlier in Acts, Simon tried to buy spiritual power and was sternly rebuked (<a href="/acts/8-18.htm">Acts 8:18-20</a>).<p>Felix&#8217;s desire for a payoff contrasts sharply with Paul&#8217;s contentment in chains (<a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So he sent for Paul frequently</b><p>Felix&#8217;s summonses look pious but are calculated.

Felix is convicted by truth yet driven by greed, so he keeps calling Paul in hopes of profit. God uses those very summonses to spread the gospel, showing His sovereignty over human motives. The verse warns believers against the corrosive pull of money, highlights the danger of delaying obedience, and encourages us to seize every audience&#8212;however imperfect&#8212;to speak the word of Christ plainly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul.</span>--The Greek gives "hoping also," as continuing the previous verse, and so places the fact in more immediate connection with the procurator's conduct. This greed of gain in the very act of administering justice was the root-evil of the weak and wicked character. He had caught at the word "alms" in <a href="/acts/24-17.htm" title="Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.">Acts 24:17</a>. St. Paul, then, was not without resources.
