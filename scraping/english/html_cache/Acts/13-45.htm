This city was a significant center in the Roman province of Galatia, and the synagogue was a place where Jews and God-fearing Gentiles gathered. The presence of large crowds indicates the growing interest in the message of the Gospel, which was spreading beyond the Jewish community to include Gentiles. This shift was a fulfillment of the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and the prophecy that the Messiah would be a light to the Gentiles (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<p><b>they were filled with jealousy</b><br>The Jewish leaders' jealousy was rooted in their fear of losing influence and authority. The rapid spread of Christianity threatened their traditional religious structure and power. This reaction is reminiscent of the jealousy of the religious leaders towards Jesus during His ministry (<a href="/mark/15-10.htm">Mark 15:10</a>). The jealousy here is not just personal but also a resistance to the new covenant that was being established through Christ, which included both Jews and Gentiles (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<p><b>and they blasphemously contradicted</b><br>The term "blasphemously" indicates that their opposition was not just disagreement but a serious offense against God. By contradicting Paul, they were rejecting the message of salvation through Jesus Christ, which is central to the Christian faith. This opposition is similar to the resistance faced by the prophets in the Old Testament, who were often rejected by their own people (<a href="/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25-26</a>).<p><b>what Paul was saying</b><br>Paul's message centered on the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets, and the offer of salvation to all who believe (<a href="/acts/13-38.htm">Acts 13:38-39</a>). His preaching was rooted in the Hebrew Scriptures, showing that Jesus was the promised Messiah. The contradiction by the Jews highlights the tension between the old covenant, based on the Law, and the new covenant, based on grace through faith in Christ (<a href="/romans/10-4.htm">Romans 10:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A key figure in the early Christian church, Paul was a missionary and apostle who spread the Gospel to the Gentiles.
