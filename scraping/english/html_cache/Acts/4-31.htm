The apostles and early believers often gathered for prayer, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a> and <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>. This communal prayer underscores the unity and faith of the early Christians, who sought divine intervention in the face of persecution. The act of praying together also reflects Jewish traditions of communal prayer, which were integral to worship and community life.<p><b>their meeting place was shaken</b><br>The physical shaking of the meeting place is reminiscent of God's presence in the Old Testament, such as at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>). It signifies divine approval and the power of God manifesting in response to prayer. This event parallels the shaking of the earth at Jesus' crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>) and resurrection (<a href="/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2</a>), symbolizing God's active involvement in the unfolding of salvation history.<p><b>and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit</b><br>The filling of the Holy Spirit is a recurring event in Acts, first occurring at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>). This filling empowers believers for ministry and bold proclamation of the gospel. It fulfills Jesus' promise in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> that the disciples would receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon them. The Holy Spirit's role is central in the book of Acts, guiding, empowering, and sustaining the early church.<p><b>and spoke the word of God boldly</b><br>Boldness in speaking the word of God is a hallmark of the apostles' ministry, as seen in <a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a> and <a href="/acts/9-27.htm">Acts 9:27-28</a>. This boldness is a direct result of the Holy Spirit's empowerment, enabling the apostles to preach despite threats and opposition. The phrase emphasizes the transformative power of the Holy Spirit, turning ordinary men into fearless witnesses of Christ. This bold proclamation fulfills the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and is a testament to the truth and urgency of the gospel message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles_and_early_believers.htm">The Apostles and Early Believers</a></b><br>The primary individuals involved in this passage are the apostles and the early Christian community.

Earlier the believers &#8220;devoted themselves to prayer&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>), and again they gather with one voice after Peter and John report the Sanhedrin&#8217;s threats (<a href="/acts/4-23.htm">Acts 4:23-24</a>). Prayer here is:<p>&#8226; Unified&#8212;&#8220;with one accord&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture-saturated&#8212;they cite <a href="/bsb/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a> in their request (<a href="/acts/4-25.htm">Acts 4:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; Mission-focused&#8212;they ask not for comfort but for boldness (<a href="/acts/4-29.htm">Acts 4:29</a>).<p>God consistently responds to such prayer: compare Elijah calling down fire in <a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36-38</a> and the church&#8217;s later intercession for Peter in <a href="/acts/12-5.htm">Acts 12:5-11</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>their meeting place was shaken</b><p>The literal physical shaking signals God&#8217;s immediate, tangible response. Similar manifestations mark decisive divine encounters: Mount Sinai &#8220;trembled violently&#8221; when the Lord descended (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>), Isaiah saw the temple thresholds shake (<a href="/isaiah/6-4.htm">Isaiah 6:4</a>), and an earthquake freed Paul and Silas while they prayed and sang hymns (<a href="/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25-26</a>). Here, the trembling room underscores that the Sovereign Lord they just addressed (<a href="/acts/4-24.htm">Acts 4:24</a>) is present and active, authenticating their mission.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit</b><p>This is a fresh filling, not a first coming; many present had already received the Spirit at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>). Scripture shows repeated fillings for empowered service (<a href="/acts/9-17.htm">Acts 9:17</a>; 13:9), echoing the call &#8220;be filled with the Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>). God supplies exactly what they requested in <a href="/acts/4-29.htm">Acts 4:29</a>: divine enablement to continue His work. The filling produces immediate, observable fruit, just as in <a href="/luke/1-41.htm">Luke 1:41-42</a> when Elizabeth erupted in Spirit-inspired praise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and spoke the word of God boldly</b><p>Boldness (parr&#275;sia) is fearless, Spirit-given freedom to declare truth. Earlier the council &#8220;recognized that they had been with Jesus&#8221; because of this very boldness (<a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>). Now, despite fresh threats, they proclaim without hesitation&#8212;fulfilling <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, &#8220;you will receive power&#8230; and you will be My witnesses.&#8221; The pattern runs through Acts: Paul and Barnabas &#8220;spoke boldly for the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/acts/14-3.htm">Acts 14:3</a>), and Paul in Rome kept &#8220;preaching the kingdom of God with all boldness&#8221; (<a href="/acts/28-31.htm">Acts 28:31</a>). Bold speech is the natural overflow of Spirit-filled hearts (<a href="/2_timothy/1-7.htm">2 Timothy 1:7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a> portrays a seamless sequence: unified prayer, divine confirmation, Spirit empowerment, and fearless proclamation. God answers a faith-filled petition by shaking the room, filling every believer afresh, and propelling them to speak His word with courage. The verse assures us that when God&#8217;s people pray according to His will and rely on His Spirit, He supplies real power to advance the gospel, no matter the opposition.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">The place was shaken</span>. . . .--The impression on the senses was so far a renewal of the wonder of the Day of Pentecost, but in this instance without the sign of the tongues of fire, which were the symbols of a gift imparted once for all, and, perhaps also, without the special marvel of the utterance of the tongues. The disciples felt the power of the Spirit, the evidence of sense confirming that of inward, spiritual consciousness, and it came in the form for which they had made a special supplication, the power to speak with boldness the word which they were commissioned to speak.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> <span class="accented">- Wherein they were gathered</span> for <span class="accented">when they were assembled</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">When they had prayed</span>.
