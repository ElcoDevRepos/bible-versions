It suggests a divine orchestration of events, emphasizing that the unfolding of these events was not random but part of a predetermined plan. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and providence, where He works through history to achieve His purposes.<p><b>God has fulfilled</b><br>The fulfillment of God's promises is a central theme in Scripture, highlighting His faithfulness and reliability. This phrase underscores the idea that what was promised in the past has now come to fruition. It reflects the biblical narrative of God&#8217;s redemptive plan, which is consistently fulfilled throughout history, as seen in the fulfillment of prophecies concerning Jesus Christ.<p><b>what He foretold through all the prophets</b><br>The prophets of the Old Testament, such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Daniel, spoke of the coming Messiah and the salvation He would bring. This phrase emphasizes the continuity and consistency of God's message throughout the Scriptures. It also highlights the role of prophecy in validating Jesus as the Messiah, as these prophecies were given centuries before His birth and were fulfilled in His life, death, and resurrection.<p><b>saying that His Christ</b><br>The term "Christ" is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew "Messiah," meaning "Anointed One." This title signifies Jesus' divine appointment and mission. The use of "His Christ" indicates possession, emphasizing that Jesus is the one chosen and sent by God. This connects to the messianic expectations found in the Old Testament, where the Messiah is depicted as a deliverer and king.<p><b>would suffer</b><br>The suffering of the Messiah was a concept that was difficult for many to accept, as the prevailing expectation was for a triumphant, conquering king. However, passages like <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> vividly describe the suffering servant, who would bear the sins of many. This suffering was necessary for the atonement of sin, fulfilling the sacrificial system established in the Old Testament and pointing to Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice. This phrase highlights the paradox of the Messiah's mission, where victory is achieved through suffering and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign deity who orchestrates the fulfillment of prophecy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Messengers of God who foretold the coming and suffering of the Messiah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ (Messiah)</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus, the anointed one, who fulfills the prophecies through His suffering.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle speaking in this passage, addressing the crowd after healing a lame man.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events and Peter's speech take place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>God's plan is sovereign and unfolds according to His divine will.
