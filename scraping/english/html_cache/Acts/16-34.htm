In the cultural context of the Roman Empire, inviting someone into one's home was a significant gesture of friendship and acceptance. The jailer's actions demonstrate a radical change in his heart, moving from a position of authority and potential hostility to one of fellowship and care. This act of hospitality is reminiscent of the early Christian practice of sharing meals and fellowship, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>, where believers broke bread in their homes with glad and sincere hearts.<p><b>and set a meal before them.</b><br>Providing a meal was a customary way to show honor and welcome guests. In the ancient Near East, sharing a meal was more than just eating together; it was a sign of peace and reconciliation. This act by the jailer signifies his newfound faith and the breaking down of barriers between him and Paul and Silas. It echoes the Last Supper, where Jesus shared a meal with His disciples, symbolizing unity and the new covenant (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19-20</a>).<p><b>So he and all his household rejoiced</b><br>The joy experienced by the jailer and his household is a common theme in the New Testament, where salvation and the acceptance of the Gospel bring about profound joy. This joy is not just an emotional response but a deep-seated assurance of salvation and the presence of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>, where joy is listed as a fruit of the Spirit. The inclusion of the entire household suggests the communal nature of faith in the early church, where families often came to faith together.<p><b>that they had come to believe in God.</b><br>The belief in God here is a direct result of the miraculous events and the testimony of Paul and Silas. This belief is not merely intellectual assent but a transformative faith that leads to action, as evidenced by the jailer's immediate baptism and change in behavior. This conversion experience aligns with the broader biblical narrative of God calling individuals and families to Himself, as seen in the story of Cornelius in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>. The phrase underscores the fulfillment of the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), as the Gospel reaches the Gentiles and transforms lives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jailer.htm">The Jailer</a></b><br>A Roman jailer responsible for Paul and Silas, who experiences a dramatic conversion after witnessing their faith and the miraculous events in the prison.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_silas.htm">Paul and Silas</a></b><br>Apostles of Jesus Christ, imprisoned for preaching the Gospel.

This reflects the immediate fruit of salvation&#8212;practical love (<a href="/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly links genuine faith with hospitality: Abraham welcomed strangers (<a href="/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1-8</a>), Lydia opened her home earlier in the same chapter (<a href="/acts/16-15.htm">Acts 16:15</a>), and believers are urged to &#8220;show hospitality without complaining&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/4-9.htm">1 Peter 4:9</a>).<p>&#8226; By inviting these missionaries inside, the jailer publicly aligns himself with the men he had once guarded, echoing Zacchaeus who &#8220;welcomed Him joyfully&#8221; (<a href="/luke/19-6.htm">Luke 19:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and set a meal before them</b><p>&#8226; A shared table says, &#8220;We&#8217;re now family.&#8221; In the early church &#8220;they broke bread from house to house and shared their food with glad and sincere hearts&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus often revealed grace around meals&#8212;feeding the multitudes (<a href="/matthew/14-19.htm">Matthew 14:19-20</a>), dining with tax collectors (<a href="/luke/5-29.htm">Luke 5:29-32</a>), and serving breakfast after the resurrection (<a href="/john/21-12.htm">John 21:12-13</a>). The jailer follows that pattern: faith expresses itself in tangible service.<p>&#8226; A meal also signals rest; the night&#8217;s chaos (earthquake, chains falling) gives way to peace reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, &#8220;You prepare a table before me&#8230;&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So he and all his household rejoiced</b><p>&#8226; Salvation is contagious; one man&#8217;s conversion ripples through everyone under his roof, just as Cornelius&#8217; household believed together (<a href="/acts/10-24.htm">Acts 10:24, 44</a>-48).<p>&#8226; Joy is the hallmark of new life: &#8220;There is joy in the presence of God&#8217;s angels over one sinner who repents&#8221; (<a href="/luke/15-10.htm">Luke 15:10</a>). The household&#8217;s rejoicing mirrors the Ethiopian eunuch who &#8220;went on his way rejoicing&#8221; (<a href="/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39</a>).<p>&#8226; Family unity in worship fulfills <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>, &#8220;As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that they had come to believe in God</b><p>&#8226; Luke ties the rejoicing directly to belief, not to the earthquake or miraculous release.

Everyone under that roof personally embraced Christ; no one rode on the jailer&#8217;s coattails.<p>&#8226; Their belief turns a night of fear into a celebration, embodying <a href="/psalms/126-3.htm">Psalm 126:3</a>, &#8220;The LORD has done great things for us; we are filled with joy.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/16-34.htm">Acts 16:34</a> pictures the immediate, transformative impact of faith in Christ. The jailer&#8217;s new heart opens his home, sets a welcoming table, and overflows with family-wide joy because they now belong to God. Hospitality, service, and shared rejoicing flow naturally from a household that has come to believe, proving that when Jesus enters a life&#8212;or a family&#8212;He brings both salvation and unmistakable gladness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">He set meat before them, and rejoiced.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">set a table before them.</span> The two sufferers may well have needed food. If the tumult had begun, as is probable, as they were going to the <span class= "ital">proseuclia</span> for morning prayer, at the third hour of the day (9 A.M.), they had probably been fasting for nearly twenty-four hours. They were not likely to have made a meal when they were thrust into the dungeon. The "joy" of the meal reminds us of that noted as a chief feature of the social life of the disciples at Jerusalem in <a href="/acts/2-46.htm" title="And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,">Acts 2:46</a>. The new hope, succeeding to the blank despair, brought with it what we may well describe as a new "joy in the Holy Ghost" (<a href="/romans/14-17.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.">Romans 14:17</a>). The absence of the specific term of "breaking bread" excludes the idea of its having been, in the later sense of the term, an eucharistic feast; and St. Paul would probably have hesitated to admit the new convert to the Supper of the Lord without further instruction, such as we find in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/10-15.htm" title="I speak as to wise men; judge you what I say.">1Corinthians 10:15-17</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.">1Corinthians 11:20-34</a>; but the meal at which the teachers and the disciples, so strangely brought together, now sat down may, at any rate, be thought of as an <span class= "ital">agape </span>or "feast of charity." (See Note on <a href="/jude/1-12.htm" title="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> <span class="accented">- He brought them up</span>... <span class="accented">and set</span> for <span class="accented">when he had brought them</span>... <span class="accented">he set</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">rejoiced greatly</span> for <span class="accented">rejoiced</span>, A.V.
