The preaching of the gospel signifies the core mission of Paul and Barnabas, emphasizing the spread of the message of Jesus Christ. This act of preaching is consistent with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus instructed His disciples to make disciples of all nations. The focus on preaching highlights the importance of verbal proclamation in the early church's evangelistic efforts.<p><b>and made many disciples.</b><br>The making of disciples indicates not just conversion but also the process of teaching and nurturing new believers in the faith. This aligns with the model of discipleship seen throughout the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to grow in their understanding and practice of the faith (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>). The success in making many disciples in Derbe suggests a receptive audience and the effective work of the Holy Spirit in opening hearts to the gospel message.<p><b>Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,</b><br>The return to these cities&#8212;Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch of Pisidia&#8212;demonstrates the commitment of Paul and Barnabas to strengthen and encourage the new believers. These cities were part of their earlier missionary journey (Acts 13-14), and returning to them shows the importance of follow-up and discipleship. Lystra is notable for being the place where Paul was stoned and left for dead (<a href="/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a>), yet he courageously returns, exemplifying perseverance in the face of persecution. Iconium and Antioch were also places of significant opposition, yet they were crucial centers for the early church.

Their message in Derbe would have echoed Peter&#8217;s earlier proclamation&#8212;&#8220;Christ died for our sins &#8230; He was buried &#8230; He was raised on the third day&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3&#8211;4</a>). Notice three markers of their ministry:<p>&#8226; Bold proclamation&#8212;They did not dilute the message despite recent stoning (<a href="/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a>); courage rests in the Spirit, not circumstance (<a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Clear focus&#8212;The same good news announced in <a href="/acts/13-32.htm">Acts 13:32</a> is now delivered in a fresh city. Luke highlights continuity with Jesus&#8217; promise that &#8220;repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in His name to all nations&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-47.htm">Luke 24:47</a>).<p>&#8226; Localized engagement&#8212;They preached &#8220;to that city,&#8221; meeting real people in a real place. Acts repeatedly shows the gospel entering specific contexts (<a href="/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4&#8211;8, 10</a>:34&#8211;48), reminding us that evangelism is never abstract.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and made many disciples</b><p>Luke does not say they collected decisions; he says &#8220;disciples.&#8221; This fulfills Christ&#8217;s commission: &#8220;Go therefore and make disciples of all nations&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19&#8211;20</a>). A disciple is a life-learner who abides in Jesus&#8217; word (<a href="/john/8-31.htm">John 8:31</a>). Evidence of genuine disciple-making appears here:<p>&#8226; Multiplication&#8212;Not a few but &#8220;many.&#8221; Just as believers were first called disciples in Antioch (<a href="/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>), Derbe now becomes another training ground for followers, showing the gospel&#8217;s power to multiply even after hardship.<p>&#8226; Ongoing teaching&#8212;Paul later writes, &#8220;The things you have heard from me &#8230; entrust to faithful men who will be qualified to teach others&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>). The pattern begins in Derbe: truth is passed, not merely professed.<p>&#8226; Visible fruit&#8212;Discipleship implies transformed behavior (<a href="/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8</a>). Though Luke doesn&#8217;t list every change, the simple report that &#8220;many&#8221; were formed points to Spirit-borne growth (<a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41&#8211;42</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch</b><p>Instead of pressing on to unreached territory, the missionaries backtracked through places that had just tried to crush them. Their return reveals shepherd hearts and a biblical strategy of strengthening:<p>&#8226; Confirming the saints&#8212;In the very next verse they are &#8220;strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith&#8221; (<a href="/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>). Believers need reinforcement after initial conversion, a theme echoed when Paul later says, &#8220;Let us go back and visit the brothers in every city&#8221; (<a href="/acts/15-36.htm">Acts 15:36</a>).<p>&#8226; Preparing for tribulation&#8212;They teach, &#8220;We must endure many hardships to enter the kingdom of God&#8221; (<a href="/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>). This realistic encouragement mirrors Jesus&#8217; own warning in <a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>.<p>&#8226; Appointing leadership&#8212;<a href="/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a> notes the installation of elders.

Courage and pastoral concern walk together.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/14-21.htm">Acts 14:21</a> captures a full-orbed cycle of gospel ministry. Paul and Barnabas evangelize boldly, disciple deeply, and shepherd faithfully&#8212;even at personal risk. The verse calls modern believers to the same pattern: announce the saving work of Christ, invest in growing disciples, and nurture young churches until they stand firm in faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">And had taught many</span>.--Better, <span class= "ital">made many disciples.</span> The word is the same as in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a>.
