This was a strategic approach, as synagogues were centers of Jewish worship and learning, and Paul, being a Pharisee and well-versed in the Scriptures, could engage with the Jewish audience on common ground. This practice is consistent with his statement in <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>, where he expresses his commitment to preach "first to the Jew, then to the Gentile." The synagogue in Ephesus, where this event takes place, was a significant location due to Ephesus's status as a major city in Asia Minor, known for its diverse population and religious pluralism.<p><b>and spoke boldly there for three months</b><br>Paul's boldness in speaking is a recurring theme in Acts, reflecting the empowerment of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>). His ability to speak boldly for an extended period indicates both his commitment and the initial receptivity of the audience. The duration of three months suggests a significant opportunity for teaching and discussion, allowing Paul to lay a strong foundation for the believers in Ephesus. This period of bold proclamation is reminiscent of the prophets in the Old Testament, who spoke with authority and conviction.<p><b>arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God</b><br>Paul's message centered on the kingdom of God, a theme that is central to Jesus' own teaching (<a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>). The kingdom of God refers to God's sovereign rule and the fulfillment of His promises through Jesus Christ. Paul's persuasive arguments would have included the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, and the implications of these events for both Jews and Gentiles. His approach was likely apologetic, addressing objections and misconceptions about Jesus as the Messiah. This method of reasoning is similar to his approach in other cities, such as Thessalonica (<a href="/acts/17-2.htm">Acts 17:2-3</a>), where he reasoned from the Scriptures to prove that Jesus was the Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle and missionary who is central to the spread of Christianity in the first century.
