The Psalms, a collection of songs and prayers, were often seen as prophetic and authoritative. This reference underscores the belief that the events surrounding Judas Iscariot were foreseen and part of God's divine plan.<p><b>&#8216;May his place be deserted;</b><br>This part of the verse is a quotation from <a href="/psalms/69-25.htm">Psalm 69:25</a>, which is a psalm of lament attributed to David. The psalm speaks of the suffering of the righteous and the judgment of the wicked. In the context of Acts, it is applied to Judas Iscariot, whose betrayal of Jesus led to his downfall. The "place" refers to his position among the apostles, which is now vacant due to his betrayal and subsequent death.<p><b>let there be no one to dwell in it,&#8217;</b><br>This continuation of the quote from <a href="/psalms/69-25.htm">Psalm 69:25</a> emphasizes the desolation and abandonment of Judas's position. It reflects the judgment and consequences of his actions, leaving his role empty and unfulfilled. This desolation is symbolic of the spiritual barrenness that results from turning away from God's purposes.<p><b>and, &#8216;May another take his position.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase is a reference to <a href="/psalms/109-8.htm">Psalm 109:8</a>, another psalm attributed to David, which speaks of the replacement of the wicked. In the context of Acts, it is used to justify the selection of a new apostle to take Judas's place, ensuring the continuity of the Twelve. This replacement is seen as necessary for maintaining the integrity and mission of the apostolic group, which is foundational for the early church. The selection of Matthias as Judas's replacement fulfills this scripture, demonstrating the early church's commitment to scriptural authority and divine guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle who stands up among the believers to address the need to replace Judas Iscariot, referencing the Psalms to justify the decision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>The disciple who betrayed Jesus, leading to his death and the vacancy of his apostolic position.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_book_of_psalms.htm">The Book of Psalms</a></b><br>The Old Testament scripture that Peter quotes to support the need for Judas's replacement.

His purpose in making the quotation is to show that the disciples should not be staggered by the treachery of Judas, and the seeming failure of their hopes. The Psalms had represented the righteous sufferer as the victim of treachery. They had also spoken of the traitor as receiving a righteous punishment such as had now fallen upon Judas. No strange thing had happened. What had been of old was typical of what they had heard or known. We need not in this place discuss either the historical occasions of the Psalms cited, or the ethical difficulties presented by their imprecations of evil. Neither comes, so to speak, within the horizon of St. Peter's thoughts. It was enough for him to note the striking parallelism which they presented to what was fresh in his memory, and to believe that it was not accidental.<p><span class= "bld">His bishoprick let another take.</span>--Better, as in <a href="/psalms/109-8.htm" title="Let his days be few; and let another take his office.">Psalm 109:8</a>, <span class= "ital">let another take his office.</span> The Greek word is <span class= "ital">episcope, </span>which, as meaning an office like that of the <span class= "ital">episcopos, </span>is, of course, in one sense, rightly translated by "bishoprick." The latter term is, however, so surrounded by associations foreign to the apostolic age that it is better to use the more general, and, therefore, neutral, term of the English version of the Psalm. The use of "bishoprick" may be noted as an instance of the tendency of the revisers of 1611 to maintain the use of "bishop" and the like where the office seemed to be placed on a high level (as here and in <a href="/1_peter/2-25.htm" title="For you were as sheep going astray; but are now returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.">1Peter 2:25</a>), while they use "overseer" and "oversight" (as in <a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>, and <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm" title="Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;">1Peter 5:2</a>) where it is identified with the functions of the elders or presbyters of the Church.

Bishop</span> being the English transliteration of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">bishopric</span> is, of course, the literal rendering of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;</span>; if taken in its wider and more general sense, as in the well-known work of Archdeacon Evans? "the bishopric of souls." This same office is called a <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (a deaconship), and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span> (an apostleship) in vers. 17 and 25. So St. Paul cells himself <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (a minister) in <a href="/ephesians/3-7.htm">Ephesians 3:7</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23, 25</a>, etc. So the presbyters of the Church are called bishops (<a href="/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17, 28</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-1.htm">1 Timothy 1:1, 2</a>. etc.). The ecclesiastical names for the different offices in the Church only acquired their distinctive use later, and by the gradual growth of custom.
