The synagogue was a central place of worship and community for Jews, and it was customary for visiting teachers to speak. This setting highlights the Jewish roots of Christianity and the initial focus on reaching the Jewish population with the Gospel. The synagogue served as a strategic location for spreading the message of Jesus, as it gathered those familiar with the Scriptures.<p><b>the people urged them</b><br>The response of the people indicates a strong interest and openness to the message Paul and Barnabas shared. This eagerness reflects the spiritual hunger and anticipation among the Jewish and God-fearing Gentile audience. It also suggests that the message resonated with their understanding of the Scriptures and the hope of the Messiah.<p><b>to continue this message</b><br>The message referred to is the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which Paul and Barnabas were proclaiming. This message included the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, and the offer of salvation to all who believe. The request to continue indicates that the message was both compelling and challenging, prompting further exploration and discussion.<p><b>on the next Sabbath</b><br>The Sabbath, observed from Friday evening to Saturday evening, was a day of rest and worship for the Jewish people. The request to hear more on the next Sabbath shows the structured nature of Jewish worship and the importance of the Sabbath as a time for teaching and learning. It also underscores the continuity between the Jewish faith and the emerging Christian faith, as the early church initially met on the Sabbath before transitioning to Sunday worship in honor of the resurrection of Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>Formerly known as Saul, Paul is a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and epistles.

The immediate departure shows the missionaries were never seeking personal honor; once the gospel was proclaimed, they moved along, trusting God to work.<p>&#8226; This pattern repeats throughout the journey: &#8220;After they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia&#8221; (<a href="/acts/14-25.htm">Acts 14:25</a>). The messengers keep moving, but the message remains.<p>&#8226; Their exit also underscores that faith is not tied to a personality. As in <a href="/john/3-30.htm">John 3:30</a>, &#8220;He must increase; I must decrease,&#8221; the focus stays on Christ, not the preachers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the synagogue</b><p>&#8226; Paul consistently begins with the synagogue (<a href="/acts/17-2.htm">Acts 17:2</a>; <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). He respects God&#8217;s covenant order: the gospel is &#8220;to the Jew first.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The synagogue offers Scripture-literate listeners who can test Paul&#8217;s words against the Law and Prophets&#8212;exactly what he wants (<a href="/acts/13-27.htm">Acts 13:27</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s design for this setting becomes clear when later Gentiles in Antioch eagerly hear the same message (<a href="/acts/13-48.htm">Acts 13:48</a>). By starting in the synagogue, the gospel bridge is built for everyone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the people</b><p>&#8226; Not just the rulers, but the whole congregation is stirred. Faithful proclamation reaches beyond official leaders to ordinary hearers, as seen when &#8220;many of the Corinthians who heard believed&#8221; (<a href="/acts/18-8.htm">Acts 18:8</a>).<p>&#8226; This crowd&#8217;s responsiveness fulfills <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>&#8212;God&#8217;s word &#8220;will not return to Me empty.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Their openness contrasts with later hostility (<a href="/acts/13-45.htm">Acts 13:45</a>), reminding us that initial enthusiasm must mature into rooted faith (<a href="/matthew/13-20.htm">Matthew 13:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>urged them</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Urged&#8221; shows genuine hunger. The Spirit is drawing hearts, just as Lydia&#8217;s heart is opened in <a href="/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14</a>.<p>&#8226; Gospel hearing leads naturally to a desire for more. When Jesus finished teaching on the Mount, &#8220;the crowds were astonished&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28</a>), and many followed Him.<p>&#8226; The missionaries&#8217; willingness to stay and teach models pastoral care: shepherds feed sheep who ask for nourishment (<a href="/john/21-17.htm">John 21:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to continue this message</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;message&#8221; is the good news of forgiveness through Jesus (<a href="/acts/13-38.htm">Acts 13:38-39</a>). The listeners know it is too weighty to absorb in one sitting.<p>&#8226; Continuity matters. Truth taught once must be reinforced (<a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; By requesting more, the people demonstrate a Berean-like spirit (<a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>), eager to examine Scripture daily.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the next Sabbath</b><p>&#8226; Waiting a week respects the synagogue calendar while building anticipation. God often uses intervals to deepen desire (<a href="/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The chosen timing hints at the gospel&#8217;s unfolding from Old Covenant rhythms into New Covenant fulfillment&#8212;each Sabbath now points to the rest found in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Meanwhile, word spreads. By the next Sabbath, &#8220;almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-44.htm">Acts 13:44</a>), evidencing that sincere seekers become effective witnesses.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/13-42.htm">Acts 13:42</a> captures a pivotal moment: faithful preaching sparks genuine hunger. Paul and Barnabas, content to leave the spotlight, exit the synagogue, yet the message remains center stage. Ordinary listeners, moved by the Spirit, urgently request more teaching, positioning themselves for deeper revelation the following Sabbath. The verse reminds us that when Scripture is proclaimed plainly and boldly, God Himself creates the desire for its continuation, ensuring His word advances from week to week and heart to heart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(42) <span class= "bld">And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue.</span>--The better MSS. give simply, <span class= "ital">as they were going out, </span>the Received text being apparently an explanatory interpretation.

The participle implies that they stopped as they passed out, to request the Apostle to resume his teaching on the following Sabbath.
