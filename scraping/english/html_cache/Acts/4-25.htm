The Holy Spirit is seen as the third person of the Trinity, actively involved in guiding and revealing God's truth to humanity. This aligns with <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>, which states that prophecy never had its origin in human will, but prophets spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.<p><b>through the mouth of Your servant,</b><br>The term "servant" reflects a position of humility and obedience to God. In biblical context, a servant of God is someone chosen to fulfill His purposes. This is consistent with the role of prophets and leaders in the Old Testament, who were often referred to as servants of God, such as Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-5.htm">Deuteronomy 34:5</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>).<p><b>our father David:</b><br>David is a central figure in the history of Israel, known as a king, warrior, and psalmist. He is considered a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>) and is a key ancestor in the lineage of Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>). David's role as a prophet is highlighted here, as he is credited with writing many of the Psalms, which are seen as both worship and prophecy.<p><b>&#8216;Why do the nations rage</b><br>This phrase is a direct quotation from <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1</a>, a messianic psalm that speaks of the futility of opposing God's anointed. The "nations" refers to the Gentile powers and rulers who resist God's authority. Historically, this reflects the political turmoil and opposition faced by Israel from surrounding nations, and prophetically, it points to the opposition against Christ and His kingdom.<p><b>and the peoples plot in vain?</b><br>The futility of human schemes against God's sovereign plan is underscored here. Despite the plotting and rebellion of the peoples, God's purposes will prevail. This is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in stories like the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>) and the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom in <a href="/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19-21</a>.
