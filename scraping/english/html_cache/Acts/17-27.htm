The idea that God desires humanity to seek Him is rooted in the biblical narrative, beginning with the creation of man in Genesis. The fall of man introduced a separation from God, but throughout Scripture, God consistently calls His people to return to Him. This seeking is not merely a passive acknowledgment but an active pursuit, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a>, where it is stated that if you seek the Lord with all your heart and soul, you will find Him. The intention of God is that all nations and peoples would come to know Him, as reflected in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<p><b>and perhaps reach out for Him</b><br>The imagery of reaching out suggests a groping or feeling after God, akin to a blind person searching for something in the dark. This reflects the spiritual blindness of humanity due to sin, as described in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>. Despite this blindness, God has made Himself known through His creation (<a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>) and through His Word. The use of "perhaps" indicates human free will and the possibility of rejection, yet it also underscores God's grace in making Himself accessible. This reaching out is an act of faith, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>, which states that God rewards those who earnestly seek Him.<p><b>and find Him</b><br>Finding God is the culmination of the seeking and reaching out process. This is not merely an intellectual discovery but a relational encounter with the living God. <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a> promises that those who seek God with all their heart will find Him. The assurance of finding God is rooted in His faithfulness and desire for relationship with His creation. This finding is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is the way, the truth, and the life (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). Through Christ, believers have direct access to God, as emphasized in <a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>.<p><b>though He is not far from each one of us</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the immanence of God, contrasting with the deistic view that God is distant and uninvolved. God's nearness is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/145-18.htm">Psalm 145:18</a>, which states that the Lord is near to all who call on Him. Theologically, this reflects the omnipresence of God, who is present in all places and times. Culturally, this would have been a radical concept for the Athenians, who were accustomed to gods who were distant and capricious. The nearness of God is also a comfort to believers, assuring them of His constant presence and support, as promised in <a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Paul is addressing the people of Athens at the Areopagus, sharing the message of the one true God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/athens.htm">Athens</a></b><br>A city known for its rich history in philosophy and religion, where Paul delivers his sermon to a diverse audience of thinkers and seekers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/areopagus.htm">Areopagus</a></b><br>A prominent rock outcropping in Athens, serving as a meeting place for the council and a venue for philosophical discussions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_athenians.htm">The Athenians</a></b><br>The audience of Paul's sermon, consisting of philosophers, scholars, and citizens interested in new teachings and ideas.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unknown_god.htm">The Unknown God</a></b><br>Paul uses the Athenians' altar to an "unknown god" as a starting point to introduce them to the God of the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_accessibility.htm">God's Accessibility</a></b><br>God is not distant or unreachable; He is near to each of us, inviting us to seek and find Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universal_call_to_seek_god.htm">The Universal Call to Seek God</a></b><br>Every person, regardless of background or belief, is called to seek God.

And in the LXX. of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a> we read, <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f60;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "Thou shall grope at noonday as the blind gropeth in darkness." The teaching, therefore, of the passage is that, though God was very near to every man, and had not left himself without abundant witness in his manifold gifts, yet, through the blindness of the heathen, they had to feel their way uncertainly toward God. In this fact lies the need of a revelation, as it follows ver. 30, etc. And hence part at least of the significance of such passages as, "Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord" (<a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8</a>); "Who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a> ); "God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>), and many more like passages. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/17-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[ God intended that ] they would seek</span><br /><span class="grk">&#950;&#951;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#275;tein)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Infinitive Active<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2212.htm">Strong's 2212: </a> </span><span class="str2">To seek, search for, desire, require, demand.
