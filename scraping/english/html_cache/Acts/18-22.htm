It served as the Roman administrative capital of Judea. This location was a hub for travel and trade, making it a strategic point for Paul's missionary journeys. The city's archaeological remains, including the theater and aqueduct, highlight its importance and grandeur during the Roman period. Paul's arrival here marks the end of his second missionary journey, emphasizing the spread of the Gospel through key urban centers.<p><b>he went up and greeted the church at Jerusalem</b><br>The phrase "went up" reflects the geographical elevation of Jerusalem, which is situated on a plateau in the Judean mountains. Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship and the early Christian church. Paul's visit to the church here underscores his connection and accountability to the apostles and elders, maintaining unity and doctrinal consistency. This visit likely involved reporting on his missionary activities and receiving guidance or support for future endeavors. Jerusalem's significance is rooted in its history as the city of David and the location of the Temple, central to Jewish and early Christian identity.<p><b>Then he went down to Antioch</b><br>Antioch in Syria was a major center for early Christianity and the base for Paul's missionary journeys. The phrase "went down" indicates the descent from the higher elevation of Jerusalem to the lower elevation of Antioch. This city was known for its diverse population and was the place where followers of Jesus were first called "Christians" (<a href="/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>). Antioch served as a launching point for Paul's missions, highlighting its role as a vibrant and influential church community. The return to Antioch signifies a period of rest and preparation for future missions, reflecting the cyclical nature of Paul's ministry work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is central to this passage.

In three brief clauses, Scripture grounds missionary zeal in real geography, shared fellowship, and a sending church&#8212;inviting us to embrace the same pattern today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">And when he had landed at Caesarea.</span>--It is obvious that a great deal is covered by the short record of this verse. In the absence of any <span class= "ital">data</span> in the Acts for settling the question, we may possibly refer to some casualty in this voyage, one of the three shipwrecks of <a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm" title="Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;">2Corinthians 11:25</a>. At Caesarea, we may believe, he would probably renew his intercourse with Philip the Evangelist. At Jerusalem there would be the usual gathering of the Church, the completion of his Nazarite vow in the Temple, a friendly welcome on the part of St. James and the elders of the Church. Peter was probably at Antioch (<a href="/galatians/2-11.htm" title="But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.">Galatians 2:11</a>), or possibly at Babylon (<a href="/1_peter/5-13.htm" title="The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you; and so does Marcus my son.">1Peter 5:13</a>). To this visit to Antioch we may probably refer the scene which St. Paul narrates in <a href="/context/galatians/2-11.htm" title="But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.">Galatians 2:11-14</a>. His long absence from Antioch had left the Judaising party time to gather strength and organise a new attack on the freedom of the Gentiles, and they brought a fresh pressure to bear upon the element of instability which still lingered in St. Peter's character, and he had not been able to resist it. It is, however, possible that the incident may have occurred before Paul and Silas had left Antioch. (See Note on <a href="/context/acts/15-39.htm" title="And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed to Cyprus;">Acts 15:39-40</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - He <span class="accented">went up</span> for <span class="accented">and gone up</span>, A. g.; <span class="accented">and went</span> for he <span class="accented">went</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">When he had landed at Caesarea</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. Caesarea</span> Stratonis, or Sebaste, or <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, as it was variously called, to distinguish it from Caesarea Philippi (see <a href="/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>; <a href="/acts/9-30.htm">Acts 9:30</a>; <a href="/acts/10-1.htm">Acts 10:1</a>, etc., and frequently elsewhere in the Acts). "Caesarea, whither probably the vessel was bound, was the military capital of the Roman province of Judea, of which Felix was at this time procurator. It was also the harbor by which all travelers from the West approached it, and from whence roads led to Egypt on the south, to Tyre and Sidon and Antioch on the north, and eastward to Nablous and Jerusalem and the Jordan" (Howson, 1:455). <span class="cmt_word">He went up and saluted the Church</span>; meaning, without any doubt, he went up to Jerusalem, as both the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span>, and the object of his-going up, "to salute the Church," conclusively show.
