Saul's removal signifies a divine intervention in the leadership of Israel, emphasizing God's sovereignty in appointing and deposing kings. This act underscores the importance of obedience to God&#8217;s will, a recurring theme in the Old Testament.<p><b>He raised up David as their king</b><br>David's anointing as king is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, marking the transition from Saul's failed monarchy to a dynasty that would be characterized by a heart aligned with God. David was chosen by God and anointed by the prophet Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>). This choice highlights God's preference for inner character over outward appearance, as David was initially overlooked by his own family.<p><b>and testified about him</b><br>God's testimony about David is significant, as it reflects divine approval and endorsement. This divine testimony is recorded in <a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14 and 16</a>:7, where God emphasizes David's heart and character. It serves as a reminder that God sees beyond human limitations and recognizes the potential for faithfulness and leadership.<p><b>&#8216;I have found David son of Jesse</b><br>David's identification as the son of Jesse roots him in the tribe of Judah, fulfilling Jacob's prophecy that the scepter would not depart from Judah (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). This lineage is crucial for the messianic prophecies, as Jesus Christ is later identified as a descendant of David (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>). David's humble beginnings as a shepherd boy contrast with his future role as king, illustrating God's ability to elevate the lowly.<p><b>a man after My own heart</b><br>This phrase is central to understanding David's unique relationship with God. It indicates a deep alignment with God's values and desires, despite David's human flaws and failures. David's psalms and his repentance after sinning (e.g., <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>) exemplify his sincere devotion and pursuit of God's heart. This characteristic sets David apart and foreshadows the perfect obedience of Jesus Christ.<p><b>he will carry out My will in its entirety</b><br>David's commitment to fulfilling God's will is seen throughout his reign, as he sought to establish a kingdom that honored God. His desire to build a temple (<a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7:1-17</a>) and his efforts to unite the tribes of Israel under God's covenant reflect this dedication. David's life, though imperfect, points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's will through Jesus Christ, who perfectly accomplished the Father's will (<a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

This requires a heart that seeks God earnestly and obeys His commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_will.htm">Obedience to God's Will</a></b><br>David's life exemplifies a commitment to doing God's will.
