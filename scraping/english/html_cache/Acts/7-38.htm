The "assembly in the wilderness" is the congregation of Israel, gathered as a community under God's guidance. The wilderness journey is a significant period in Israel's history, symbolizing a time of testing and reliance on God. It also prefigures the Christian journey of faith, where believers are called to trust in God's provision and guidance.<p><b>with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai</b><br>The angel mentioned here is often understood to be a manifestation of God Himself, as seen in the burning bush encounter (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>). Mount Sinai is a pivotal location where Moses received the Law, establishing the covenant between God and Israel. This event underscores the holiness and authority of God's commandments, which are foundational to both Jewish and Christian faiths. The presence of the angel signifies divine communication and the sacredness of the Law given to Moses.<p><b>and with our fathers</b><br>This phrase connects the audience of Stephen's speech in Acts to their ancestors, emphasizing continuity in God's dealings with Israel. The "fathers" are the patriarchs and leaders of Israel, who experienced God's faithfulness and covenant promises. This connection serves as a reminder of the shared heritage and responsibility to uphold God's commands and teachings.<p><b>And he received living words to pass on to us</b><br>The "living words" refer to the Law and commandments given to Moses, which are described as "living" because they are dynamic, active, and life-giving. These words are not merely historical documents but are intended to guide and shape the lives of God's people. The transmission of these words to subsequent generations highlights the importance of teaching and preserving God's truth. In a Christian context, this can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the living Word, Jesus Christ, who fulfills and embodies the Law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly_in_the_wilderness.htm">The Assembly in the Wilderness</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites gathered during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land.

The word &#8220;assembly&#8221; points back to Israel gathered as God&#8217;s covenant people (<a href="/exodus/12-16.htm">Exodus 12:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/9-10.htm">Deuteronomy 9:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Their location &#8220;in the wilderness&#8221; recalls the forty-year journey after the Exodus (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>). God was not limited to temples or cities; He met His people in a desolate place, providing manna and water (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>; 17:6).<p>&#8226; By starting here, Stephen stresses that genuine worship and obedience are about relationship and faith, not geography (<a href="/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai</b><p>&#8226; Moses was not alone; &#8220;the angel&#8221; accompanied him and delivered God&#8217;s law (<a href="/exodus/19-19.htm">Exodus 19:19-20</a>; 23:20-23). The angel often appears in Scripture as God&#8217;s own messenger, sometimes revealing the LORD&#8217;s very presence (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2-6</a>; <a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Mount Sinai is where God descended in fire and thunder (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-18</a>). Stephen underscores that the law came from heaven, mediated through a heavenly messenger, reinforcing its divine origin (<a href="/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and with our fathers</b><p>&#8226; Moses stood &#8220;with our fathers,&#8221; meaning the forefathers of Israel who had been rescued from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-10.htm">Deuteronomy 29:10-13</a>).<p>&#8226; By linking Moses to &#8220;our fathers,&#8221; Stephen appeals to shared heritage. The same patriarchs the Sanhedrin revered had witnessed God&#8217;s revelation through Moses (<a href="/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2-8</a>).<p>&#8226; This detail confronts his audience: rejecting Moses&#8217; testimony&#8212;or the One to whom Moses pointed&#8212;amounts to rejecting their own spiritual lineage (<a href="/john/5-45.htm">John 5:45-47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He received living words to pass on to us</b><p>&#8226; The commandments, statutes, and promises given to Moses are called &#8220;living words.&#8221; God&#8217;s Word breathes life and remains active (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-46.htm">Deuteronomy 32:46-47</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Stephen&#8217;s phrase &#8220;to pass on to us&#8221; draws a line of continuity from Sinai to his present moment. God&#8217;s revelation was never meant to be hoarded; it was entrusted for every generation (<a href="/psalms/78-5.htm">Psalm 78:5-7</a>; <a href="/romans/15-4.htm">Romans 15:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The ultimate fulfillment of these &#8220;living words&#8221; is found in Christ, the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <a href="/acts/3-22.htm">Acts 3:22-24</a>). To reject Jesus is to turn away from the very life those words convey (<a href="/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63, 68</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a> shows Moses as the God-appointed mediator who stood with Israel in the wilderness, received the law through a heavenly messenger on Mount Sinai, and delivered &#8220;living words&#8221; that still speak today. Stephen uses this verse to affirm the divine origin and enduring authority of Scripture, to connect the audience with their covenant history, and ultimately to point them to Jesus, the fullest expression of God&#8217;s life-giving Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">That was in the church in the wilderness.</span>--The word <span class= "ital">ecclesia</span> is used, as it had been in the LXX. (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-16.htm" title="According to all that you desired of the LORD your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.">Deuteronomy 18:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-1.htm" title="He that is wounded in the stones, or has his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.">Deuteronomy 23:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/26-12.htm" title="My foot stands in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.">Psalm 26:12</a>), for the "congregation" of Israel. Of the earlier versions. Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Genevan, had given "congregation." Even the Rhemish contented itself with "assembly." The translators of 1611, acting on the instructions which were drawn up for their direction, did not see any reason for making this an exception to the rule, and so gave "church." Assuming that <span class= "ital">ecclesia</span> was so rendered elsewhere, it was, it may be admitted, right, as a matter of consistency, that it should be used here, as presenting the thought, which was emphasised in Stephen's speech, that the society of believers in Christ was like, in character and in its relation to God, to that of Israel. The new <span class= "ital">ecclesia</span> was the development of the old. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/16-18.htm" title="And I say also to you, That you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.">Matthew 16:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The lively oracles.</span>--The noun was used by the Greeks for the solemn utterances of the Pythian oracles, and thus came to be used by the LXX. in connection with the Urim and Thummim of the high priest (<a href="/exodus/28-30.htm" title="And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be on Aaron's heart, when he goes in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel on his heart before the LORD continually.">Exodus 28:30</a>), and so for any answer from God (<a href="/numbers/24-4.htm" title="He has said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:">Numbers 24:4</a>). In the New Testament it appears again in <a href="/romans/3-2.htm" title="Much every way: chiefly, because that to them were committed the oracles of God.">Romans 3:2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-12.htm" title="For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.">Hebrews 5:12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-11.htm" title="If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God gives: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever.

(Hebrew for Greek form); <span class="accented">living cracks</span> for <span class="accented">the lively</span> cracks, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">In the church.</span> St. Stephen probably used the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> without any reference to its special meaning, "the Church." It is used in a secular sense in <a href="/acts/19-32.htm">Acts 19:32, 39</a>, and of the congregation of Israel in the LXX. of <a href="/1_chronicles/13-2.htm">1 Chronicles 13:2</a>; 1 Macc. 2:56; Ecclus. 44:15; and elsewhere. In Stephen's time it could hardly have become widely known as the designation of the flock of Christ. On the whole, the marginal rendering, "the congregation," seems best, but with the idea attached that it was the Lord's congregation. <span class="cmt_word">The angel which spake</span>. It may be doubted whether the phrase, "the angel which spake to him in the mount Sinai," refers to the angel spoken of in ver. 30, or to the angel by whose mouth God spake the words of the ten commandments on Mount Sinai, as recorded in <a href="/exodus/20-1.htm">Exodus 20:1-17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-1.htm">Deuteronomy 5:1-22</a>. Chrysostom and most commentators seem to understand it of the angel who gave the Law; but Whitby, not without reason, thinks the reference is to the burning bush. <span class="cmt_word">Living oracles</span>. In like manner, St. Paul calls the Holy Scriptures "the oracles of God" (<a href="/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>), and in <a href="/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a> we read again of "the first principles of the oracles of God," and St. Peter says, "Let him speak as the oracles of God" (<a href="/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>). For the force of the <span class="accented">living</span> or <span class="accented">lively</span> oracles, see <a href="/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23, 25</a>. Stephen magnifies Moses by reminding his hearers how he had received the Law from God to give to the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/7-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[He]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#972;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(houtos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#949;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(genomenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1096.htm">Strong's 1096: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolongation and middle voice form of a primary verb; to cause to be, i.e. to become, used with great latitude.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
