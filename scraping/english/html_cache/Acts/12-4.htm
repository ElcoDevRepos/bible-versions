Herod Agrippa I was the grandson of Herod the Great and ruled Judea from AD 41 to 44. His arrest of Peter was part of a broader persecution of the early church, which included the execution of James, the brother of John. The imprisonment of Peter highlights the growing tension between the early Christians and the Jewish authorities, as well as the Roman rulers who sought to maintain order and appease the Jewish population. The act of imprisonment was a common method to suppress dissent and maintain control.<p><b>handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each</b><br>The use of four squads of four soldiers, totaling sixteen guards, indicates the high level of security and the importance Herod placed on preventing Peter's escape. This level of security was unusual for a single prisoner, suggesting Herod's awareness of Peter's previous miraculous escape from prison (<a href="/acts/5-19.htm">Acts 5:19</a>). The Roman military discipline and organization are evident here, reflecting the seriousness with which Herod viewed the potential threat posed by Peter and the early Christian movement.<p><b>Herod intended to bring him out to the people after the Passover</b><br>Herod's intention to bring Peter out after the Passover reflects his political acumen. The Passover was a significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, drawing large crowds to Jerusalem. By delaying Peter's public trial and potential execution until after the Passover, Herod aimed to maximize the impact of his actions, possibly to gain favor with the Jewish populace who were hostile to the Christian sect. This timing also mirrors the events of Jesus' own arrest and crucifixion, which occurred around the Passover, drawing a parallel between Peter's experience and that of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_agrippa_i.htm">Herod Agrippa I</a></b><br>The king who arrested Peter.
