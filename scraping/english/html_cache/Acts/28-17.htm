The number three often signifies completeness or divine purpose in Scripture, as seen in the resurrection of Christ on the third day (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-4.htm">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>). Paul's quick action reflects his urgency and commitment to his mission.<p><b>he called together the leaders of the Jews</b><br>Paul's initiative to meet with Jewish leaders demonstrates his consistent pattern of reaching out to the Jewish community first (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). This approach aligns with his identity as a Jew and his desire to share the gospel with his own people, despite previous rejections (<a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a>).<p><b>When they had gathered</b><br>The gathering of Jewish leaders suggests a willingness to hear Paul, indicating a level of respect or curiosity about his message. This meeting would have taken place in a private setting, possibly in the house where Paul was under house arrest (<a href="/acts/28-30.htm">Acts 28:30</a>).<p><b>he said to them, &#8220;Brothers</b><br>Paul addresses them as "brothers," emphasizing his shared heritage and identity with the Jewish people. This term of endearment underscores his genuine affection and solidarity with them, despite their differing views on Jesus as the Messiah.<p><b>although I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers</b><br>Paul defends his innocence regarding accusations of violating Jewish law or traditions. This echoes his previous defenses (<a href="/acts/24-14.htm">Acts 24:14-16</a>) and highlights his respect for Jewish customs, even as he preaches the gospel of Christ.<p><b>I was taken prisoner in Jerusalem</b><br>Paul recounts his arrest in Jerusalem, which is detailed in <a href="/acts/21-27.htm">Acts 21:27-36</a>. This event was a pivotal moment in his ministry, leading to his journey to Rome. Jerusalem, as the center of Jewish worship, holds significant historical and religious importance.<p><b>and handed over to the Romans</b><br>This transfer to Roman custody fulfilled Jesus' prophecy about Paul being a witness in Rome (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>).

Those who are described as the "chief" would naturally include the ruler of the synagogue (the title <span class= "ital">Archisynagogus </span>is found in a Jewish inscription from Capua, now in the Lateran Museum); the <span class= "ital">Archontes, </span>or rulers of the people--perhaps another way of describing the Archisynagogi--(this title is found in the Jewish cemetery at Rome already mentioned; Garucci, <span class= "ital">ut supra, p. </span>35); the Scribes (the title <span class= "ital">Grammateus </span>is also found, pp. 42, 47, 55, 59); the <span class= "ital">Gerousiarchai, </span>or heads of the Jewish senate, which was allowed, as at Alexandria, a certain measure of independent jurisdiction (pp. 51, 62); the "fathers of the synagogue," perhaps identical with the "rulers" or "elders," perhaps of a slightly higher grade (p. 52); perhaps, also (for this title also is found), the "mothers of the synagogue," occupying, possibly, a position more or less analogous to the widows and deaconesses of the Christian Church (pp. 52, 53);<span class= "note">[4]</span> those who were known as <span class= "ital">Nomomatheis</span>, or students of the Law (p. 57); the wealthier traders; those who, as freed-men, held office of some kind in the imperial court, or, like the Aliturius mentioned by Josephus (<span class= "ital">Life, </span>c. 3), courted the favour of Poppaea, and gained the praise of Nero by acting in his spectacles. To such a mingled crowd, summoned by a special messenger--or, it may be, by a notice read on the Sabbath in the synagogue, or posted on some wall or pillar in the Jewish quarter--after three days spent, partly in settling in his lodging, partly in the delivery of the summons, St. Paul now addressed himself. These he was seeking to win, if possible, for Christ.<p><span class= "note">[4] Since I wrote the above, I have heard from Dr. A. Edersheim, than whom there is no higher living authority on matters connected with Jewish archaeology, that in his judgment the title of "father" or "mother" of the synagogue did not imply any functions, but was assigned as a mark of honour to its oldest members. He rests this belief on the fact that they are found chiefly, or exclusively, in inscriptions which record a very advanced as 80 or 110.<p>(</span>17<span class= "note">)</span> <span class= "bld">Though I have committed nothing against the people . . .</span>--We note St. Paul's characteristic tact.
