This phrase emphasizes the firsthand nature of their testimony, which is a key element in the early church's proclamation of the gospel. The concept of being a "witness" is rooted in the Jewish legal system, where the testimony of witnesses was crucial for establishing truth (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). The apostles' role as witnesses fulfills Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where He instructs them to be His witnesses in Jerusalem and beyond.<p><b>and so is the Holy Spirit</b><br>The Holy Spirit is presented as a co-witness with the apostles, affirming the truth of their message. This highlights the divine endorsement of their testimony. The Holy Spirit's role as a witness is consistent with Jesus' promise in <a href="/john/15-26.htm">John 15:26</a>, where He says the Spirit of truth will testify about Him. The presence of the Holy Spirit in the early church is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, which speak of God's Spirit being poured out on all people.<p><b>whom God has given to those who obey Him.</b><br>This phrase underscores the conditional aspect of receiving the Holy Spirit, which is linked to obedience to God. In the context of Acts, obedience involves accepting the message of Jesus Christ and following His teachings. The giving of the Holy Spirit is a sign of the new covenant, as prophesied in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, where God promises to put His Spirit within His people to enable them to follow His decrees. This also reflects the transformative power of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers, empowering them to live in accordance with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The primary speakers in this passage, who are testifying about the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the work of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Referred to as a witness alongside the apostles, emphasizing His role in empowering and guiding believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The giver of the Holy Spirit to those who obey Him, highlighting His sovereignty and the divine order of obedience and blessing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanhedrin.htm">The Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The Jewish council before whom the apostles are speaking, representing the religious authority of the time.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of this event, where the early church is growing and facing opposition.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit is not just a passive presence but an active witness to the truth of Jesus Christ.
