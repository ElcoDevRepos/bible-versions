The "seven nations" mentioned are the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>). These nations were known for their idolatry and moral corruption, which is why God commanded their destruction (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4-5</a>). The conquest of these nations fulfilled God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would inherit the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). This event is a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, as He conquers the spiritual enemies of His people.<p><b>He gave their land to His people as an inheritance</b><br>The land of Canaan was given to the Israelites as an inheritance, signifying God's faithfulness to His covenant promises. This inheritance was not earned by the Israelites' own strength or righteousness but was a gift from God (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-5.htm">Deuteronomy 9:5-6</a>). The distribution of the land among the tribes of Israel is detailed in the book of Joshua (Joshua 13-21). This inheritance is a foreshadowing of the spiritual inheritance believers receive through Christ, as mentioned in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>, <a href="/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12</a>).

It is difficult to say what is the meaning of the R.T. in regard to the four hundred and fifty years, what is the terminus a <span class="accented">quo</span> or <span class="accented">ad quem</span> intended by it. The usual explanations of the reading of the R.T. (adopted by Lachman, Bishop Wordsworth, and others) is that the years are dated from the birth of Isaac, and that the meaning is that the promise to give the land to the seed of Abraham was actually performed within four hundred and fifty years (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>) (after the analogy of <a href="/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a>), which gives a good sense and is not at all improbable (see Bishop Wordsworth's note). The reading of the T.R. has grave objections on the score of chronology as well as grammar. Duration of time is expressed by the accusative case, as vers. 18 and 21; the measure of time in which a thing is done by the dative. So that the natural rendering of the T.R. would be that he gave them judges four hundred and fifty years after the entrance into Canaan; which of course cannot be the meaning. The other objection is that, if the times of the judges from the final conquest of the land to the judgeship of Samuel was four hundred and fifty years, the whole time from the Exodus to the building of the temple must have been about six hundred and forty years (37 from death of Moses to Othuiel + 450, + 30 for judgeship of Samuel, + 40 of Saul's reign, + 40 for David's reign, +3 years of Solomon, + and the 40 years in the wilderness), whereas <a href="/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a> gives the time as four hundred and eighty years; while the genealogies suppose a much shorter time - about two hundred and eighty years. It is an immense gain, therefore, to get rid of this four hundred and fifty years for the time of the judges, and by the well-supported reading of the R.T. to get a calculation in agreement with <a href="/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a> and with the chronology of the times. <span class="cmt_word">Gave them... for an inheritance</span>. The T.R. has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, the R.T. has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, which words are not infrequently interchanged in different codices of the LXX. (see <a href="/joshua/19-51.htm">Joshua 19:51</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-38.htm">Deuteronomy 1:38</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-16.htm">Deuteronomy 21:16</a>, etc.).
