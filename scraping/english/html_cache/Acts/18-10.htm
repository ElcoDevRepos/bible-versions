It emphasizes God's continual presence with His people, providing comfort and courage. In the context of <a href="/acts/18.htm">Acts 18</a>, Paul is in Corinth, a city known for its immorality and idolatry, and this assurance would have been crucial for his mission. The presence of God is a recurring theme in the Bible, often associated with protection, guidance, and empowerment.<p><b>and no one will lay a hand on you</b><br>This promise of protection is significant given the opposition Paul faced in his ministry. In Corinth, Paul encountered resistance from both Jews and Gentiles. The phrase suggests divine intervention to prevent harm, similar to God's protection of His prophets in the Old Testament, such as Elijah and Jeremiah. It reassures Paul that his mission will not be thwarted by human opposition, aligning with the biblical theme that God's purposes cannot be hindered by man (<a href="/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>).<p><b>because I have many people in this city.</b><br>This statement reveals God's sovereign knowledge and plan, indicating that there are individuals in Corinth who are destined to become believers. It highlights the concept of God's elect, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a> and <a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29-30</a>. The phrase also underscores the importance of evangelism and the spread of the Gospel, as Paul is encouraged to continue his work knowing that God has prepared hearts to receive the message. Corinth, a major trade city, was strategically significant for the spread of Christianity, and this assurance would have motivated Paul to persevere in his mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is the central figure in this passage.

Just as the Lord stood by Paul later in prison (<a href="/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a>), He assures a continual, empowering companionship right now.<p>- The statement reminds every believer that ministry never rests on human strength alone; God Himself stands alongside those who proclaim His gospel (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and no one will lay a hand on you</b><p>- This is a concrete pledge of physical protection for Paul&#8217;s specific assignment in Corinth.

Though unseen, they are already His.<p>- Paul can preach boldly knowing a harvest is guaranteed. The same confidence drove his continued witness in Corinth for eighteen months (<a href="/acts/18-11.htm">Acts 18:11</a>).<p>- This reveals God&#8217;s heart for urban centers and reassures us that even hostile environments contain ready listeners (<a href="/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>; <a href="/acts/8-6.htm">Acts 8:6-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/18-10.htm">Acts 18:10</a> folds three promises into one sentence: God&#8217;s presence, God&#8217;s protection, and God&#8217;s prepared people.
