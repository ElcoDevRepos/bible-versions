Malta, a strategic island in the Mediterranean, was under Roman control, and Publius would have been responsible for maintaining order and representing Roman interests. The mention of an estate suggests wealth and influence, consistent with his role. This encounter highlights the providence of God in providing for Paul and his companions through influential people, reminiscent of how God used Joseph of Arimathea to care for Jesus' body (<a href="/matthew/27-57.htm">Matthew 27:57-60</a>).<p><b>He welcomed us and entertained us hospitably for three days.</b><br>The hospitality shown by Publius reflects the cultural norms of the time, where welcoming strangers was a valued practice, especially in the Mediterranean world. This act of kindness is significant, as it provided Paul and his companions with rest and recovery after their shipwreck ordeal. The three days of hospitality may symbolize completeness and divine provision, as seen in other biblical narratives, such as Jonah's three days in the fish (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>) and Jesus' resurrection on the third day (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-4.htm">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>).

When the Romans succeeded the Carthaginians in the possession of the island, they would be likely to perpetuate the title of the chief magistrate.
