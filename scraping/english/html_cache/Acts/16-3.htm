Timothy was a young disciple from Lystra, well spoken of by the believers there. Paul's desire for Timothy to join him reflects the importance of mentorship and discipleship in the early church. This decision also highlights the strategic nature of Paul's missionary journeys, as he sought companions who could aid in spreading the Gospel.<p><b>so he took him and circumcised him</b><br>This action might seem contradictory to Paul's teachings on circumcision and the law (<a href="/galatians/5-2.htm">Galatians 5:2-6</a>). However, Paul's decision was pragmatic, aimed at removing barriers to the Gospel among Jewish communities. Circumcision was a significant cultural and religious practice for Jews, and by circumcising Timothy, Paul ensured that their ministry would not be hindered by Jewish objections.<p><b>on account of the Jews in that area</b><br>The Jewish communities in the region were aware of Timothy's mixed heritage. To avoid unnecessary conflict and to gain a hearing among the Jews, Paul circumcised Timothy. This decision underscores the principle of becoming "all things to all people" (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-20.htm">1 Corinthians 9:20-22</a>) to win them to Christ, demonstrating Paul's commitment to cultural sensitivity in his mission work.<p><b>for they all knew that his father was a Greek</b><br>Timothy's father being Greek meant that Timothy was not circumcised as a child, which was customary for Jewish boys. This mixed heritage could have posed a stumbling block in Jewish evangelism. By addressing this issue, Paul ensured that Timothy's background would not impede their mission.

Paul knew the harvest was great (<a href="/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37</a>) and intentionally multiplied workers, modeling <a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a> even before he wrote it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So he took him and circumcised him</b><p>At first glance this seems to contradict the Jerusalem Council&#8217;s recent decision that Gentile believers need not be circumcised to be saved (<a href="/acts/15-6.htm">Acts 15:6&#8211;11</a>). Yet Paul&#8217;s own writings clarify his motive: &#8220;For though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19</a>). Timothy&#8217;s circumcision was not about earning salvation or placating legalists; it was a voluntary concession so that nothing would hinder gospel witness, much like Paul&#8217;s willingness to forego certain rights (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-13.htm">1 Corinthians 8:13</a>). By contrast, Paul refused to circumcise Titus, a full Gentile, because false brothers insisted it was necessary for justification (<a href="/galatians/2-3.htm">Galatians 2:3&#8211;5</a>). The distinction is purpose: grace never bends to legalism, but love willingly limits liberty for the sake of others (<a href="/romans/14-13.htm">Romans 14:13&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On account of the Jews in that area</b><p>Paul&#8217;s pattern was to begin in the synagogue wherever he traveled (<a href="/acts/13-5.htm">Acts 13:5</a>; 17:1&#8211;2). Uncircumcised Timothy, known to have Jewish heritage through his mother, would have been barred from synagogue participation according to prevailing customs (compare <a href="/acts/21-28.htm">Acts 21:28</a>). By removing that barrier, Paul ensured that both he and Timothy could enter, reason from the Scriptures, and &#8220;explain and prove that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-3.htm">Acts 17:3</a>). This action embodies <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>&#8212;&#8220;to the Jew first, and also to the Greek&#8221;&#8212;and highlights how strategic flexibility serves gospel advance without compromising truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For they all knew that his father was a Greek</b><p>Local knowledge mattered. The community recognized Timothy&#8217;s mixed background, and an uncircumcised status would signal disregard for Jewish identity, fueling suspicion that the gospel dismissed God&#8217;s covenant with Israel. By honoring Timothy&#8217;s Jewish lineage through circumcision, Paul demonstrated respect for God&#8217;s historic dealings with His people (<a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4&#8211;5</a>) while affirming that salvation is still &#8220;by grace through faith&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8&#8211;9</a>). The step removed a stumbling block (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-32.htm">1 Corinthians 10:32&#8211;33</a>) so listeners would focus on Christ, not controversy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/16-3.htm">Acts 16:3</a> shows Paul acting in practical wisdom and sacrificial love. Timothy&#8217;s circumcision was not compromise but strategy: removing cultural obstacles so Jews could hear the gospel unhindered. The passage illustrates how believers, secure in freedom, may voluntarily limit that freedom to advance the mission of Christ, always upholding the sufficiency of grace while honoring those they seek to reach.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And took and circumcised him.</span>--The act seems at first inconsistent with St. Paul's conduct as to Titus (<a href="/galatians/2-3.htm" title="But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:">Galatians 2:3</a>), and with his general teaching as to circumcision (<a href="/context/galatians/5-2.htm" title="Behold, I Paul say to you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.">Galatians 5:2-6</a>). The circumstances of the two cases were, however, different, and there were adequate reasons here for the course which he adopted. (1) The act was spontaneous, and men may rightly concede as a favour, or as a matter of expediency, what they would be justified in resisting when demanded as a matter of necessity. (2) Titus was a Greek, pure and simple (<a href="/galatians/2-3.htm" title="But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:">Galatians 2:3</a>); but the mixed parentage of Timotheus, according to the received canons of Jewish law, made him inherit from the nobler side, and he was therefore by birth in the same position as an Israelite. (3) By not urging circumcision prior to baptism, or to his admission to that "breaking of bread" which was then, as afterwards, the witness of a full communion with Christ, the Apostle had shown that he did not look on it as essential to admission into the Christian Church, or continued fellowship with it, and in what he now did he was simply acting on his avowed principle of becoming to the Jews as a Jew (see Notes on <a href="/acts/18-18.htm" title="And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.">Acts 18:18</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-20.htm" title="And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;">1Corinthians 9:20</a>), and guarding against the difficulties which he would have encountered from those whom he sought to win to Christ, had they seen, as one of the travelling company, an Israelite who was ashamed of the seal of the covenant of Abraham. The acceptance of that seal by one who had grown up to manhood without it may be noted as showing that the disciple had imbibed the spirit of his Master. It seems probable, from the youth of Timotheus, that at this period he took the place which had been before filled by Mark, and acted chiefly as an attendant, the "work of an evangelist" coming later (<a href="/2_timothy/4-5.htm" title="But watch you in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry.">2Timothy 4:5</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- He took</span> for <span class="accented">took</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that</span> for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">parts</span> for <span class="accented">quarters</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">all knew</span> for <span class="accented">knew all</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Circumcised him</span>.
