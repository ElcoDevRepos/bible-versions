The act of laying the money at the apostles' feet symbolizes submission and trust in their leadership. In the cultural context of the time, feet were often associated with authority and respect, as seen in other biblical instances such as Mary anointing Jesus' feet (<a href="/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a>). This practice reflects the communal lifestyle of the early church, emphasizing unity and mutual support. It also highlights the apostles' role as stewards of the community's resources, entrusted with the responsibility to manage and distribute them wisely.<p><b>for distribution to anyone</b><br>The early church's approach to resource distribution was radical for its time, reflecting the teachings of Jesus on caring for the poor and needy (<a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>). This communal sharing is reminiscent of the Old Testament principles of Jubilee and gleaning, where provisions were made for the less fortunate (Leviticus 25, <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19-21</a>). The apostles acted as administrators, ensuring that the resources were allocated fairly and according to need. This practice underscores the church's commitment to social justice and equality, aligning with the prophetic calls for justice found throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>, <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><b>as he had need</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the principle of need-based distribution, contrasting with the accumulation of wealth for personal gain. It reflects the early church's commitment to living out the teachings of Jesus, who instructed His followers to care for one another and prioritize the needs of others (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>). This approach is a practical application of the love commandment, where believers are called to love their neighbors as themselves (<a href="/mark/12-31.htm">Mark 12:31</a>). The focus on need rather than want or status challenges societal norms and reflects the kingdom values that Jesus preached, where the last shall be first and the first shall be last (<a href="/matthew/20-16.htm">Matthew 20:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The leaders of the early Christian church, entrusted with the teachings of Jesus and the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

It was not coerced socialism; each giver retained the right to decide, as Peter later reminded Ananias, &#8220;Was it not your own?&#8221; (<a href="/acts/5-4.htm">Acts 5:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern mirrors <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>&#8212;&#8220;Each one should give what he has decided in his heart&#8230;

When gifts or offerings are made to a king, or priest, or teacher, they are not placed in his hands, but at his feet. The Apostles sat, it would seem, in conclave, on their twelve seats, as in the figurative promise of <a href="/matthew/19-28.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That you which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.">Matthew 19:28</a>, and the vision of <a href="/revelation/4-4.htm" title="And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and on the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.">Revelation 4:4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - Laid them for <span class="accented">laid them downs</span> A.V.; <span class="accented">unto each</span>... <span class="accented">as any one</span> for <span class="accented">unto every man</span>... <span class="accented">as he</span>, A.V., a change without an improvement. <span class="cmt_word">Laid them at the apostles' feet</span>.
