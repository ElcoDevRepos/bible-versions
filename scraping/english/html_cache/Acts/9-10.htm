It was a significant center for trade and culture in the ancient Near East. Ananias, a disciple in this city, indicates the early spread of Christianity beyond Jerusalem. The term "disciple" suggests he was a committed follower of Jesus, likely part of the early Christian community established after Pentecost. Ananias is not mentioned elsewhere in Scripture, highlighting that God often uses ordinary believers for extraordinary purposes.<p><b>The Lord spoke to him in a vision,</b><br>Visions were a common way God communicated with His people in both the Old and New Testaments. This method of divine communication underscores the personal relationship between God and His followers. Visions often provided guidance, revelation, or a call to action. In the context of Acts, visions are significant in directing the early church's mission, as seen with Peter's vision in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Ananias!&#8221;</b><br>The direct address by name signifies a personal and intimate call from the Lord. This mirrors other biblical instances where God calls individuals by name, such as Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) and Samuel in the temple (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>). It emphasizes God's knowledge of and care for each individual.<p><b>&#8220;Here I am, Lord,&#8221; he answered.</b><br>Ananias's response is one of readiness and willingness to serve, echoing the responses of other biblical figures like Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>) and Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-4.htm">1 Samuel 3:4</a>). This phrase indicates a posture of obedience and submission to God's will, a hallmark of faithful discipleship. Ananias's readiness to respond to God's call is crucial, as he is about to play a pivotal role in the conversion of Saul, who becomes the Apostle Paul.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ananias.htm">Ananias</a></b><br>A disciple in Damascus, known for his obedience and faithfulness.

The name was so common that any identification must be in some measure uncertain, but the account which Josephus gives (<span class= "ital">Ant. xx.</span> 2, ? 4) of the conversion of Izates, King of Adiabene, to the faith of Israel by a Jewish merchant who bore the name of Ananias, and who taught that it was enough for men to worship the God of Israel without being circumcised, suggests, as probable, the thought that he too was a preacher of the gospel of Christ as St. Paul preached it. The arrival of another teacher, Eleazar of Galilee, who worked on the young king's fears and compelled him to be circumcised, presents a striking parallel to the manner in which the Judaisers followed on the track of St. Paul in Galatia and elsewhere (<a href="/galatians/2-4.htm" title="And that because of false brothers unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:">Galatians 2:4</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-17.htm" title="They zealously affect you, but not well; yes, they would exclude you, that you might affect them.">Galatians 4:17</a>). The narrative here leaves it uncertain whether this Ananias had been a disciple during our Lord's ministry or had been converted since the Day of Pentecost. In relation to St. Paul the name had a two-fold significance. He had come from one Annas, or Ananias, the Sadducean high priest, he was to be received by another. The meaning of the name--identical with that of Jochanan, Joannes, John, "the Lord is gracious"--was itself an omen and prophecy of pardon.<p><span class= "bld">To him said the Lord in a vision.</span>--It is clear from <a href="/acts/9-16.htm" title="For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.">Acts 9:16</a> that the writer is speaking of the Lord Jesus.
