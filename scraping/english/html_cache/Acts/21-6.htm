In the context of <a href="/acts/21.htm">Acts 21</a>, Paul and his companions are leaving the believers in Tyre. The act of saying farewells reflects the deep bonds formed within the early Christian community, emphasizing the unity and love among believers. This moment is reminiscent of other biblical farewells, such as Paul's emotional departure from the Ephesian elders in <a href="/acts/20-36.htm">Acts 20:36-38</a>. The use of "we" suggests the presence of the author, Luke, indicating an eyewitness account.<p><b>we went aboard the ship</b><br>The act of boarding a ship highlights the missionary journeys of Paul, which were crucial for the spread of the Gospel across the Roman Empire. The Mediterranean Sea was a major route for travel and trade, facilitating the movement of people and ideas. This journey is part of Paul's third missionary journey, demonstrating his commitment to spreading Christianity despite the challenges of travel in the ancient world. Ships were a common mode of transportation for long distances, and Paul's use of them underscores the strategic planning involved in his missions.<p><b>and they returned home</b><br>The phrase "they returned home" refers to the believers in Tyre who had come to see Paul off. This indicates that the early Christians had established communities and homes, suggesting a level of stability and organization within the church. The return home also signifies the continuation of their daily lives and responsibilities, even as they supported the broader mission of the church. This reflects the balance between local ministry and global mission, a theme prevalent throughout the New Testament. The concept of "home" can also be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual home believers have in Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who is on his missionary journey, heading towards Jerusalem despite knowing the challenges that await him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>- Fellow believers who accompanied Paul to the ship, showing their support and love for him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ship.htm">The Ship</a></b><br>- The vessel that Paul and his companions boarded to continue their journey.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_departure.htm">The Departure</a></b><br>- The event of saying farewell, which signifies a moment of emotional separation and commitment to God's calling.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/home.htm">Home</a></b><br>- The place to which the disciples returned, symbolizing their continued mission and life in their local context.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_farewells.htm">The Importance of Farewells</a></b><br>Farewells in the Christian journey are significant moments that reflect our trust in God's plan and our commitment to His calling.

Shared prayer, counsel, and affection made their bond strong in a short time.<p>&#8226; Similar scenes of farewell in Scripture&#8212;like the elders kneeling with Paul at Miletus (<a href="/acts/20-36.htm">Acts 20:36&#8211;38</a>) or Jonathan and David&#8217;s tearful parting (<a href="/1_samuel/20-41.htm">1 Samuel 20:41&#8211;42</a>)&#8212;remind us that the family of God is marked by deep, sacrificial love.<p>&#8226; Genuine farewells place the future in God&#8217;s hands; the believers knelt on the beach and prayed (<a href="/acts/21-5.htm">Acts 21:5</a>). Prayer turns separation into confident trust, echoing promises such as <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>, &#8220;I am with you always.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Saying goodbye in Christ is never final. Because of our shared eternal hope (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:17&#8211;18</a>), departures are temporary checkpoints on the pilgrimage home.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we went aboard the ship</b><p>&#8220;...we went aboard the ship...&#8221; (<a href="/acts/21-6.htm">Acts 21:6</a>) signals obedience to God&#8217;s direction.<p>&#8226; Paul is &#8220;bound by the Spirit&#8221; to go to Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/20-22.htm">Acts 20:22</a>), even though prophetic warnings await him (<a href="/acts/21-10.htm">Acts 21:10&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Boarding the vessel is an act of faith, not fatalism. Like Abraham leaving Ur (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1&#8211;4</a>) and Jesus setting His face toward Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>), Paul moves forward because God&#8217;s mission outweighs personal comfort.<p>&#8226; Mission often requires decisive steps. The disciples are not paralyzed by emotion; they act. <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a> urges believers to be doers, not hearers only.<p>&#8226; Each believer still boards a figurative ship when stepping into God-given assignments&#8212;trusting that the One who calls equips (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they returned home</b><p>&#8220;...and they returned home.&#8221; (<a href="/acts/21-6.htm">Acts 21:6</a>) highlights faithfulness in ordinary places.<p>&#8226; Those who remain are no less obedient than those who travel.

Jesus told the Gerasene man, &#8220;Return home and describe what God has done for you&#8221; (<a href="/luke/8-39.htm">Luke 8:39</a>). Our testimony often begins at the kitchen table.<p>&#8226; Routine responsibilities&#8212;family, work, community&#8212;are sacred trusts (<a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>). The believers return to homes needing truth, love, and stability.<p>&#8226; Their quiet faithfulness supports Paul&#8217;s public ministry; sending, praying, and sustaining resources are all part of the same gospel advance (3 <a href="/bsb/john/8.htm">John 8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/21-6.htm">Acts 21:6</a> paints a three-part picture of Christian life: heartfelt fellowship, courageous obedience, and steadfast faithfulness at home.
