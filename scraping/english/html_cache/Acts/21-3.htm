It was the home of Barnabas, a companion of Paul (<a href="/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>). The island was one of the first places Paul visited on his missionary journeys (<a href="/acts/13-4.htm">Acts 13:4-5</a>). The mention of Cyprus here indicates the route taken by Paul and his companions as they traveled by sea. The island's location made it a common landmark for ships traveling from Asia Minor to the Levant.<p><b>and passing south of it</b><br>This phrase indicates the navigational route taken by the ship. By passing south of Cyprus, the ship was likely taking advantage of prevailing winds and currents. This route was a common maritime path in the ancient world, used by traders and travelers moving between the regions of Asia Minor and the Near East.<p><b>we sailed on to Syria</b><br>Syria, during the time of Acts, was a Roman province that included the region of modern-day Syria and parts of Lebanon. It was a significant area for early Christianity, with Antioch being a major center for the early church (<a href="/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>). The journey to Syria marks a continuation of Paul's mission to spread the Gospel to both Jews and Gentiles.<p><b>and landed at Tyre</b><br>Tyre was an ancient Phoenician city located on the Mediterranean coast, known for its trade and commerce. It was a significant port city in the Roman Empire. In the Old Testament, Tyre is often mentioned in the context of trade and wealth (Ezekiel 27). The city's inclusion in Paul's journey highlights the spread of Christianity to major urban centers.<p><b>where the ship was to unload its cargo</b><br>This detail underscores the commercial nature of Paul's journey. Ships in the ancient world often carried both passengers and goods, and Tyre was a key trading hub. The unloading of cargo indicates the economic activity of the region and provides a backdrop for Paul's missionary work, as he often engaged with local communities in such bustling environments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cyprus.htm">Cyprus</a></b><br>An island in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, significant in early Christian history as the home of Barnabas and a place where Paul and Barnabas preached during their first missionary journey.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/syria.htm">Syria</a></b><br>A region in the ancient Near East, which included important cities like Antioch, a major center for early Christianity and the starting point for Paul's missionary journeys.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tyre.htm">Tyre</a></b><br>A prominent Phoenician city on the Mediterranean coast, known for its trade and commerce.

Tyre at this time was still a city of some commercial importance, with two harbors, one north and one south of the causeway which connected the island with the mainland (see <a href="/acts/12-20.htm">Acts 12:20</a>). Howson thinks the ship in which St. Paul sailed may have brought wheat from the Black Sea, and taken up Phoenician wares in exchange. The sight of Cyprus as he sailed by must have brought many and very various memories to the apostle's mind, of Barnabas, of Sergius Paulus, of Elymas, and many others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/21-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[After]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sighting</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#966;&#940;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(anaphanantes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_398.htm">Strong's 398: </a> </span><span class="str2">From ana and phaino; to show, i.e. appear, or to have pointed out.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Cyprus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#973;&#960;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Kypron)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2954.htm">Strong's 2954: </a> </span><span class="str2">Cyprus.
