The prophets in the Hebrew Scriptures often spoke of God's plans for Israel and the nations. In the context of <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, the apostles and elders are addressing the inclusion of Gentiles in the church. The reference to "the prophets" underscores that this inclusion is not a new idea but is rooted in the longstanding promises of God. Prophets like Isaiah and Amos spoke of a time when Gentiles would seek the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>, <a href="/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11-12</a>).<p><b>agree with this</b><br>The agreement mentioned here refers to the consensus among the early church leaders that the Gentiles should be welcomed into the faith without the burden of adhering to the full Mosaic Law. This agreement is seen as a fulfillment of the prophetic words, indicating that the inclusion of Gentiles aligns with God's redemptive plan. The unity among the apostles and elders reflects the work of the Holy Spirit in guiding the church to understand and apply Scripture in light of Christ's work.<p><b>as it is written:</b><br>This phrase introduces a direct quotation from the Hebrew Scriptures, emphasizing the authority and continuity of God's Word. The use of "as it is written" is a common formula in the New Testament to indicate that the events or teachings being discussed are in fulfillment of Scripture. In this context, it points to the reliability and divine inspiration of the prophetic writings, which foretold the inclusion of the Gentiles. The specific passage being referenced is from <a href="/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11-12</a>, which speaks of the restoration of David's fallen tent and the inclusion of all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The leader of the Jerusalem church who speaks in <a href="/bsb/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, providing a judgment on the issue of Gentile believers and the Law of Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem_council.htm">Jerusalem Council</a></b><br>A significant meeting of early church leaders to discuss whether Gentile converts must follow Jewish law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Refers to the Old Testament prophets whose writings are seen as foretelling the inclusion of Gentiles in God's plan.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentile_believers.htm">Gentile Believers</a></b><br>Non-Jewish individuals who have come to faith in Jesus Christ, central to the discussion in <a href="/bsb/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/antioch.htm">Antioch</a></b><br>The city from which Paul and Barnabas came to Jerusalem to discuss the issue of Gentile believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_unity_of_scripture.htm">The Unity of Scripture</a></b><br>The New Testament fulfills the Old Testament prophecies, demonstrating the consistency and unity of God's Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_inclusive_plan.htm">God's Inclusive Plan</a></b><br>God's plan of salvation includes all people, regardless of ethnic or cultural background, emphasizing the universality of the gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophecy.htm">The Role of Prophecy</a></b><br>Prophecies in the Old Testament are not just historical but have ongoing relevance and fulfillment in the New Testament era.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_church_leadership.htm">The Importance of Church Leadership</a></b><br>The Jerusalem Council shows the importance of wise and Spirit-led leadership in resolving doctrinal issues within the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_sensitivity_in_ministry.htm">Cultural Sensitivity in Ministry</a></b><br>The decision of the council reflects a sensitivity to cultural differences, teaching us to be considerate of diverse backgrounds in ministry.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_15_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 15:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Acts_15_15_OT_prophecy_fulfilled.htm">How does Acts 15:15 affirm the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_prophecy_validate_early_church.htm">What role does prophecy play in validating the early church's mission?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Align_church_with_Acts_15_15_prophecy.htm">How can we ensure our church aligns with biblical prophecy like Acts 15:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Acts_15_15_Unity_for_Jews_Gentiles.htm">How does Acts 15:15 encourage unity between Jewish and Gentile believers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_prophecy_in_faith_journey.htm">What steps can we take to apply prophetic fulfillment in our faith journey?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Acts_15_15_OT_prophecy_fulfilled_2.htm">How does Acts 15:15 support the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy in the New Testament?

Every syllable carries His authority (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p>- James, presiding at the Jerusalem Council, reaches for Scripture first. His opening phrase reminds the church that divine words, not human opinions, settle doctrine.<p>- In practical terms: whenever we face doctrinal tension&#8212;here, whether Gentiles must keep the Mosaic law&#8212;we start with &#8220;What has God said?&#8221; not &#8220;What do we feel?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the prophets</b><p>- These &#8220;words&#8221; are anchored in the prophetic writings, God&#8217;s messengers who &#8220;spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-20.htm">2 Peter 1:20-21</a>).<p>- Jesus Himself trusted those prophetic voices (<a href="/luke/24-25.htm">Luke 24:25-27</a>). James follows His lead, showing continuity between Christ&#8217;s teaching and the Hebrew Scriptures.<p>- By appealing to multiple prophets (&#8220;words&#8221; plural), James signals that this is not an isolated proof-text but a consistent prophetic chorus (<a href="/luke/1-70.htm">Luke 1:70</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>agree with this</b><p>- &#8220;This&#8221; refers to Peter&#8217;s testimony that God purified Gentiles by faith apart from law-keeping (<a href="/acts/15-7.htm">Acts 15:7-11</a>). The prophets had already proclaimed that very inclusion.<p>- Agreement means harmony, not mere similarity.<p>&#8226; <a href="/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11-12</a> (quoted next) foretells Gentiles seeking the Lord.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a> promises salvation &#8220;to the ends of the earth.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a> cites <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a> to show the gospel forecasted to Abraham.<p>- The same God authored Old and New Testaments, so genuine contradiction is impossible. Rather than forcing the prophets to match church tradition, James lets their words interpret the moment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as it is written</b><p>- This familiar biblical formula (<a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>; <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>) underlines final authority: what stands written cannot be overturned.<p>- James immediately quotes <a href="/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11-12</a> (<a href="/acts/15-16.htm">Acts 15:16-17</a>), taking it at face value. A rebuilt &#8220;tent of David&#8221; and Gentiles called by God&#8217;s name are literal promises, now unfolding in the church age.<p>- &#8220;Written&#8221; also highlights permanence. Oral reports might fade, but the Spirit-breathed record endures, guiding every generation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/15-15.htm">Acts 15:15</a> shows James grounding a pivotal church decision in the unchanging, prophetically inspired Word of God.
