It was known for its commerce and trade, and it played a crucial role in the spread of Christianity in the early church. The presence of disciples in Tyre indicates the widespread reach of the Gospel beyond Jewish territories, reflecting the fulfillment of Jesus' command to be witnesses "to the ends of the earth" (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). The act of seeking out fellow believers demonstrates the early Christians' commitment to fellowship and mutual support, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>, which encourages believers not to forsake assembling together.<p><b>and stayed with them seven days.</b><br>The duration of seven days is significant in biblical terms, often symbolizing completeness or perfection, as seen in the creation account in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. Staying for a week allowed Paul and his companions to rest, teach, and strengthen the local church. This period also provided ample time for spiritual fellowship and encouragement, aligning with the early church's practice of communal living and sharing, as described in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>. The number seven may also reflect the Jewish Sabbath cycle, indicating a time of spiritual renewal and worship.<p><b>Through the Spirit they kept telling Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.</b><br>This phrase highlights the role of the Holy Spirit in guiding and warning believers. The Spirit's communication through the disciples in Tyre serves as a prophetic warning to Paul about the dangers awaiting him in Jerusalem. This aligns with other instances in Acts where the Holy Spirit provides guidance, such as in <a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>, where the Spirit sets apart Barnabas and Saul for missionary work. The repeated warnings Paul receives about going to Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/20-23.htm">Acts 20:23</a>, <a href="/acts/21-11.htm">Acts 21:11</a>) underscore the tension between divine guidance and human agency. Despite these warnings, Paul feels compelled to continue his journey, reflecting his commitment to his mission and his willingness to suffer for the sake of the Gospel, as he expresses in <a href="/acts/20-24.htm">Acts 20:24</a>. This tension can be seen as a type of Christ, who also resolutely set His face toward Jerusalem, knowing the suffering that awaited Him (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is on his missionary journey, determined to go to Jerusalem despite warnings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples_in_tyre.htm">Disciples in Tyre</a></b><br>Believers in the city of Tyre who, through the Spirit, advised Paul against going to Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tyre.htm">Tyre</a></b><br>A city in Phoenicia where Paul and his companions stayed for seven days.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit.htm">The Spirit</a></b><br>Refers to the Holy Spirit, who communicated through the disciples to warn Paul.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The destination Paul is determined to reach, despite the warnings he receives.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_of_the_spirit's_guidance.htm">Discernment of the Spirit's Guidance</a></b><br>Believers must seek to discern the Spirit's guidance in their lives, understanding that it may come through other believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_community_in_decision-making.htm">The Role of Community in Decision-Making</a></b><br>The Christian community plays a vital role in providing counsel and warnings, which should be weighed carefully.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_and_obedience_in_the_face_of_adversity.htm">Courage and Obedience in the Face of Adversity</a></b><br>Like Paul, believers are called to be courageous and obedient to God's call, even when facing potential suffering.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/balancing_personal_conviction_with_community_advice.htm">Balancing Personal Conviction with Community Advice</a></b><br>It is important to balance personal convictions with the advice and warnings from the faith community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_will_in_suffering.htm">Understanding God's Will in Suffering</a></b><br>Suffering can be part of God's will and purpose, as seen in Paul's journey, and believers should seek to understand and accept this aspect of their faith journey.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_21_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 21:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Acts_21_4_Holy_Spirit_s_guidance_role.htm">How does Acts 21:4 demonstrate the role of the Holy Spirit in guidance?

Paul&#8217;s team didn&#8217;t wait for believers to discover them; they actively searched for fellowship. The Gospel had reached Tyre earlier (<a href="/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>), so they expected brothers and sisters there.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/19-1.htm">Acts 19:1</a> shows Paul doing the same in Ephesus&#8212;&#8220;he found some disciples.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Seeking out believers models <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24&#8211;25</a>: we are to &#8220;spur one another on&#8230;not neglecting to meet together.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This deliberate pursuit of Christian community underscores the Church&#8217;s unity across cultures (<a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and stayed with them seven days</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;&#8230;and stayed with them seven days.&#8221; Why a full week?<p>&#8226; Practically, the ship needed time to unload cargo (<a href="/acts/21-3.htm">Acts 21:3</a>), giving the missionaries margin to rest.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, seven-day stays appear repeatedly (<a href="/acts/20-6.htm">Acts 20:6</a> in Troas; <a href="/acts/28-14.htm">Acts 28:14</a> in Puteoli). A week allows for a complete cycle of worship, fellowship, and the Lord&#8217;s Day (<a href="/acts/20-7.htm">Acts 20:7</a>).<p>&#8226; It mirrors the Old Testament rhythm where a week often marks completion (<a href="/genesis/2-1.htm">Genesis 2:1&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>).<p>Takeaway: schedule-driven travel did not crowd out shared life with believers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Through the Spirit they kept telling Paul not to go up to Jerusalem</b><p>Luke concludes, &#8220;Through the Spirit they kept telling Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.&#8221; This raises two key points.<p>1. Genuine prophetic insight<p>&#8226; The warning was Spirit-born, just like Agabus&#8217;s later prophecy (<a href="/acts/21-10.htm">Acts 21:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a> reminds us the Spirit &#8220;will guide you into all truth,&#8221; including dangers ahead.<p>2.

Paul&#8217;s friends urge caution, yet Paul discerns a higher call to endure hardship for Christ. The verse encourages us to pursue Christian community actively, invest time in it, listen to prophetic counsel, and obey God&#8217;s personal direction even when it leads into difficulty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days.</span>--The word for "finding" implies a previous search. They inquired, when they landed, amid the crowded streets of the still busy port, whether any Christians were to be found there. It will be remembered that St. Paul had passed through that region at least once before. (See Note on <a href="/acts/15-3.htm" title="And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy to all the brothers.">Acts 15:3</a>.) The church had probably been planted by the labours of Philip, as the Evangelist of Caesarea. It is clear that the believers there were prepared to welcome St. Paul and his companions, and showed a warm interest in their welfare.<p>The "seven days' " stay, as at Troas (see Note on <a href="/acts/20-6.htm" title="And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days; where we stayed seven days.">Acts 20:6</a>), and afterwards at Puteoli (<a href="/acts/28-14.htm" title="Where we found brothers, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.">Acts 28:14</a>), was obviously for the purpose of attending one, or possibly more than one, meeting of the church for the Lord's Supper on the Lord's Day. The utterances through the Spirit implied the exercise of prophetic gifts at such a meeting. It seems, at first, somewhat startling that St. Paul should reject what is described as an inspired counsel; or, if we believe him also to have been guided by the Spirit, that the two inspirations should thus clash. We remember, however, that men received the Spirit "by measure," and the prophets of the churches at Tyre, as elsewhere (<a href="/acts/20-23.htm" title="Save that the Holy Ghost witnesses in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.">Acts 20:23</a>), though foreseeing the danger to which the Apostle was exposed, might yet be lacking in that higher inspiration which guided the decision of the Apostle, and which he himself defines as the spirit "of power, and of love, and of a sound mind" (<a href="/2_timothy/1-7.htm" title="For God has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.">2Timothy 1:7</a>). This is, it is believed, a much more adequate explanation than that which sees in the Apostle's conduct a somewhat self-willed adherence to his own human purpose, and finds a chastisement for that self-will in the long delay and imprisonment that followed on the slighted warnings. He was right, we may boldly say, to go to Jerusalem in spite of consequences. The repeated warnings are, however, an indication of the exceeding bitterness of feeling with which the Judaisers and unbelieving Jews were known to be animated against him. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- Having found the disciples</span> for <span class="accented">finding disciples</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">and these</span> for <span class="accented">who</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">set foot in</span> for <span class="accented">go up to</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Having found the disciples</span>, If the R.T. is right, the meaning is that they had sought out the Christians, apparently not a large body, scattered in the city, and perhaps with some difficulty found them and their place of meeting.
