The Jewish population held significant influence, and Herod sought to maintain their favor to stabilize his rule. The execution of James, the brother of John, had garnered approval from the Jewish leaders, who were opposed to the burgeoning Christian movement. This approval was likely rooted in the belief that the Christians were a threat to Jewish religious traditions and authority. The Jewish leaders' satisfaction with James's death reflects the tension between early Christians and the Jewish establishment, a theme that recurs throughout the Acts of the Apostles.<p><b>Herod proceeded to seize Peter</b><br>Peter, one of the leading figures of the early Church, was a prime target for Herod. By arresting Peter, Herod aimed to further appease the Jewish leaders and suppress the Christian movement. This act of seizing Peter highlights the ongoing persecution faced by the early Church, as well as the political maneuvering of Herod, who was more concerned with maintaining power than with justice. The arrest of Peter is reminiscent of the earlier arrest and trial of Jesus, drawing a parallel between the experiences of Christ and His apostles.<p><b>during the Feast of Unleavened Bread</b><br>The Feast of Unleavened Bread, also known as Passover, was a significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' exodus from Egypt. It was a time when Jerusalem was filled with Jewish pilgrims, making it a strategic moment for Herod to make a public statement by arresting Peter. The timing of Peter's arrest during this festival is symbolic, as it echoes the arrest and crucifixion of Jesus, which also occurred during Passover. This connection underscores the continuity between the experiences of Jesus and His followers, as well as the fulfillment of Old Testament typology, where Jesus is seen as the ultimate Passover Lamb.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_agrippa_i.htm">Herod Agrippa I</a></b><br>The king who sought to gain favor with the Jewish people by persecuting the early church.

When he noticed the public approval, he leaned further into persecution, valuing popularity over righteousness&#8212;much like Pilate, who &#8220;wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas&#8221; (<a href="/mark/15-15.htm">Mark 15:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Seeking human applause above God&#8217;s favor shows the dark side of people-pleasing (<a href="/john/12-43.htm">John 12:43</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>).

The persecution did not spring from any fanatic zeal against the new faith, but simply from motives of political expediency. A somewhat touching incident is recorded, illustrating the king's sensitiveness to popular praise or blame. It was at the Feast of Tabernacles, and the Law was read, and he heard the words of <a href="/deuteronomy/17-15.htm" title="You shall in any wise set him king over you, whom the LORD your God shall choose: one from among your brothers shall you set king over you: you may not set a stranger over you, which is not your brother.">Deuteronomy 17:15</a> : "Thou shalt not set a stranger over thee," and he burst into tears at the thought of his own Idumaean descent. The people saw him weeping, and cried out: "Trouble not thyself, Agrippa; thou also art our brother," and the king's heart was comforted (Jost, <span class= "ital">Gesch. des Judenthums, </span>I., p. 420).<p><span class= "bld">Then were the days of unleavened bread.</span>--The crowds of Hellenistic and other Jews who were gathered to keep the feast at Jerusalem naturally made this a favourable opportunity for courting the favour of the people.
