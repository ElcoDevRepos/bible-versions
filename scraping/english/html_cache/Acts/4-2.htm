This disturbance was not merely emotional but stemmed from a perceived threat to their authority and doctrinal beliefs. The Sadducees, who held significant power in the Sanhedrin, denied the resurrection and any form of afterlife, which was a core part of their theological stance. The apostles' message directly challenged their beliefs and threatened their influence over the people.<p><b>that they were teaching the people</b><br>The apostles were actively engaging with the public, spreading the teachings of Jesus. This was significant because teaching was traditionally the role of the rabbis and religious leaders. The apostles, considered uneducated by the standards of the time, were now assuming a role of authority, which undermined the established religious hierarchy. This teaching was not confined to the synagogues but was taking place in public spaces, making it accessible to all.<p><b>and proclaiming in Jesus</b><br>The central focus of the apostles' message was Jesus Christ. They were not merely teaching moral or ethical lessons but were proclaiming Jesus as the Messiah. This proclamation was a direct continuation of Jesus' own ministry and fulfilled Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah. The apostles' boldness in declaring Jesus as the risen Lord was a testament to their conviction and the transformative power of the Holy Spirit.<p><b>the resurrection of the dead</b><br>The doctrine of resurrection was a contentious issue, especially with the Sadducees, who rejected it. However, the Pharisees, another influential group, did believe in the resurrection. The apostles' teaching affirmed the resurrection as a cornerstone of Christian faith, emphasizing that Jesus' resurrection was the firstfruits of those who have died. This teaching connected to Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in Isaiah and Daniel, and was a fulfillment of Jesus' own predictions about His death and resurrection. The resurrection was not just a future hope but a present reality that validated Jesus' divinity and the truth of His message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter_and_john.htm">Peter and John</a></b><br>Apostles of Jesus Christ who were actively preaching and teaching about Jesus and His resurrection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sadducees.htm">The Sadducees</a></b><br>A sect of Jewish leaders who were particularly disturbed by the teaching of the resurrection, as they did not believe in the resurrection of the dead.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship in Jerusalem where Peter and John were teaching.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resurrection_of_jesus.htm">The Resurrection of Jesus</a></b><br>The central event being proclaimed by the apostles, which was a cornerstone of early Christian preaching.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The audience in the temple who were receiving the teaching about Jesus and His resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_centrality_of_the_resurrection.htm">The Centrality of the Resurrection</a></b><br>The resurrection of Jesus is not just a historical event but the foundation of Christian faith.
