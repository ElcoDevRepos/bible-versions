The Israelites, who had initially come to Egypt during the time of Joseph, had grown in number and strength. The new Pharaoh, who did not know Joseph, felt threatened by their presence and sought to control them through exploitation. This exploitation involved forced labor and harsh treatment, as described in <a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11-14</a>. The Pharaoh's actions were driven by fear of the Israelites' potential to join Egypt's enemies in case of war, as mentioned in <a href="/exodus/1-9.htm">Exodus 1:9-10</a>.<p><b>and oppressed our fathers</b><br>The oppression of the Israelites' ancestors is a reference to the severe conditions they faced under Egyptian rule. This oppression included not only hard labor but also a systematic attempt to break their spirit and reduce their numbers. The term "fathers" highlights the generational impact of this oppression, affecting the patriarchs of the Israelite community. This aligns with the prophecy given to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>, where God foretold that his descendants would be strangers in a land not their own and would be enslaved and mistreated for 400 years.<p><b>forcing them to abandon their infants</b><br>The Pharaoh's decree to abandon infants was a direct attack on the future of the Israelite people. This edict, found in <a href="/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>, commanded that every Hebrew male child be thrown into the Nile River. This act of infanticide was intended to curb the growth of the Israelite population and eliminate any future threat they might pose. The abandonment of infants is a poignant reminder of the extreme measures taken by the Egyptians to maintain control over the Israelites.<p><b>so they would die</b><br>The ultimate goal of Pharaoh's decree was the death of the Hebrew male infants. This act of cruelty is a stark example of the lengths to which the Egyptians went to suppress the Israelites. It also sets the stage for the miraculous preservation of Moses, who was saved from this fate and later became the deliverer of his people. This narrative foreshadows the deliverance theme found throughout the Bible, culminating in the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ. The survival of Moses, despite the decree, is a testament to God's providence and plan for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who oppressed the Israelites, as described in the context of Stephen's speech in <a href="/bsb/acts/7.htm">Acts 7</a>.
