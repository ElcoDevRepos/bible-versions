The "many days" likely refers to a span of time that includes Saul's initial preaching in Damascus and his subsequent retreat to Arabia, as mentioned in <a href="/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17-18</a>. This period could have lasted up to three years, suggesting a time of preparation and growth in Saul's understanding of the Gospel. It reflects the biblical pattern of God preparing His servants over time, as seen with Moses in Midian and Jesus in the wilderness.<p><b>the Jews conspired to kill him</b><br>This phrase highlights the intense opposition Saul faced from the Jewish community in Damascus. Saul, once a persecutor of Christians, now finds himself the target of persecution. This reversal underscores the transformative power of the Gospel and the radical change in Saul's life. The Jews' conspiracy to kill Saul reflects the broader pattern of resistance to the early Christian message, as seen in the hostility faced by Jesus and the apostles. This opposition fulfills Jesus' prophecy that His followers would face persecution (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>). Saul's experience here foreshadows the many trials and sufferings he would endure for the sake of Christ, as detailed in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul (Paul)</a></b><br>Former persecutor of Christians who experienced a dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus.

His bold preaching gave listeners ample opportunity to weigh the evidence that &#8220;Jesus is the Christ,&#8221; and many rejected it.<p>&#8226; The phrase also reminds us that God often allows a period of growth before greater testing arrives, just as Moses spent years in Midian (<a href="/exodus/2-15.htm">Exodus 2:15-25</a>) and David waited between anointing and kingship (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Jews conspired</b><p>&#8226; The same community Saul once served now bands together against him, illustrating Jesus&#8217; warning that &#8220;a man&#8217;s enemies will be the members of his own household&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-36.htm">Matthew 10:36</a>).<p>&#8226; Conspiracy is deliberate and collective. Luke uses similar language for plots against Jesus (<a href="/luke/22-2.htm">Luke 22:2</a>) and later against Paul (<a href="/acts/23-12.htm">Acts 23:12-15</a>), showing that resistance to the gospel is neither new nor isolated.<p>&#8226; Their response highlights the spiritual battle: instead of refuting Saul&#8217;s arguments, they seek to silence him. <a href="/acts/4-29.htm">Acts 4:29</a> records the early church praying for boldness, not safety, because opposition is expected whenever truth confronts hardened hearts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to kill him</b><p>&#8226; Murder, not debate, becomes the strategy. Saul now tastes the persecution he once inflicted (<a href="/acts/8-3.htm">Acts 8:3</a>), fulfilling Jesus&#8217; promise to Ananias that Saul would &#8220;suffer for My name&#8221; (<a href="/acts/9-16.htm">Acts 9:16</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty over Saul&#8217;s life is clear. While enemies plot, the Lord provides an escape&#8212;&#8220;his disciples took him by night and lowered him in a basket&#8221; (<a href="/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a>). Paul later recalls this rescue in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-32.htm">2 Corinthians 11:32-33</a>, marking it as the first in a long list of sufferings God would turn to ministry advantage (<a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12-14</a>).<p>&#8226; The attempt on Saul&#8217;s life also foreshadows the church&#8217;s ongoing reality: &#8220;Everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/9-23.htm">Acts 9:23</a> reveals the inevitable collision between transformed lives and entrenched unbelief. After a season of preparation, Saul&#8217;s Spirit-empowered witness provokes lethal opposition, yet God remains firmly in control. The verse reassures believers that while hostility may intensify, the Lord fashions every plot into a platform for the gospel and a forge for faithful character.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">After that many days were fulfilled.</span>--We learn from the more definite statement in <a href="/galatians/1-18.htm" title="Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.">Galatians 1:18</a> that these few words cover a period of otherwise unrecorded work, extending over a period of three years. That period must have witnessed the growth of a Christian society at Damascus, with an order of discipline and worship based on the outlines of that at Jerusalem. It follows, however, from the subsequent history that, as yet, Gentile converts were not admitted to the Church as such. The special mission to them came later on (comp. <a href="/acts/22-21.htm" title="And he said to me, Depart: for I will send you far hence to the Gentiles.">Acts 22:21</a>), and it was natural that one, with the intense affection for his brethren according to the flesh which characterised St. Paul (<a href="/romans/10-1.htm" title="Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.">Romans 10:1</a>), should, till that mission came, have given himself mainly, or even exclusively, to the work of labouring for their conversion. It is probable, however, from the bitter antagonism of the Jews, that his teaching had already pointed to the breaking down of "the middle wall of partition" (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a>), and the passing away of all on which they had prided themselves as being their exclusive privileges. From the first it might almost seem as if Stephen had risen from the dead, and was living again in the spirit and power of his persecutor.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="accented">When</span> for <span class="accented">after that</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">took counsel together</span> for <span class="accented">took counsel</span>, A.V.
