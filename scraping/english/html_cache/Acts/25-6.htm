This reflects the Roman administrative efficiency and the political pressure to maintain peace in Judea. The ambiguity in the number of days suggests a lack of precise record-keeping or the fluidity of Roman schedules.<p><b>Festus went down to Caesarea</b><br>Caesarea was the Roman administrative capital of Judea, strategically located on the Mediterranean coast. It was a hub of Roman power and influence, with significant archaeological remains, including a well-preserved theater and aqueduct. The phrase "went down" is geographically accurate, as Caesarea is at a lower elevation than Jerusalem.<p><b>The next day he sat on the judgment seat</b><br>The judgment seat, or "bema," was a raised platform used by Roman officials to hear legal cases. This setting underscores the formal and authoritative nature of Roman judicial proceedings. The bema is a recurring symbol in the New Testament, representing divine judgment (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>).<p><b>and ordered that Paul be brought in</b><br>Paul, a Roman citizen, was entitled to a fair trial, which Festus was obligated to provide.

Festus listens courteously but briefly, signaling he will not be manipulated.<p>&#8226; Unlike Felix, who kept Paul in custody for two years (<a href="/acts/24-27.htm">Acts 24:27</a>), Festus moves promptly.
