In the context of ancient public speaking, a loud voice was often used to capture attention and convey importance. This moment mirrors Jesus' healing miracles, where He often spoke with authority (e.g., <a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43</a>, when Jesus called Lazarus from the tomb). The loud voice also indicates the public nature of the miracle, ensuring that witnesses could hear and see the power of God at work.<p><b>&#8220;Stand up on your feet!&#8221;</b><br>This command is direct and mirrors the commands given by Jesus during His healing ministry (e.g., <a href="/mark/2-11.htm">Mark 2:11</a>, where Jesus tells the paralytic to rise). The phrase emphasizes faith and action; the man is called to respond in faith to the command. The act of standing is symbolic of new life and restoration, reflecting the transformative power of the Gospel. It also signifies a reversal of his previous condition, as he was unable to walk before.<p><b>And the man jumped up</b><br>The immediate response of the man highlights the miraculous nature of the healing. His jumping up is an expression of joy and complete restoration, similar to the healed lame man in <a href="/acts/3-8.htm">Acts 3:8</a> who entered the temple walking and leaping. This action demonstrates the completeness of God's healing power, as the man not only stands but leaps, indicating strength and vitality.<p><b>and began to walk.</b><br>Walking signifies a return to normalcy and participation in community life, which was significant in the cultural context of the time. In biblical symbolism, walking often represents living in accordance with God's will (e.g., <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>, "walk in love"). The man's ability to walk is a testament to the authenticity of the miracle and serves as a powerful witness to the surrounding people of the truth of Paul's message and the power of the risen Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>An apostle of Jesus Christ, formerly known as Saul of Tarsus, who played a significant role in spreading the Gospel to the Gentiles.

This reflects confidence that God is about to act, similar to Peter&#8217;s raised voice at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14</a>) and Jesus crying out, &#8220;Lazarus, come out!&#8221; (<a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43</a>).<p>&#8226; The volume underscores divine authority, not human theatrics. When God speaks, mountains move (<a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3-9</a>), and here His servant&#8217;s loud voice anticipates a miraculous shift.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Paul called out</b><p>&#8226; Paul addresses the crippled man publicly, demonstrating that faith is never a private possession only. <a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6</a> shows the same courage when Peter spoke to the lame beggar at the temple gate.<p>&#8226; His calling out flows from the Spirit&#8217;s prompting (<a href="/acts/14-9.htm">Acts 14:9</a>); the initiative is from God, not human impulse (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Stand up on your feet!</b><p>&#8226; This is a clear command, not a suggestion.

When Jesus heals, He heals fully (<a href="/matthew/12-13.htm">Matthew 12:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience precedes experience; the man acts on Paul&#8217;s command before feeling strength, just as Naaman dipped in the Jordan before his skin cleared (<a href="/2_kings/5-14.htm">2 Kings 5:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And began to walk</b><p>&#8226; The miracle is ongoing, not a momentary spasm of strength. Continuous walking proves lasting restoration (<a href="/luke/7-22.htm">Luke 7:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Walking symbolizes new life and participation in community. Once carried, he now moves among peers, paralleling Aeneas who &#8220;got up at once&#8221; and saw others turn to the Lord (<a href="/acts/9-34.htm">Acts 9:34-35</a>).<p>&#8226; The ripple effect follows: the crowd&#8217;s reaction sets up the rest of <a href="/bsb/acts/14.htm">Acts 14</a>, where Paul must redirect their misplaced worship toward the living God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/14-10.htm">Acts 14:10</a> showcases God&#8217;s immediate, public, and total power to restore. Paul speaks with Spirit-given authority; the lame man trusts instantly; and the result is undeniable evidence that the risen Christ continues His ministry through His servants. The verse invites us to expect God to act powerfully, to obey His Word promptly, and to walk in the new life He provides.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Stand upright on thy feet.</span>--What may be called the <span class= "ital">modus operandi</span> of the miracle reminds us of that of the paralytic in <a href="/matthew/9-6.htm" title="But that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (then said he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.">Matthew 9:6</a>, and the cripple at Bethesda in <a href="/john/5-11.htm" title="He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said to me, Take up your bed, and walk.">John 5:11</a>, and the lame man in <a href="/acts/3-6.htm" title="Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.">Acts 3:6</a>.
