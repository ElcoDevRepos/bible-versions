David's favor with God is evident in his anointing as king and his victories over Israel's enemies. His deep devotion and repentance, as seen in the Psalms, highlight his relationship with God. This favor is not based on David's perfection but on his faith and obedience.<p><b>and asked to provide a dwelling place</b><br>David expressed a desire to build a temple for God, as recorded in <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7:1-2</a>. This request was motivated by his reverence for God and his desire to honor Him with a permanent place of worship. The concept of a dwelling place for God reflects the importance of the temple in Jewish worship, serving as a central location for sacrifices and festivals.<p><b>for the God of Jacob</b><br>The reference to "the God of Jacob" emphasizes the continuity of God's covenant with the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It underscores the faithfulness of God to His promises and His enduring relationship with the people of Israel.

The temple could never contain Him; it simply served as a visible testimony to His covenant presence.<p>&#8226; In the New Covenant Jesus fulfills this reality: &#8220;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), and believers are now &#8220;a dwelling place for God in His Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the God of Jacob</b><p>The verse ends with a covenant title: &#8220;the God of Jacob.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Linking David&#8217;s request to &#8220;the God of Jacob&#8221; ties the monarchy to the patriarchal promises (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13</a>).<p>&#8226; It underscores continuity: the same God who watched over Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob was now shepherding Israel through David (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>; 80:1).<p>&#8226; The name also carries a missionary note. When Solomon dedicates the temple, he prays that foreigners too would come and know &#8220;this house that I have built is called by Your Name&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/8-41.htm">1 Kings 8:41-43</a>).<p>&#8226; Ultimately, Jesus&#8212;Son of David and Lord of Jacob&#8212;gathers both Jew and Gentile into one household of faith (<a href="/acts/15-16.htm">Acts 15:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/acts/7-46.htm">Acts 7:46</a> celebrates David as a man graced by God, whose heartfelt request sprang from a passion to honor the Lord with a permanent sanctuary. While the temple pointed Israel to God&#8217;s abiding presence, it also foreshadowed the greater dwelling place realized in Christ and in His people. God&#8217;s favor, our response of worship, the longing for His nearness, and the unbroken covenant line from Jacob to David to Jesus&#8212;all converge in this single sentence, reminding us that the Lord still delights to make His home among those who seek Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(46) <span class= "bld">Who found favour before God.</span>--Again we trace, though still in the form of a narrative, an indirect answer to the accusation brought against Stephen. He was ready to acknowledge without reserve that the Temple was planned by the man after God's own heart, and built by the wisest of the sons of men. But the question still remained whether it was therefore the symbol of a final and perfect worship, whether it did not bear witness to its own incompleteness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="accented">In</span> <span class="accented">the sight of</span> for <span class="accented">before</span>, A.V.
