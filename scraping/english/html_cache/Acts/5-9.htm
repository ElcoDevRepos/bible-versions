In biblical context, "testing the Spirit" refers to challenging or doubting God's omniscience and authority. This echoes the sin of Israel in the wilderness, where they tested God despite witnessing His miracles (<a href="/exodus/17-2.htm">Exodus 17:2</a>, <a href="/psalms/95-9.htm">Psalm 95:9</a>). The Holy Spirit, as part of the Trinity, is fully God, and to test Him is to question His divine nature and power. This incident underscores the early church's emphasis on holiness and integrity, as deceit within the community was seen as a direct affront to God.<p><b>Peter replied.</b><br>Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples and a leader in the early church, is the speaker. His role as an apostle gives him authority to address sin within the community. Historically, Peter's leadership is crucial in the formative years of the church, as seen in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a> with the Pentecost sermon. His response here is not just personal but represents the church's stance on sin and truthfulness.<p><b>Look, the feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door,</b><br>This phrase serves as a prophetic declaration and a stark warning. The mention of "the feet of the men" indicates the immediacy and certainty of the judgment. In the cultural context of the time, burial was often swift, especially in the hot climate of the Middle East, to prevent decay. The quick succession of events emphasizes the seriousness of the sin and the swift justice of God. The imagery of the feet at the door suggests that God's judgment is imminent and unavoidable.<p><b>and they will carry you out also.</b><br>This final phrase confirms the impending judgment on Sapphira, mirroring the fate of her husband, Ananias. It serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of sin, particularly deceit against God. The early church was marked by a strong sense of community and accountability, and this incident reinforced the need for honesty and integrity. Theologically, it reflects the holiness of God and the seriousness with which He views sin, especially within His church. This event also serves as a type of divine judgment, foreshadowing the ultimate judgment that will come upon all humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles, a leader in the early church, and the speaker in this passage.
