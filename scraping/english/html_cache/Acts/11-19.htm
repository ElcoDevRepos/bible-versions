This event marked a significant turning point for the early church, as it led to widespread persecution of Christians in Jerusalem. The scattering of believers fulfilled Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be His witnesses "in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth." This dispersion, though initially a result of persecution, was used by God to spread the Gospel beyond the confines of Jerusalem.<p><b>traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch</b><br>Phoenicia was a coastal region north of Israel, known for its major cities like Tyre and Sidon. Cyprus is an island in the eastern Mediterranean, significant in early Christian missions, as seen in <a href="/acts/13-4.htm">Acts 13:4-12</a>. Antioch, located in modern-day Turkey, was a major city of the Roman Empire and became a central hub for early Christianity. The spread of the Gospel to these areas indicates the geographical expansion of the early church and the fulfillment of the Great Commission.<p><b>speaking the message only to Jews</b><br>Initially, the early Christians, who were predominantly Jewish, focused their evangelistic efforts on fellow Jews. This reflects the early church's understanding of the Gospel as a continuation of God's covenant with Israel. However, this approach would soon change, as seen later in <a href="/acts/11-20.htm">Acts 11:20-21</a>, where some began to preach to Gentiles. This shift was pivotal in the church's mission, aligning with prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of salvation reaching the ends of the earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>A deacon in the early church whose martyrdom marked the beginning of a significant persecution against Christians in Jerusalem.

Philip we have traced in Samaria and Caesarea; others went to Ph?nice, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to the cities of Tyre and Sidon and Ptolemais, and were probably the founders of the churches which we find there in <a href="/context/acts/21-4.htm" title="And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.">Acts 21:4-7</a>; <a href="/acts/27-3.htm" title="And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go to his friends to refresh himself.">Acts 27:3</a>. In Cyprus (see Note on <a href="/acts/13-4.htm" title="So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed to Seleucia; and from there they sailed to Cyprus.">Acts 13:4</a>, for an account of the island) they prepared the way for the work of Barnabas and Paul.<p><span class= "bld">And Antioch.</span>--We have here the first direct point of contact between the Church of Christ and the great Syrian capital which was for so many years one of its chief centres. We may, perhaps, think of the proselyte of Antioch (<a href="/acts/6-5.htm" title="And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:">Acts 6:5</a>) who had been one of Stephen's colleagues as one of those who brought the new faith to his native city. It was, as the sequel shows, a moment of immense importance. Situated on the Orontes, about fifteen miles from the port of Seleucia, the city, founded by Seleucus Nicator, and named after his father Antiochus, had grown in wealth and magnificence till it was one of the "eyes" of Asia. Its men of letters and rhetoricians (among them the poet Archias, in whose behalf Cicero made one of his most memorable orations) had carried its fame to Rome itself, and the Roman Satirist complained that the Syrian Orontes had polluted his native Tiber with the tainted stream of luxury and vice (Juvenal, <span class= "ital">Sat. iii.</span> 62-64). It had a large colony of Jews, and Herod the Great had courted the favour of its inhabitants by building a marble colonnade which ran the whole length of the city. It became the head-quarters of the Prefect or President of Syria, and the new faith was thus brought into more direct contact with the higher forms of Roman life than it had been at Jerusalem or Caesarea. There also it came into more direct conflict with heathenism in its most tempting and most debasing forms. The groves of Daphne, in the outskirts of the city, were famous for a worship which in its main features resembled that of Aphrodite at Corinth. An annual festival was held, known as the <span class= "ital">Maiuma, </span>at which the harlot-priestesses, stripped of clothing, disported themselves in the waters of a lake. The city was stained with the vices of a reckless and shameless sensuality. It was as one of the strongholds of Satan; and we have to trace, as it were, the stages of the victory which transformed it into the mother-church of the Gentiles. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> <span class="accented">- They therefore that</span> for <span class="accented">now they which</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">tribulation</span> for <span class="accented">persecution</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Phoenicia</span> for <span class="accented">Phenice</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">speaking</span> for <span class="accented">preaching</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">save only to Jews</span> for <span class="accented">but unto the Jews only</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Scattered abroad</span>; as in <a href="/acts/8-1.htm">Acts 8:1</a>, to which point of time the narrative now reverts. <span class="cmt_word">Tribulation</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>).

There was a large population of Jews, whom Seleucus attracted to his new city by giving them equal political privileges with the Greeks. It was reckoned by Josephus to be the third city in importance of the whole Roman empire, Rome and Alexandria being the two first. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/11-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Meanwhile,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
