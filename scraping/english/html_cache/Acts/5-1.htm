This name appears several times in the New Testament, indicating its popularity. The character of Ananias in this passage is significant as it contrasts with the meaning of his name, highlighting the theme of hypocrisy and deceit. The story of Ananias and Sapphira serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of lying to the Holy Spirit and the community of believers.<p><b>together with his wife Sapphira</b><br>Sapphira, whose name means "beautiful" or "sapphire," is introduced alongside her husband, indicating their joint involvement in the actions that follow. The mention of both husband and wife emphasizes the unity in their decision and the shared responsibility for their actions. This partnership in deceit contrasts with the ideal of a godly marriage, which should be based on truth and integrity.<p><b>also sold a piece of property</b><br>The act of selling property was common in the early church, as believers were encouraged to share their resources to support one another (<a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32-37</a>). This practice was voluntary, and the proceeds were often laid at the apostles' feet for distribution. The word "also" suggests that Ananias and Sapphira were following the example of others, such as Barnabas, who had sold land and donated the proceeds to the community. However, their subsequent actions reveal a lack of sincerity and a desire for personal gain or recognition, contrasting with the genuine generosity of others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ananias.htm">Ananias</a></b><br>A member of the early Christian community in Jerusalem.

God values truthful hearts above impressive appearances, and this single verse begins a narrative that will underscore the seriousness of pretending in matters of faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">V.</span><p>(1, 2) A certain man named Ananias.--The name meets us again as belonging to the high priest in <a href="/acts/23-2.htm" title="And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.">Acts 23:2</a>, and was the Greek form of the Hebrew Hananiah. It had the same significance as John, or Johanan, "The Lord be gracious." "Sapphira," is either connected with the "sapphire," as a precious stone, or from a Hebrew word signifying "beautiful" or "pleasant." The whole history must be read in connection with the act of Barnabas. He, it seemed, had gained praise and power by his self-sacrifice. Ananias thought that he could get at the same result more cheaply. The act shows a strange mingling of discordant elements. Zeal and faith of some sort had led him to profess himself a believer. Ambition was strong enough to win a partial victory over avarice; avarice was strong enough to triumph over truth. The impulse to sell came from the Spirit of God; it was counteracted by the spirit of evil, and the resulting sin was therefore worse than that of one who lived altogether in the lower, commoner forms of covetousness. It was an attempt to serve God and mammon; to gain the reputation of a saint, without the reality of holiness. The sin of Ananias is, in some aspects, like that of Gehazi (<a href="/context/2_kings/5-20.htm" title="But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD lives, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.">2Kings 5:20-27</a>), but it was against greater light and intensified by a more profound hypocrisy, and it was therefore visited by a more terrible chastisement. We may well trace in the earnestness with which St. James warns men against the peril of the "double mind"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the heart divided between the world and God (<a href="/james/1-8.htm" title="A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.">James 1:8</a>; <a href="/james/4-8.htm" title="Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double minded.">James 4:8</a>)--the impression made on him by such a history as this.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ananias</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) In <a href="/nehemiah/3-23.htm">Nehemiah 3:23</a> the Hebrew name <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (God covers or protects) is thus rendered in the LXX.
