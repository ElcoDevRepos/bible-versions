In <a href="/acts/19.htm">Acts 19</a>, this assembly took place in Ephesus, a major city in the Roman province of Asia, known for its temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The turmoil arose due to the impact of Paul's ministry, which threatened the local economy tied to the worship of Artemis. This reflects the tension between the spread of Christianity and established pagan practices. The word "turmoil" indicates confusion and disorder, highlighting the chaotic nature of the gathering, reminiscent of other biblical instances where crowds were stirred up, such as during Jesus' trial (<a href="/mark/15-11.htm">Mark 15:11-15</a>).<p><b>Some were shouting one thing and some another,</b><br>This phrase illustrates the confusion and lack of unity among the crowd. The shouting signifies a lack of clear leadership or purpose, a common occurrence in mob situations. This mirrors the chaotic scenes in other parts of Scripture, such as the confusion at the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-7.htm">Genesis 11:7-9</a>), where a lack of understanding led to division. The shouting also reflects the spiritual blindness and confusion that can occur when people are led by emotions rather than truth.<p><b>and most of them did not even know why they were there.</b><br>This highlights the irrationality and impulsiveness of the crowd, driven by emotion rather than reason. It underscores the influence of mob mentality, where individuals act without understanding the cause or purpose. This can be compared to the crowd's behavior during Jesus' crucifixion, where many were swayed by the chief priests and elders without fully understanding the implications (<a href="/matthew/27-20.htm">Matthew 27:20-23</a>). The phrase serves as a caution against being swept up in collective hysteria without discernment or knowledge.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly.htm">The Assembly</a></b><br>This refers to the crowd gathered in Ephesus, a city known for its temple to the goddess Artemis.
