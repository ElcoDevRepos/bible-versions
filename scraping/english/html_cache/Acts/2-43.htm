The "sense of awe" reflects a deep reverence and fear of God, often associated with His manifest presence. In the Old Testament, similar reactions are seen when God reveals Himself, such as at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). This awe is not merely emotional but a recognition of God's holiness and power. The early church's unity and devotion, as described earlier in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, contributed to this atmosphere of reverence.<p><b>and the apostles performed many wonders and signs</b><br>The apostles' ability to perform "wonders and signs" is a testament to the authority and power given to them by Jesus Christ. These miracles served as divine validation of their message and ministry, similar to how Jesus' miracles confirmed His identity and mission (<a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30-31</a>). The term "wonders and signs" is often used in Scripture to describe acts that reveal God's power and provoke amazement, as seen in the miracles performed by Moses in Egypt (Exodus 7-11). These acts were not just displays of power but were meant to point people to the truth of the Gospel and the reality of the Kingdom of God. The apostles' miracles fulfilled Jesus' promise that they would do greater works (<a href="/john/14-12.htm">John 14:12</a>) and were a continuation of His ministry on earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The primary leaders of the early church, chosen by Jesus, who were empowered by the Holy Spirit to perform miracles and teach the gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_believers.htm">Early Believers</a></b><br>The community of new Christians who were witnessing the apostles' works and experiencing the growth of the early church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events took place, significant as the center of Jewish worship and the location of the early church's beginnings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wonders_and_signs.htm">Wonders and Signs</a></b><br>Miraculous acts performed by the apostles, serving as divine confirmation of their message and authority.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sense_of_awe.htm">Sense of Awe</a></b><br>The reverential fear and amazement experienced by the people as they witnessed the apostles' works.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Power of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The apostles' ability to perform wonders and signs was a direct result of the Holy Spirit's empowerment.
