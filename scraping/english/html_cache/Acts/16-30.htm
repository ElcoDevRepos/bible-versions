The context is a miraculous event where an earthquake opened the prison doors and loosened the chains of the prisoners. The jailer, fearing the prisoners had escaped, was about to take his own life, but Paul intervened. The act of bringing them out signifies a shift from physical imprisonment to spiritual inquiry. Philippi was a Roman colony, and the jailer would have been a Roman citizen, highlighting the spread of the Gospel beyond Jewish communities.<p><b>and asked,</b><br>The act of asking indicates a moment of desperation and realization. The jailer, having witnessed the power of God through the earthquake and the integrity of Paul and Silas, is moved to seek answers. This reflects a common biblical theme where individuals, after witnessing divine intervention, seek understanding and salvation. It parallels other instances in Scripture where people inquire about spiritual matters after witnessing miracles, such as Nicodemus approaching Jesus in <a href="/john/3.htm">John 3</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Sirs,</b><br>The term "Sirs" is a respectful address, acknowledging the authority and wisdom of Paul and Silas. In the cultural context of the Roman world, respect for authority and hierarchy was significant. The jailer&#8217;s use of this term indicates his recognition of something extraordinary in Paul and Silas, despite their status as prisoners. This respect is a precursor to his openness to their message.<p><b>what must I do</b><br>This question reflects a personal responsibility and desire for action. It echoes the rich young ruler's question to Jesus in <a href="/matthew/19-16.htm">Matthew 19:16</a>, "What good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?" It underscores the human inclination to seek a formula or action for salvation, which is a common theme throughout Scripture. The question implies a readiness to change and a recognition of personal inadequacy.<p><b>to be saved?&#8221;</b><br>The concept of salvation is central to Christian theology, encompassing deliverance from sin and its consequences. In the New Testament, salvation is often linked to faith in Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9-10</a>. The jailer&#8217;s question indicates an awareness of his need for spiritual rescue, not just physical safety. This moment is pivotal, as it leads to the proclamation of the Gospel to him and his household, fulfilling the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>. The question also reflects the universal human quest for meaning and redemption, a theme that resonates throughout the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_silas.htm">Paul and Silas</a></b><br>Two apostles of Jesus Christ who were imprisoned in Philippi for casting out a spirit from a slave girl.

We ask what the gaoler meant by the question. Was he thinking of temporal safety from the earthquake, or from punishment; or had there come upon him, in that suicidal agony, the sense of an inward misery and shame, a "horror of great darkness" from which he sought deliverance? The latter seems every way most probable. It must be remembered that the very circumstances which had brought St. Paul to the prison had pointed him out as "proclaiming the way of salvation" (<a href="/acts/16-17.htm" title="The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which show to us the way of salvation.">Acts 16:17</a>).
