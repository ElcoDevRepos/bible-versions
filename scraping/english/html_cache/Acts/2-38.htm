His response is to a crowd gathered during Pentecost, a Jewish festival. This moment follows the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, which fulfills Jesus' promise in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>. Peter's role as a spokesperson highlights his leadership and the fulfillment of Jesus' words in <a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18-19</a>.<p><b>Repent</b><br>Repentance is a call to turn away from sin and change one's mind and heart towards God. It is a consistent theme throughout Scripture, seen in the messages of John the Baptist (<a href="/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>) and Jesus (<a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>). Repentance is foundational for entering the Kingdom of God and is a prerequisite for receiving forgiveness and salvation.<p><b>and be baptized</b><br>Baptism is an outward expression of an inward change, symbolizing the believer's identification with the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>). It was practiced by John the Baptist and commanded by Jesus in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). Baptism serves as a public declaration of faith and commitment to follow Christ.<p><b>every one of you</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the universality of the call to repentance and baptism. It is inclusive, extending the invitation to all individuals, regardless of their background or status. This aligns with the message of the Gospel being for all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>) and the breaking down of barriers between Jew and Gentile (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>).<p><b>in the name of Jesus Christ</b><br>Baptism in the name of Jesus Christ signifies allegiance to Him and acknowledgment of His authority. It reflects the early church's understanding of Jesus as the Messiah and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies (Isaiah 53, <a href="/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25-26</a>). The name of Jesus carries power and is central to salvation (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>).<p><b>for the forgiveness of your sins</b><br>Forgiveness is a core aspect of the Gospel, made possible through Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>). It restores the broken relationship between humanity and God, fulfilling the promise of a new covenant (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>). Forgiveness is both a legal and relational act, removing the penalty of sin and reconciling believers to God.<p><b>and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit</b><br>The Holy Spirit is promised to all believers as a gift, marking the new era of the church. This gift empowers, guides, and sanctifies Christians (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>, <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, and signifies the believer's adoption into God's family (<a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, Peter is the speaker in this verse.

There is the same indispensable condition of "repentance"--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span> a change of heart and will--the same outward rite as the symbol of purification, the same promise of forgiveness which that change involves. But the baptism is now, as it had not been before, in the name of Jesus Christ, and it is connected more directly with the gift of the Holy Spirit. The question presents itself, Why is the baptism here, and elsewhere in the Acts (<a href="/acts/10-48.htm" title="And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.">Acts 10:48</a>; <a href="/acts/19-5.htm" title="When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.">Acts 19:5</a>), "in the name of Jesus Christ," while in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a>, the Apostles are commanded to baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit? Various explanations have been given. It has been said that baptism in the Name of any one of the Persons of the Trinity, involves the Name of the other Two. It has even been assumed that St. Luke meant the fuller formula when he used the shorter one. But a more satisfactory solution is, perhaps, found in seeing in the words of <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a> (see Note there) the formula for the baptism of those who, as Gentiles. had been "without God in the world, not knowing the Father;" while for converts from Judaism, or those who had before been proselytes to Judaism, it was enough that there should be the distinctive profession of their faith in Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God, added on to their previous belief in the Father and the Holy Spirit. In proportion as the main work of the Church of Christ lay among the Gentiles, it was natural that the fuller form should become dominant, and finally be used exclusively. It is interesting here, also, to compare the speech of St. Peter with the stress laid on baptism in his Epistle (<a href="/1_peter/3-21.htm" title="The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:">1Peter 3:21</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</span>--The word for "gift" (<span class= "ital">dorea</span>) is generic, and differs from the more specific "gift" (<span class= "ital">charisma</span>) of <a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm" title="Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.">1Corinthians 12:4</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-9.htm" title="To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;">1Corinthians 12:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-28.htm" title="And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.">1Corinthians 12:28</a>. The Apostle does not necessarily promise startling and marvellous powers, but in some way they should all feel that a new Spirit was working in them, and that that Spirit was from God. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">said</span> (in italics) for said, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">repent ye</span> for <span class="accented">repent</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">unto</span> for <span class="accented">for</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">your sins</span> for <span class="accented">sins</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Repent</span>, etc. We have in this short verse the summary of Christian doctrine as regards man and God. Repentance and faith on the part of man; forgiveness of <span class="accented">sins</span>, or justification, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, or sanctification, on the part of God. And both these are expressed in the sacrament of baptism, which as it were ties the act of man to the promise of God. For the sacrament expresses man's faith and repentance on one side, and God's forgiveness and gift on the other. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/2-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Peter</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Petros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4074.htm">Strong's 4074: </a> </span><span class="str2">Peter, a Greek name meaning rock.
