His role as a spokesperson is consistent with his character throughout the Gospels and Acts. This moment follows the significant event of Cornelius's conversion, marking a pivotal shift in the early church's mission to include Gentiles. Peter's leadership is crucial in navigating this transition.<p><b>and explained to them</b><br>Peter's explanation is vital for the Jewish believers in Jerusalem who were skeptical about Gentile inclusion. His approach reflects the importance of clear communication and understanding within the early church. This act of explaining aligns with the biblical principle of providing a reasoned account of one's actions, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>, where believers are encouraged to give a reason for their hope.<p><b>the whole sequence of events:</b><br>Peter recounts the vision he received in Joppa, the visit from Cornelius's men, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the Gentiles. This sequence underscores the divine orchestration of events, affirming God's plan for the Gentiles. The narrative parallels the structure of Old Testament storytelling, where events unfold according to God's sovereign will, as seen in the stories of Joseph and Moses.

The almost verbal repetition of the same narrative as that of Acts 10 seems, at first sight, inconsistent with our common standard of skill in composition. The probable explanation of it is that St. Luke obtained the first narrative from the disciples whom he met at Caesarea, and the second from those of Jerusalem, and that the close agreement of the two seemed to him, as indeed it was, a confirmation of the truth of each.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- Began and expounded the matter unto them in order</span> for <span class="accented">rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them</span>, A.V. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/11-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Peter</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Petros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4074.htm">Strong's 4074: </a> </span><span class="str2">Peter, a Greek name meaning rock.
