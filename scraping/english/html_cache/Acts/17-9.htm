Their message stirred both interest and opposition. Jason, a local believer, had offered them hospitality. The phrase "collected bond" indicates a legal requirement imposed by the city authorities. This bond was likely a financial guarantee ensuring that Jason and the others would not cause further disturbances. In the Roman legal system, such bonds were common to maintain public order. This action reflects the tension between the early Christian movement and the established social order. The authorities sought to prevent further unrest without resorting to harsher penalties. This incident highlights the cost of discipleship and the risks faced by early Christians. The bond served as a temporary solution to appease the agitated crowd and maintain peace.<p><b>and then released them</b><br>The release of Jason and the others signifies a temporary resolution to the conflict. By posting bond, they were able to secure their freedom, albeit with the understanding that they would ensure no further disturbances. This reflects the Roman emphasis on maintaining civic order and the pragmatic approach of the authorities in dealing with new religious movements. The release also allowed the early church to continue its mission, albeit with increased caution. This event parallels other instances in Acts where believers faced legal challenges but were often released, such as Peter and John in <a href="/acts/4.htm">Acts 4</a>. The release underscores the theme of divine providence and protection over the early church, allowing the gospel to spread despite opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jason.htm">Jason</a></b><br>A believer in Thessalonica who provided hospitality to Paul and Silas.
