This reflects the cultural norms of hospitality in the ancient Mediterranean world, where strangers were often treated with respect and generosity. The Greek word used here for "honored" can also imply respect and reverence, indicating that the islanders held Paul and his companions in high regard, possibly due to the miraculous healing of Publius's father and others on the island (<a href="/acts/28-8.htm">Acts 28:8-9</a>). This act of honoring aligns with the biblical principle of showing hospitality to strangers, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>.<p><b>and supplied our needs</b><br>The islanders provided for the physical necessities of Paul and his companions, which would have included food, clothing, and possibly other supplies needed for their journey. This act of provision is reminiscent of God's promise to supply the needs of His people, as seen in <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>. It also reflects the communal nature of early Christian communities, where believers shared resources to meet each other's needs (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>).<p><b>when we were ready to sail</b><br>This phrase indicates a transition from their time on the island to the continuation of their journey to Rome. The readiness to sail suggests that the ship was repaired or a new vessel was secured, and the weather conditions were favorable for travel. This moment marks the fulfillment of God's promise to Paul that he would testify in Rome (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>). The journey to Rome is significant as it represents the spread of the Gospel to the heart of the Roman Empire, fulfilling the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who was shipwrecked on the island of Malta.

Far from treating the shipwrecked strangers with suspicion, they extended remarkable kindness. Their response echoes God&#8217;s pattern of using unexpected people to bless His servants:<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/41-38.htm">Genesis 41:38-41</a> &#8211; Pharaoh elevates Joseph.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_kings/17-9.htm">1 Kings 17:9-16</a> &#8211; A Gentile widow provides for Elijah.<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/10-33.htm">Luke 10:33-34</a> &#8211; A Samaritan shows mercy to an injured Jew.<p>God delights in demonstrating that common grace reaches even those with no prior exposure to the gospel, and He positions them to participate in His redemptive plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>honored us</b><p>Honor here involves tangible respect and public recognition. The Maltese acknowledged Paul and his companions as worthy guests after witnessing divine power (Paul&#8217;s survival of the snakebite, <a href="/acts/28-3.htm">Acts 28:3-6</a>; the healing of Publius&#8217;s father, vv. 7-8). Similar moments of God-initiated honor appear throughout Acts:<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/13-48.htm">Acts 13:48</a> &#8211; Gentiles honor the word of the Lord.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/16-34.htm">Acts 16:34</a> &#8211; The Philippian jailer welcomes Paul and Silas into his home.<p>Such honor testifies that God vindicates His servants (<a href="/john/12-26.htm">John 12:26</a>) and opens doors for the gospel through evident acts of compassion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in many ways</b><p>The phrase shows that their generosity was varied, sustained, and abundant. Hospitality in Scripture is rarely one-dimensional:<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a> &#8211; &#8220;Share with the saints who are in need; practice hospitality.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-11.htm">2 Corinthians 9:11</a> &#8211; &#8220;You will be enriched in every way to be generous on every occasion.&#8221;<p>On Malta, provision likely ranged from food and clothing to shelter and companionship for the full three-month stay (<a href="/acts/28-11.htm">Acts 28:11</a>). God&#8217;s people today can mirror this multifaceted care, recognizing that needs come in layers&#8212;physical, emotional, relational, and spiritual.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and supplied our needs</b><p>The islanders did more than show courtesy; they met every practical requirement for the next leg of the journey. Scripture often links God&#8217;s mission with His faithful provision:<p>&#8226; <a href="/philippians/4-16.htm">Philippians 4:16, 19</a> &#8211; &#8220;You sent me aid again and again&#8230; And my God will supply all your needs.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-14.htm">2 Corinthians 8:14</a> &#8211; &#8220;At the present time your surplus will supply their need.&#8221;<p>The Maltese, though outside the covenant community, became God&#8217;s instruments so that Paul could continue toward Rome, proving that the Lord &#8220;owns the cattle on a thousand hills&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10</a>) and can channel resources through anyone He chooses.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when we were ready to sail</b><p>Timing matters. Provision arrived precisely when departure approached, underscoring God&#8217;s meticulous care. Parallel moments include:<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/21-5.htm">Acts 21:5</a> &#8211; Believers escort Paul to the ship, praying on the beach.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/20-36.htm">Acts 20:36-38</a> &#8211; The Ephesian elders accompany Paul to the dock with tears and support.<p>Each scene highlights that God equips His servants right up to the moment of launch. He is never early or late, ensuring that obedience is matched with sufficiency (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/28-10.htm">Acts 28:10</a> showcases the Lord&#8217;s sovereign ability to raise up unexpected partners, bestow honor on His witnesses, supply every need in diverse ways, and time His provision perfectly. The Maltese people&#8217;s generosity reminds us that God&#8217;s mission advances through ordinary acts of kindness directed by His extraordinary hand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Who also honoured us with many honours.</span>--It lies in the nature of the case that the honours took the form of gifts. The very word was, indeed, specially applied, both in Greek and Latin, to the <span class= "ital">honorarium, </span>or fee, paid to the physician, and its use here is accordingly characteristic of St. Luke's calling. (Comp. <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/38-1.htm" title="Honour a physician with the honour due unto him for the uses which ye may have of him: for the Lord hath created him.">Ecclesiasticus 38:1</a>.) In addition to these gifts of courtesy, the things that were wanted for their voyage--clothing, provisions, and the like--were freely supplied at their departure.<p><span class= "bld">When we departed.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">as we were setting sail.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="accented">- Sailed</span> for <span class="accented">departed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">put on board</span> for <span class="accented">laded us with</span>, A.V.; we <span class="accented">needed</span> for were <span class="accented">necessary</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Honored us with many honors</span>. Kuinoel understands this in the sense of "gifts, presents," which of course their destitute condition, after losing all they had in the ship-wreck, would make very acceptable. But there is nothing in the words to suggest this meaning, and, had it been so, Luke would have simply stated it, as he does immediately afterwards, when he says that they put on board such things as we needed. <span class="cmt_word">When we sailed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); see <a href="/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13</a>; <a href="/acts/16-11.htm">Acts 16:11</a>; <a href="/acts/18-21.htm">Acts 18:21</a>; <a href="/acts/20-3.htm">Acts 20:3, 13</a>; <a href="/acts/21-1.htm">Acts 21:1, 2, 4, 12, 21</a>, and notes.
