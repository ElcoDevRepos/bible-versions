The term "elders" refers to mature, spiritually qualified leaders responsible for teaching, shepherding, and overseeing the church. This practice aligns with Jewish synagogue traditions where elders played a significant role. The appointment of elders by Paul and Barnabas indicates a structured approach to church governance, ensuring continuity and stability. This practice is echoed in other New Testament passages, such as <a href="/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a> and <a href="/1_timothy/3.htm">1 Timothy 3:1-7</a>, which outline the qualifications and responsibilities of church leaders.<p><b>praying and fasting</b><br>Prayer and fasting were integral to the decision-making process in the early church, reflecting a dependence on divine guidance. This spiritual discipline is seen throughout Scripture, such as in the ministry of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>) and the early church's commissioning of missionaries (<a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2-3</a>). Fasting, often coupled with prayer, signifies earnestness and humility before God, seeking His will and blessing for the task at hand. This practice underscores the seriousness with which Paul and Barnabas approached the appointment of church leaders.<p><b>as they entrusted them to the Lord</b><br>Entrusting the newly appointed elders to the Lord signifies a recognition of God's ultimate authority and care over the church. This act of entrustment reflects a deep faith in God's sovereignty and provision. It parallels the biblical theme of committing one's work to the Lord, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-3.htm">Proverbs 16:3</a>. By entrusting the elders to God, Paul and Barnabas acknowledge that the success and growth of the church depend on divine guidance and protection.<p><b>in whom they had believed</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the faith of the early Christians in the Lord Jesus Christ. The foundation of their belief is the gospel message preached by Paul and Barnabas, which centered on the death and resurrection of Jesus. This belief is not merely intellectual assent but a transformative trust in Christ as Savior and Lord. The phrase connects to the broader New Testament theme of faith as the means of salvation, as articulated in passages like <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a> and <a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9-10</a>.

In <a href="/acts/10-41.htm" title="Not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.">Acts 10:41</a> a compound form of the verb is translated "chosen of God," and clearly excludes any action but that of the divine will. Used, as it is here, of the act of the two Apostles, not of the Church, the latter meaning seems most in harmony with the context. There may have been, as in <a href="/acts/6-3.htm" title="Why, brothers, look you out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.">Acts 6:3</a>, a previous election; or the names of those who were to be appointed may have been submitted to the approval of the Church; but the word cannot in itself be held to imply either. On the institution of elders, see Note on <a href="/acts/11-30.htm" title="Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.">Acts 11:30</a>. It is interesting here to note (1) that Paul and Barnabas, by virtue of the authority which as Apostles they had received, primarily from Christ (<a href="/galatians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)">Galatians 1:1</a>) and mediately from the Church of Antioch (<a href="/acts/13-3.htm" title="And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.">Acts 13:3</a>), exercised the right of appointing, or, in later phrase, ordaining elders. (2) They plant among the Churches of the Gentiles the organisation which we have found in that of Jerusalem, and which was itself based on that of the Synagogue, not on that of the Temple. (3) As this appears as the first appointment, it would seem to follow that the disciples had in the meantime met, and taught, and baptised, and broken bread without them. Organisation of this kind was, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>important for the permanence of the life of the Church as such, but not essential to its being, or to the spiritual growth of individual members. (4) It will be remembered that the "elders" so appointed were the same as those who, in the Apostolic Church, were known as "bishops" or "overseers (<span class= "ital">episcopi</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>what we call distinctive episcopal functions being reserved for the Apostles, or for their personal representatives (<a href="/1_timothy/4-16.htm" title="Take heed to yourself, and to the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this you shall both save yourself, and them that hear you.">1Timothy 4:16</a>; <a href="/titus/1-5.htm" title="For this cause left I you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you:">Titus 1:5</a>; see Note on <a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> <span class="accented">- Appointed for them</span> for <span class="accented">ordained them</span>, A.V.

In the choice of an apostle the election was by lot (<a href="/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>), in the appointment of deacons the choice was by the people, how indicated we are not told (<a href="/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>); the question here, on which commentators disagree, is whether the use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> indicates voting by the people, selection by the apostles, or simple creation or appointment. As <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is predicated of Paul and Barnabas, it cannot possibly refer to voting by the people, who are included in the <span class="accented">able</span>, as those on whose behalf the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> was made.
