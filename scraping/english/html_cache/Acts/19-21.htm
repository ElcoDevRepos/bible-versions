This context highlights the spiritual awakening and opposition Paul faced, setting the stage for his future plans.<p><b>Paul resolved in the Spirit</b><br>Paul's decision was not merely a personal desire but was guided by the Holy Spirit. This indicates a deep spiritual conviction and alignment with God's will, reflecting the importance of seeking divine guidance in decision-making. It underscores the role of the Holy Spirit in directing the early church's mission.<p><b>to go to Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship and the location of the early church's beginnings.

This statement foreshadows his eventual journey to Rome, where he would witness and minister, as detailed in <a href="/acts/28.htm">Acts 28</a>.

The spirit which formed the purpose was in communion with the Divine Spirit. (See Notes on <a href="/acts/17-16.htm" title="Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.">Acts 17:16</a>; <a href="/acts/18-5.htm" title="And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.">Acts 18:5</a>.)<p>We learn from the First Epistle to the Corinthians what were the chief antecedents of this purpose. There had been intercourse, we may believe, more or less frequent, with the churches of both Macedonia and Achaia during the two years which St. Paul had spent at Ephesus; and there was much to cause anxiety. It had been necessary for him to send a letter, not extant, to warn the Corinthians against their besetting impurity (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-9.htm" title="I wrote to you in an letter not to company with fornicators:">1Corinthians 5:9</a>). The slaves or freed-men of Chloe had brought tidings of schisms, and incestuous adulteries, and grave disorders in ritual and discipline. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction to the First Epistle to the Corinthians.</span>) These things called for the Apostle's presence. With these was joined another purpose. He wished to revisit Jerusalem, and to appear there as the bearer of a munificent contribution from the Gentile churches to the suffering church of the Hebrews.
