It served as the Roman administrative capital of Judea. The arrival of the horsemen here signifies the importance of the mission, as Caesarea was a hub of Roman political and military power. This location is also where Peter baptized Cornelius, the first Gentile convert, marking a pivotal moment in the spread of the Gospel (Acts 10).<p><b>they delivered the letter to the governor</b><br>The governor referred to here is Antonius Felix, the Roman procurator of Judea. Letters were a common means of communication in the Roman Empire, often used to convey official orders or information. This letter, written by Claudius Lysias, the Roman commander in Jerusalem, was intended to explain the circumstances of Paul's arrest and the need for his protection. The delivery of such a letter underscores the legal and bureaucratic processes of the Roman government, which played a crucial role in the unfolding of Paul's missionary journey and eventual trial.<p><b>and presented Paul to him</b><br>Paul's presentation to the governor marks a significant moment in his legal trials. This act of presenting a prisoner to a higher authority was customary in Roman legal proceedings. It highlights the transition of Paul's case from a local to a provincial level, reflecting the broader theme of the Gospel's movement from Jerusalem to the ends of the earth (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). Paul's trials before Roman authorities also fulfill Jesus' prophecy that His followers would stand before governors and kings as witnesses (<a href="/matthew/10-18.htm">Matthew 10:18</a>).
