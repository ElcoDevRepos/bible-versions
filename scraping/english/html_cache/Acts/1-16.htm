His role as the betrayer of Jesus is seen as a fulfillment of specific Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in Psalms, which are interpreted as foreshadowing his actions.<p><b>who became a guide for those who arrested Jesus.</b><br>Judas's betrayal is depicted as a pivotal event leading to Jesus's arrest and subsequent crucifixion. This act is seen as a necessary part of the redemptive plan, fulfilling prophecies about the Messiah's suffering and death.

To do that work faithfully was a worthier fruit of repentance than any public confession of his guilt would have been.

It is most important to our Christian integrity that we should view the Scriptures in the same light as our Lord and his apostles did, as containing real prophecies, spoken by the Holy Ghost. (Compare the manner in which the sixty-ninth psalm is here quoted with that of <a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7</a>.)
