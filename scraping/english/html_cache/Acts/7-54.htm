Stephen had just delivered a powerful sermon recounting Israel's history and accusing the Jewish leaders of resisting the Holy Spirit, similar to their ancestors. His words were a direct challenge to their authority and spiritual condition, echoing the prophetic tradition of calling Israel to repentance.<p><b>the members of the Sanhedrin</b><br>The Sanhedrin was the supreme religious council in Jerusalem, composed of chief priests, elders, and scribes. It held significant authority over Jewish religious and civil matters. This body had previously condemned Jesus to death and was now confronting His followers, indicating the continuity of opposition to the early Christian movement.<p><b>were enraged</b><br>The Greek term used here conveys intense emotional turmoil, suggesting a deep-seated anger and frustration. This reaction highlights the conviction and truth of Stephen's message, which exposed the Sanhedrin's spiritual blindness and hypocrisy. Their rage is reminiscent of the anger directed at prophets like Jeremiah and Elijah, who also faced hostility for speaking God's truth.<p><b>and they gnashed their teeth at him</b><br>Gnashing of teeth is a biblical expression of extreme anger and hostility, often associated with judgment and condemnation. This imagery is used in the Old Testament and by Jesus in the Gospels to describe the anguish of those who reject God's message. The Sanhedrin's reaction foreshadows the judgment they would face for rejecting the Messiah and His messengers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>A deacon in the early church, known for his wisdom and filled with the Holy Spirit.
