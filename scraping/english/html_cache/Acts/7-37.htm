His life and actions are foundational to Jewish identity and faith. In <a href="/acts/7.htm">Acts 7</a>, Stephen is addressing the Sanhedrin, emphasizing Moses' role as a precursor to Christ. Moses is often seen as a type of Christ, a deliverer and mediator between God and His people.<p><b>who told the Israelites</b><br>Moses communicated God's laws and promises to the Israelites, acting as an intermediary. His role as a prophet was to guide and instruct the people according to God's will. The Israelites, descendants of Jacob, were the chosen people through whom God intended to reveal His plan of salvation.<p><b>&#8216;God will raise up for you a prophet like me</b><br>This prophecy is found in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, where Moses speaks of a future prophet. This is understood as a messianic prophecy, pointing to Jesus Christ. Like Moses, Jesus would be a leader, teacher, and mediator. The phrase "like me" suggests that this prophet would have a similar role in delivering God's message and leading His people.<p><b>from among your brothers.&#8217;</b><br>The prophet would arise from among the Israelites, indicating that he would be one of their own, sharing their heritage and understanding their struggles. This emphasizes Jesus' humanity and His connection to the Jewish people.

That prophet is Jesus: raised up by God, born within Israel, speaking God&#8217;s very words, and mediating a superior covenant. By citing this verse, Stephen declares that rejecting Jesus means rejecting the very fulfillment Moses promised, while embracing Him aligns us with the consistent, unbroken witness of Scripture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up.</span>--The parallelism previously suggested is now distinctly proclaimed, and shown to be a fulfilment of the prediction of <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm" title="I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brothers, like to you, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him.">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>.

The definite application of the words by St. Peter determined their bearing here. At this point we may reasonably think of the members of the Sanhedrin as catching the drift of his discourse, and showing signs of excitement, the effect of which is, perhaps, traceable in the greater compression of the narrative that follows.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> <span class="accented">- God</span> for <span class="accented">the Lord your God</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">from among</span> for <span class="accented">of</span>, A.V.
