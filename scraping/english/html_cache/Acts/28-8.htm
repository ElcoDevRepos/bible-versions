The mention of his father being sick highlights the personal nature of the narrative and sets the stage for a miraculous event. The fact that he was bedridden suggests a serious illness, which would have been a cause for concern in a time without modern medical interventions.<p><b>suffering from fever and dysentery</b><br>The symptoms described are consistent with what is known today as "Malta fever," caused by the Brucella bacteria, which was common in the region due to the consumption of unpasteurized milk. This detail provides historical and medical context, illustrating the real and tangible nature of the affliction. The specific mention of the illness underscores the severity of the condition and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>Paul went in to see him</b><br>Paul's willingness to visit the sick man demonstrates his compassion and readiness to serve others, reflecting the teachings of Jesus to care for the sick and needy. This action also shows Paul's boldness and faith, as he enters a potentially contagious environment without fear, trusting in God's protection and power.<p><b>and after praying</b><br>Prayer is a central element in the healing process, emphasizing reliance on God's power rather than human ability. This act of prayer aligns with the biblical principle that healing comes from God, and it reflects the practice of seeking divine guidance and intervention before taking action.<p><b>and placing his hands on him</b><br>The laying on of hands is a biblical practice associated with healing, blessing, and the impartation of the Holy Spirit. This gesture symbolizes the transfer of God's power and authority through His servant, Paul. It also serves as a physical demonstration of faith and connection, reinforcing the communal and relational aspects of Christian ministry.<p><b>he healed the man</b><br>The healing of Publius's father is a testament to the power of God working through Paul, affirming his apostolic authority and the truth of the Gospel message. This miracle would have had a profound impact on the local population, serving as a sign of God's presence and favor. It also echoes the healing ministry of Jesus, who often healed the sick as a demonstration of the Kingdom of God.

It is also spoken of as an accompaniment of prayer in confirmation, ordination, etc. It has been remarked as curious that the two actions of taking up serpents and healing the sick by the laying on of hands should be in such close juxtaposition both here and in <a href="/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a>. It suggests the thought whether Luke had seen the passage in St. Mark; or whether the writer of <a href="/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a> had seen <a href="/acts/28-8.htm">Acts 28:8</a>.
