In biblical narratives, angels often serve as messengers of God, bringing guidance, comfort, or instruction. This encounter emphasizes the direct communication between God and His chosen servants, highlighting the importance of divine intervention in critical moments.<p><b>&#8216;Do not be afraid, Paul;</b><br>Fear is a common human response in perilous situations, and Paul, despite his strong faith, is no exception. The reassurance "Do not be afraid" is a frequent biblical exhortation, appearing in various contexts where God encourages His people to trust in His protection and plan (e.g., <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>, <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). This phrase underscores God's awareness of human emotions and His desire to provide comfort and assurance.<p><b>you must stand before Caesar.</b><br>This statement reveals God's sovereign plan for Paul to testify in Rome, fulfilling the prophecy given to him earlier (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>). Standing before Caesar signifies not only a legal trial but also an opportunity for Paul to witness to the highest authority in the Roman Empire. This aligns with the broader theme of Acts, where the gospel spreads from Jerusalem to the ends of the earth (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><b>And look,</b><br>The word "look" serves as an attention-grabbing device, emphasizing the significance of the following statement. It indicates a shift in focus to a new, important piece of information that underscores God's providence and care.<p><b>God has granted you the lives of all who sail with you.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase highlights God's mercy and the power of intercessory prayer. Paul's presence on the ship brings divine favor to all aboard, reminiscent of how the presence of the righteous can bring blessings to others (<a href="/genesis/18-32.htm">Genesis 18:32</a>). It also reflects the biblical principle that God often spares many for the sake of a few faithful individuals. This assurance of safety for all passengers demonstrates God's control over nature and history, reinforcing the theme of divine sovereignty throughout the book of Acts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle and central figure in this passage, who is on his way to Rome to stand trial before Caesar.

The words that follow imply that his prayer had not been bounded by his own interests, but had included those who were sharing the danger with him. We are reminded, as by the parallelism of contrast, of the words in which Caesar bade the pilot of his ship not to fear, but to commit himself to the wind, seeing that he carried "Caesar and the fortune of Caesar" (Plutarch, <span class= "ital">de Fortun.
