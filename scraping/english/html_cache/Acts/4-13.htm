This transformation is attributed to the empowerment of the Holy Spirit, which they received at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2:1-4</a>). Boldness in the face of opposition is a recurring theme in Acts, demonstrating the apostles' commitment to their mission (<a href="/acts/4-29.htm">Acts 4:29, 31</a>). This boldness is also a fulfillment of Jesus' promise that the Holy Spirit would give them the words to speak when they faced persecution (<a href="/luke/12-11.htm">Luke 12:11-12</a>).<p><b>and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men</b><br>The term "unschooled" indicates that Peter and John had not received formal rabbinical training, which was highly valued in Jewish society. This highlights the divine nature of their wisdom and understanding, as it was not derived from human education but from their relationship with Jesus and the Holy Spirit's guidance. The description of them as "ordinary" underscores the idea that God often chooses the humble and lowly to accomplish His purposes, as seen throughout Scripture (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>).<p><b>they marveled</b><br>The reaction of marveling suggests that the religious leaders were astonished by the apostles' knowledge and authority, which seemed disproportionate to their background. This amazement is a recurring response to Jesus' own teachings and miracles (<a href="/mark/6-2.htm">Mark 6:2</a>, <a href="/luke/4-22.htm">Luke 4:22</a>), indicating that the apostles were continuing His work and ministry with similar impact.<p><b>and took note that these men had been with Jesus</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the transformative power of being in the presence of Jesus. The apostles' association with Jesus was evident in their speech, actions, and understanding of Scripture. It also serves as a testament to the authenticity of their message, as they were eyewitnesses to Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. This connection to Jesus is a key theme in Acts, as the apostles' authority and mission are directly linked to their relationship with Him (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8, 2</a>:32).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter_and_john.htm">Peter and John</a></b><br>Two of Jesus' apostles who were known for their boldness in preaching the gospel.

That "boldness of speech" had been characteristic of his Lord's teaching (<a href="/mark/8-32.htm" title="And he spoke that saying openly.
