The Egyptians were known for their advanced knowledge in various fields such as mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and architecture. This education would have equipped Moses with skills and knowledge that were crucial for his later leadership of the Israelites. The wisdom of the Egyptians is also a testament to the providence of God, preparing Moses for his future role. This background is significant as it contrasts with the divine wisdom he later receives from God, highlighting the transformation from worldly to spiritual leadership.<p><b>and was powerful in speech and action.</b><br>Despite Moses' later protestations of being "slow of speech" (<a href="/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10</a>), this phrase indicates that he was initially recognized for his eloquence and effectiveness. This could refer to his ability to communicate and lead, skills that were essential for his mission to liberate the Israelites. The phrase "powerful in action" underscores his capability to execute plans and lead people, foreshadowing his role in the Exodus. This duality of speech and action is a type of Christ, who is described as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>) and who performed mighty works.

The narrative of Josephus (as above) and the references in the New Testament to Jannes and Jambres as the magicians who withstood Moses (<a href="/2_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.">2Timothy 3:8</a>), and to the dispute of Michael and Satan as to his body (<a href="/jude/1-9.htm" title="Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke you.">Jude 1:9</a>), indicate the wide acceptance of some such half-legendary history. The passage is instructive, (1) as an indirect plea on the part of Stephen, like that afterwards made by Clement of Alexandria (<span class= "ital">Strom. </span>i. 5, ? 28; 6:5, ? 42) and Justin (<span class= "ital">Dial. c. Tryph.</span> c. 1-4)<span class= "ital">, </span>for the recognition of heathen wisdom as an element in the divine education of mankind; (2) as having contributed to fix the attention of the more cultivated and scholarly of the early Christian critics, such as those named, and Origen, and Jerome, and Augustine, on the teaching of Greek poets and philosophers, and having furnished them with a sanction for such studies.<p><span class= "bld">Mighty in words and in deeds.</span>--Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> ii. 10), still following the same traditional history, relates that Moses commanded the Egyptian forces in a campaign against the Ethiopians, and protected them against the serpents that infected the country, by transporting large numbers of the ibis that feeds on serpents. The romance was completed by the marriage of Moses with the daughter of the Ethiopian king who had fallen passionately in love with him. This was possibly a development of the brief statement in <a href="/numbers/12-1.htm" title="And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.">Numbers 12:1</a>. The language of Moses (<a href="/exodus/4-10.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since you have spoken to your servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.">Exodus 4:10</a>), in which he speaks of himself as "not eloquent" and "slow of speech," seems at first inconsistent with "mighty in words," but may fairly be regarded as simply the utterance of a true humility shrinking from the burden of a mighty task.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> <span class="accented">- Instructed</span> for <span class="accented">learned</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">he was mighty</span> for <span class="accented">was mighty</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">in his words and works</span> for <span class="accented">in words and in deeds</span>, A.V. and T.R.
