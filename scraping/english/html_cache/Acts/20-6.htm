It commemorates the Israelites' exodus from Egypt and their haste in leaving, which did not allow time for their bread to rise. This timing indicates that Paul and his companions were observing Jewish customs, reflecting the early church's connection to Jewish traditions. The feast's symbolism of purity and separation from sin can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the sinless "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>we sailed from Philippi</b><br>Philippi was a Roman colony in Macedonia, notable for being the first European city where Paul established a church (<a href="/acts/16-12.htm">Acts 16:12-40</a>). The use of "we" suggests that the author, Luke, was present, indicating an eyewitness account. Philippi's strategic location on the Via Egnatia made it a key city for spreading the Gospel in Europe. The departure from Philippi after the feast suggests a careful planning of travel to align with religious observances.<p><b>and five days later we rejoined them in Troas</b><br>Troas, a port city in the northwest of Asia Minor, was an important location for Paul's missionary journeys. The journey taking five days may reflect adverse sailing conditions or stops along the way. Troas is significant in Acts as the place where Paul received the vision of the man of Macedonia (<a href="/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9</a>), which led to the Gospel's spread into Europe. The rejoining of the group indicates a coordinated effort in their missionary work.<p><b>where we stayed seven days</b><br>The seven-day stay in Troas allowed Paul to engage deeply with the local believers, as seen in the subsequent verses where he preaches and performs a miracle (<a href="/acts/20-7.htm">Acts 20:7-12</a>). The number seven often symbolizes completeness and perfection in the Bible, suggesting a full and meaningful time of ministry. This period also allowed for the observance of the Lord's Day, highlighting the early church's practice of gathering on the first day of the week.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is on his missionary journey, spreading the Gospel and strengthening the early church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philippi.htm">Philippi</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where Paul had previously established a church.

The reunion highlights coordinated ministry and mutual care (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Troas had already been a strategic launch point for the gospel into Europe (<a href="/acts/16-8.htm">Acts 16:8-10</a>).

The verse quietly testifies that God directs both the grand sweep of redemption history and the ordinary details of travel schedules and weather. As we trace Paul&#8217;s steps we learn to order our own days around God&#8217;s calendar, trust Him in every delay, and make room for unhurried fellowship that strengthens Christ&#8217;s church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And came unto them to Troas in five days.</span>--The voyage from Troas to Philippi (see Notes on <a href="/context/acts/16-11.htm" title="Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;">Acts 16:11-12</a>) had taken only three days, but the ship had now to contend against the south-west current that set in from the Dardanelles, and probably also against the Etesian winds blowing from the north-east that prevail in the Archipelago in the spring.<p><span class= "bld">Where we abode seven days.</span>--It lies on the surface that the motive for this stay was to keep the Lord's day (the name was probably already current; see <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10</a>), and to partake with the Church of what, even before the date of this journey, St. Paul had already spoken of as the Lord's Supper (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.">1Corinthians 11:20</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> <span class="accented">- Tarried</span> for <span class="accented">abode</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">We</span>; distinctly marking that Luke, the author of the narrative, whom we left at Philippi (<a href="/acts/16-13.htm">Acts 16:13, 14</a>), joined him again at the same place. Renan (p. 498) well remarks, "At Philippi Paul once more met the disciple who had guided him for the first time to Macedonia. He attached him to his company again, and thus secured as his companion in the voyage the historian who was to write an account of it, with such infinite charm of manner and such perfect truth."
