This obedience to Jesus' command highlights the importance of Jerusalem as the starting point for the spread of the Gospel (<a href="/luke/24-47.htm">Luke 24:47</a>).<p><b>they went to the upper room</b><br>The "upper room" is traditionally understood as a large room on the second floor of a house, often used for gatherings. This may be the same room where the Last Supper took place (<a href="/luke/22-12.htm">Luke 22:12-13</a>). It served as a private and secure meeting place for the disciples during a time of uncertainty and transition.<p><b>where they were staying</b><br>This indicates that the apostles had made this upper room their temporary residence. It suggests a period of waiting and preparation, as they anticipated the coming of the Holy Spirit, as promised by Jesus (<a href="/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4-5</a>).<p><b>Peter and John, James and Andrew</b><br>These names represent the core group of Jesus' disciples, often mentioned together in the Gospels. Peter and John were part of Jesus' inner circle, witnessing key events such as the Transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1</a>). James and Andrew, brothers of John and Peter respectively, were among the first called by Jesus (<a href="/matthew/4-18.htm">Matthew 4:18-22</a>).<p><b>Philip and Thomas</b><br>Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Peter and Andrew (<a href="/john/1-44.htm">John 1:44</a>). He is known for bringing Nathanael to Jesus (<a href="/john/1-45.htm">John 1:45-46</a>). Thomas, also called Didymus, is famously known for his initial doubt about Jesus' resurrection (<a href="/john/20-24.htm">John 20:24-29</a>), which led to a profound confession of faith.<p><b>Bartholomew and Matthew</b><br>Bartholomew is often identified with Nathanael, who was brought to Jesus by Philip (<a href="/john/1-45.htm">John 1:45-49</a>). Matthew, also known as Levi, was a tax collector before following Jesus (<a href="/matthew/9-9.htm">Matthew 9:9</a>). His inclusion highlights the diverse backgrounds of the apostles.<p><b>James son of Alphaeus</b><br>This James is sometimes referred to as "James the Less" to distinguish him from James, the brother of John. Little is known about him, but his presence underscores the varied and often humble origins of the apostles.<p><b>Simon the Zealot</b><br>Simon is identified as a Zealot, indicating his previous association with a Jewish political movement that sought to overthrow Roman rule. His transformation into a follower of Christ exemplifies the unifying power of the Gospel.<p><b>and Judas son of James</b><br>Also known as Thaddaeus or Lebbaeus, this Judas is distinct from Judas Iscariot, the betrayer of Jesus.

The room may have been the same as that in which the Paschal Supper had been eaten (<a href="/mark/14-15.htm" title="And he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.">Mark 14:15</a>). On the other hand, that room seems to have been different from that in which the disciples had lodged during the Paschal week, and to have been chosen specially for the occasion (<a href="/luke/22-8.htm" title="And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.">Luke 22:8</a>). The word used is also different in form. So far as we are able to distinguish between the two words, the room of the Paschal Supper was on the first floor, the guest-chamber, used for meals; that in which the disciples now met, on the second floor, or loft, which was used for retirement and prayer. It would seem from <a href="/luke/24-53.htm" title="And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.">Luke 24:53</a>, that they spent the greater part of each day in the Temple, and met together in the evening. The better MSS. give "prayer" only, without "supplication." The prayer thus offered may be thought of as specially directed to the "promise of the Father." Whether it was spoken or silent, unpremeditated or in some set form of words, like the Lord's Prayer, we have no <span class= "ital">data</span> to determine.<p><span class= "bld">Peter, and James.</span>--On the lists of the Twelve Apostles see Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/10-2.htm" title="Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;">Matthew 10:2-4</a>. The points to be noticed are--(1) that Andrew stands last in the group of the first four, divided from his brother, thus agreeing with the list in St. Mark (<a href="/mark/3-17.htm" title="And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:">Mark 3:17</a>); (2) that Philip is in like manner divided from Bartholomew, and Thomas from Matthew; (3) that Zelotes appears here, as in <a href="/luke/6-15.htm" title="Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,">Luke 6:15</a>, instead of the Cananaean. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="accented">The upper chamber</span> for <span class="accented">an upper room</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">where they were abiding</span> for <span class="accented">where abode</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">son of James</span> for <span class="accented">brother of James</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The upper chamber</span>; perhaps the same room where they had eaten the Passover with Christ (<a href="/luke/22-12.htm">Luke 22:12</a>); but this is very uncertain, though affirmed by Epiphanius, and by Nicephorus, who further relates that the very house in which the upper chamber was built into the back part of the temple which the Empress Helena erected on Mount Sion.

Where they were abiding. A slight change in the order of the words, as adopted in the text of the R.V., makes Peter and the other apostles the nominative case to the verb "went up," instead of, as in the A.V., to "abode." In regard to the list of the apostles which follows, it may be noticed first, that it is identical with that of <a href="/luke/6-14.htm">Luke 6:14-16</a>, except in the omission of Judas Iscariot and the order in which the apostles are named. The order in Luke seems to have followed that of natural birth and association. The brothers, Peter and Andrew, James and John, are classed together; Philip and Bartholomew, or Nathanael, go together, and so on. But in this list John follows Peter, his close companion in missionary work (<a href="/acts/3-1.htm">Acts 3:1</a>, etc.; Acts 4:12; 8:14); James follows instead of preceding John; and others are classed somewhat differently, for reasons probably analogous, but which we know not. Of the other lists that in <a href="/mark/3-16.htm">Mark 3:16-19</a> agrees most nearly with that before us. In all, Simon Peter stands <span class="accented">first.</span> The Jude of <a href="/luke/6-16.htm">Luke 6:16</a> (comp. <a href="/jude/1-1.htm">Jude 1:1</a>) and <a href="/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a> is called <span class="accented">Thaddaeus</span> in <a href="/matthew/10-3.htm">Matthew 10:3</a> (" Lebbaeus whose surname was Thaddaeus," A.V.) and in <a href="/mark/3-18.htm">Mark 3:18</a>; but no doubt the persons are the same. In all the lists Philip stands fifth. In three Bartholomew is sixth, while in the list in Acts his being named after Thomas makes him seventh. In all the lists James the son of Alphaeus is ninth, and Judas Iscariot the last, except in the Acts, where he is not named, being already dead.
