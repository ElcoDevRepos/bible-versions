Gathering together was a common practice for early Christians, reflecting Jewish traditions of communal worship and study. This setting underscores the unity and shared purpose among the disciples as they awaited further instructions from Jesus.<p><b>He commanded them</b><br>The use of "commanded" highlights the authority of Jesus over His disciples. This is not a mere suggestion but a directive from their risen Lord. It reflects the obedience expected of followers of Christ, aligning with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18-20</a>, where Jesus instructs His disciples to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>Do not leave Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem holds significant historical and theological importance. It is the city where Jesus was crucified and resurrected, and it is the center of Jewish worship. By instructing the disciples to remain in Jerusalem, Jesus is setting the stage for the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a> and <a href="/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>, which speak of the word of the Lord going forth from Jerusalem.<p><b>but wait for the gift the Father promised</b><br>The "gift" refers to the Holy Spirit, as promised in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>) and reiterated by Jesus in <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>.
