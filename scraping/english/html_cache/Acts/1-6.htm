This phrase indicates a physical assembly, likely in Jerusalem, where the disciples were instructed to wait for the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4</a>). The unity of the disciples is a recurring theme in Acts, emphasizing the importance of communal faith and shared mission.<p><b>they asked Him</b><br>The disciples' question to Jesus shows their direct communication and relationship with Him. It reflects their ongoing learning process and desire for understanding. This interaction highlights the disciples' expectation of Jesus' role and the fulfillment of God's promises. It also underscores the importance of seeking divine guidance and wisdom.<p><b>&#8220;Lord, will You at this time</b><br>The use of "Lord" acknowledges Jesus' authority and divinity. The phrase "at this time" indicates the disciples' anticipation of an imminent event. This reflects their understanding of prophetic timelines and their hope for the fulfillment of messianic prophecies. The disciples were aware of the Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah and the restoration of Israel, such as those found in Isaiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>restore the kingdom to Israel?&#8221;</b><br>The concept of restoring the kingdom to Israel is rooted in Jewish eschatological hopes. The disciples were expecting a political and national restoration, reminiscent of the Davidic kingdom. This expectation is tied to prophecies like those in <a href="/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11-15</a> and <a href="/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10-12</a>, which speak of a future restoration and peace. The question reveals a common misunderstanding of the nature of Jesus' kingdom, which He later clarifies as spiritual rather than political. This expectation of restoration is also linked to the covenant promises made to Abraham and David, emphasizing God's faithfulness to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are gathered with Him.
