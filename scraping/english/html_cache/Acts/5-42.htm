This daily activity underscores the urgency and importance of spreading the gospel, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>, where believers met daily with one accord.<p><b>in the temple courts</b><br>The temple courts were a central place for Jewish worship and teaching in Jerusalem, providing a strategic location for the apostles to reach a large audience. This setting highlights the apostles' boldness in proclaiming Jesus as the Messiah in a place deeply rooted in Jewish tradition and law, as seen in <a href="/acts/3-11.htm">Acts 3:11</a> and <a href="/acts/4.htm">Acts 4:1-2</a>.<p><b>and from house to house</b><br>The early Christians also met in private homes, indicating the intimate and personal nature of their fellowship and teaching. This practice reflects the communal aspect of the early church, as described in <a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46-47</a>, and foreshadows the house church movement that would become essential in the spread of Christianity.<p><b>they did not stop</b><br>The apostles' perseverance in the face of persecution and opposition is a testament to their unwavering faith and commitment. This phrase emphasizes their resilience and determination, as seen in <a href="/acts/4-18.htm">Acts 4:18-20</a>, where they boldly declare their intention to continue speaking about Jesus despite threats.<p><b>teaching and proclaiming</b><br>The dual focus on teaching and proclaiming indicates a comprehensive approach to spreading the gospel. Teaching involves instructing believers in the faith, while proclaiming refers to the public declaration of the gospel message. This mirrors Jesus' own ministry, as seen in <a href="/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>, where He taught in synagogues and proclaimed the good news.<p><b>the good news</b><br>The "good news" refers to the gospel message of salvation through Jesus Christ. This message is central to the Christian faith and is rooted in the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, which speaks of bringing good news to the poor.<p><b>that Jesus is the Christ</b><br>Proclaiming Jesus as the Christ affirms His role as the promised Messiah, fulfilling prophecies such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>. This declaration is foundational to Christian belief, as it acknowledges Jesus' divine nature and His fulfillment of God's redemptive plan, as seen in Peter's confession in <a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The primary figures in this passage, the apostles were the early followers of Jesus who were tasked with spreading His teachings. They were committed to their mission despite facing persecution.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_courts.htm">Temple Courts</a></b><br>A central place of worship and gathering in Jerusalem, the temple courts were significant for Jewish religious life. The apostles used this public space to reach a wide audience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_to_house.htm">House to House</a></b><br>This phrase indicates the apostles' dedication to personal and intimate evangelism. They took the message of Jesus into private homes, emphasizing the personal nature of the Gospel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/teaching_and_proclaiming.htm">Teaching and Proclaiming</a></b><br>These actions highlight the dual approach of the apostles. "Teaching" involves explaining and instructing in the faith, while "proclaiming" refers to announcing the good news of Jesus as the Messiah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_as_the_christ.htm">Jesus as the Christ</a></b><br>The central message of the apostles' teaching was that Jesus is the Messiah, the anointed one promised in the Hebrew Scriptures.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/consistency_in_witnessing.htm">Consistency in Witnessing</a></b><br>The apostles' daily commitment to teaching and proclaiming the Gospel serves as a model for believers to consistently share their faith, regardless of circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/public_and_private_evangelism.htm">Public and Private Evangelism</a></b><br>The dual approach of using both public spaces and private homes for evangelism highlights the importance of being versatile and adaptable in sharing the Gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/centrality_of_christ.htm">Centrality of Christ</a></b><br>The focus on Jesus as the Christ underscores the necessity of keeping the message of Jesus central in all teaching and evangelism efforts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_amidst_opposition.htm">Perseverance Amidst Opposition</a></b><br>Despite facing persecution, the apostles did not cease their mission.
