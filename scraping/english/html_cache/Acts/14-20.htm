The disciples' gathering around Paul after he was stoned and left for dead in Lystra (<a href="/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a>) demonstrates the early Christian practice of communal care and prayer. This reflects the teachings of Jesus on the importance of fellowship and support within the body of Christ (<a href="/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>). The act of gathering could also imply prayer for Paul's recovery, reminiscent of the early church's prayer for Peter's release from prison (<a href="/acts/12-5.htm">Acts 12:5</a>).<p><b>he got up</b><br>Paul's recovery and ability to stand up after being stoned is seen as a miraculous event, suggesting divine intervention. This act of getting up can be compared to the resurrection power of Christ, who rose from the dead, symbolizing victory over death and suffering. It also echoes the resilience and perseverance that Paul often speaks about in his letters, such as in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8-9</a>, where he describes being "struck down, but not destroyed."<p><b>and went back into the city</b><br>Paul's return to Lystra, the very place where he was attacked, demonstrates his courage and commitment to his mission. This action reflects the teachings of Jesus about loving one's enemies and turning the other cheek (<a href="/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>). It also highlights Paul's dedication to spreading the Gospel despite persecution, as he later writes in <a href="/romans/8-35.htm">Romans 8:35-39</a> about the inseparability of believers from the love of Christ, even in the face of hardship.<p><b>And the next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe</b><br>This phrase marks the continuation of Paul and Barnabas's missionary journey. Derbe was a city in the region of Lycaonia, part of modern-day Turkey. The journey to Derbe signifies the spread of the Gospel to new territories, fulfilling the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). The partnership between Paul and Barnabas exemplifies the biblical principle of working together in ministry, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9-10</a>, which speaks of the benefits of companionship and mutual support. Their mission in Derbe would further establish the early church and strengthen the believers in that region.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A key apostle in the early church, known for his missionary journeys and spreading the Gospel to the Gentiles.
