The crowd's reaction highlights the impact of witnessing a miracle, which often led to amazement and misunderstanding. Miracles in the early church served as signs to authenticate the message of the apostles, similar to the miracles performed by Jesus (<a href="/john/14-11.htm">John 14:11</a>). The crowd's response also reflects a common human tendency to focus on the miraculous rather than the message.<p><b>they lifted up their voices in the Lycaonian language</b><br>The use of the Lycaonian language indicates the local cultural context of Lystra, a city in the Roman province of Galatia. This detail underscores the diversity of languages and cultures in the ancient world, which the apostles encountered in their missionary journeys. The fact that the crowd spoke in their native tongue suggests that Paul and Barnabas may not have immediately understood their reaction, leading to a temporary misunderstanding.<p><b>&#8220;The gods have come down to us in human form!&#8221;</b><br>This exclamation reveals the pagan beliefs prevalent in Lystra, where the people were influenced by Greco-Roman mythology. The idea of gods taking human form was common in ancient myths, such as the stories of Zeus and Hermes. This belief contrasts with the Christian doctrine of the Incarnation, where God became man in the person of Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The crowd's declaration also echoes the misunderstanding of Jesus' identity during His ministry, where people often failed to recognize His divine nature (<a href="/john/10-33.htm">John 10:33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>An apostle of Jesus Christ, who was instrumental in spreading the Gospel to the Gentiles.

Their excitement shows how quickly people recognize supernatural power yet misattribute it without sound teaching. <a href="/acts/14-11.htm">Acts 14:11</a> reminds us that genuine works of God demand clear proclamation of the gospel so observers honor the Lord, not idols.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Saying in the speech of Lycaonia.</span>--The fact is clearly recorded with a definite purpose, and no explanation seems so natural as that which assumes it to be given as accounting for the passive attitude of the Apostles till what was then said had borne its fruit in acts. It will be admitted by all who are not under the influence of a theory that this serves almost as a crucial instance, showing that the "gift of tongues," which St. Paul possessed so largely (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-18.htm" title="I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than you all:">1Corinthians 14:18</a>), did not consist in a supernatural knowledge of every provincial <span class= "ital">patois</span> with which he came in contact. (See Note on <a href="/acts/2-4.htm" title="And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.">Acts 2:4</a>.) It is clear that he might easily have learnt afterwards, from those who knew both languages, the meaning of what at the time was unintelligible. To suppose, as some have done, that the Apostles, understanding what was said, acquiesced in the preparations for sacrifice in order that they might afterwards make their protest as with a greater dramatic effect, is at variance with the natural impression made by the narrative, and, it need scarcely be said, with any worthy conception of St. Paul's character. The diglottic character of the people, here and in other Asiatic provinces of the empire, would make it perfectly natural that they should speak to one another in their own dialect, while Greek served for their intercourse with strangers. The "speech of Lycaonia" is said to have had affinities with Assyrian.<p><span class= "bld">The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the gods, made like unto men, are come down to us.</span> The belief which the words expressed was characteristic of the rude simplicity of the Lycaonians. No such cry would have been possible in the great cities where the confluence of a debased polytheism and philosophical speculation had ended in utter scepticism. And the form which the belief took was in accordance with the old legends of the district. There, according to the <span class= "ital">Myth</span> which Ovid had recently revived and adorned (<span class= "ital">Metam.</span> viii. 625-724), Zeus and Hermes (Jupiter and Mercury) had come in human guise, and been received by Baucis and Philemon (St. Paul's Epistle to Philemon shows that the name lingered in that region), and left tokens of their favour. We find from the poem just referred to that the place where they had dwelt was looked on as a shrine to which devout worshippers made their pilgrimages, and where they left their votive offerings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="accented">- Multitudes</span> for <span class="accented">people</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">voice</span> for <span class="accented">voices</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">In the speech of Lycaonia</span>. It is not known what the language of Lycaonia was, whether Cappadocian, or Celtic, or Lycian; but we learn incidentally from Stephanus Byzantinus, that there was a Lycaonian language, for he tells us that <span class="accented">Delbia</span> (<span class="accented">as</span> some write the name Derbe) was the Lycaonian for <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a juniper tree or berry. No other Lycaonian word is known (see "Jablouskii Disquis. de Ling. Lycaon," in Stephan., 'Thesaur.'). The Lycaoniaus doubtless understood Greek as the language of intercommunication all over Roman Asia, but among themselves would speak their native dialect. The belief that <span class="cmt_word">the gods were come down in the likeness of men</span>, and that these gods were Jupiter and Hermes, or Mercury, was most natural to Lycaonians, who were conversant with, and doubtless believed, the Phrygian legend of Philemon and Baucis, who entertained hospitably Jupiter and Hermes, when no one else would take them in, and whose cottage was by the gods turned into a temple (when all the neighborhood was drowned by a flood), of which they were made priest and priestess during life, and simultaneously metamorphosed into an oak and lime tree when their life ended (Ovid, 'Metamorph.,'8:611, etc.). Ovid places the scene of the legend at Tyana, the site of which has been ascertained by Hamilton to be near Erekli, in Cappadocia, close to the borders of Lycaonia. The moral drawn in the legend itself seems to have been that which influenced the people of Lycaonia in their conduct towards the two strangers: "Cura pii dis sunt, et qui coluere coluntur," which may be Englished, "Them that honor me I will honor" (<a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/14-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(te)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5037.htm">Strong's 5037: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, both.
