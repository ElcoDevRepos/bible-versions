But they remembered that He had claimed it as His Father's house, that His zeal for that house had been as a consuming passion (<a href="/context/john/2-16.htm" title="And said to them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.">John 2:16-17</a>), and therefore they had attended its worship daily before the Day of Pentecost (<a href="/luke/24-53.htm" title="And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.">Luke 24:53</a>); and it was not less, but infinitely more, precious to them now, as the place where they could meet with God, than it had been in the days of ignorance, before they had known the Christ, and through Him had learnt to know the Father. The apparent strangeness of their being allowed to meet in the Temple is explained partly by the fact that its courts were open to all Israelites who did not disturb its peace, partly by the existence of a moderate half-believing party in the Sanhedrin itself, including Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathaea, and Gamaliel (<a href="/acts/5-35.htm" title="And said to them, You men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do as touching these men.">Acts 5:35</a>); and by the popularity gained for a time by the holiness and liberal almsgiving of the new community. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> <span class="accented">- Day by day continuing steadfastly</span> for <span class="accented">they continuing daily</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">at home for from house to house</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">they did take their food</span> for <span class="accented">did eat their meat</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">In the temple</span>. It is very remarkable that at this early age of the Church's existence Christians did not deem themselves separated from their Jewish brethren, or from the Old Testament institutions. Christianity was but Judaism perfected; the gospel the full blossoming of the Law. The first Christian Jews, therefore, did not conceive of themselves as quitting the religion of their fathers, but rather hoped that their whole nation would in a short time acknowledge Jesus to be the Christ. Christian institutions, therefore - the prayers, the breaking of bread, the prophesyings and speaking with tongues, and the apostolic teachings - were supplemental to the temple service, not antagonistic to it; and the church took the place rather of the synagogue than of the temple (see 'Dict. of Bible:' "Synagogue"). <span class="cmt_word">At home.</span> This version hardly represents the true idea of the original; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> represents the private Christian place of meeting, as contrasted with the temple. The meaning is not that every disciple broke bread in his own house, but that they broke bread at the house where the Christian assemblies were held, whether one or more. We have already seen the Church gathered together "in an upper room" (<a href="/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>), in "one place," in "a house" (<a href="/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1, 2</a>), and "together" (ver. 44; see too <a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>); and we know that as the synagogue was called <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, house of prayer, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5e1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>, the house of assemblage, so the Christian place of meeting was called <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; the Lord's house, whence the word "<span class="accented">church."</span> (For <span class="accented">breaking bread, see</span> above, ver. 42.) They did take their food. The link of connection is the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;</span> or love-feast, which formed an important part of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, or common life, of the early Christians. The whole description is a beautiful picture of Christian unity, piety, love, and joy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/2-46.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">With one accord</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#952;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#948;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(homothymadon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3661.htm">Strong's 3661: </a> </span><span class="str2">Adverb from a compound of the base of homou and thumos; unanimously.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they continued [to meet]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(proskarterountes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4342.htm">Strong's 4342: </a> </span><span class="str2">To persist, persevere in, continue steadfast in; I wait upon. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">daily</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;&#956;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;meran)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2250.htm">Strong's 2250: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day, the period from sunrise to sunset. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
