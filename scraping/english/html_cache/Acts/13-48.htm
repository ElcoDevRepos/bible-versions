The Gentiles' hearing of the message signifies the breaking of traditional Jewish boundaries, as the gospel is now being extended to all nations, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of being a light to the Gentiles. This moment marks a significant shift in the early church's mission strategy, emphasizing the inclusivity of the gospel.<p><b>they rejoiced</b><br>The Gentiles' rejoicing reflects their acceptance and appreciation of the message of salvation. This joy is a common response to the gospel throughout the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/acts/8-8.htm">Acts 8:8</a> with the Samaritans and in <a href="/acts/16-34.htm">Acts 16:34</a> with the Philippian jailer.

This act of glorification is a form of worship and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and grace. It parallels the response of the Thessalonians in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>, who accepted the word not as human words but as the word of God.<p><b>and all who were appointed for eternal life believed</b><br>This phrase touches on the theological concept of divine election, suggesting that those who believed were predestined by God for salvation. It aligns with passages like <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>, which speak of believers being chosen before the foundation of the world. This concept is central to understanding God's sovereignty in salvation, emphasizing that faith is a gift from God (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>) and that His purposes are fulfilled in those He calls.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who were present and listening to Paul and Barnabas.

It runs, with hardly any variation, through all the chief English versions, the Rhemish giving the stronger form "pre-ordinate." The Greek word, however, does not imply more than that they fell in with the divine order which the Jews rejected. They were as soldiers who take the place assigned to them in God's great army.
