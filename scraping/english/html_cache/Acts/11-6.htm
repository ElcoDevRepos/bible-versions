In biblical narratives, visions often require careful attention to discern their divine message. This reflects the need for spiritual discernment, as seen in other scriptural accounts such as Daniel's visions (Daniel 7) and John's Revelation (<a href="/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10-11</a>).<p><b>and saw four-footed animals of the earth</b><br>The mention of four-footed animals refers to creatures that were part of the dietary laws given to Israel in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>. These laws distinguished between clean and unclean animals. The vision challenges Peter's understanding of these laws, symbolizing the inclusion of Gentiles into the faith, as the gospel transcends Jewish ceremonial boundaries.<p><b>wild beasts</b><br>Wild beasts often symbolize untamed and unclean elements in biblical literature. In this context, they represent the Gentiles, who were considered outside the covenant community of Israel. This vision signifies the breaking down of barriers between Jews and Gentiles, aligning with Paul's teaching in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a> about Christ breaking down the dividing wall of hostility.<p><b>reptiles</b><br>Reptiles, like snakes and lizards, were considered unclean under Jewish law (<a href="/leviticus/11-29.htm">Leviticus 11:29-30</a>). Their inclusion in the vision emphasizes the radical nature of the new covenant, where traditional purity laws are reinterpreted in light of Christ's redemptive work. This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18-19</a>, where He declares all foods clean.<p><b>and birds of the air</b><br>Birds of the air, some of which were also deemed unclean (<a href="/leviticus/11-13.htm">Leviticus 11:13-19</a>), complete the vision's representation of all creation. This phrase underscores the comprehensive nature of God's redemptive plan, which includes all peoples and nations. It reflects the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>) and the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where salvation is extended to the ends of the earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle who is recounting his vision to the believers in Jerusalem.

His deliberate attention underscores that this was no fleeting dream. God wanted Peter to observe every detail (<a href="/acts/10-11.htm">Acts 10:11-16</a>). The Lord often calls His servants to &#8220;look carefully&#8221; so they can discern His will, as with Moses and the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-3.htm">Exodus 3:3-4</a>) and Jeremiah&#8217;s almond branch (<a href="/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11-12</a>). Peter&#8217;s careful gaze prepares him&#8212;and us&#8212;for a lesson that overturns long-held traditions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and saw four-footed animals of the earth</b><p>The sheet held ordinary livestock&#8212;creatures Israel commonly classified as clean or unclean (<a href="/leviticus/11-2.htm">Leviticus 11:2-8</a>). By including four-footed animals, God hints that both familiar and previously off-limits creatures are in view. This anticipates the broader revelation that Gentiles, once regarded as &#8220;outsiders,&#8221; are now welcomed through Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-13</a>). Just as Peter&#8217;s diet would expand, so would his mission field.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>wild beasts</b><p>These untamed animals symbolize nations and peoples Israel considered dangerous or defiling (<a href="/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3-6</a>). Yet God owns &#8220;the cattle on a thousand hills&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10</a>) and all wildlife (<a href="/job/12-7.htm">Job 12:7-10</a>). Their presence in the sheet proclaims God&#8217;s sovereign right to include those deemed wild&#8212;such as the Roman centurion Cornelius&#8212;within His covenant family (<a href="/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28, 34</a>-35).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>reptiles</b><p>Crawling creatures were explicitly forbidden to Israel (<a href="/leviticus/11-41.htm">Leviticus 11:41-44</a>). Their inclusion drives home the radical nature of the vision: nothing God cleanses remains unclean. Peter would later write, &#8220;It is not God&#8217;s will that any should perish&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>). The reptiles remind us that the gospel reaches the most unlikely people, for &#8220;where sin increased, grace abounded all the more&#8221; (<a href="/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and birds of the air</b><p>Birds span the spectrum from the majestic eagle to scavenging vultures (<a href="/leviticus/11-13.htm">Leviticus 11:13-19</a>). In Scripture they often picture both blessing and judgment (<a href="/genesis/8-8.htm">Genesis 8:8-12</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-4.htm">Matthew 13:4, 32</a>). Their appearance rounds out the vision&#8217;s totality: every category of creature&#8212;clean or unclean, noble or common&#8212;is enveloped in God&#8217;s redemptive plan. Peter would soon witness the Holy Spirit &#8220;fall on all who heard the word&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44-45</a>), just as Jesus promised (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/11-6.htm">Acts 11:6</a> unfolds in vivid layers so Peter&#8212;and we&#8212;grasp God&#8217;s sweeping declaration: through Christ, the former boundaries of ritual purity and ethnic separation have been abolished. By spotlighting four-footed animals, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds, the Lord shows that He alone defines what is clean and whom He will call. The vision readies the church to welcome Gentiles, illustrating that the gospel is for &#8220;every creature under heaven&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered.</span>--Here again we trace the same kind of vividness as in the previous verse.
