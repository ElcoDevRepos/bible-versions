This event occurs in Caesarea, a significant city in the Roman Empire, known for its diverse population and as a center of Roman administration. Peter's speech is a pivotal moment in the book of Acts, as it marks the first time the gospel is explicitly preached to Gentiles. The phrase indicates the immediacy and divine interruption of the Holy Spirit, emphasizing that God's work is not confined to human timing or completion of a sermon.<p><b>the Holy Spirit fell upon</b><br>The falling of the Holy Spirit is reminiscent of the events at Pentecost (Acts 2), where the Spirit descended upon the Jewish believers. This parallel signifies the inclusion of Gentiles into the new covenant community, breaking down the barriers between Jews and Gentiles. The Holy Spirit's descent is a fulfillment of Jesus' promise in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where He declared that His followers would receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon them. This event also echoes Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, which speak of God's Spirit being poured out on all people.<p><b>all who heard his message</b><br>The phrase "all who heard" underscores the universality of the gospel message. Cornelius, a Roman centurion, and his household represent the Gentile world, which was previously considered outside the scope of God's chosen people. This moment is a turning point in the early church, as it confirms that salvation through Jesus Christ is available to all, regardless of ethnic or cultural background. It aligns with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations. The inclusion of Gentiles fulfills the Abrahamic promise that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles, Peter is the central figure in this passage, delivering a message to the Gentiles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, who descends upon the Gentiles as Peter speaks.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cornelius'_household.htm">Cornelius' Household</a></b><br>The Gentile audience, including Cornelius, a Roman centurion, and his family and friends, who receive the Holy Spirit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/caesarea.htm">Caesarea</a></b><br>The location where this event takes place, a significant city in the Roman Empire and home to Cornelius.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who are the recipients of the Holy Spirit in this passage, marking a pivotal moment in the early Church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_the_gospel.htm">The Universality of the Gospel</a></b><br>The event in <a href="/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44</a> demonstrates that the Gospel is for all people, regardless of ethnic or cultural background.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit's descent upon the Gentiles signifies God's approval and the breaking of traditional barriers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_leading.htm">Obedience to God's Leading</a></b><br>Peter's willingness to speak to Gentiles shows the importance of following God's direction, even when it challenges societal norms.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">The Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>This event fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Spirit being poured out on all flesh, affirming the reliability of God's Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_the_body_of_christ.htm">Unity in the Body of Christ</a></b><br>The inclusion of Gentiles highlights the unity and diversity within the Church, calling believers to embrace all who come to faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_10_44_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 10:44?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Acts_10_44_Holy_Spirit_s_impartiality.htm">How does Acts 10:44 demonstrate the Holy Spirit's impartiality towards believers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Insights_on_God_s_timing_in_Acts_10_44.htm">What can we learn about God's timing from Acts 10:44?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Acts_10_44_Matthew_28_19-20_link.htm">How does Acts 10:44 relate to the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19-20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Be_more_open_to_the_Holy_Spirit.htm">How can we be more receptive to the Holy Spirit's work in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_stay_open_to_God_s_guidance.htm">What steps can we take to ensure we are open to God's guidance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Acts_10_44_Holy_Spirit_s_role_in_conversion.htm">How does Acts 10:44 demonstrate the Holy Spirit's role in early Christian conversion?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_Holy_Spirit_on_Gentiles_pre-baptism.htm">Why did the Holy Spirit descend on Gentiles in Acts 10:44 before baptism?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Acts_10_44_God_s_impartiality_shown.htm">What does Acts 10:44 reveal about God's impartiality towards Jews and Gentiles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_acts_10.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Acts 10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/proof_gentiles_got_holy_spirit,_tongues.htm">Acts 10:44&#8211;46 &#8211; Is there any archaeological or historical proof that Gentiles suddenly received the Holy Spirit and spoke in tongues?

As there is no mention here of the utterance of praise being in any other language than those with which the speakers were familiar, there is no ground for assuming that this feature of the Pentecostal gift was reproduced, and the jubilant ecstatic praise which was the essence of that gift must be thought of as corresponding to the phenomena described in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-7.htm" title="And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?">1Corinthians 14:7-9</a>.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/10-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[While] Peter</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(Petrou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4074.htm">Strong's 4074: </a> </span><span class="str2">Peter, a Greek name meaning rock.
