This setting is significant as it was a common place for teaching and gathering in the Temple area. Peter's readiness to address the people reflects the boldness and authority given to him by the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a> during Pentecost.<p><b>Men of Israel,</b><br>Peter addresses the crowd as "Men of Israel," acknowledging their shared heritage and covenant relationship with God. This phrase connects the audience to the patriarchs and the promises given to Israel, emphasizing their identity as God's chosen people.<p><b>why are you surprised by this?</b><br>The miracle of healing the lame man at the Beautiful Gate astonished the onlookers. Peter questions their surprise, suggesting that such acts should be expected as a continuation of Jesus' ministry. This reflects the fulfillment of prophecies and the power of God at work through the apostles.<p><b>Why do you stare at us</b><br>Peter redirects the attention from himself and John to God. This humility is consistent with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized servanthood and the glorification of God rather than self. It also serves as a reminder that the apostles are merely instruments of God's power.<p><b>as if by our own power or godliness</b><br>Peter clarifies that the miracle was not due to any inherent power or piety on their part. This distinction is crucial in the early church to prevent the elevation of apostles to a status that detracts from the glory due to God alone. It echoes the biblical theme that God uses the humble and the weak to accomplish His purposes.<p><b>we had made this man walk?</b><br>The healing of the lame man is a testament to the power of Jesus' name and faith in Him. This miracle serves as a sign pointing to the truth of the gospel and the resurrection of Jesus. It also fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah bringing healing and restoration, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>, where the lame are said to leap like a deer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, a leader in the early church, and the speaker in this passage.
