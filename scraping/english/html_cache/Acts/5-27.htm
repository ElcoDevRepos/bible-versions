The apostles had been preaching about Jesus and performing miracles, which led to their arrest. This action was taken by the temple guards, who were responsible for maintaining order in the temple complex. The apostles' boldness in preaching despite previous warnings highlights their commitment to their mission and the power of the Holy Spirit working through them.<p><b>and made them stand before the Sanhedrin</b><br>The Sanhedrin was the highest Jewish council and court in Jerusalem, consisting of 71 members, including chief priests, elders, and scribes. It was the same body that had previously condemned Jesus to death. Standing before the Sanhedrin was a significant and intimidating experience, as it was the central authority for Jewish religious and legal matters. This setting underscores the gravity of the situation and the potential consequences the apostles faced for their actions.<p><b>where the high priest interrogated them</b><br>The high priest at this time was likely Caiaphas, who had also played a key role in the trial of Jesus. The high priest's interrogation was a formal process, seeking to understand the apostles' teachings and actions. This interrogation reflects the ongoing tension between the early Christian movement and the established Jewish religious authorities. The high priest's role as the chief religious authority in Judaism adds weight to the proceedings, as he sought to maintain religious order and authority in the face of the growing influence of the apostles' message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who were spreading His teachings and performing miracles in His name.
