Personal fear as to suffering or death he was, more than most men, free from; but was his work to be cut short? Was he to fall a victim to the malice of the Jews? Was the desire, which he had cherished for many years, to preach the gospel in the great capital of the empire (<a href="/romans/1-13.htm" title="Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that oftentimes I purposed to come to you, (but was let till now,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.">Romans 1:13</a>; <a href="/romans/15-23.htm" title="But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you;">Romans 15:23</a>) to be frustrated? These questions pressed upon him in the wakeful night that followed the exhausting day; and, with a nature like St. Paul's, such anxieties could not but find expression in his prayers. To those prayers the "vision and apocalypse of the Lord" of which we now read was manifestly the answer. To him, tossed on these waves and billows of the soul, as once before to the Twelve tossing on the troubled waters of the Sea of Galilee (<a href="/matthew/14-27.htm" title="But straightway Jesus spoke to them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.">Matthew 14:27</a>), there came the words, full of comfort and of hope, "Be of good cheer."
