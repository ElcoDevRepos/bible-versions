The oppression refers to the harsh slavery and mistreatment described in <a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11-14</a>. God's acknowledgment of their suffering demonstrates His covenant relationship with Israel, as He promised to be their God and deliver them (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>). The phrase also highlights God's omniscience and compassion, as He is not distant from the afflictions of His people.<p><b>I have heard their groaning</b><br>The groaning of the Israelites signifies their cries for help and deliverance from their suffering. This aligns with <a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-24</a>, where God hears their cries and remembers His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It emphasizes the power of prayer and God's responsiveness to the pleas of His people. The groaning can also be seen as a type of intercession, foreshadowing the role of Jesus Christ as the intercessor for humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><b>and have come down to deliver them.</b><br>This phrase indicates God's direct intervention in human history to rescue His people. The concept of God "coming down" is significant, as it shows His willingness to be actively involved in the world. This prefigures the incarnation of Jesus Christ, who came down from heaven to deliver humanity from sin (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The deliverance from Egypt is a type of salvation, symbolizing the greater deliverance through Christ.<p><b>Now come, I will send you back to Egypt.</b><br>This command to Moses signifies his divine commissioning as the leader and deliverer of Israel. It marks a pivotal moment in biblical history, as Moses is chosen to confront Pharaoh and lead the Israelites out of bondage. The sending back to Egypt underscores the theme of divine mission and obedience, as Moses initially fled Egypt but is now called to return with God's authority. This mirrors the sending of Jesus, who was sent by the Father to fulfill His redemptive mission (<a href="/john/20-21.htm">John 20:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His awareness and concern for His people's suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The individual God is addressing, chosen to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's people, suffering under oppression in Egypt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place of Israel's bondage and oppression.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse in Acts, recounting Israel's history before the Sanhedrin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_awareness_and_compassion.htm">God's Awareness and Compassion</a></b><br>God is not distant or indifferent to the suffering of His people.
