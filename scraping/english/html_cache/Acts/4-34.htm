The absence of need among the believers reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament ideals, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/15-4.htm">Deuteronomy 15:4</a>, which speaks of a time when there would be no poor among the people if they obeyed God's commands. This communal sharing is a practical expression of love and unity, embodying the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a> about loving one another.<p><b>because those who owned lands or houses</b><br>The mention of land and houses indicates that some members of the early church were relatively wealthy, possessing significant assets. In the first-century Jewish context, land ownership was a sign of wealth and stability. This detail underscores the diversity within the early church, which included both affluent and less affluent members, united by their faith in Christ.<p><b>would sell their property</b><br>The act of selling property demonstrates a radical commitment to the community and the mission of the church. This voluntary act of generosity is reminiscent of the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/19-21.htm">Matthew 19:21</a>, where He advises the rich young ruler to sell his possessions and give to the poor. It reflects a detachment from material wealth and a focus on spiritual riches.<p><b>bring the proceeds from the sales</b><br>Bringing the proceeds to the apostles signifies trust and accountability within the community. This practice ensured that resources were distributed fairly and according to need, as seen in <a href="/acts/4-35.htm">Acts 4:35</a>. It also highlights the role of the apostles as leaders and stewards of the community's resources, emphasizing the importance of wise and just leadership in the church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The community of believers in Jerusalem shortly after the resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ.

The verse calls today&#8217;s church to the same joyful generosity, confident that Scripture&#8217;s promises remain sure and that God still meets needs through willing hearts and open hands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Neither was there any among them that lacked.</span>--Better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">any one in need.</span><p><span class= "bld">Sold them, and brought the prices.</span>--Both words imply continuous and repeated action.
