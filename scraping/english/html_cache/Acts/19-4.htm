His role as a teacher and leader in the early church is evident as he clarifies theological misunderstandings. This moment reflects Paul's dedication to ensuring that the followers of Christ have a correct understanding of the gospel message.<p><b>&#8220;John&#8217;s baptism was a baptism of repentance.</b><br>John the Baptist's ministry was characterized by calling people to repentance, preparing the way for the Messiah. His baptism symbolized a turning away from sin and a readiness to receive the coming Savior. This act of repentance was a crucial step in the spiritual preparation of the Jewish people, as seen in <a href="/matthew/3.htm">Matthew 3:1-6</a> and <a href="/mark/1-4.htm">Mark 1:4</a>. John's baptism did not impart the Holy Spirit, which distinguishes it from Christian baptism.<p><b>He told the people to believe in the One coming after him,</b><br>John's role as a forerunner to Christ is emphasized here. He consistently pointed beyond himself to the Messiah, as seen in <a href="/john/1-23.htm">John 1:23</a> and <a href="/luke/3-16.htm">Luke 3:16</a>. This prophetic role was foretold in <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a> and <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, where a messenger is described as preparing the way for the Lord. John's message was clear: belief in the coming Messiah was essential for salvation.<p><b>that is, in Jesus.&#8221;</b><br>Paul identifies Jesus as the fulfillment of John's prophecy, affirming that Jesus is the awaited Messiah. This declaration aligns with the core Christian belief that Jesus is the Son of God and the Savior of the world, as stated in <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a> and <a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>.
