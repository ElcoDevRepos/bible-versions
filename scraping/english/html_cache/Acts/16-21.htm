In the Roman Empire, religious practices were closely tied to the state, and any new or foreign customs were often viewed with suspicion. This reflects the tension between the early Christian message and the prevailing Roman religious and social norms. The term "customs" here can refer to religious practices, beliefs, or social behaviors that were seen as contrary to Roman traditions.<p><b>that are unlawful for us Romans</b><br>The emphasis on "us Romans" highlights the pride and identity associated with Roman citizenship. Roman law was highly regarded, and anything perceived as a threat to its order was taken seriously. The Roman Empire had a pantheon of gods and a well-established religious system, and the introduction of a new faith that claimed exclusivity, like Christianity, was seen as potentially subversive. This reflects the broader theme in Acts of the Gospel challenging existing power structures and cultural norms.<p><b>to adopt or practice.&#8221;</b><br>The concern was not just about belief but about the adoption and practice of these customs. Roman society was highly structured, and any deviation from accepted practices could be seen as a threat to social order. The early Christians were often accused of being atheists because they did not worship the Roman gods, and their practices, such as the Lord's Supper, were misunderstood and misrepresented.
