The anointing signifies God's selection and empowerment for a specific mission. In the Old Testament, anointing with oil was a symbolic act for consecrating priests, prophets, and kings (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). Jesus' anointing with the Holy Spirit at His baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16-17</a>) marks the beginning of His public ministry. The Holy Spirit's presence signifies divine approval and empowerment, fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, which prophesies the Messiah's anointing to bring good news. The mention of "Jesus of Nazareth" emphasizes His humanity and humble origins, contrasting with His divine mission.<p><b>and how Jesus went around doing good</b><br>This phrase underscores Jesus' active ministry and His role as a servant. His actions reflect the character of God, who is inherently good (<a href="/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a>). Jesus' ministry involved teaching, feeding the hungry, and showing compassion, embodying the love and mercy of God. His itinerant lifestyle, moving from place to place, demonstrates His commitment to reach all people, fulfilling the prophecy of a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>).<p><b>and healing all who were oppressed by the devil</b><br>Jesus' healing ministry is a direct confrontation with the forces of evil. The oppression by the devil refers to both physical ailments and spiritual bondage. Jesus' authority over demons and sickness (<a href="/mark/1-34.htm">Mark 1:34</a>) reveals His power to restore and liberate, fulfilling the messianic prophecy of setting captives free (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>). This phrase also highlights the reality of spiritual warfare and the kingdom of God advancing against the kingdom of darkness.<p><b>because God was with Him</b><br>This phrase affirms the divine presence and approval in Jesus' ministry. It echoes the Emmanuel prophecy, "God with us" (<a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>), and confirms that Jesus' works were accomplished through divine power and authority. The presence of God with Jesus is a testament to His identity as the Son of God and His unity with the Father (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>). This divine presence is the source of His authority and the effectiveness of His ministry, providing a model for believers who are also empowered by the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine source of Jesus' anointing, empowering Him with the Holy Spirit and power.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_of_nazareth.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, anointed by God to perform His earthly ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_spirit.htm">Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, who empowers and anoints Jesus for His mission.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_devil.htm">The Devil</a></b><br>The adversary who oppresses humanity, from whom Jesus delivers people through His healing ministry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazareth.htm">Nazareth</a></b><br>The town where Jesus grew up, emphasizing His humble earthly origins.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_anointing_of_jesus.htm">The Anointing of Jesus</a></b><br>Recognize that Jesus' ministry was empowered by the Holy Spirit, setting an example for believers to seek the Spirit's guidance and power in their own lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_mission_of_jesus.htm">The Mission of Jesus</a></b><br>Understand that Jesus' mission was to do good and heal, which calls Christians to engage in acts of kindness and seek to bring healing to those around them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Acknowledge the reality of spiritual oppression and the authority of Jesus to deliver and heal, encouraging believers to rely on His power in spiritual battles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence.htm">God's Presence</a></b><br>Emphasize that Jesus' effectiveness in ministry was because "God was with Him," reminding believers of the importance of God's presence in their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Highlight the necessity of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers for ministry, encouraging them to seek a deeper relationship with the Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_10_38_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 10:38?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_emulate_Jesus_good_deeds_daily.htm">How can we follow Jesus' example of "doing good" in our daily lives?
