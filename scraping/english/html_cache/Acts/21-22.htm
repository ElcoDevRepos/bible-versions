The context is the tension between Jewish customs and the new Christian faith. The leaders are seeking wisdom on how to address the potential conflict arising from Paul's presence. This question echoes the need for divine guidance, similar to the early church's reliance on the Holy Spirit in <a href="/acts/15-28.htm">Acts 15:28</a> during the Jerusalem Council.<p><b>They will certainly hear that you have come.</b><br>The leaders anticipate that news of Paul's arrival will spread quickly among the Jewish believers in Jerusalem. This reflects the close-knit nature of the Jewish community and the rapid dissemination of information in ancient cities. The concern is that Paul's reputation for teaching against Jewish customs (<a href="/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21</a>) might cause unrest. This situation underscores the tension between maintaining Jewish traditions and embracing the new covenant in Christ, a recurring theme in Paul's ministry (<a href="/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is central to the events in <a href="/bsb/acts/21.htm">Acts 21</a>.

Rumors swirl that Paul teaches Jews &#8220;to forsake Moses&#8221; (v. 21). Into that setting comes our verse. Think of other moments when the church faced possible division&#8212;<a href="/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1-2</a> shows similar concern, and <a href="/galatians/2-2.htm">Galatians 2:2</a> records Paul privately laying out his gospel &#8220;for fear that I was running&#8230; in vain.&#8221; The elders&#8217; question springs from love for unity and a sober reading of the crowd.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;What then should we do?&#8221;</b><p>This is a pastoral plea.

Each arrival in a city became a gospel opportunity (<a href="/acts/17-2.htm">Acts 17:2-3</a>) yet often sparked opposition (<a href="/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a>). Here, the elders aim to harness Paul&#8217;s visit for good:<p>&#8226;Affirming Jewish believers that the Law is honored (<a href="/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24</a>).<p>&#8226;Keeping open doors for evangelism (<a href="/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>).<p>&#8226;Modeling unity between Jew and Gentile (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/21-22.htm">Acts 21:22</a> captures a moment when church leaders balance zeal for truth with pastoral strategy.

They note, &#8220;that you have come,&#8221; viewing Paul&#8217;s presence as both challenge and opportunity.
