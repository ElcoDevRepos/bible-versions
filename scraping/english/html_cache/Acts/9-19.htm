After being blinded and fasting for three days, Saul's physical weakness is evident. The act of taking food signifies not only the restoration of his physical strength but also a return to normalcy and preparation for his new mission. In biblical times, fasting was often associated with repentance and seeking divine guidance, and Saul's fast underscores the seriousness of his transformation. The restoration of his strength symbolizes the beginning of his new life in Christ, paralleling the spiritual renewal he experienced.<p><b>And he spent several days with the disciples in Damascus.</b><br>Saul's time with the disciples in Damascus marks a significant shift in his life. Previously, he was a fierce persecutor of Christians, but now he is welcomed into their fellowship. This period allowed Saul to learn from the disciples and be integrated into the Christian community. Damascus, one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, was a significant center for early Christianity. The disciples there would have been wary of Saul, given his reputation, but his conversion and subsequent acceptance highlight the transformative power of the Gospel. This time also provided Saul with the opportunity to begin preaching about Jesus, as seen in the subsequent verses, demonstrating his immediate commitment to his new faith. This fellowship with the disciples is a precursor to his later ministry and missionary journeys, where he would continue to spread the message of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul (Paul)</a></b><br>Former persecutor of Christians who encountered Jesus on the road to Damascus, leading to his conversion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples_in_damascus.htm">Disciples in Damascus</a></b><br>Early followers of Jesus who were initially wary of Saul due to his past but later accepted him as a brother in Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/damascus.htm">Damascus</a></b><br>An ancient city where Saul was headed to persecute Christians but instead became a believer himself.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ananias.htm">Ananias</a></b><br>A disciple in Damascus who, following God's command, visited Saul, laid hands on him, and restored his sight.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/conversion_event.htm">Conversion Event</a></b><br>Saul's transformative encounter with Jesus, which led to his baptism and acceptance into the Christian community.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_spiritual_nourishment.htm">The Power of Spiritual Nourishment</a></b><br>Just as Saul regained physical strength through food, spiritual nourishment through fellowship and the Word is essential for believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_community.htm">The Importance of Community</a></b><br>Saul's integration into the community of disciples in Damascus highlights the role of Christian fellowship in spiritual growth and support.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_and_acceptance.htm">Transformation and Acceptance</a></b><br>Saul's acceptance by the disciples demonstrates the transformative power of Christ and the importance of welcoming new believers, regardless of their past.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_call.htm">Obedience to God's Call</a></b><br>Ananias's obedience to God's command to help Saul shows the importance of trusting God's plan, even when it seems challenging or risky.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_discipleship.htm">The Role of Discipleship</a></b><br>Saul's time with the disciples underscores the importance of discipleship in equipping and strengthening new believers for their mission.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_9_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 9:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_deepen_faith_like_Saul_in_Acts_9.htm">How can we strengthen our faith like Saul after his conversion in Acts 9:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Fellowship_s_role_in_Acts_9_19.htm">What role does fellowship play in spiritual growth according to Acts 9:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Acts_9_19_Heb_10_25_Believers_gathering.htm">How does Acts 9:19 connect with Hebrews 10:25 about gathering with believers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Saul_s_fellowship_to_church.htm">How can we apply Saul's immediate fellowship with disciples to our church involvement?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_welcome_new_believers.htm">What steps can we take to integrate new believers into our faith community?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Acts_9_19_Faith_s_transformative_power.htm">How does Acts 9:19 illustrate the transformative power of faith in one's life?

Because Scripture treats nourishment as a God-given gift (<a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14-15</a>), Saul&#8217;s meal is more than a detail; it signals divine care and the start of restored wholeness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He regained his strength</b><p>&#8226; Physical vigor returned, but Luke hints at renewed spiritual vigor too.

In St. Paul's account of his conversion in <a href="/galatians/1-17.htm" title="Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.">Galatians 1:17</a>, he states that when it pleased God to reveal His Son in him, immediately he "conferred not with flesh, and blood," but went into Arabia and returned again to Damascus. We have, it is obvious, no certain <span class= "ital">data</span> for fixing the time, nor the extent of that journey. St. Luke does not mention it, and his "straightway" balances the "immediately" of St. Paul's account. On the whole. it seems most probable that it was the first step taken by him after he had regained his sight and been baptised. Physically, rest and seclusion would be necessary during the period of convalescence after the great crisis of his conversion. Spiritually, that solitude was needed, we may believe, to prepare him for the continuous labour of the three years that followed. I place the journey to Arabia accordingly, with hardly any hesitation, after the "certain days" of fellowship with the disciples, and his reception at their solemn meeting to break bread in the Supper of the Lord, and before the "preaching Christ" in the synagogues. How far the journey extended we cannot say. "Arabia" was used somewhat vaguely as a geographical term; but the fact that Damascus was at this time occupied by the troops of Aretas, the king of Arabia Petraea, makes it probable that he went to that region. In St. Paul's paronomastic reference to Hagar as a synonym for Mount Sinai in Arabia (Hagar and Sinai both admitting of an etymology which gives "rock" as the meaning of each), we may, perhaps, trace a local knowledge gained during this journey, and draw the inference that he had sought communion with God where Moses and Elijah had found it, on the heights of Sinai and Horeb. (Comp. <a href="/galatians/4-25.htm" title="For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.">Galatians 4:25</a>.) He learnt, it may be, the true meaning and purpose of the Law, as arousing the fear of judgment, amid the terrors of the very rocks from which that Law had first been proclaimed to Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> <span class="accented">- He took food and</span> for <span class="accented">when he had received meat he</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and he was</span> for <span class="accented">then was Saul</span>, A.V. and T.R. Some commentators would interpose the journey to Arabia (mentioned <a href="/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>) between vers. 19 and 20; and this seems to be the intention of the A.V., where the clause commencing with <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> (ver. 19) seems to wind up and close the preceding narrative. This too is the view strongly supported by Canon Farrar, vol. 1. <a href="/acts/11.htm">Acts 11</a>, and by Lewin. Alford places the journey to Arabia in the time comprised in ver. 22; others before ver. 22; Neander, Meyer, and others, in the time comprised in the "many days" of ver. 23. And this last is undoubtedly the easiest, were it not for the considerations urged by Farrar with great force as to the probability of St. Paul seeking a period of retirement after his conversion before commencing any public preaching, and the further countenance given to this view by <a href="/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>, where St. Paul certainly says of himself that <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">immediately</span>, after his conversion he "went away to Arabia." Taking all things into consideration, and supposing that either Luke was not aware of the sojourn in Arabia, or that he omitted from his notes some brief notice of it immediately preceding the description of Saul's preaching in Damascus, which explained the following <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, it seems best to understand the latter part of ver. 19 and all that follows as subsequent to his return from Arabia; and to conclude that he only stayed at Damascus <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, a few days, after his conversion, and then retired to Arabia. It may be observed, too, that this interpretation gives a significance to the mention of the "certain days" which otherwise it has not. There is a further difference of opinion as to what is meant by <span class="accented">Arabia.</span> The most common view is that <span class="accented">Auranitis</span>, bordering upon Arabia Deserts, and reckoned as part of Arabia, not above two days' journey from Damascus, is the country meant. But others understand it in its more strictly Hebrew sense of the Peninsula of Sinai (Farrar, vol. 1. p. 212, and Exeursus 9; Dean Howson on Galatians in 'Speaker's Commentary;' Bishop Lightfoot on <a href="/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>). This view is decidedly strengthened by the fact that, in the fourth chapter of the Epistle to the Galatians, St. Paul clearly means by <span class="accented">Arabia</span> the Peninsula of Arabia, where Sinai was (<a href="/galatians/4-25.htm">Galatians 4:25</a>). On the assumption that the Sinaitic Peninsula is meant, Bishop Lightfoot says, "He was attracted thither by a spirit akin to that which formerly had driven Elijah to the same region. Standing on the threshold of the new covenant, he was anxious to look upon the birthplace of the old; that, dwelling for a while in seclusion in the presence of the mount that burned with fire, he might ponder over the transient glories of the ministration of death, and apprehend its real purpose in relation to the more glorious covenant which was now to supplant it." His journey to Arabia need not necessarily have occupied more than two or three mouths.
