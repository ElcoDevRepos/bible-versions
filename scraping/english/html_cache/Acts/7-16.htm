Luke&#8217;s summary in Acts echoes that legal transfer, affirming land ownership by faith, not conquest.<p>&#8226; No contradiction exists with Jacob&#8217;s later purchase at Shechem (<a href="/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18-19</a>). Both transactions happened; Stephen compresses the narrative, attributing the family burial ground to the patriarchal head whose faith initiated Israel&#8217;s claim (<a href="/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>).<p>&#8226; The purchase underlines that God&#8217;s people possessed a foothold in the promised land long before Joshua&#8217;s wars (<a href="/hebrews/11-9.htm">Hebrews 11:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From the sons of Hamor at Shechem</b><p>&#8226; Shechem held deep covenant history:<p>&#8211; Abram first received the promise there (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6-7</a>).<p>&#8211; Jacob built an altar there, calling it El-Elohe-Israel (<a href="/genesis/33-20.htm">Genesis 33:20</a>).<p>&#8211; Joshua later renewed the covenant there (<a href="/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1, 25</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;sons of Hamor&#8221; identify the local rulers, emphasizing a peaceful, legal purchase, not seizure (cf. <a href="/genesis/34-2.htm">Genesis 34:2, 6</a>; <a href="/judges/9-28.htm">Judges 9:28</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming them, Stephen shows Israel&#8217;s fathers engaging honorably with surrounding peoples (<a href="/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For a price he paid in silver</b><p>&#8226; Silver sealed the deal, stressing the reality of the transaction (<a href="/genesis/23-15.htm">Genesis 23:15-16</a>; 33:19).<p>&#8226; Paying full price foreshadowed redemption: God later &#8220;redeemed&#8221; Israel from Egypt &#8220;with silver and gold&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/105-37.htm">Psalm 105:37</a>) and ultimately redeemed sinners &#8220;not with perishable things such as silver,&#8221; but with Christ&#8217;s blood (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; The mention of money reminds us that God&#8217;s promises engage everyday life&#8212;land, currency, contracts&#8212;and yet point to eternal realities (<a href="/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Stephen&#8217;s brief sentence (<a href="/acts/7-16.htm">Acts 7:16</a>) weaves a tapestry of covenant faithfulness: the patriarchs&#8217; bones witnessed to resurrection hope; their transport to Shechem displayed God&#8217;s promise of land; the legally purchased tomb underscored rightful possession; and the silver price hinted at future redemption. Every detail confirms Scripture&#8217;s reliability and invites us to rest, as they did, in the certainty that God keeps His word now and forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">And were carried over into Sychem.</span>--The words appear to include Jacob, who was buried not at Sychem, but Machpelah (<a href="/genesis/1-13.htm" title="And the evening and the morning were the third day.">Genesis 1:13</a>). If we limit the verb to the patriarchs, which is in itself a tenable limitation, we are met by the fresh difficulty that the Old Testament contains no record of the burial of any of the Twelve Patriarchs, with the exception of Joseph, whose bones were laid, on the occupation of Canaan, in Shechem (<a href="/joshua/24-32.htm" title="And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.">Joshua 24:32</a>); and Josephus states (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> iv. 8, ? 2) that they were buried at Hebron. This, however, only represents, at the best, a local tradition. In the time of Jerome (<span class= "ital">Ep.</span> 86) the tombs of the Twelve Patriarchs were shown at Shechem, and this in its turn witnesses to a Samaritan tradition which continues to the present day (<span class= "ital">Palestine Exploration Report, </span>Dec., 1877), and which Stephen, it may be, followed in preference to that of Judaea. Looking to the probabilities of the case, it was likely that the example set by Joseph would be followed by the other tribes, and that as Shechem was far more prominent than Hebron, as the centre of the civil and religious life of Israel in the time of Joshua, that should have been chosen as the burial-place of his brethren rather than Machpelah. Looking, again, to the fact that one of Stephen's companions, immediately after his death, goes to Samaria as a preacher, and that there are good grounds for believing that both had been previously connected with it (see Note on <a href="/acts/6-5.htm" title="And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:">Acts 6:5</a>), we may probably trace to this influence his adoption of the Samaritan version of the history. The hated Sychar (<a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/1-26.htm" title="If thou desire wisdom, keep the commandments, and the Lord shall give her unto thee.">Ecclesiasticus 1:26</a>; see Note on <a href="/john/4-5.htm" title="Then comes he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.">John 4:5</a>) had, from Stephen's point of view, a claim on the reverence of all true Israelites, and his assertion of that claim may well have been one of the causes of the bitterness with which his hearers listened to him.<p><span class= "bld">That Abraham bought for a sum of money.</span>--Here we seem to come across a direct contradiction to the narrative of Genesis. The only recorded transaction in which Abraham appears as a buyer, was his purchase of the cave of Machpelah from Ephron the Hittite (<a href="/genesis/23-16.htm" title="And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.">Genesis 23:16</a>). The only recorded transaction in which the sons of Emmor, or Hamor, appear as sellers, was in Jacob's purchase of the field at Shechem (<a href="/genesis/33-19.htm" title="And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.">Genesis 33:19</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-32.htm" title="And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.">Joshua 24:32</a>). What we have seen above, however, prepares us for there having been a Samaritan tradition carrying the associations of Shechem to a remoter past. And, assuming such a tradition, there are significant facts in the patriarchal history of which it furnishes an explanation. (1) Jacob gives as a special inheritance to Joseph, "one portion" (in the Hebrew, "one <span class= "ital">Shechem;</span>" in the LXX., <span class= "ital">Sikima</span>) above his brethren, which he had taken "out of the hands of the Amorites with his sword and his bow." Of that conquest--as it is clear that the words cannot refer to the massacre connected with the story of Dinah, which Jacob had severely condemned (<a href="/genesis/34-30.htm" title="And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.">Genesis 34:30</a>)--the history contains no record, and to interpret the words as prophetic of future conquests is to strain them to a non-natural interpretation which they will hardly bear. Jacob did not come as an invader, nor had the time for thus taking possession of the whole land as yet arrived. The facts of the case suggest a special right claimed and asserted in regard to this one possession, and that right presupposes a previous purchase by some ancestor of Jacob's--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>by Abraham. This being done and the right asserted, to make the portion larger, and perhaps as a measure of conciliation, there followed the subsequent purchase of <a href="/genesis/33-19.htm" title="And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.">Genesis 33:19</a>. (2) Shechem was the earliest settlement of Abraham on his entrance into Canaan, and there he built an altar (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm" title="And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To your seed will I give this land: and there built he an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him.">Genesis 12:7</a>). But the feeling of reverence for holy places, always strong in the Hebrew race, as seen, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in the case of David and Araunah, would hardly permit a man of Abraham's wealth and princely nobleness to offer burnt-offerings to the Lord of that which had cost him nothing (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm" title="And the king said to Araunah, No; but I will surely buy it of you at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God of that which does cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.">2Samuel 24:24</a>); nor would a devout worshipper be content to see the altar so consecrated in the possession of another, and so exposed to desecration. The building of an altar involved, almost of necessity, as in the case just cited, the purchase of the ground on which it stood. (3) The Samaritans had an immemorial tradition (adopted by Dean Stanley, Ffouikes, Grove, and others) that the sacrifice of Isaac took place on the mountain of Moriah (<a href="/genesis/22-2.htm" title="And he said, Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and get you into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.">Genesis 22:2</a>), or Gerizim, which commands the plain of Moreh (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm" title="And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.">Genesis 12:6</a>), or Shechem; and, without now discussing the evidence for or against the tradition, it almost involved of necessity the assumption that Abraham had already an altar there, and with it a consecrated field which he could call his own. (4) Another Samaritan tradition, it may be noted, connected Shechem with the sacrifice offered by Melchizedek. This is enough to show the extent of the claims which were made by the Samaritans on behalf of their sacred places, and, taken together with the statement referred to in the previous Note as to the tombs of the Patriarchs, leads us <span class= "ital">to t</span>he conclusion that Stephen, more or less influenced by his recent associations with them, adopted their traditions. This seems, at any rate, the most probable solution of the difficulty which the statement at first sight presents. To do this in Jerusalem, before the very Sanhedrin, the members of which had reviled our Lord as a Samaritan (<a href="/john/8-48.htm" title="Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that you are a Samaritan, and have a devil?">John 8:48</a>), required a martyr's boldness, and, claiming as it did, a brotherhood for the hated Samaritans, the hereditary foes of Judah, had, we may believe, much to do with causing the fury that ended in his actual martyrdom. It may be added (1) that the manifest familiarity of St. Luke with Samaria and the Samaritans would dispose him to accept such a tradition without correction (see <span class= "ital">Introduction to St. Luke's Gospel</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> (2) that the Twelve, some of whom had sojourned for three days at Sychar (<a href="/john/4-43.htm" title="Now after two days he departed there, and went into Galilee.">John 4:43</a>), were likely to have become acquainted with it, and to have been ignorant of the Hebron traditions; (3) that the well-known substitution of Gerizim for Ebal in <a href="/deuteronomy/27-4.htm" title="Therefore it shall be when you be gone over Jordan, that you shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with plaster.">Deuteronomy 27:4</a>, in the Samaritan Pentateuch, not less than their addition of a commandment to build an altar on Gerizim to the ten great laws of Exodus 20, shows a tendency to deal freely with the text and the facts of the Pentateuch, so as to support their own traditions as to their sacred places. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <span class="accented">- And they were</span> for <span class="accented">and</span> were, A.V.; <span class="accented">unto Shechem</span> for <span class="accented">into Sychem</span>, A.V., <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Hebrew for the Greek form of the name (<a href="/genesis/34-2.htm">Genesis 34:2</a>); tomb for <span class="accented">sepulcher</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a price in silver</span> for <span class="accented">a sum of money</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Hamor</span> for Erect, A.V. (Hebrew for Greek form); <span class="accented">in Shechem</span> for <span class="accented">the father of Sychem</span>, A.V. and T.R. As regards the statement in the text, two distinct transactions seem at first sight to be mixed up. One, that Abraham bought the field of Machpelah of Ephron the Hittite for a burial-place, where he and Sarah, and Isaac and Rebekah, and Jacob and Leah, were buried (<a href="/genesis/24-16.htm">Genesis 24:16, 17, 19</a>; <a href="/genesis/25-9.htm">Genesis 25:9, 10</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-27.htm">Genesis 35:27-29</a>; <a href="/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29-31</a>); the other, that Jacob "bought a parcel of a field..., at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money," where the bones of Joseph were buried by Joshua (<a href="/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>; <a href="/genesis/50-25.htm">Genesis 50:25</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>), and where, according to a tradition still surviving in the days of St. Jerome, the other patriarchs were also buried ('Epistol.'86," She came to Sichem, now called Neapolis (or Nablous), and from thence visited the tombs of the twelve patriarchs"). See also Jerome, 'De Optimo Genere Interpretandi. All Jewish writers, however, are wholly silent" about this tradition, perhaps from jealousy of the Samaritans (Lightfoot, vol. 8. p. 423). And Josephus affirms that all but Joseph were buried at Hebron ('Ant. Jud.,'2. 8:2); and that their beautiful marble monuments were to be seen at Hebron in his day. In the cave of Machpelah, however, there is no tomb of any of the twelve patriarchs except Joseph; and his so-called tomb is of a different character and situation from the genuine ones (Stanley's 'Lectures on Jewish Church,' 1st series, pp. 498-500. See also 'Sermons in the East': 'The Mosque of Hebron'). But on looking closer at the text it appears pretty certain that only Shechem was in Stephen's mind. For first he speaks of Shechem at once, <span class="cmt_word">And were carried over unto Shechem</span>. And adds and <span class="cmt_word">were laid in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver of the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</span> Except the one word "Abraham," the whole sentence points to Shechem. What he says of Shechem is exactly in accordance with <a href="/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18, 19</a>. And what he says of their fathers being carried over and buried at Shechem is exactly true of Joseph's bones, as related in <a href="/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>. So that the one difficulty is the word "Abraham." It seems much more probable that this word should have been interpolated by some early transcriber, who saw no nominative case to <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, and who had in his mind a confused recollection of Abraham's purchase, than that Stephen, who shows such thorough knowledge of the Bible history, should have made a gross mistake in such a well-known and famous circumstance as the purchase of the field of Machpelah, or that Luke should have perpetuated it had he made it in the hurry of speech. It cannot be affirmed with certainty that Stephen confirms the story of the other patriarchs being buried at Shechem, though possibly he alludes to the tradition. The plural, "they were carried," etc., might be put generally, though only Joseph was meant (as <a href="/matthew/27-44.htm">Matthew 27:44</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-8.htm">Matthew 26:8</a> compared with <a href="/luke/23-39.htm">Luke 23:39</a>; <a href="/john/12-4.htm">John 12:4</a>), or "the bones of Joseph" might possibly be the subject, though not expressed. Lightfoot - followed by Bishop Wordsworth, who thinks that Abraham really did buy a field of Ephron in Sychem, when he was there (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>)-would thus be right in supposing that the point of Stephen's remark was that the patriarchs were buried in Shechem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/7-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Their bones]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">were carried back</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#949;&#964;&#941;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(meteteth&#275;san)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3346.htm">Strong's 3346: </a> </span><span class="str2">From meta and tithemi; to transfer, i.e. transport, exchange, change sides, or pervert.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1519.htm">Strong's 1519: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition; to or into, of place, time, or purpose; also in adverbial phrases.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Shechem</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#965;&#967;&#8050;&#956;</span> <span class="translit">(Sychem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4966.htm">Strong's 4966: </a> </span><span class="str2">Shechem.
