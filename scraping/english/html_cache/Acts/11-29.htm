This group included both the original apostles and other believers who had embraced the teachings of Jesus. The use of "disciples" here emphasizes their role as learners and followers of Christ's example.<p><b>each according to his ability</b><br>This phrase highlights the principle of giving based on one's capacity, a concept rooted in the teachings of Jesus and the early church. It reflects the idea of proportional giving, where contributions are made in accordance with one's resources. This principle is echoed in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-12.htm">2 Corinthians 8:12</a>, where Paul speaks about the willingness to give being more important than the amount.<p><b>decided to send relief</b><br>The decision to send relief indicates a collective and deliberate action taken by the disciples. This reflects the communal nature of the early church, where decisions were often made together under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The relief was likely in the form of financial aid or food supplies, intended to support those in need.<p><b>to the brothers living in Judea</b><br>"Brothers" refers to fellow believers, emphasizing the familial bond among Christians. Judea was a region in the Roman province of Palestine, where the church in Jerusalem was located. This area was experiencing a famine, as prophesied by Agabus earlier in <a href="/acts/11-28.htm">Acts 11:28</a>. The decision to send aid underscores the unity and mutual support within the early Christian community, transcending geographical boundaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus Christ who were part of the early Christian church.
