The fortress was adjacent to the Temple Mount and served as a military barracks for Roman soldiers. This setting underscores the tension between Roman authority and Jewish religious practices. The steps symbolize a transition point from the public chaos of the mob to the relative safety under Roman protection.<p><b>he had to be carried by the soldiers</b><br>The need for Paul to be carried highlights the severity of the situation and the intensity of the mob's aggression. Roman soldiers intervening to protect Paul demonstrates the Roman practice of maintaining order and their role as enforcers of peace. This act of carrying Paul can be seen as a fulfillment of God's providence, ensuring Paul's safety to continue his mission. It also reflects the theme of divine protection seen throughout Acts, where God uses various means to preserve His messengers.<p><b>because of the violence of the mob</b><br>The violence of the mob reflects the deep-seated animosity and misunderstanding between the Jewish populace and Paul, who was perceived as a threat to their religious traditions. This hostility is reminiscent of the opposition faced by Jesus, as both were seen as disruptors of the status quo. The mob's violence fulfills Jesus' prophecy that His followers would face persecution (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).

Jud.,' 5. 5:8, in which he says (Traill's translation), "Its general appearance was that of a tower with other towers at each of the four corners. That at the southeast angle rose to an elevation of seventy cubits, so that from thence there was a complete view of the temple. Where it adjoined the colonnades of the temple it had passages leading down to both, through which the guards - for in the fortress there always lay a Roman legion - descended and disposed themselves about the colonnades in arms at the festivals, to watch the people, and repress any insurrectionary movement." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/21-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(hote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3753.htm">Strong's 3753: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, at which time.
