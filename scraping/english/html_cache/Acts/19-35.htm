His intervention highlights the importance of civic leaders in Roman cities. Ephesus was a major city in Asia Minor, known for its bustling trade and diverse population. The crowd had been stirred by Demetrius and other craftsmen who felt threatened by Paul's teachings, which were turning people away from idol worship (<a href="/acts/19-23.htm">Acts 19:23-34</a>). The clerk's ability to quiet the crowd demonstrates his authority and the respect he commanded.<p><b>and declared, &#8220;Men of Ephesus, doesn&#8217;t everyone know</b><br>The city clerk addresses the crowd with a rhetorical question, appealing to their shared identity and common knowledge. This approach is strategic, as it seeks to remind the Ephesians of their civic pride and the widely recognized status of their city. Ephesus was renowned throughout the Roman Empire, and its citizens took pride in their cultural and religious heritage.<p><b>that the city of Ephesus is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis</b><br>Ephesus was home to the Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The temple served as a major religious, cultural, and economic center. Artemis, also known as Diana in Roman mythology, was a goddess associated with fertility and nature. The term "guardian" underscores the city's responsibility and privilege in maintaining the temple, which was central to its identity and economy. This statement reinforces the idea that the Ephesians had a vested interest in protecting their religious traditions.<p><b>and of her image, which fell from heaven?</b><br>The "image, which fell from heaven" likely refers to a meteorite or a sacred stone that was believed to be of divine origin. Such objects were often venerated in ancient cultures as symbols of the gods. This belief in a heavenly origin added to the sanctity and mystique of the temple and its worship. The mention of this image serves to remind the Ephesians of the divine favor and protection they believed they received, reinforcing their religious devotion and the importance of Artemis in their society.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/city_clerk.htm">City Clerk</a></b><br>A prominent official in Ephesus responsible for maintaining order and managing civic affairs.

He was the keeper of the records and archives of the city. The title appears in many of the inscriptions in Mr. Wood's volume, often in conjunction with those of the Asiarchs and the proconsul. If, as is probable, his office was a permanent one, he was likely to have more weight with the people than the Asiarchs, who were elected only for a year, and who were not all of Ephesus. The language of the public officer is as characteristic in its grave caution as that of Demetrius had been in its brutal frankness. He, like the Asiarchs, obviously looks on St. Paul and his companions with respect. He has no feeling of fanaticism, and would not willingly be a persecutor. He dares not oppose the multitude, but he will try and soothe them with the loud profession of his attachment to the religion of his country. He was, if we may so speak, the Gamaliel of Ephesus, not without parallels among the princes and statesmen and prelates who have lived in the critical times of political and religious changes, and have endeavoured to hold the balance between contending parties.<p><span class= "bld">A worshipper of the great goddess Diana.</span>--The substantive as well as the adjective belonged to the local vocabulary. Its literal meaning is "temple sweeper," or "sacristan"--one consecrated to the service of the goddess. The Greek word (<span class= "ital">neokoros</span>) is found on coins and inscriptions of Ephesus as applied to the inhabitants, sometimes in relation to the Emperor, sometimes to the goddess. They looked to her as their guardian and protector. One inscription claims for the city the honour of being the "nurse" of the great goddess (Boeckh. 2954, <span class= "ital">ut supra</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> She was, as it were, to borrow a phraseology which presents only too painful an analogy, "Our Lady of Ephesus." It is a curious fact that the same month was consecrated to Flora in Rome, and is now the "Mois de Marie" in France and Italy. The omission of the word "goddess" in nearly all the best MSS. is significant. She was, even without that word, emphatically "Artemis the Great" In some of the inscriptions of Ephesus she is described as "the greatest," the "most High."<p><span class= "bld">The image which fell down from Jupiter.</span>--The name was often given to old pre-historic images--as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>to that of Athene Polias at Athens. It may have been merely a legendary way of stating that no one knew what artist had sculptured the image, or when it had been first worshipped. Possibly, however, the word may have had a more literal meaning as applied to a meteoric stone which had been employed by the sculptor, or was worshipped in its original form. The many-breasted image of Aitemis described in the Note on <a href="/acts/19-24.htm" title="For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain to the craftsmen;">Acts 19:24</a> is, however, reported to have been made of olive-wood. The word <span class= "ital">image</span> is not in the Greek, and one familiar word (<span class= "ital">diopetes</span>) was sufficient to express what requires seven in the English paraphrase.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> <span class="accented">- Quieted the multitude</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) for <span class="accented">appeased the people</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">saith</span> for <span class="accented">said</span>, A.V.; who for <span class="accented">that</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">temple-keeper</span> for <span class="accented">a worshipper</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Diana</span> for <span class="accented">goddess</span> Dann, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">The town clerk</span> (6 <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the scribe, is the city secre<span class="accented">tary.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, Thucyd., 7:19 (Meyer); <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, inscription quoted by Howson (vol. it. p. 76, note). His office, as appears from the passage in Thucydides, was to read public documents to the people. According to some, it was not a post of much dignity at Athens (Becket, on Thucyd., 7:10); but according to Kuinoel it was an office of first-rate influence in the senate in the Greek cities of Asia, seeing the scribe was the chief registrar, had the drafting of the laws, and the custody of the archives. As there were three orders of scribes, there may have been a great difference in the political rank of each. <span class="cmt_word">Had quieted</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, ver. 36). <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> means to "arrange," "put in <span class="accented">order</span>," the hair, the dress, or the like; hence "to restrain," "quiet;" found only in these two places in the New Testament, but not uncommon in the Maccabees and in Josephus.

The word <span class="accented">Neoceros</span> was a peculiar title, assumed first by persons and then by such cities, in Asia especially, as had the special charge of the temple and sacred rites of any particular god. It first appears on coins of Ephesus, in the reign of Nero, and was deemed a title of great honor. One inscription speaks of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as making a certain dedication. But another use of the term sprang up about this time. Among the vile flatteries of those corrupt times, it became usual with cities to dedicate temples and altars to the emperors, and they received in return the title, meant to be an honor, of <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of the emperor. Some extant coins exhibit the city of Ephesus as <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> both of Diana and the emperor (see Lewin, vol. 1. p. 411; Howson, vol. it. pp. 75, 76). <span class="cmt_word">The image which fell down from Jupiter</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, understand <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as in the 'Iphig. in Taur.,' 947), <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; which is described in ver. 88 of the same play as "the image (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) of the goddess Diana, which they say fell down from heaven (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>) into her temple in Tauris;" and in line 1349 it is called <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, "<span class="accented">The</span> image of the daughter of Jove which fell from heaven," brought away from Tauris by Iphigenia and Orestes into Attica. But it does not appear that there was any tradition that the identical image brought from Tauris was carried to Ephesus. There are several representations of the Ephesian Diana, or Artemis, on coins, of which one or two are given by Lewin (vol. 1. p, 411) and by Howson (vol. it. p. 66). The image was of rude form and execution, mummy-shaped, or like an inverted pyramid; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;</span> (rendered by St. Jerome <span class="accented">multi-mammia</span>, and explained as intending to represent her as the nourisher of all living things: Preface to Ephesians); made of wood variously described as ebony, cedar, and vine wood. Pliny says that, though the temple itself had been restored seven times, the image had never been altered (quoted by Kuinoel). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/19-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Finally</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
