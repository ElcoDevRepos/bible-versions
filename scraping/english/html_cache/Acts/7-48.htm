In the Old Testament, the temple in Jerusalem was seen as the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27-30</a>). However, Stephen, in his speech, emphasizes that God is not confined to physical structures. This reflects the broader biblical theme that God is omnipresent and transcends human limitations (<a href="/isaiah/66.htm">Isaiah 66:1-2</a>). The phrase also echoes Solomon's acknowledgment during the temple's dedication that even the highest heavens cannot contain God (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>). This understanding is crucial for the early Christian community, which is moving away from temple-centric worship to a more spiritual understanding of God's presence, as seen in Jesus' conversation with the Samaritan woman in <a href="/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21-24</a>.<p><b>As the prophet says:</b><br>Stephen refers to the prophet Isaiah, specifically <a href="/isaiah/66.htm">Isaiah 66:1-2</a>, to support his argument. This prophetic reference underscores the continuity between the Old Testament and the teachings of Jesus and the apostles. By quoting Isaiah, Stephen aligns himself with the prophetic tradition that critiques empty ritualism and emphasizes a heart-oriented relationship with God. This connection to Isaiah also highlights the prophetic role of Jesus, who fulfills and expands upon the messages of the prophets. The use of prophecy here serves to validate Stephen's message to his Jewish audience, showing that his teachings are rooted in their own scriptures and not a departure from them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Stephen is one of the first deacons of the early church and the first Christian martyr.

Stephen had risen to the truth which, though it had been proclaimed before, had been practically dormant. It broke down the thought of any exclusive holiness in the Temple, and therefore placed its downfall among the chances and changes which might be involved in God's chastisement of the people, and His education of mankind. The inference which we have seen reason to draw as to the probability of some connection, direct or indirect, between Stephen and the Samaritans (see Notes on <a href="/acts/7-16.htm" title="And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.">Acts 7:16</a> and <a href="/acts/6-5.htm" title="And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:">Acts 6:5</a>), suggests the thought that we may trace here something like an echo of the teaching of our Lord in His dialogue with the woman of Samaria (<a href="/context/john/4-21.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.">John 4:21-23</a>). It is a fact of singular interest to note how one who now listened to the words as applied to the Temple of the God of Israel, afterwards embraced them in all their fulness, and used them as his text in asserting the truth they embodied as against the Temples of Zeus and Athene (<a href="/acts/17-24.htm" title="God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands;">Acts 17:24</a>).<p><span class= "bld">As saith the prophet.</span>--The truth which Stephen asserted had been uttered in the very dedication prayer of the Temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm" title="But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built?">1Kings 8:27</a>). The builder of the Temple had himself felt that it was the witness not of a localised but a universal Presence. But he turns to what might seem to his hearers a yet higher authority--to the great prophet (<a href="/context/isaiah/66-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that you build to me? and where is the place of my rest?">Isaiah 66:1-2</a>), who was preeminently the preacher of glad tidings, and who had closed his mission with the utterance of the truth that, whatever glory and greatness might attach to the Temple in Jerusalem, the prayer of him that was "poor and of a contrite spirit" was equally acceptable wherever it might be offered. The words were full of deep meaning in themselves. They were yet more significant as showing that the thoughts of Stephen had been turned to that great close of a great work, and that he must thus have been led to that wider vision of the future when all nations and tongues should be gathered to see the glory of the Eternal; and the work of Israel, especially of those who, like himself, belonged to the Dispersion, should be to declare His glory to the Gentiles, and when they, too, should be accepted as priests and Levites in the true Temple (<a href="/isaiah/66-21.htm" title="And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, said the LORD.">Isaiah 66:21</a>).
