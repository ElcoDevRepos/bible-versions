Ananias's role highlights the importance of obedience to God's direction, even when it involves reaching out to someone like Saul, who was known for persecuting Christians.<p><b>&#8216;The God of our fathers</b><br>This phrase connects Saul's experience to the God of Israel, emphasizing continuity with the Jewish faith. It underscores that the God who called Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is the same God who is now calling Saul. This connection is crucial for understanding the fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ and the inclusion of the Gentiles in God's plan.<p><b>has appointed you</b><br>The term "appointed" indicates a divine selection or commissioning. Saul's calling was not of his own choosing but was a sovereign act of God. This mirrors the calling of prophets in the Old Testament, such as Jeremiah, who was appointed by God before birth (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>).<p><b>to know His will</b><br>Knowing God's will is central to the life of a believer. For Saul, this meant understanding the gospel and his role in spreading it. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that God reveals His will to those He calls, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, where believers are encouraged to discern God's will.<p><b>and to see the Righteous One</b><br>"The Righteous One" is a title for Jesus Christ, emphasizing His sinlessness and fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah. Saul's vision of Jesus on the road to Damascus was a pivotal moment, confirming Jesus' resurrection and divine nature. This encounter is a type of theophany, similar to Moses' encounter with God in the burning bush (Exodus 3).<p><b>and to hear His voice.</b><br>Hearing the voice of Jesus was a direct revelation and commissioning for Saul. This experience parallels the calling of other biblical figures, such as Samuel, who heard God's voice in the temple (1 Samuel 3). It signifies a personal relationship and communication with God, which is foundational for Saul's future ministry as Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul (formerly Saul)</a></b><br>The apostle who is recounting his conversion experience and divine calling in this chapter.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ananias.htm">Ananias</a></b><br>A devout man according to the law, who was sent by God to restore Paul's sight and deliver God's message to him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_god_of_our_fathers.htm">The God of our fathers</a></b><br>Refers to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, emphasizing the continuity of God's work from the Old Testament to the New Testament.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous_one.htm">The Righteous One</a></b><br>A title for Jesus Christ, highlighting His sinlessness and fulfillment of Messianic prophecies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul's_conversion.htm">Paul's Conversion</a></b><br>The event on the road to Damascus where Paul encountered Jesus and was transformed from a persecutor of Christians to a devoted apostle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_appointment.htm">Divine Appointment</a></b><br>God has a specific purpose and calling for each believer, just as He did for Paul.

The line reminds us that this message is not Ananias&#8217;s opinion but a divinely ordered announcement, echoing how prophets often began with a declarative &#8220;Thus says the LORD&#8221; (cf. <a href="/acts/9-17.htm">Acts 9:17</a>; 26:16).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The God of our fathers</b><p>By invoking &#8220;the God of our fathers,&#8221; Ananias links Saul&#8217;s experience to the covenant history of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>; <a href="/acts/3-13.htm">Acts 3:13</a>; 5:30). Salvation in Jesus is not a break from Israel&#8217;s story; it is its fulfillment. Paul will later affirm this same continuity when he says, &#8220;I worship the God of our fathers, believing everything that is written in the Law and the Prophets&#8221; (<a href="/acts/24-14.htm">Acts 24:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>has appointed you</b><p>The verb underscores God&#8217;s sovereign choice. Saul&#8217;s apostleship is not self-generated; it is a divine assignment, much like Jeremiah&#8217;s call &#8220;before you were born I set you apart&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>) or Paul&#8217;s own testimony, &#8220;God&#8230; set me apart from my mother&#8217;s womb and called me by His grace&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15</a>). The appointment carries authority and responsibility (<a href="/1_timothy/1-12.htm">1 Timothy 1:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to know His will</b><p>God does not leave His servants guessing. Saul is granted direct knowledge of the divine plan, ultimately summarized in Christ: &#8220;He made known to us the mystery of His will&#8230; to bring all things in heaven and on earth together in Christ&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9&#8211;10</a>). For Paul, that will includes taking the gospel to the Gentiles (<a href="/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21</a>; <a href="/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and to see the Righteous One</b><p>&#8220;The Righteous One&#8221; is a messianic title for Jesus (<a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>; <a href="/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14</a>; 7:52). Saul literally saw the risen Christ on the Damascus road (<a href="/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3&#8211;5</a>), qualifying him as an apostle: &#8220;Have I not seen Jesus our Lord?&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>). This vision confirms Jesus as perfectly righteous and therefore the only sufficient Savior.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and to hear His voice</b><p>Hearing Christ&#8217;s voice goes beyond the initial call; it inaugurates a lifetime of direct guidance (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>). Paul would later recount, &#8220;I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, &#8216;Saul, Saul&#8230;&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/acts/26-14.htm">Acts 26:14</a>). The same voice would continue to direct his ministry (<a href="/acts/18-9.htm">Acts 18:9&#8211;10</a>; 23:11), demonstrating that true apostleship involves ongoing communion with the living Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/22-14.htm">Acts 22:14</a> shows that Saul&#8217;s conversion is a divine commissioning rooted in Israel&#8217;s story, grounded in God&#8217;s sovereign choice, and centered on personal encounter with the risen, righteous Christ. Knowing God&#8217;s will, seeing Jesus, and hearing His voice equip Paul&#8212; and every believer&#8212;to live and testify with certainty that the gospel is God&#8217;s uninterrupted plan from the fathers to the ends of the earth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">The God of our fathers . . .</span>--The report of what was said by Ananias is somewhat fuller than in <a href="/acts/9-17.htm" title="And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared to you in the way as you came, has sent me, that you might receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.">Acts 9:17</a>, and gives in outline what had been spoken to him by the Lord.
