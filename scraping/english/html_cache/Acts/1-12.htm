The literal geography underscores the certainty of that future event.<p>&#8226; The place of Jesus&#8217; agony (<a href="/luke/22-44.htm">Luke 22:44</a>) becomes the launch point of hope, reminding readers that God redeems pain into purpose (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which is near the city</b><p>&#8226; Luke notes the proximity so we can picture an easy, tangible movement: the mount lies just east of Jerusalem, separated by the Kidron Valley.<p>&#8226; This nearness highlights God&#8217;s plan to begin the gospel witness right where Jesus was rejected (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>; <a href="/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14</a>). Far-reaching mission starts with faithfulness at home.<p>&#8226; The detail reaffirms the factual nature of the narrative. Anyone in the first century could verify distance, terrain, and landmarks, strengthening confidence in Scripture&#8217;s historical reliability (<a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a Sabbath day&#8217;s journey away</b><p>&#8226; A &#8220;Sabbath day&#8217;s journey&#8221; was about 2,000 cubits&#8212;roughly three-quarters of a mile (<a href="/numbers/35-5.htm">Numbers 35:5</a>). Luke is not endorsing man-made limits but giving a familiar measurement.<p>&#8226; The phrase shows the disciples&#8217; return was a brief walk, accomplished without violating Sabbath regulations (<a href="/exodus/16-29.htm">Exodus 16:29</a>). Although it was not necessarily the Sabbath, the idiom marks distance precisely.<p>&#8226; This small span reminds us that obedience often begins with short steps.

The verse anchors the ascension in real geography, affirms Scripture&#8217;s trustworthiness, and illustrates how faith responds&#8212;immediately, together, and right where the Lord places His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">From the mount called Olivet.</span>--As to the name, see Note on <a href="/luke/19-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he was come near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,">Luke 19:29</a>. The mention of the distance, and the measure of distance employed are, both of them, remarkable, and suggest the thought that St. Luke's reckoning was a different one from that which Christendom has commonly received, and that the "forty days" expired before the last renewal of our Lord's intercourse with His disciples, and that this ended on the following sabbath--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>eight days before the day of Pentecost. On this supposition we get a reason, otherwise wanting, for this manner of stating the distance. Symbolically, too, there seems a fitness in our Lord's entering into His rest, on the great day of rest, which is wanting in our common way of reckoning. On the other hand, it may be noted that it is after St. Luke's manner as in the case of Emmaus (<a href="/luke/24-13.htm" title="And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about three score furlongs.">Luke 24:13</a>) to give distances.
