This community was vigilant and protective, aware of the threats against Saul (later Paul) after his conversion. The context here is Saul's bold preaching in Jerusalem, which led to threats against his life. This reflects the early church's challenges and the need for unity and support among believers, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>.<p><b>they took him down to Caesarea</b><br>Caesarea was a significant port city on the Mediterranean coast, built by Herod the Great. It served as a Roman administrative center, which made it a strategic location for travel and communication. The decision to take Saul to Caesarea indicates the urgency and seriousness of the threat against him. This city later becomes a pivotal location in Acts, where Peter preaches to Cornelius (Acts 10) and Paul is imprisoned (Acts 23-26).<p><b>and sent him off to Tarsus</b><br>Tarsus was Saul's hometown, located in the region of Cilicia in modern-day Turkey. It was a prominent city known for its university and as a center of Stoic philosophy. Sending Saul to Tarsus was both a protective measure and a strategic move, allowing him to continue his ministry in a less hostile environment. This period in Tarsus is not detailed in Acts, but it is likely a time of preparation and growth for Saul, who later emerges as a key figure in spreading the Gospel to the Gentiles. This move also fulfills the prophecy of Saul's mission to the Gentiles, as foretold in <a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_brothers.htm">The Brothers</a></b><br>Refers to the early Christian believers who were part of the church.

At Caesarea he would probably, as afterwards in <a href="/acts/21-8.htm" title="And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came to Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and stayed with him.">Acts 21:8</a>, find Philip, and the friend and the accuser of the proto-martyr met face to face as brethren. In returning to his home at Tarsus, from which he had been absent at the least for four years, and possibly for a much longer period, it would be natural for him to resume his old employment as a tent-maker. (See Note on <a href="/acts/18-3.htm" title="And because he was of the same craft, he stayed with them, and worked: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.">Acts 18:3</a>.) Thence, as from a centre, he did his work as an Evangelist in the regions of Cilicia (<a href="/galatians/1-21.htm" title="Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;">Galatians 1:21</a>), where, in <a href="/acts/15-41.htm" title="And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.">Acts 15:41</a>, we find churches already organised, which had not been founded in what we call the first mission journey of Paul and Barnabas, and must therefore have been planted by the former at an earlier period. Here, for the present, we lose sight of him. It need hardly be said that the Caesarea here spoken of is that on the sea-coast. Caesarea Philippi is always distinguished by its special epithet.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> <span class="accented">- And when the brethren knew it</span> for <span class="accented">which when the brethren knew</span>, A.V.

There is no reasonable doubt that it means the same place here. A seaport, near to Jerusalem, and with Roman protection, affording access to Tarsus either by sea or land as should seem best, was the natural place for Paul's friends to take him to. If further proof were wanting, it could be found in the phrase, "brought him down," as compared with the converse, "gone up" (<a href="/acts/18-22.htm">Acts 18:22</a>), "ascended "(<a href="/acts/25-1.htm">Acts 25:1</a>), when the journey was from Caesarea to Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">To Tarsus</span>. A glance at the map will show that, starting from Caesarea, a person might either go by land along the sea-coast of Phoenicia, through Acre, Tyre, Sidon, Beyrout, Tripolis, Antioch, Issus, to Tarsus; or by sea to any of the intermediate ports between Caesarea and Tarsus; or rather the artificial harbor at the mouth of the Cydnus which formed the seaport of Tarsus. It is not improbable that Paul landed at Selcucia, since he says (<a href="/galatians/1-21.htm">Galatians 1:21</a>) that he came at this time "into the regions of Syria and Cilicia," which is exactly what he would have done if he had landed at Seleucia, the seaport of Antioch. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/9-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
