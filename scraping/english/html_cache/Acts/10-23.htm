In Jewish culture, inviting Gentiles into one's home was uncommon due to purity laws and social customs. This act signifies a pivotal shift in the early church's mission, foreshadowing the inclusion of Gentiles. Peter's willingness to host these men reflects his obedience to the vision he received from God, breaking down barriers between Jews and Gentiles. This moment is a precursor to the Jerusalem Council in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, where the inclusion of Gentiles is formally recognized.<p><b>And the next day he got ready and went with them,</b><br>Peter's readiness to travel with the men sent by Cornelius demonstrates his commitment to God's mission. This journey from Joppa to Caesarea marks a significant step in the spread of the Gospel beyond Jewish boundaries. The phrase indicates Peter's immediate response to God's call, reminiscent of Abraham's obedience in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-4</a>. It also reflects the urgency and importance of the mission, as Peter does not delay in following God's direction.<p><b>accompanied by some of the brothers from Joppa.</b><br>The inclusion of "some of the brothers from Joppa" suggests the importance of communal support and witness in the early church. These brothers likely served as witnesses to the events that would unfold, providing accountability and validation of Peter's actions. This communal aspect is consistent with the early church's practice of traveling in groups for safety and support, as seen in <a href="/acts/13.htm">Acts 13:1-3</a> with Paul and Barnabas. The presence of these brothers also underscores the significance of the event, as it would later be recounted to the church in Jerusalem, affirming the work of the Holy Spirit among the Gentiles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles, known for his leadership in the early church and his role in spreading the Gospel to the Gentiles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cornelius'_messengers.htm">Cornelius' Messengers</a></b><br>Sent by Cornelius, a Roman centurion, to bring Peter to his house.

The apostle opens his home to Gentile messengers&#8212;people a devout Jew would normally keep at arm&#8217;s length (<a href="/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter lives out the command Jesus modeled: welcoming the stranger (<a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35</a>) and practicing brotherly love (<a href="/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>).<p>&#8226; His invitation shows immediate submission to the Spirit&#8217;s revelation (<a href="/acts/10-19.htm">Acts 10:19&#8211;20</a>). Peter doesn&#8217;t pause to debate cultural taboos; he demonstrates that &#8220;what God has cleansed, no longer call common&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>).<p>&#8226; By bringing these men under his roof, Peter illustrates the gospel&#8217;s power to break barriers (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>) and foreshadows the full inclusion of the Gentiles in the church (<a href="/acts/11-18.htm">Acts 11:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Note the quiet courage: Peter is lodging with Simon a tanner (<a href="/acts/9-43.htm">Acts 9:43</a>)&#8212;already a socially awkward choice&#8212;so he simply doubles down on grace by adding more unlikely guests.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the next day he got ready and went with them</b><p>&#8220;And the next day he got ready and went with them&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-23.htm">Acts 10:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter doesn&#8217;t delay; obedience is timely (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>; <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Getting &#8220;ready&#8221; implies active preparation&#8212;arranging his affairs, perhaps prayerfully committing the journey to the Lord (<a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26&#8211;30</a>).<p>&#8226; He trusts God&#8217;s unfolding plan even without knowing every detail (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5&#8211;6</a>). The Spirit had said, &#8220;Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-20.htm">Acts 10:20</a>). Peter acts on that word the very next morning.<p>&#8226; Quick obedience keeps him in step with God&#8217;s mission rhythm (<a href="/luke/9-60.htm">Luke 9:60</a>).

These brothers confirm the Spirit&#8217;s work.<p>&#8211; Unity: Jewish Christians and Gentiles will soon worship together; taking brothers along models shared ministry (<a href="/luke/10-1.htm">Luke 10:1</a>; <a href="/acts/15-2.htm">Acts 15:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The journey from Joppa to Caesarea is roughly 30 miles. Traveling together signals solidarity and provides safety.<p>&#8226; Their companionship reminds us that God rarely calls us to lone-ranger missions; He weaves community into His assignments (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9&#8211;10</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/10-23.htm">Acts 10:23</a> sketches a three-part portrait of gospel expansion: Peter extends radical hospitality, obeys without hesitation, and brings fellow believers as witnesses.
