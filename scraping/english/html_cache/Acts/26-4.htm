This statement underscores the transparency and public nature of his past. Paul was a well-known figure, especially among the Pharisees, a sect known for their strict adherence to the Law. His reputation was established and recognized by the Jewish community, which adds credibility to his testimony.<p><b>how I have lived from my earliest childhood</b><br>Paul emphasizes the consistency of his life and beliefs from a young age. Raised in a devout Jewish environment, he was educated in the traditions and laws of Judaism. This background is crucial as it highlights his deep roots in Jewish culture and religion, which he later contrasts with his conversion to Christianity. His early life was marked by a zealous commitment to Jewish customs, which is evident in his later persecution of Christians before his conversion.<p><b>among my own people</b><br>This phrase indicates Paul's upbringing within the Jewish community, likely in Tarsus, a city known for its cultural and educational significance. Tarsus was a major center of Hellenistic culture, yet Paul maintained his Jewish identity and practices. His life among his people suggests a strong connection to Jewish traditions and a shared cultural heritage, which would have been important in establishing his credibility with his audience.<p><b>and also in Jerusalem.</b><br>Paul's mention of Jerusalem is significant as it was the religious and cultural heart of Judaism. His time in Jerusalem would have included studying under Gamaliel, a respected Pharisee teacher, as mentioned in <a href="/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>. This education would have further ingrained in him the Pharisaic traditions and the importance of the Law. Jerusalem was also the site of the Temple, the center of Jewish worship, which underscores Paul's deep connection to Jewish religious life. His experiences in Jerusalem would have been formative, shaping his initial opposition to the Christian movement before his dramatic conversion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul (formerly Saul of Tarsus)</a></b><br>The apostle who is giving his defense before King Agrippa.
