It is the same city from which Jonah attempted to flee from God's command (<a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>). The directive to send for Simon Peter highlights the divine orchestration in spreading the Gospel to the Gentiles, as Peter was chosen to break the cultural barriers between Jews and Gentiles. This moment is pivotal in the early church, marking the beginning of the Gentile mission. Peter, originally named Simon, was given the name Peter (meaning "rock") by Jesus (<a href="/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>), signifying his foundational role in the church (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>).<p><b>He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, by the sea.</b><br>Staying with Simon the tanner is significant because tanning was considered an unclean profession by Jewish standards due to contact with dead animals. This setting underscores the theme of breaking traditional Jewish purity laws, foreshadowing the acceptance of Gentiles into the faith. The location "by the sea" suggests proximity to the port, facilitating the spread of the Gospel. The sea often symbolizes the vastness of God's reach and the spread of His message to all nations. This setting also reflects Peter's openness to God's leading, as he resides in a place that challenges Jewish customs, preparing him for the vision he receives in <a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9-16</a>, which further emphasizes the inclusion of Gentiles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cornelius.htm">Cornelius</a></b><br>A centurion in the Roman army, described as a devout and God-fearing man.
