Nighttime often symbolizes danger or urgency in biblical narratives, as seen in other instances like Nicodemus visiting Jesus at night (<a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>). The use of "however" indicates a contrast to previous events, suggesting a turning point or a critical moment in the narrative.<p><b>his disciples took him</b><br>The mention of "his disciples" indicates that Saul, later known as Paul, had already gathered followers who were committed to his teachings and mission. This early formation of a supportive community highlights the rapid spread of the Gospel and the establishment of early Christian fellowship. It also reflects the trust and loyalty Saul had earned despite his recent conversion.<p><b>and lowered him in a basket</b><br>The act of lowering Saul in a basket is a practical solution to a life-threatening situation. This method of escape is reminiscent of the story of Rahab, who helped the Israelite spies escape from Jericho by lowering them from her window (<a href="/joshua/2-15.htm">Joshua 2:15</a>). The use of a basket, a humble and everyday object, underscores the theme of God's provision and protection through ordinary means.<p><b>through a window in the wall.</b><br>The window in the wall suggests a city with fortified structures, typical of ancient cities like Damascus. Archaeological evidence supports the existence of such walls, which were often part of the city's defense system. This escape route signifies a divine intervention, as walls in Scripture often symbolize barriers or protection, and here, God provides a way of escape for Saul. This event foreshadows Paul's later teachings on God's deliverance and protection (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-32.htm">2 Corinthians 11:32-33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul (Paul)</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Saul, later known as Paul, was a zealous Pharisee who converted to Christianity after encountering Jesus on the road to Damascus.

It seems to follow, from the tone in which the Apostle there speaks of this adventure, that it had been made matter of ridicule. It is connected in his thoughts with the "infirmities" (probably with his smallness of stature) of which he was content to boast. The escape was effected, like that of the spies from the house of Rahab (<a href="/joshua/2-15.htm" title="Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was on the town wall, and she dwelled on the wall.">Joshua 2:15</a>) and of David from his own house (<a href="/1_samuel/19-11.htm" title="Saul also sent messengers to David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If you save not your life to night, to morrow you shall be slain.">1Samuel 19:11</a>), through an opening or "window" in the town wall. Such a window is still shown in the wall of Damascus as the traditional scene of the escape.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - But for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">his disciples</span> for <span class="accented">the disciples</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">through</span> for <span class="accented">by</span>, A.V; <span class="accented">lowering him in</span> for in, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Lowering him</span>, etc. The A.V. gives the sense freely; and combining the verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> with the participle <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, translates both by the one word "let him down." The <span class="accented">by</span> of the A.V. seems preferable to the <span class="cmt_word">through</span> of the R.V., as <span class="accented">through</span> suggests the idea, which cannot be intended, of making a hole in the wall. The escape of the spies from Jericho, as described in <a href="/joshua/2-15.htm">Joshua 2:15</a>, was exactly in the same way, except that they had only a rope to descend by, whereas St. Paul had a rope-basket. In the description of his escape given by St. Paul to the Corinthians (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-33.htm">2 Corinthians 11:33</a>), he uses the same word for "let down" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>), tells us he was let down "by the wall," R.V. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, with the additional particular that he got out through the window, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and that it was a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, a basket made of ropes (which describes the kind of basket somewhat more accurately than the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> here used) in which he was let down (see note on ver. 20). The passage in 2 Corinthians gives us a further interesting account of how the Jews went about to accomplish their purpose of killing Paul. It seems that at this time, either in revolt against the Romans or by permission of Caligula (it is not known certainly which), a certain Aretas, or Hareth, King of Arabia Petrea, included Damascus in his dominions for a time, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> through the reigns of Caligula and Claudius. He appointed an ethnarch, who was doubtless a Jew, to rule the large Jewish population according to their Law, and who was the ready tool of the unbelieving Jews, using his power as governor to have the gates kept day and night so as to prevent Saul's escape. But he that keepeth Israel neither slumbered nor slept, and by his watchful providence Saul escaped from their hands. As regards the R.Y., his disciples for <span class="accented">the disciples</span>, Alford adopts the reading <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, and holds <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> of the R.T. to be simply a mistake for <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, caused by the situation of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>.
