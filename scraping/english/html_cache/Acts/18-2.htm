Jews were dispersed throughout the Roman Empire, often forming tight-knit communities. Aquila's Jewish identity would have been significant in the context of the early Christian church, which was grappling with the integration of Jewish and Gentile believers. His name, meaning "eagle" in Latin, suggests a Roman influence, which was common among Jews living in the diaspora.<p><b>a native of Pontus</b><br>Pontus was a region located in what is now modern-day Turkey, along the southern coast of the Black Sea. It was known for its diverse population and was part of the Roman province of Bithynia and Pontus. The mention of Pontus highlights the widespread dispersion of Jews and the reach of the Roman Empire. This background may have contributed to Aquila's ability to connect with various cultures and peoples, a valuable trait in the early church.<p><b>who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla</b><br>Priscilla, also known as Prisca, is often mentioned alongside her husband, indicating her active role in their ministry. The couple's move from Italy suggests they were part of the Jewish community in Rome. Their partnership in ministry is notable, as it reflects the early church's inclusion of women in significant roles. The fact that they traveled together underscores their unity and shared mission.<p><b>because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome</b><br>The expulsion of Jews from Rome by Emperor Claudius is a well-documented historical event, occurring around AD 49. This decree was likely due to disturbances in the Jewish community, possibly related to conflicts over the emerging Christian faith. This expulsion forced many Jews, including Aquila and Priscilla, to relocate, which inadvertently spread the Christian message to new regions. This event is a reminder of how God can use political and social upheaval to further His purposes.<p><b>Paul went to visit them</b><br>Paul's decision to visit Aquila and Priscilla indicates a strategic move to connect with fellow believers and potential allies in ministry. This visit likely led to a strong partnership, as Aquila and Priscilla became key figures in the early church, hosting a house church and mentoring Apollos. Paul's initiative in seeking them out reflects his commitment to building and strengthening the Christian community, a theme consistent throughout his missionary journeys.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aquila.htm">Aquila</a></b><br>A Jewish man originally from Pontus, a region in modern-day Turkey.

Strictly speaking, the Greek form is <span class= "ital">Ahylas, </span>but this is undoubtedly the transliterated form of the Latin <span class= "ital">Aquila</span> (= Eagle). The name appears in a yet more altered form in <span class= "ital">Onkelos, </span>the traditional writer of one of the Targums, or Paraphrases of the Law, then current among the Jews. In Aquila, one of the later translators of the Old Testament into Greek, himself also born in Pontus, and possibly (but see Mr. Deutsch's <span class= "ital">Remains, </span>p. 339) identical with Onkelos, we get the Greek form again. In the well-known chief Rabbi of the synagogues of the Jews of London, Dr. Adler, we have it reappearing in a German form (<span class= "ital">Adler=</span>Eagle). The tendency of Jews to take names derived from animals when sojourning in heathen countries, may be noted as not uncommon. Ursulus, Leo, Leopardus, Dorcas, which appear in the early Christian inscriptions in the Vatican and Lateran Museums, present analogous instances. His birth in Pontus indicates that he belonged to the dispersion of the Jews of that province (<a href="/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1Peter 1:1</a>) which, as the north-eastern region of Asia Minor, lay between Bithynia and Armenia. Some from that province had been present at Jerusalem on the Day of Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-9.htm" title="Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,">Acts 2:9</a>). As the Jews at Rome consisted largely of freed-men, the <span class= "ital">libertinum genus</span> of Latin writers (see Note on the <span class= "ital">Libertines</span> in <a href="/acts/6-9.htm" title="Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.">Acts 6:9</a>), it is probable that Aquila belonged to that class.<p><span class= "bld">With his wife Priscilla.</span>--The name appears in some MSS., both here and elsewhere, in the form of Prisca, of which it is the diminutive. So we have Lucilla from Lucia, Domitilla from Domitia, Atticilla (in an inscription in the Museum of Perugia) from Attica. The name Prisca probably indicates a connection with the <span class= "ital">gens</span> of the <span class= "ital">Prisci, </span>who appear in the earliest stages of Roman history, and supplied a long series of praetors and consuls. The marriage was probably, therefore, an example of the influence gained by educated Jews over the higher class of women at Rome. It was, perhaps, a natural consequence of her higher social position that her name is sometimes placed before Aquila's (<a href="/acts/18-18.htm" title="And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.">Acts 18:18</a>; <a href="/romans/16-3.htm" title="Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:">Romans 16:3</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-19.htm" title="Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.">2Timothy 4:19</a>). The fact that she took part in the instruction of Apollos (see Note on <a href="/acts/18-26.htm" title="And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him to them, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.">Acts 18:26</a>), indicates that she was a woman of more than ordinary culture, a student and interpreter of the Old Testament Scriptures. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="accented">- He found</span> for <span class="accented">found</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a man of Pontus by race</span> for <span class="accented">born in Pontus</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">because</span> for <span class="accented">because that</span>, A.V.; the <span class="accented">Jews</span> for <span class="accented"></span>,[<span class="accented">ewe</span>, A.V.: he came for came, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Aquila</span>. A Roman name, Graecized into <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. Knights and tribunes and others of the name occur in Roman history. Whether the Jewish family residing in Pontus took the name of Aquila from any of these Romans is not known. Aquila, the translator of the Old Testament into Greek about A.D. , was also a Jew of Pontus, the old kingdom of Mithridates. That there was a considerable colony of Jews in Pontus appears also from <a href="/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1</a> and <a href="/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Priscilla</span>. Also called <span class="accented">Prison</span> (<a href="/2_timothy/4-19.htm">2 Timothy 4:19</a>). So in classical authors, <span class="accented">Livia</span> and <span class="accented">Livilla, Drusa</span> and <span class="accented">Drusilla</span>, are used of the same persons (Howson, p. 415). Prisca is a not uncommon name for Roman women. The masculine Priscus occurs very frequently. Aquila and Priscilla were among the most active Christians, and the most devoted friends of St. Paul (vers. 18, 26; <a href="/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3, 4, 5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-19.htm">2 Timothy 4:19</a>); and were evidently persons of culture as well as piety. Lately; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="accented">i.q.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Pindar, etc.), only found here in the New Testament. But it occurs in the LXX. of <a href="/deuteronomy/24-5.htm">Deuteronomy 24:5</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/11-3.htm">Ezekiel 11:3</a>, and in the apocryphal books repeatedly, and in Polybius. The adjective <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which is also used by the LXX. and the Apocrypha and in classical Greek for "new," is used only once in the New Testament, in <a href="/hebrews/10-20.htm">Hebrews 10:20</a>. It means properly "newly killed," hence anything "recent," "fresh, or "new." Both the adjective and the adverb are very common in medical writings. <span class="cmt_word">Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome</span>. Suetonius mentions the fact, but unfortunately does not say in what year of Claudius's reign it took place. His account is that, in consequence of frequent disturbances and riots among the Jews at the instigation of Chrestus, Claudius drove them from Rome. It seems almost certain, as Renan says, especially combining Tacitus's account ('Annal.,' 15:44) of the spread of Christianity in the city of Rome before the time of Nero, that <span class="accented">Chrestus</span> (Greek <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>,) is only a corruption of the name Christ, similar to that found on three or four inscriptions before the time of Constantine, where Christians are called <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, and to the formation of the French word <span class="accented">Chretien</span> - in old French <span class="accented">Chrestien</span>; and that the true account of these riots is that they were attacks of the unbelieving Jews upon Christian Jews, similar to these at Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/8.htm">Acts 8</a>.), at Antioch in Pisidia (<a href="/acts/13-50.htm">Acts 13:50</a>), at Iconium and Lystra (<a href="/acts/14.htm">Acts 14</a>.), and at Thessalonica and Beraea (<a href="/acts/17.htm">Acts 17</a>.). The Romans did not discriminate between Jews and Christian Jews, and thought that those who called Christ their King were fighting under his leadership (comp. <a href="/acts/17-7.htm">Acts 17:7</a>; <a href="/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2</a>; see Renan, 'St. Paul,' p. 101). Tertullian and Lactantius (quoted by Lewin, p. 274) both speak of the vulgar pronunciation, Chres-<span class="accented">tianus</span> and <span class="accented">Chrestus.</span> Howson also adopts the above explanation. But Meyer thinks that Chrestus was, as Suetonius says, a Jewish leader of insurrection at Rome. The question bears on the passage before us chiefly as the solution does or does not prove the existence of Christians at Rome at this time, and affects the probability of Aquila and Priscilla being already Christians when they came to Corinth, before they made St. Paul's acquaintance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/18-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[There]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">he found</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8017;&#961;&#974;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(heur&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2147.htm">Strong's 2147: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary heuro, which heureo is used for it in all the tenses except the present and imperfect to find.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#957;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(tina)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
