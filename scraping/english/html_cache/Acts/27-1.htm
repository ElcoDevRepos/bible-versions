The journey to Italy signifies the spread of the Gospel to the heart of the Roman Empire, aligning with the Great Commission to take the message to the ends of the earth (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). The decision to sail also reflects the Roman legal system's process of transferring prisoners for trial.<p><b>Paul and some other prisoners</b><br>Paul is not alone in his journey; he is accompanied by other prisoners, indicating that this was a common practice for transporting those awaiting trial or punishment. This context highlights the Roman Empire's extensive legal and penal system. Paul's status as a prisoner contrasts with his spiritual freedom and mission, echoing his writings about being a "prisoner for Christ" (<a href="/ephesians/3.htm">Ephesians 3:1</a>).<p><b>were handed over to a centurion named Julius</b><br>The centurion, Julius, represents Roman authority and military discipline. Centurions were respected officers in the Roman army, typically commanding about 100 soldiers.

His later interactions with Paul show a level of respect and humanity, reflecting the centurion's character and possibly the influence of Paul's demeanor and faith.<p><b>who belonged to the Imperial Regiment</b><br>The Imperial Regiment, also known as the Augustan Cohort, was a prestigious unit within the Roman military, often tasked with special duties, including escorting important prisoners.

It is probable, however, that they also had appealed to the emperor, as there would otherwise be no object in sending them to Rome.<p><span class= "bld">A centurion of Augustus' band.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">of the Sebaste.</span> On the band or cohort as a subdivision of the Roman legion, see Note on <a href="/acts/10-1.htm" title="There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,">Acts 10:1</a>. Three different explanations have been given of the term translated "Augustus." (1) The cohort may have consisted of soldiers levied in Sebaste (= Augusta) or Samaria. Josephus mentions a squadron of Sebastene cavalry (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 6, ? 1; xix. 9, ? 2), and there may have been a corresponding band of foot-soldiers. (2) Nero about this time had formed a kind of body-guard, consisting of some 3, 000 young men of the equestrian order, who accompanied him to games and spectacles, and whose chief business it was to applaud him in his speeches and recitations. To these he gave the name of <span class= "ital">Augustani</span> (Tacit. <span class= "ital">Ann.</span> xiv. 15; Sueton. <span class= "ital">Nero, </span>c. 25), a term of which Sebastene would be the natural Greek equivalent. (3) A certain Julius Priscus appears in Tacit. <span class= "ital">Hist.</span> ii. 92 as appointed by Vitellius to be one of the prefects of the Praetorian cohorts, which, as specially under the emperor's personal command, might naturally be called by his name; and he has been conjecturally identified with the centurion here named. Of these, (2) seems the most probable, but it is not absolutely incompatible with (3). On this assumption, as it is not said that the cohort itself was at Caesarea, it is possible that he may have accompanied Festus as an escort to his province, and was now returning to Rome.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - For, for <span class="accented">into</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to a centurion named Julius of the Augustan band</span> for unto <span class="accented">one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus</span> <span class="accented">band</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">That we should sail</span>.

It has been conjectured (Kuinoel, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.), indeed, that the name may rather be taken flora Sebaste, Samaria, as consisting of Samaritans, seeing that Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 2. 12:5) actually mentions a troop of cavalry (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) called the troop of Sebaste.
