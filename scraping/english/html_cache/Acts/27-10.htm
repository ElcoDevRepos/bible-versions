This phrase highlights his role as a spiritual leader, even in captivity. The context is a warning against continuing the journey due to impending danger. Historically, sea voyages during this time were perilous, especially in the Mediterranean during the stormy season. Paul's foresight is reminiscent of Old Testament prophets who warned of impending doom, such as Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/38-17.htm">Jeremiah 38:17-18</a>). This also reflects the wisdom given by God to His servants, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>, where the prudent see danger and take refuge.<p><b>not only to ship and cargo</b><br>The mention of "ship and cargo" underscores the economic and material concerns of the voyage. Ships in the ancient world were vital for trade and transport, and losing a ship meant significant financial loss. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the transient nature of material wealth, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where Jesus teaches about storing treasures in heaven rather than on earth. The cargo likely included grain, a staple of Roman trade, emphasizing the potential impact on both the ship's owners and the broader economy.<p><b>but to our own lives as well</b><br>Paul's warning extends beyond material loss to the potential loss of life, highlighting the gravity of the situation. This phrase emphasizes the value of human life, a consistent biblical theme. In the cultural context, life was often at risk during sea travel, and Paul's concern for the crew and passengers reflects the Christian ethic of valuing and preserving life. This echoes the biblical principle found in <a href="/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5-6</a>, where God establishes the sanctity of human life. Additionally, it foreshadows the eventual divine intervention that spares the lives of all aboard, demonstrating God's sovereignty and care, as seen later in <a href="/acts/27-22.htm">Acts 27:22-24</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is speaking in this verse.

The Spirit had already warned Paul many times about hardships (<a href="/acts/20-23.htm">Acts 20:23</a>; 21:11).<p>&#8226; God often lets His servants &#8220;see&#8221; danger before it strikes so they can sound the alarm (<a href="/2_kings/6-9.htm">2 Kings 6:9</a>; <a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that our voyage</b><p>&#8226; The journey to Rome is God-ordained (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>), yet human decisions still matter.

Earlier he had survived shipwrecks (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>), so his words carry weight.<p>&#8226; Disaster can be God&#8217;s megaphone, exposing idols of safety and success (<a href="/jonah/1-4.htm">Jonah 1:4-6</a>; <a href="/luke/13-4.htm">Luke 13:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>not only to ship and cargo,</b><p>&#8226; Material loss is inevitable when God allows judgment or discipline.

His words blend spiritual insight with practical concern, reminding us that God&#8217;s servants must speak truth even when outnumbered. The passage teaches that 1) divine warnings are acts of grace, 2) material security is fragile, and 3) obedience to God&#8217;s guidance is the surest safety in any storm.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt.</span>--The tone is clearly that of a man who speaks more from the foresight gained by observation than from a direct supernatural prediction. St. Paul had had, it will be remembered, the experience of three shipwrecks (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm" title="Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;">2Corinthians 11:25</a>), and the Epistle to Titus, though probably written later, shows an acquaintance with Crete which suggests that he may have had some knowledge even of the very harbour in which they had found refuge. His advice accordingly was to remain where they were, in comparative safety, in spite of the drawbacks referred to in <a href="/acts/27-12.htm" title="And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart there also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lies toward the south west and north west.">Acts 27:12</a>.

When his counsel was rejected he gave himself to prayer, and to that prayer (<a href="/acts/27-24.htm" title="Saying, Fear not, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar: and, see, God has given you all them that sail with you.">Acts 27:24</a>) he attributes the preservation of his companions not less than his own. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="accented">- The</span>, for <span class="accented">this</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">injury</span> for <span class="accented">hurt</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">loss</span> for <span class="accented">damage</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the ship</span> for <span class="accented">ship</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Sirs, I perceive</span>; etc. St. Paul's opinion and reasons are evidently not fully given; only the result, that he strongly advised against the course to which they were inclined, and foretold disaster as likely to ensue from it. <span class="accented">I perceive</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span>), as <a href="/john/4-19.htm">John 4:19</a>; <a href="/john/12-19.htm">John 12:19</a>; <a href="/acts/17-22.htm">Acts 17:22</a>.
