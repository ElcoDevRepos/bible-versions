Saul, later known as Paul, was a zealous Pharisee and a fierce persecutor of Christians. His falling to the ground signifies a moment of divine intervention and humility before the risen Christ. This event is pivotal in Saul's transformation and mission. The ground symbolizes a place of submission and the beginning of a new journey, reminiscent of other biblical figures who encountered God and were changed, such as Moses at the burning bush.<p><b>but when he opened his eyes he could not see a thing</b><br>Saul's physical blindness is symbolic of his spiritual blindness. Before this encounter, Saul was blind to the truth of Jesus as the Messiah. His inability to see represents a temporary judgment and a period of reflection and dependence on God. This blindness is a physical manifestation of his need for spiritual insight and transformation. It also parallels the condition of Israel, often described as blind to the truth of God's revelation (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>).<p><b>So they led him by the hand into Damascus</b><br>This phrase highlights Saul's vulnerability and dependence on others, contrasting sharply with his previous self-sufficiency and authority. Being led by the hand signifies a humbling experience and a reversal of roles; the persecutor is now being guided. Damascus, a significant city in ancient Syria, was a center of trade and culture. It was also a place where early Christians had established a community. Saul's entry into Damascus marks the beginning of his new mission as an apostle to the Gentiles, fulfilling God's plan to spread the Gospel beyond Jewish boundaries. This journey into Damascus is a fulfillment of God's sovereign plan, as seen in the prophecies of the spread of the Gospel to all nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>A zealous Pharisee and persecutor of Christians who later becomes the Apostle Paul.

Saul&#8217;s former sight was sharp, yet he missed the truth of Jesus; now, lacking physical sight, he is ready to receive spiritual light (<a href="/acts/26-18.htm">Acts 26:18</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s gracious discipline: Like Zechariah struck mute to prepare him for belief (<a href="/luke/1-20.htm">Luke 1:20</a>), Saul&#8217;s blindness humbles him for faith.<p>&#8226; Temporary judgment: Three days without sight (<a href="/acts/9-9.htm">Acts 9:9</a>) recall Jonah&#8217;s three days in the fish (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>) and Jesus&#8217; three days in the tomb (<a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>), emphasizing death to the old life and readiness for resurrection of purpose.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So they led him by the hand into Damascus</b><p>&#8220;So they led him by the hand into Damascus&#8221; (<a href="/acts/9-8.htm">Acts 9:8</a>c).<p>&#8226; Dependence on others: The proud persecutor must now be guided like a child (<a href="/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8-9</a>). His companions, once followers of his mission, become his helpers in weakness (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Entrance in humility: Saul intended to enter Damascus triumphantly to arrest believers (<a href="/acts/9-1.htm">Acts 9:1-2</a>); instead he arrives helpless, fulfilling Jesus&#8217; words, &#8220;whoever exalts himself will be humbled&#8221; (<a href="/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Prelude to divine appointment: Being led prepares him for meeting Ananias (<a href="/acts/9-10.htm">Acts 9:10-17</a>), much as the Ethiopian eunuch was led to Philip for instruction (<a href="/acts/8-30.htm">Acts 8:30-35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/9-8.htm">Acts 9:8</a> records a literal, dramatic reversal. The risen Jesus stops Saul, raises him to his feet as a new man, blinds him to expose his inner darkness, and leads him into Damascus in humbled dependence. The verse shows that true sight begins when human self-reliance is surrendered to Christ, setting the stage for Saul&#8217;s conversion and eventual ministry as Paul (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">He saw no</span> <span class= "bld">man.</span>--The blindness was that of one who has been dazzled with excess of light (comp. <a href="/acts/22-11.htm" title="And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.">Acts 22:11</a>), the natural result of the vision of the supernatural glory, a witness to the man himself that the vision was not a mere play of imagination. Traces of its permanent effect on his powers of sight have been found in his habit of dictating rather than writing letters (see Note on <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-17.htm" title="The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every letter: so I write.">2Thessalonians 3:17</a>), in the large characters traced by him when he did write (see Note on <a href="/galatians/6-11.htm" title="You see how large a letter I have written to you with my own hand.">Galatians 6:11</a>), in his not recognising the high priest who commanded him to be struck. (See Notes on <a href="/context/acts/23-2.htm" title="And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.">Acts 23:2-5</a>.) Of the many theories as to the mysterious "thorn in the flesh" (see Note on <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2Corinthians 12:7</a>), there seems most reason for accepting that which connects it with some affection of the eyes, involving, perhaps, attacks of agonising pain. On this assumption, the eager wish of the Galatians, if it had been possible to have plucked out their own eyes and given them to him, receives a special and interesting significance. (See Note on <a href="/galatians/4-15.htm" title="Where is then the blessedness you spoke of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.">Galatians 4:15</a>.) For Saul himself, the blindness may well have had a spiritual significance. He had looked on himself as a "guide of the blind," boasting that he saw clearly (<a href="/romans/2-19.htm" title="And are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,">Romans 2:19</a>). Now, for a time, till inward and outward light should shine in on him, he had to accept his blindness. The new-born soul had to be as . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> <span class="accented">Nothing</span> for <span class="accented">no man</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">and</span> for <span class="accented">but</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Nothing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>).
