This event took place during the Jewish festival of Pentecost, a time when Jerusalem was filled with pilgrims from various regions. The sound signifies the arrival of the Holy Spirit, fulfilling Jesus' promise in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>. The imagery of wind is often associated with the Spirit in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/37-9.htm">Ezekiel 37:9-10</a> and <a href="/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>.<p><b>a crowd came together in bewilderment</b><br>The crowd's gathering indicates the significant impact of the sound, drawing people from different backgrounds. The term "bewilderment" suggests confusion and amazement, highlighting the supernatural nature of the event. This moment sets the stage for Peter's sermon, which leads to the conversion of about three thousand people (<a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a>). The gathering of the crowd fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-32</a>, where God promises to pour out His Spirit on all people.<p><b>because each one heard them speaking his own language</b><br>This miraculous event demonstrates the reversal of the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>), where God confused human language. Here, the Holy Spirit enables the apostles to speak in various languages, symbolizing the unifying power of the Gospel. This moment foreshadows the global mission of the Church, as Jesus commanded in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>.

Scripture presents this as a real, audible event, not a mere impression.<p>&#8226; The Spirit&#8217;s arrival is frequently marked by audible or visible signs&#8212;consider the voice from heaven at Jesus&#8217; baptism (<a href="/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>) and the thunder-like voice before the cross (<a href="/john/12-28.htm">John 12:28-29</a>).<p>&#8226; As at Sinai when &#8220;there were thunder and lightning, and a thick cloud&#8230;and a very loud trumpet blast&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>), God again signals His presence in unmistakable ways.<p>&#8226; By recording the detail of the sound, Luke underscores the literal, historical reality of Pentecost, assuring us that the promised Spirit truly came (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>; <a href="/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a crowd came together in bewilderment</b><p>The noise did not leave the Spirit&#8217;s work hidden in a private corner; it drew people in.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-5.htm">Acts 2:5</a>). Pilgrims already gathered for the Feast of Weeks were now providentially assembled to witness God&#8217;s new work.<p>&#8226; Their &#8220;bewilderment&#8221; mirrors earlier responses to divine intervention&#8212;e.g., the women at the empty tomb were &#8220;perplexed&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-4.htm">Luke 24:4</a>). This honest reaction confirms that no natural explanation sufficed.<p>&#8226; God often gathers an audience before He unveils truth, as when the multitude pressed upon Jesus before He fed the five thousand (<a href="/mark/6-34.htm">Mark 6:34-44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because each one heard them speaking his own language</b><p>The miracle moves from a public sign (the sound) to a personal sign (understood speech).<p>&#8226; The Spirit reverses Babel&#8217;s confusion (<a href="/genesis/11-7.htm">Genesis 11:7-9</a>) by enabling clear proclamation across linguistic boundaries.<p>&#8226; This is not ecstatic babble but recognizable dialects&#8212;so convincing that later some accuse the speakers of drunkenness only because they cannot account for the phenomenon (<a href="/acts/2-13.htm">Acts 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus had foretold that &#8220;these signs will accompany those who believe&#8230;they will speak in new tongues&#8221; (<a href="/mark/16-17.htm">Mark 16:17</a>). Paul lists tongues among Spirit-given gifts meant for edification (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>; 14:21-22).<p>&#8226; Revelation anticipates the same multilingual praise: &#8220;a great multitude&#8230;from every nation and tribe and people and tongue&#8221; worshiping the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>). Pentecost provides a foretaste.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/2-6.htm">Acts 2:6</a> shows the Holy Spirit&#8217;s arrival as a tangible, historical event that attracted a diverse crowd and immediately bridged linguistic barriers. God used an unmistakable sound to assemble witnesses, astonished them with understandable speech in their native tongues, and thus launched the gospel outward to all peoples. The verse assures believers that Scripture&#8217;s record is exact and literal, inviting confidence that the same Spirit still empowers clear proclamation of Christ today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">When this was noised abroad. . . .</span>--Better <span class= "ital">When there had been this voice, </span>or <span class= "ital">utterance.</span> The word for "voice" is never used for rumour or report in the New Testament; always of some utterance--human (<a href="/matthew/3-3.htm" title="For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.">Matthew 3:3</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-20.htm" title="I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.">Galatians 4:20</a>), angelic (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm" title="For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:">1Thessalonians 4:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-11.htm" title="And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;">Revelation 5:11</a>), or divine (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm" title="And see a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">Matthew 3:17</a>; <a href="/matthew/17-5.htm" title="While he yet spoke, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear you him.">Matthew 17:5</a>).
