Judea, Galilee, and Samaria were regions in ancient Israel, each with its own cultural and historical significance. Judea was the heartland of Jewish religious life, Galilee was known for its diverse population and was the region where Jesus conducted much of His ministry, and Samaria was a region with a mixed population of Jews and Samaritans, often at odds with each other. The peace experienced by the church may have been due to Saul's conversion, which removed a significant threat, and possibly due to political changes in the Roman Empire. This peace allowed the church to focus on growth and internal strengthening.<p><b>It grew in strength and numbers,</b><br>The growth in strength and numbers suggests both spiritual maturity and an increase in the number of believers. This growth can be attributed to the apostles' teaching, the work of the Holy Spirit, and the church's commitment to living out the teachings of Jesus. The early church's communal life, characterized by prayer, breaking of bread, and fellowship (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>), would have contributed to this strengthening. The numerical growth also fulfills Jesus' command to make disciples of all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), showing the church's obedience to the Great Commission.<p><b>living in the fear of the Lord</b><br>The fear of the Lord refers to a deep reverence and respect for God, acknowledging His holiness and authority. This fear is not about being afraid but about honoring God and aligning one's life with His will. <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a> states that "the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom," indicating that this reverence leads to wise living. The early church's commitment to living in the fear of the Lord would have set them apart from the surrounding culture and drawn others to the faith.<p><b>and the encouragement of the Holy Spirit.</b><br>The Holy Spirit, promised by Jesus as the Comforter and Helper (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>), played a crucial role in guiding and empowering the early church. The encouragement of the Holy Spirit would have provided believers with the strength to endure trials, the wisdom to navigate challenges, and the boldness to proclaim the gospel. This divine encouragement is a fulfillment of Jesus' promise that the Spirit would be with His followers, teaching them and reminding them of His words (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>). The Holy Spirit's work in the church is a testament to God's ongoing presence and activity among His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church.htm">The Church</a></b><br>Refers to the early Christian community, which was growing and spreading throughout the regions mentioned.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judea.htm">Judea</a></b><br>A region in ancient Israel, significant as the location of Jerusalem and the early center of the Christian faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/galilee.htm">Galilee</a></b><br>A region in northern Israel, known for being the area where Jesus conducted much of His ministry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>A region between Judea and Galilee, historically significant due to tensions between Jews and Samaritans, yet included in the spread of the Gospel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, who plays a crucial role in empowering and guiding the early church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/peace_and_growth.htm">Peace and Growth</a></b><br>The church experienced peace and growth, showing that God can provide stability and increase even in challenging times.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_the_lord.htm">Fear of the Lord</a></b><br>Living in the fear of the Lord is essential for spiritual growth and maturity.

The tranquility described may have been due, partly to the absence of any leading men among the opponents of the new society; partly, perhaps, to public excitement being diverted to the insane attempt of Caligula to set up his statue in the Temple at Jerusalem--an attempt from which he was only dissuaded by the earnest entreaties of Herod Agrippa, whom he had raised to the dignity of King of Judaea, but who happened at the time to be at Rome, and of Petronius, the <span class= "ital">Pr?ses</span> of Syria. The latter was influenced by great showers of rain falling from a clear sky, after a long drought, in answer to the prayers of Israel (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xviii. 8, ? 6). Such prayers, made at a crisis in which believing and unbelieving Jews felt an equal interest, may, probably, have suggested St. James's allusion to the old historical parallel of Elijah (<a href="/james/5-17.htm" title="Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.">James 5:17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Throughout all Judaea and Galilee and</span> Samaria.--Brief as the notice is, it is every way significant. It is the first intimation since the opening of the apostolic history of the existence, not of disciples only, such as had gathered round our Lord during His personal ministry, but of <span class= "ital">organised religious communities, </span>in the towns and villages of Galilee. We may think of such churches as formed in Capernaum and Tiberias, in Chorazin and the two Bethsaidas, perhaps even in Nazareth. The history is silent as to the agency by which these churches had been founded; but looking to the close relations between St. Luke and St. Philip, and to the probability that the latter made Caesarea his head-quarters for the work of an Evangelist, we may legitimately think of him as having worked there as he had worked in Samaria. It is not improbable, however, that here also, as in that region, he may have been followed, after he had done his work as an Evangelist, by the Apostles to whom it belonged to confirm and organise. (See Note on <a href="/acts/8-14.htm" title="Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John:">Acts 8:14</a>.)

It is thought that the attention of the Jews to the progress of the faith of Jesus Christ was diverted at this time, and their active hostility stayed, by the still greater danger to the Jews' religion which arose from Caligula's intention of placing a statue to himself as a god in the holy of holies. Thus did God's gracious providence intervene to give rest to his harassed saints, and to build up his Church in numbers, in holiness, and in heavenly comfort. Especially Paul had another breathing-time, which may have been the more required if, as is thought, one at least of the five scourgings mentioned in <a href="/2_corinthians/12.htm">2 Corinthians 12</a>:24 had been inflicted at Damascus, and one of the three shipwrecks alluded to in the same passage and been undergone in the dangerous coasting voyage from Caesarca to Scleucia. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/9-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
