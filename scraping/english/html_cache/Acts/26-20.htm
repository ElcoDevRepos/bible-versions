Damascus was a significant city in Syria, known for its diverse population and as a center of trade. Paul's initial preaching in Damascus highlights the immediate transformation and boldness in his new faith. Jerusalem, the heart of Jewish worship and tradition, was where Paul had previously persecuted Christians. His return there to preach signifies a powerful testimony of change and redemption. This sequence underscores the fulfillment of Jesus' command to be witnesses in Jerusalem and beyond (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><b>Then to everyone in the region of Judea</b><br>Judea, the region surrounding Jerusalem, was predominantly Jewish and steeped in the traditions of the Old Testament. Paul's message to Judea represents the continuation of the gospel's spread among the Jewish people, fulfilling the prophecy that the Messiah would be a light to the Jews first (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>). This outreach also reflects the early church's mission strategy, which prioritized the Jewish population before extending to the Gentiles.<p><b>And then to the Gentiles</b><br>The inclusion of the Gentiles marks a significant shift in the early Christian mission, aligning with God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). Paul's role as the apostle to the Gentiles (<a href="/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>) was pivotal in the expansion of Christianity beyond Jewish boundaries, fulfilling the prophecy of a universal gospel (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>). This outreach to the Gentiles also demonstrates the breaking down of the dividing wall between Jews and Gentiles, as described in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>.<p><b>I declared that they should repent and turn to God</b><br>Repentance is a central theme in both the Old and New Testaments, calling for a change of mind and heart towards God. This message echoes the preaching of John the Baptist (<a href="/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>) and Jesus (<a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>), emphasizing the necessity of repentance for salvation. Turning to God implies a complete reorientation of one's life, aligning with the call to forsake idols and false beliefs, as seen in the prophets' messages (<a href="/ezekiel/14-6.htm">Ezekiel 14:6</a>).<p><b>Performing deeds worthy of their repentance</b><br>True repentance is evidenced by a transformed life, as seen in the fruits of repentance (<a href="/matthew/3-8.htm">Matthew 3:8</a>). This concept is rooted in the teachings of the prophets, who called for justice, mercy, and humility (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). The emphasis on deeds aligns with James' teaching that faith without works is dead (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>). This phrase underscores the expectation that genuine faith results in a life that reflects God's righteousness and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul (formerly Saul of Tarsus)</a></b><br>The apostle who is speaking in this passage, recounting his ministry and the message he preached.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/damascus.htm">Damascus</a></b><br>The city where Paul first began his ministry after his conversion on the road to Damascus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central city of Jewish worship and a significant location in Paul's ministry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judea.htm">Judea</a></b><br>The region surrounding Jerusalem, where Paul also preached the message of repentance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people to whom Paul extended his ministry, emphasizing the universal nature of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_as_a_turning_point.htm">Repentance as a Turning Point</a></b><br>True repentance involves a change of mind and heart, leading to a transformation in behavior.

<a href="/context/galatians/1-17.htm" title="Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.">Galatians 1:17-18</a>); but the special mention of the Gentiles as following upon "the coasts (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the <span class= "ital">region</span>) of Judaea," points to an evangelising activity in Cilicia prior to the commencement of his work at Antioch.<p><span class= "bld">That they should repent . . .</span>--The three stages of the spiritual life are accurately noted: (1) the repentance for past sins, which is more than a regret for their consequences; (2) the "turning to God," which implies faith in Him, as far as He is known, and therefore justification; (3) the doing works meet for repentance (we note the reproduction of the Baptist's phrase; see Note on <a href="/matthew/3-8.htm" title="Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:">Matthew 3:8</a>), which are the elements of a progressive sanctification.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> <span class="accented">- Declared</span> for <span class="accented">showed</span>, A.V.;

then at Jerusalem, as in <a href="/acts/9-26.htm">Acts 9:26-29</a>; and then those on a larger and wider scale, among the Jews of Palestine and the heathen in all the countries which he visited. <span class="cmt_word">Throughout all the country of Judaea</span>. This does not allude to any preaching in the land of Judaea at the time of his first visit to Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a>), because he says in <a href="/galatians/1-22.htm">Galatians 1:22</a>, that at <span class="accented">that time</span>, viz. before he went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia, he was still "<span class="accented">unknown</span> by face unto the Churches of Judaea." But he had opportunities later of preaching in Judaea. For instance, the language of <a href="/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29</a> suggests that such an opportunity may have arisen when Paul and Barnabas carried up the alms of the Christians at Antioch "unto the brethren that dwelt in Judaea." Another opportunity he manifestly had when he passed with Barnabas through Phoenicia and Samaria to Jerusalem, as related in <a href="/acts/15-3.htm">Acts 15:3</a>. Another, when he went from Caesarea to Jerusalem, as related in <a href="/acts/18-22.htm">Acts 18:22</a>. Again, there was room for working among the Jews in Palestine while he was staying at Caesarea "many days," and journeying to Jerusalem, as we read in <a href="/acts/21-10.htm">Acts 21:10, 15</a>. So that there is no contradiction whatever between the statement in this verse and that in <a href="/galatians/1-22.htm">Galatians 1:22</a>.
