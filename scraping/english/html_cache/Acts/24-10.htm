The governor's motion indicates a formal proceeding, typical of Roman legal practices. Felix, the governor of Judea, was known for his harsh rule and corruption, as noted by the historian Tacitus. This setting underscores the tension and gravity of the situation for Paul, who is defending himself against accusations from Jewish leaders.<p><b>he began his response:</b><br>Paul's response is a critical moment in his defense. It reflects his readiness and confidence to speak, despite the serious charges against him. This moment is reminiscent of Jesus' own trials, where He also stood before Roman authorities. Paul's ability to articulate his defense is a testament to his education and rhetorical skills, which he often used to spread the Gospel.<p><b>Knowing that you have been a judge over this nation for many years</b><br>Paul acknowledges Felix's long tenure as a judge, which could be seen as a strategic move to appeal to Felix's sense of authority and experience. Felix's rule over Judea began around AD 52, and he was familiar with Jewish customs and disputes. This acknowledgment serves to establish common ground and respect, a common rhetorical strategy in ancient speeches.<p><b>I gladly make my defense.</b><br>Paul expresses his willingness to defend himself, indicating his confidence in the truth of his message and his innocence. This phrase reflects Paul's unwavering faith and his commitment to the Gospel, even in the face of persecution. His defense is not just for his own sake but for the advancement of the Christian message.

He is content to appeal to the experience of the "many years" (really about six, but this was more than the average duration of a procuratorship, and the words might, therefore, be used without exaggeration) during which he had held office. Such a man was not likely to attach too much weight to the statements of Tertullus and Ananias. Felix, after having ruled for a short time with a divided authority (see Note on <a href="/acts/24-2.htm" title="And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by you we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done to this nation by your providence,">Acts 24:2</a>), had superseded Cumanus in A.D. 52 or 53.<p><span class= "bld">I do the more cheerfully answer for myself.</span>--The verb for "answer" is connected with our English "apology" in its older sense of "vindication" or "defence."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="accented">- And when the governor</span>, etc., <span class="accented">Paul answered</span> for <span class="accented">then Paul, after that the governor</span>, etc., <span class="accented">answered</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">cheerfully</span> for <span class="accented">the more cheerfully</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">make my</span> defense for <span class="accented">answer for myself</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Forasmuch as I know</span>, etc. St. Paul, with inimitable skill, pitched upon the one favorable side of his judge's person, viz. his long experience in Jewish affairs, and made it the subject of his opening reference - a courteous and conciliatory reference, in striking contrast with the false, fulsome flattery of Tertullus. <span class="cmt_word">Of many years</span>. If Paul was speaking in the year A.D. , and Felix had been governor only since A.D. , "many years" was rather an hyperbole. But Tacitus expressly states that Felix was joint procurator with Cumanus; and therefore he had been a judge to the Jewish nation long before the banishment of Cumanus.
