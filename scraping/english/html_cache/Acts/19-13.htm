These itinerant exorcists traveled from place to place, offering their services. The Jewish historian Josephus mentions Jewish exorcists who used various methods to expel demons. This practice highlights the spiritual climate of the time, where belief in evil spirits and the need for deliverance was prevalent.<p><b>who tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus</b><br>The name of Jesus was recognized as powerful, even among those who did not follow Him. The exorcists attempted to use Jesus' name as a formulaic incantation, reflecting a misunderstanding of the source of true spiritual authority. This misuse of Jesus' name contrasts with the genuine faith and relationship with Christ that empowers believers.<p><b>over those with evil spirits</b><br>Evil spirits, or demons, are acknowledged throughout Scripture as real entities opposed to God. The New Testament frequently records Jesus and His apostles casting out demons, demonstrating the authority of God's kingdom over the forces of darkness. This phrase underscores the spiritual warfare present in the early church era.<p><b>They would say, &#8220;I command you by Jesus, whom Paul proclaims.&#8221;</b><br>The exorcists' attempt to use Jesus' name "whom Paul proclaims" indicates their recognition of Paul's authority and success in ministry. However, their lack of personal relationship with Jesus rendered their command ineffective. This highlights the importance of personal faith and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where believers are empowered to be witnesses through the Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/itinerant_jewish_exorcists.htm">Itinerant Jewish Exorcists</a></b><br>These were Jewish individuals who traveled from place to place attempting to cast out evil spirits.

Scripture affirms the reality of evil spirits (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>), so these men engaged a genuine spiritual conflict. Yet, unlike the apostles who were sent by Christ (<a href="/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14-15</a>), these exorcists moved from place to place on their own initiative, seeking reputation and income more than God&#8217;s glory (cf. <a href="/1_timothy/6-5.htm">1 Timothy 6:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus</b><p>Hearing how Paul drove out demons &#8220;in the name of Jesus Christ&#8221; (<a href="/acts/16-18.htm">Acts 16:18</a>), they attempted the same formula. They recognized that Jesus&#8217; name carries divine authority (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>), but they treated it as a magical incantation rather than a confession of faith (<a href="/john/14-13.htm">John 14:13-14</a>). The verb &#8220;tried&#8221; signals experimentation, not obedience.

They practised exorcisms as a profession, and went from city to city, pretending with charms and spells to cure those who were looked on as possessed with demons. Many of these were said to have come down from Solomon. In Layard's <span class= "ital">Nineveh and Babylon</span> (c. 22) there is an interesting account of several bronze bowls containing such formulae. To them "the name of the Lord Jesus," which was so often in St. Paul's lips, was just another formula, mightier than the name of the Most High God, or that of the archangels Raphael or Michael, which were used by others.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="accented">- But certain also</span> for <span class="accented">then certain</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">strolling</span> for <span class="accented">vagabond</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">name</span> for <span class="accented">call</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the evil</span> for <span class="accented">evil</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">I</span> for <span class="accented">we</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Strolling</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>); going their rounds from place to place, like strolling players or like peddlers. The words should be construed together, "<span class="accented">strolling</span> Jewish exorcists." That certain Jews in our Savior's time exorcised evil spirits appears from <a href="/matthew/12-27.htm">Matthew 12:27</a>; <a href="/luke/9-49.htm">Luke 9:49</a>. We learn also from Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 8:2, 5, that forms of exorcism, said to have been invented by King Solomon, so efficacious that the devils cast out by them could never come back, were used with great effect in his days. He adds that he himself knew of an instance in which one of his own countrymen, Eleazar by name, had cast out devils in the presence of Vespasian and his <span class="accented">sons</span> and officers and a number of his soldiers. The method used was this: The exorcist applied to the nose of the possessed the bezil of a ring, under which was a certain root prescribed by Solomon, and so drew out the evil spirit through the man's nostrils. The possessed then fell to the ground, and the exorcist commanded the evil spirit in the name of Solomon never to return, and then recited one of Solomon's incantations. To give full assurance to the bystanders that the evil spirit had really left the man, the exorcist placed a vessel full of water at some distance off, and then commanded the ejected spirit to overturn it, which he did. Thus far Josephus. Lightfoot, on <a href="/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a>. (vol. 3:215), quotes the book Juchasin as speaking of certain Jews as "skilled in miracles," and the Jerusalem Talmud as speaking of their enchantments and magical tricks and charms" in the name of Jesus" (see, further, Alford on <a href="/matthew/12-27.htm">Matthew 12:27</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/19-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[there were] some</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tines)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
