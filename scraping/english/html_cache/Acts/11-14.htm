In the context of <a href="/acts/11.htm">Acts 11</a>, Peter is the one who conveys the message. This reflects the biblical pattern where God often uses chosen individuals to deliver His word, as seen with prophets in the Old Testament. The message is central to the Christian faith, emphasizing the importance of the Gospel as the means of salvation.<p><b>by which you and all your household</b><br>The inclusion of the household signifies the communal aspect of faith in the early church. In the ancient world, households often included extended family and servants, indicating that the message of salvation was intended for all, regardless of social status. This mirrors the promise in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where all families of the earth are to be blessed through Abraham. It also reflects the practice seen in <a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31</a>, where the Philippian jailer and his household are saved.<p><b>will be saved.</b><br>Salvation is a central theme in the New Testament, representing deliverance from sin and its consequences. This phrase underscores the transformative power of the Gospel, which is not just a message of moral improvement but of complete spiritual renewal. The concept of salvation is rooted in the work of Jesus Christ, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the suffering servant brings redemption. The assurance of salvation for the household also points to the covenantal nature of God's promises, reminiscent of the Passover in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, where entire households were spared through the blood of the lamb.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>- One of Jesus' apostles, who plays a crucial role in the early church and is the one delivering the message of salvation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cornelius.htm">Cornelius</a></b><br>- A Roman centurion who is devout and God-fearing, seeking to know more about God.
