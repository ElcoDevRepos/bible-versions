In the Old Testament, the remnant often refers to the Israelites who remain faithful to God despite widespread apostasy (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>). Here, it suggests that God's plan includes not only Israel but also a faithful group from among the nations. The idea of seeking the Lord is a call to repentance and faith, emphasizing that salvation is available to those who earnestly seek God (<a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>).<p><b>and all the Gentiles who are called by My name</b><br>This phrase underscores the inclusion of Gentiles in God's redemptive plan, a significant theme in the New Testament. The early church grappled with the question of whether Gentiles needed to follow Jewish law to be saved. <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a> addresses this issue, affirming that Gentiles are part of God's people through faith in Christ, not adherence to the law. The phrase "called by My name" indicates a divine selection and identity, echoing Old Testament passages where God calls Israel by His name (<a href="/isaiah/43-7.htm">Isaiah 43:7</a>). It signifies belonging and covenant relationship, now extended to Gentiles.<p><b>says the Lord who does these things</b><br>This phrase affirms the sovereignty and initiative of God in salvation history. It is God who orchestrates the inclusion of the Gentiles, fulfilling His promises and prophecies. The reference to "the Lord" emphasizes His authority and faithfulness. This aligns with the prophetic tradition, where God declares His actions and purposes (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10-11</a>).

The &#8220;remnant&#8221; is the believing core God preserves for Himself, just as He did in Elijah&#8217;s day (<a href="/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2&#8211;5</a>) and foretold through prophets like Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20&#8211;22</a>) and Zephaniah (<a href="/zephaniah/3-12.htm">Zephaniah 3:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Seeking is more than curiosity; it is turning in faith to the risen Christ. Jesus promised, &#8220;Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s rebuilding of &#8220;David&#8217;s fallen tent&#8221; (<a href="/acts/15-16.htm">Acts 15:16</a>, quoting <a href="/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>) centers on the Messiah, the Son of David. In Him the faithful remnant enters full covenant blessing (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31&#8211;34</a>; <a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26&#8211;27</a>).<p>&#8226; The clause reminds every Jewish listener that heritage alone is not enough&#8212;each must personally seek the Lord through repentance and faith (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12&#8211;13</a>; <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And all the Gentiles who are called by My name</b><p>&#8220;and all the Gentiles who are called by My name&#8221; (<a href="/acts/15-17.htm">Acts 15:17</a>b)<p>&#8226; James extends Amos&#8217;s prophecy beyond Israel: God is gathering people from every nation. This fulfills the original promise to Abraham, &#8220;All the families of the earth will be blessed through you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; cf. <a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Called by My name&#8221; signals ownership and intimacy. Believers from the nations now share the covenant name just as Israel did (<a href="/isaiah/56-6.htm">Isaiah 56:6&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter had just reported Cornelius&#8217;s conversion (<a href="/bsb/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>), the Spirit had fallen on Samaritans (<a href="/bsb/acts/8.htm">Acts 8</a>), and Paul and Barnabas had seen Gentile churches birthed (<a href="/bsb/acts/13.htm">Acts 13&#8211;14</a>). The Council recognizes these facts as the very outworking of Scripture.<p>&#8226; This clause crushes any notion of second-class citizenship. In Christ there is &#8220;neither Jew nor Greek&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). Gentile believers become &#8220;fellow citizens with the saints&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>) and living stones in God&#8217;s new temple (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Says the Lord who does these things</b><p>&#8220;says the Lord who does these things&#8221; (<a href="/acts/15-17.htm">Acts 15:17</a>c)<p>&#8226; James seals the argument with God&#8217;s own authority. If the Lord has spoken, the matter is settled (<a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording underscores God&#8217;s active role: He not only decrees but also performs. &#8220;I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass; I have purposed, and I will do it&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/46-11.htm">Isaiah 46:11</a>).<p>&#8226; For puzzled believers wrestling with new realities, this assurance anchors their confidence. The inclusion of the Gentiles is not a human innovation; it is God&#8217;s long-planned accomplishment (<a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also hints at God&#8217;s ongoing work. What He began at Pentecost He continues today, gathering both Jews and Gentiles into one body until the fullness of the nations comes in (<a href="/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/15-17.htm">Acts 15:17</a> reveals God&#8217;s heart and plan: He restores a faithful Jewish remnant and simultaneously gathers Gentiles into the same covenant family. Both groups enter by seeking the Lord through faith in Jesus, and both bear His name with equal standing. The promise rests on God&#8217;s unshakeable word and His power to accomplish everything He declares.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">That the residue of men . . .</span>--The Hebrew gives, as in our version, "That they may possess the remnant of Edom and of all the heathen which are called by my name." The LXX. translators either paraphrased the passage, so as to give a wider and more general view of its teaching, or followed a reading in which the Hebrew for "man" (<span class= "ital">Adam</span>) took the place of Edom. It will be seen that the argument of St. James turns upon the Greek rendering. The "name of God" was to be "called" upon by those who were "the residue of men," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>all that were outside the pale of Israel. So understood, the words became, of course, a prediction of the conversion of the Gentiles, and to the uncritical habits of the time, accustomed to Targums or Paraphrases of many parts of Scripture, the LXX. was for all but the stricter and more bigoted Hebraists, as authoritative as the original.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="accented">- May</span> for <span class="accented">might</span>, A.V. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/15-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">so that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#960;&#969;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hop&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3704.htm">Strong's 3704: </a> </span><span class="str2">From hos and pos; what(-ever) how, i.e. In the manner that (as adverb or conjunction of coincidence, intentional or actual).</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
