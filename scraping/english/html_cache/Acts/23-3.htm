This setting is significant as Paul is addressing the Jewish religious leadership, highlighting his boldness and confidence in his mission.<p><b>&#8220;God will strike you,</b><br>Paul's declaration is prophetic, as Ananias would later meet a violent death. This statement reflects the biblical principle of divine justice, where God avenges wrongdoing. It echoes Old Testament themes where God is seen as the ultimate judge who punishes the wicked.<p><b>you whitewashed wall!</b><br>The term "whitewashed wall" is a metaphor for hypocrisy, similar to Jesus' rebuke of the Pharisees as "whitewashed tombs" in <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>. It suggests an outward appearance of righteousness that conceals inner corruption. This imagery would resonate with the Jewish audience familiar with the practice of whitewashing tombs to make them appear clean.<p><b>You sit here to judge me according to the law,</b><br>Paul points out the irony of being judged by the law by those who are supposed to uphold it. The Sanhedrin was the highest Jewish legal authority, and their role was to interpret and enforce the law. Paul's statement underscores the expectation that they should act justly and lawfully.<p><b>yet you yourself violate the law</b><br>Paul accuses the high priest of breaking the law, referencing the commandment against unjust punishment. This highlights the inconsistency and corruption within the Jewish leadership, who are failing to adhere to the very laws they are meant to enforce.<p><b>by commanding that I be struck.&#8221;</b><br>Paul's rebuke is in response to being struck on the mouth, an act that was illegal under Jewish law without a formal conviction.

His immediate response shows that believers need not be passive when injustice is done; rather, they are permitted to call out sin plainly (cf. <a href="/john/18-22.htm">John 18:22-23</a>, where Jesus likewise questions an unlawful strike).<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s words come from a heart zealous for God&#8217;s righteousness, not personal revenge. Earlier he had testified, &#8220;I have lived my life before God in all good conscience to this day&#8221; (<a href="/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1</a>), underscoring that his protest flows from commitment to God&#8217;s law.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God will strike you</b><p>&#8226; Paul issues a prophetic declaration.

The whole utterance must be regarded by St. Paul's own confession as the expression of a hasty indignation, recalled after a moment's reflection; but the words so spoken were actually a prophecy, fulfilled some years after by the death of Ananias by the hands of the <span class= "ital">sicarii.</span> (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, ii.</span> 17, ?? 2-9).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">for</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">according to</span> for <span class="accented">after</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">God shall smite thee</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>).

Jud,' 2. 17:9), at the beginning of the Jewish war under the procuratorship of Florus, in the year A.D. . He had been previously deposed from the high priesthood by King Agrippa toward the close of the government of Felix ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:8), about A.D. , or early in A.D. , less than two years from the present time. <span class="cmt_word">Thou whited wall</span>. This expression is admirably illustrated by the quotations from Seneca in Kuinoel: "These base and sordid spirits are like the walls of their own houses, only beautiful on the outside." "What are our gilt roofs hut lies? for we well know that under the gilding unseemly beams are concealed." "It is not only our walls which are coated with a thin outward ornament; the greatness of those men whom you see strutting in their pride is mere tinsel; look beneath the surface, and you will see all the evil that is hid under that thin crust of dignity" ('De Provid.,' 6, and 'Epist.' 115). Ananias was sitting in his priestly robes of office, presiding over the council in power and dignity, and presumably a righteous judge, but his heart within was polluted with injustice, selfishness, and a corrupt disposition, which made him act unrighteously (comp. <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Contrary to the Law</span>; or, <span class="accented">acting illegally</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, only found here in the New Testament, but common in classical Greek. St. Paul's temper was very excusably roused by the brutality and injustice of Ananias. But we may, perhaps, think that he did not quite attain to "the mind that was in Christ Jesus," who "when he was reviled, reviled not again," but was "led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, he opened not his mouth" (<a href="/acts/8-32.htm">Acts 8:32</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/23-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
