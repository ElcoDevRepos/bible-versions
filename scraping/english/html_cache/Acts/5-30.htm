It connects to the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;underscoring the fulfillment of God's promises. This continuity is crucial for understanding the early Christian message as a fulfillment of Jewish prophecy and tradition.<p><b>raised up Jesus</b><br>"Raised up" refers to the resurrection, a central tenet of Christian faith. The resurrection is seen as God's vindication of Jesus, affirming His divine nature and mission. This act fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, which speaks of God not allowing His Holy One to see decay. The resurrection is also a cornerstone for the apostolic preaching in Acts.<p><b>whom you had killed</b><br>This phrase directly addresses the responsibility of the Jewish leaders and people in the death of Jesus. It reflects the tension between the early Christians and the Jewish authorities. This accusation is consistent with the narrative in the Gospels, where the religious leaders conspired to have Jesus crucified. It also serves as a call to repentance for those who were complicit.<p><b>by hanging Him on a tree</b><br>"Hanging on a tree" is a reference to crucifixion, which was a Roman method of execution. The phrase echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>, where being hanged on a tree is associated with being cursed by God. This connection is significant in understanding the theological implications of Jesus' death, as Paul later explains in <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>, stating that Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us.

links the message of Jesus to the covenant history of Israel.<p>- By invoking &#8220;the God of our fathers,&#8221; he reminds the Sanhedrin that the same God who spoke to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>; <a href="/acts/3-13.htm">Acts 3:13</a>) is the One acting now.<p>- This phrase underscores continuity: the gospel is not a new religion but the fulfillment of God&#8217;s longstanding promises (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>; <a href="/acts/13-32.htm">Acts 13:32-33</a>).<p>- It also carries a gentle yet firm invitation: if they revere the patriarchs, they must listen to what their God has done and repent (<a href="/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>raised up Jesus</b><p>- &#8220;Raised up&#8221; points first to the resurrection. God literally brought Jesus back from the dead (<a href="/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a>; <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The resurrection vindicates Jesus as Messiah and Lord (<a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>).<p>&#8226; It assures believers of future resurrection (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>).<p>- The phrase can also echo God&#8217;s purposeful raising of a deliverer, as in <a href="/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9</a>. Jesus is the ultimate Deliverer.<p>- By highlighting God&#8217;s action, Peter shifts attention from human rejection to divine approval (<a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22-23</a>; <a href="/acts/4-10.htm">Acts 4:10-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whom you had killed</b><p>- Peter holds the leaders accountable: &#8220;you.&#8221; He had earlier declared, &#8220;this Jesus, whom you crucified&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; 4:10).<p>- Yet he never singles out only the leaders; humanity&#8217;s sin placed Jesus on the cross (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5-6</a>; <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>).<p>- The statement is both accusation and invitation&#8212;exposing guilt so that grace can be received (<a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by hanging Him on a tree</b><p>- &#8220;Tree&#8221; recalls <a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>, where a hanged man is under God&#8217;s curse.<p>&#8226; By taking that curse, Jesus redeems us from it (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>).<p>- The word pictures the wooden cross without technical jargon, stressing shame and curse rather than mere execution method (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>).<p>- Peter shows the paradox: what looked like a cursed death became the means of blessing (<a href="/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/5-30.htm">Acts 5:30</a> weaves Israel&#8217;s story, Jesus&#8217; resurrection, human guilt, and the cursed cross into one verse.
