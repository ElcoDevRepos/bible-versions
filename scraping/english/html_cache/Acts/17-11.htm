This term suggests a higher moral and intellectual character. In contrast to the Thessalonians, who had a mixed response to Paul's message, the Bereans are praised for their willingness to engage with new teachings. The Thessalonians had some who believed, but others who were hostile, leading to persecution (<a href="/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5-9</a>). The Bereans' nobility is seen in their fair-mindedness and lack of prejudice, which is a model for how to approach new teachings.<p><b>for they received the message with great eagerness</b><br>The Bereans' eagerness reflects a genuine interest and enthusiasm for the Word of God. This eagerness is a positive trait, showing a hunger for spiritual truth. It contrasts with the skepticism or indifference that can often accompany new teachings. Their attitude is reminiscent of the Psalmist's delight in God's law (<a href="/psalms/119-97.htm">Psalm 119:97</a>). This eagerness is a key component of their noble-mindedness, as it shows a proactive approach to learning and understanding.<p><b>and examined the Scriptures every day</b><br>The Bereans' daily examination of the Scriptures highlights their diligence and commitment to truth. This practice of daily study is a model for believers, emphasizing the importance of regular engagement with God's Word. The Bereans did not take Paul's teachings at face value but sought to verify them against the Hebrew Scriptures, which were the authoritative texts for them. This practice aligns with the biblical principle of testing all things and holding fast to what is good (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>).<p><b>to see if these teachings were true</b><br>The Bereans' approach to verifying Paul's teachings underscores the importance of discernment and critical thinking in matters of faith. They did not blindly accept new doctrines but sought confirmation through Scripture, which is the ultimate standard of truth. This method of validation is consistent with the call to be like the sons of Issachar, who understood the times and knew what Israel should do (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-32.htm">1 Chronicles 12:32</a>). The Bereans' example encourages believers to be discerning and to ensure that teachings align with biblical truth, reflecting the Bereans' commitment to truth and their reliance on Scripture as the foundation for belief.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bereans.htm">Bereans</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Berea, a city in Macedonia, known for their

Here it stands for the generous, loyal temper which was ideally supposed to characterise those of noble origin. This was the quality which the Apostle and the historian admired in the Ber?ans. They were not the slaves of prejudice. They were ready to believe in the gospel which St. Paul preached as meeting their spiritual wants; and so they came to the study of the proofs, which the preacher "opened and alleged," with a temper predisposed to faith. On the other hand, they did not accept their own wishes, or the Apostle's assertions, as in themselves sufficient grounds of faith. With a quick and clear intelligence they searched the Scriptures daily to see whether they really did speak of a Christ who should suffer and rise again. The Ber?an converts have naturally been regarded, especially among those who urge the duty, or claim the right, of private judgment, as a representative instance of the right relations of Reason and Faith, occupying a middle position between credulity and scepticism, to be reproduced, <span class= "ital">mutatis mutandis, </span>according to the different aspects which each presents in successive ages.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="accented">Now these</span> for <span class="accented">these</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">examining</span> for <span class="accented">and searched</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">these</span> for <span class="accented">those</span>, A.V.
