He played a crucial role in the acceptance of Paul by the apostles in Jerusalem. His desire to take John Mark on the missionary journey reflects his forgiving and nurturing nature, as he likely wanted to give Mark another chance after he had previously left Paul and Barnabas during their first missionary journey (<a href="/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13</a>).<p><b>John, also called Mark</b><br>John Mark, often referred to simply as Mark, was a relative of Barnabas, possibly his cousin (<a href="/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>). He is traditionally believed to be the author of the Gospel of Mark. His dual name reflects the common practice of Jews in the Roman Empire having both a Hebrew name (John) and a Roman name (Mark). Mark's earlier departure from the mission field may have been due to fear, immaturity, or disagreement, but he later became a valuable companion to Paul (<a href="/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>) and Peter (<a href="/1_peter/5-13.htm">1 Peter 5:13</a>), indicating his growth and restoration in ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/barnabas.htm">Barnabas</a></b><br>A key figure in the early Christian church, known for his encouragement and support of new believers.
