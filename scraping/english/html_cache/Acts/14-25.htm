It was a significant city in the Roman province and known for its temple of Artemis. Paul and Barnabas had previously passed through Perga on their first missionary journey (<a href="/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13-14</a>), but there is no record of them preaching there at that time. This phrase indicates that they took the opportunity to proclaim the Gospel upon their return. The act of speaking the word signifies the central mission of the apostles: to spread the message of Jesus Christ. This aligns with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), emphasizing the importance of evangelism in early Christianity.<p><b>they went down to Attalia</b><br>Attalia, known today as Antalya, was a port city in Pamphylia, serving as a gateway for travel and trade. The phrase "went down" reflects the geographical descent from the inland city of Perga to the coastal city of Attalia. This journey was part of Paul and Barnabas's return trip to Antioch, from where they had been sent out by the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/13.htm">Acts 13:1-3</a>). Attalia was likely chosen for its port facilities, facilitating their sea voyage back to their sending church. This movement underscores the strategic planning in their missionary work, ensuring the Gospel reached various regions. The journey from Perga to Attalia also highlights the apostles' commitment to completing their mission, despite the challenges faced during their travels.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_barnabas.htm">Paul and Barnabas</a></b><br>The primary missionaries in this passage, continuing their first missionary journey, spreading the Gospel and establishing churches.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/perga.htm">Perga</a></b><br>A city in Pamphylia where Paul and Barnabas preached the word.
