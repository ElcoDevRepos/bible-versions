The term "jeopardy" indicates a serious risk, reflecting the Roman Empire's strict laws against public disorder. Ephesus was a significant city in the Roman province of Asia, and maintaining peace was crucial to avoid Roman intervention. The Roman authorities were known for their intolerance of riots, as they could destabilize the region and challenge Roman authority. This phrase highlights the political tension and the potential consequences of civil unrest.<p><b>for today&#8217;s events</b><br>The "events" refer to the uproar caused by the silversmiths led by Demetrius, who were concerned about the impact of Paul's preaching on their trade of making silver shrines of Artemis. Ephesus was home to the Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the worship of Artemis was central to the city's identity and economy. The events of the day were not just a religious dispute but also an economic and cultural crisis, as the spread of Christianity threatened the local economy and traditional religious practices.<p><b>and we have no justification</b><br>The city clerk acknowledges that there is no legal basis for the riot. This admission is significant because it underscores the lack of legitimate grievances against Paul and his companions. The absence of justification suggests that the opposition to Paul's message was rooted in fear and economic self-interest rather than any legal or moral wrongdoing. This aligns with other instances in Acts where accusations against Christians are shown to be unfounded, highlighting the integrity of the early Christian movement.<p><b>to account for this commotion.</b><br>The "commotion" refers to the chaotic assembly that had gathered in the theater of Ephesus. The city clerk's statement serves as a call to order, emphasizing the need for lawful conduct. The use of the word "commotion" suggests disorder and confusion, which contrasts with the order and peace that the Roman authorities demanded. This situation reflects the broader theme in Acts of the tension between the spread of the Gospel and the societal structures it challenged. The clerk's intervention ultimately prevents further escalation, allowing Paul and his companions to continue their mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>A central figure in the Book of Acts, Paul was spreading the Gospel in Ephesus, which led to significant social and economic upheaval.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, known for its temple of Artemis.

Scripture consistently affirms lawful authority, denounces riotous behavior, and highlights God&#8217;s protection of His innocent servants. The verse calls believers to honor order, reject mob mentality, and trust that the gospel, though it may disturb worldly systems, stands blameless before both God and man.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(40) <span class= "bld">We</span> <span class= "bld">are in danger to be called in question.</span>--The "we" as used to include the rioters. The "called in question" is the same verb as that rendered "implead" in <a href="/acts/19-38.htm" title="Why if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them accuse one another.">Acts 19:38</a>. There was a risk of which Demetrius and his party had to be reminded, that they might find themselves defendants, and not plaintiffs, in a suit. A riotous "concourse" (the town-clerk uses the most contemptuous word he can find, "this <span class= "ital">mob meeting"</span>) taking the law into its own hands was not an offence which the proconsuls were likely to pass over lightly. It would hardly be thought a legitimate excuse that they had got hold of two Jews and wanted to "lynch" them.<p>An interesting inscription of the date of Trajan, from an aqueduct at Ephesus, gives nearly all the technical terms that occur in the town-clerk's speech, and so far confirms the accuracy of St. Luke's report: "This has been dedicated by the loyal and devoted Council of the Ephesians, and the people that serve the temple (<span class= "ital">Neokoros</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>Peducaeus Priscinus being <span class= "ital">proconsul, </span>by the decree of Tiberius Claudius Italicus, the <span class= "ital">town-clerk</span> of the people."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> <span class="accented">- For indeed</span> for <span class="accented">for</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">accused</span> for <span class="accented">called in question</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">concerning</span> <span class="accented">for</span> for, A.V.; <span class="accented">riot</span> for <span class="accented">uproar</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">for it</span> for <span class="accented">whereby</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and as touching it we shall not be able to</span> for <span class="accented">we may</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">account</span> for <span class="accented">an account</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">We are in danger</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>: see ver. 27, note). <span class="cmt_word">To be accused concerning this day's riot</span>.

But "<span class="accented">it"</span> must mean "the riot," which is feminine, whereas <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;</span> is masculine; so that the R.T. is impossible to construe. It is much better, therefore, to adhere to the T.R., which has good manuscript authority, and to construe as the A.V. <span class="accented">Whereby</span>, equivalent to "<span class="accented">on</span> the ground of which" (Meyer). With regard to the great tumult to which the foregoing narrative relates, it is certain that St. Luke has by no means exaggerated its importance. In his Second Epistle to the Corinthians, written from Macedonia shortly after his departure from Ephesus, St. Paul speaks as one still smarting under the severity of his sufferings. In the language of trust, yet of a trust sorely tried, he speaks of the Father of mercies" who comforteth us in all our tribulation." He speaks of the sufferings of Christ as abounding in him. And then, referring directly to the trouble which came upon him in Asia, he <span class="accented">says</span>, "We were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life: but we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: who delivered us from so great a death" (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-4.htm">2 Corinthians 1:4-10</a>). And the same tone breaks out again in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7-18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-4.htm">2 Corinthians 6:4-10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-27</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9, 10</a>. It is also very probable that it was on this occasion that Priscilla and Aquila saved St. Paul's life at the risk of their own, to which he alludes in <a href="/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3, 4</a>, written after he had reached Corinth from Macedonia, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> before Easter of the year So that it is certain that the riot and the danger to St. Paul's life were even greater than we should have inferred from St. Luke's narrative alone. It should be added, with reference to the three <span class="accented">years</span> residence at Ephesus (<a href="/acts/20-21.htm">Acts 20:21</a>) which this nineteenth chapter describes, that one or two important incidents which occurred are not related by St. Luke. The first is that encounter with a savage rabble to which St. Paul refers in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-32.htm">1 Corinthians 15:32</a>, but of which we have no account in the Acts. It must have happened in the early part of his sojourn at Ephesus. Another is a probable visit to Corinth, inferred from <a href="/2_corinthians/2-1.htm">2 Corinthians 2:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-14.htm">2 Corinthians 12:14, 21</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1, 2</a>; and thought to have been caused by bad accounts of the moral state of the Corinthian Church, sent to him at Ephesus. It was probably a hasty visit, and in contrast with it he says, in <a href="/1_corinthians/16-7.htm">1 Corinthians 16:7</a>, with reference to his then coming visit, "I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you." It is also thought that there was another letter to the Corinthians, written from Ephesus, soon after that second visit, which is now lost, but is alluded to in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-9.htm">1 Corinthians 5:9</a>. The First Epistle to the Corinthians was manifestly written at this time from Ephesus (see <a href="/1_corinthians/16-8.htm">1 Corinthians 16:8, 19</a>). Some think that the Epistle to the Galatians was also written from Ephesus, a little before the First Epistle to the Corinthians (see <a href="/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>); but Renan thinks it was written from Antioch, before he came to Ephesus. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/19-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">we are in jeopardy of</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#953;&#957;&#948;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(kindyneuomen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2793.htm">Strong's 2793: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be in danger or peril.
