It underscores the power of God to act swiftly and decisively in the lives of individuals. This moment marks a pivotal transformation in Saul's life, aligning with the biblical theme of God's intervention at critical moments.<p><b>something like scales fell from Saul&#8217;s eyes</b><br>The imagery of scales suggests a physical manifestation of spiritual blindness being removed. This can be seen as a fulfillment of spiritual enlightenment, where Saul's previous inability to see the truth of Jesus Christ is lifted. The metaphor of scales is unique to this passage, symbolizing the removal of barriers to understanding and perceiving spiritual truth. This event is reminiscent of Old Testament instances where God opens the eyes of individuals to see His reality, such as in <a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>.<p><b>and his sight was restored</b><br>The restoration of Saul's sight is both literal and symbolic. Literally, it marks the end of his physical blindness, which began on the road to Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-8.htm">Acts 9:8-9</a>). Symbolically, it represents Saul's newfound spiritual insight and understanding of Jesus as the Messiah. This restoration is a testament to the transformative power of Christ, aligning with themes of healing and redemption found throughout the New Testament.<p><b>He got up</b><br>This action signifies Saul's readiness to embrace his new life and mission. It reflects a common biblical motif where individuals rise to follow God's call, as seen in the stories of prophets and disciples. Saul's rising is an act of obedience and acceptance of his new identity in Christ, preparing him for the mission to the Gentiles.<p><b>and was baptized</b><br>Baptism here signifies Saul's public declaration of faith and his initiation into the Christian community. It is an outward expression of an inward transformation, symbolizing the washing away of his past sins and his new life in Christ. This act connects Saul to the early Christian practice of baptism as a sign of repentance and faith, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>. Saul's baptism also aligns with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His followers to baptize new disciples.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul (Paul)</a></b><br>A Pharisee and persecutor of Christians who experiences a dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus, becoming a devoted follower of Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ananias.htm">Ananias</a></b><br>A disciple in Damascus who, despite initial fear, obeys God's command to visit Saul and lay hands on him, facilitating Saul's healing and baptism.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/damascus.htm">Damascus</a></b><br>The city where Saul was headed to persecute Christians, but instead becomes the place of his conversion and baptism.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_road_to_damascus.htm">The Road to Damascus</a></b><br>The location of Saul's encounter with Jesus, leading to his temporary blindness and subsequent spiritual awakening.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/baptism.htm">Baptism</a></b><br>The act of Saul's public declaration of faith and obedience to Christ following his conversion and healing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_blindness_and_sight.htm">Spiritual Blindness and Sight</a></b><br>Saul's physical blindness symbolizes spiritual blindness.

God instantly removes Saul&#8217;s blindness, restores sight, and leads him to be baptized. The passage showcases Christ&#8217;s sovereign power to transform enemies into servants, emphasizing that salvation is God-initiated, visibly confirmed, and immediately expressed in obedient faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">There fell from his eyes as it had been scales.</span>--The description suggests the thought that the blindness was caused by an incrustation, caused by acute inflammation, covering the pupil of the eye, or closing up the eye-lids, analogous to the "whiteness," that peeled (or <span class= "ital">scaled</span>) off from the eyes of Tobit (<a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/11-13.htm" title="And the whiteness pilled away from the corners of his eyes: and when he saw his son, he fell upon his neck.">Tobit 11:13</a>). Like phenomena are mentioned by Hippocrates, and the care with which St. Luke records the fact in this instance, may be noted, with <a href="/acts/3-7.htm" title="And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.">Acts 3:7</a>; <a href="/acts/28-8.htm" title="And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.">Acts 28:8</a>, as one of the examples of the technical precision of his calling as a physician.<p><span class= "bld">Arose, and was baptised.</span>--It is clear that both Saul and Ananias looked on this as the indispensable condition for admission into the visible society of the kingdom of God. No visions and revelations of the Lord, no intensity of personal conversion, exempted him from it. For him, too, that was the "washing of regeneration" (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>), the moment of the new birth, of being buried with Christ (<a href="/context/romans/6-3.htm" title="Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?">Romans 6:3-4</a>). It may be inferred almost as a matter of certainty that it was at the hands of Ananias that he received baptism. The baptism would probably be administered in one or other of the rivers which the history of Naaman had made famous, and so the waters of "Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus" (<a href="/2_kings/5-12.htm" title="Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.">2Kings 5:12</a>), were now sanctified no less than those of Jordan for the "mystical washing away of sin." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> <span class="accented">- Straightway</span> for <span class="accented">immediately</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">as it were</span> for as <span class="accented">it had been</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">received his sight</span> for <span class="accented">received sight forthwith</span>, A.V. and T.R.; he <span class="accented">arose</span> for <span class="accented">arose</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">As it were scales</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">scales</span>, or <span class="accented">flakes</span>; any thin substance which peals off; a frequent term in Greek medical writers. <span class="cmt_word">And was baptized</span>. It is a curious difference between St. Paul and the other apostles that, if they were baptized at all, which is doubtful, they must have been baptized by Christ himself; whereas St. Paul received his baptism at the hands of Ananias.
