The elders were leaders within the early church, often responsible for teaching and governance. This gathering signifies the importance of collective leadership and decision-making in the early church. The inclusion of both apostles and elders highlights the balance between spiritual authority and practical wisdom. This structure is seen in other parts of the New Testament, such as in <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>, where elders are described as worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching.<p><b>met</b><br>The act of meeting indicates a formal assembly, suggesting the gravity of the issue at hand. This was not a casual discussion but a deliberate gathering to address a significant theological and practical concern. The early church often met in homes or synagogues, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a> and <a href="/acts/5-42.htm">Acts 5:42</a>, reflecting the communal and relational nature of early Christian worship and decision-making.<p><b>to look into</b><br>This phrase implies careful consideration and investigation. The early church leaders were committed to discerning God's will through prayer, discussion, and examination of the Scriptures. This approach is consistent with the Berean attitude in <a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>, where the Bereans are commended for examining the Scriptures daily to see if what Paul said was true.<p><b>this matter</b><br>The matter in question was the issue of whether Gentile converts to Christianity needed to be circumcised and follow the Mosaic Law, as some Jewish Christians were advocating. This was a pivotal moment in church history, as it addressed the relationship between Jewish traditions and the new covenant in Christ. The resolution of this issue, as seen later in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, affirmed that salvation is through grace and faith in Jesus Christ alone, not by adherence to the law, aligning with Paul's teachings in <a href="/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a> and <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/apostles.htm">Apostles</a></b><br>The original disciples of Jesus Christ, chosen to spread His teachings and establish the early Church.

Paul and Barnabas dispute the claim, and the church at Antioch sends them to Jerusalem for clarity.<p>&#8226; The transition word marks a deliberate response of the church&#8217;s leadership to a brewing doctrinal crisis, much like earlier turning points (see <a href="/acts/6-2.htm">Acts 6:2</a> &#8220;So the Twelve summoned the whole group&#8221;

It bore its witness that the government of the Christian society was not to rest in the autocracy of a single will, but in the deliberative decision of those who, directly or indirectly, having been appointed by the choice, or with the approval, of the people, represented the whole community. Presbyters had an equal voice with the Apostles, whose position was analogous to that of the later bishops. Those whom we should call the laity were present at the deliberations, and, though we have no absolute proof that they took part in them, gave their vote. (Comp. Note on <a href="/acts/15-23.htm" title="And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brothers send greeting to the brothers which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.">Acts 15:23</a>.) Strictly speaking, it was, in the later ecclesiastical language, a provincial and not an ?cumenical synod, called to decide what seemed a question of discipline rather than of doctrine; but the ground on which the question had been argued made it one of world-wide dogmatic importance. If circumcision was necessary, then faith in Christ was insufficient. St. Paul saw and felt this in all its fulness, and therefore would not "give way by subjection, no, not for an hour" (<a href="/galatians/2-5.htm" title="To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.">Galatians 2:5</a>). We have no <span class= "ital">data</span> for estimating the number of the presbyters who were present. Probably they included those of the neighbouring towns and villages of Judaea as well as of Jerusalem, and if so, we may fairly think of some number between fifty and a hundred.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> <span class="accented">- The elders</span> for <span class="accented">elders</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">were gathered</span> for came, A.V.; to for <span class="accented">for</span> to, A.V.
