It is mentioned in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/leviticus/16-8.htm">Leviticus 16:8</a> for selecting the scapegoat. The practice reflects a reliance on divine providence rather than human judgment. In this context, it underscores the apostles' desire to ensure that the choice of Judas's replacement was divinely guided.<p><b>and the lot fell to Matthias.</b><br>Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot, fulfilling the need for twelve apostles, which symbolically represents the twelve tribes of Israel. This selection highlights the importance of maintaining the apostolic foundation for the early church. Matthias's selection is not mentioned elsewhere in the New Testament, indicating that his role was primarily foundational rather than prominent in the narrative of Acts.<p><b>So he was added to the eleven apostles.</b><br>The restoration of the group to twelve apostles signifies completeness and continuity in the mission of the church. The number twelve is significant in biblical numerology, often associated with God's people.

The disciples trusted that promise; they were not gambling but submitting the final decision to God after meeting the clear qualifications laid out in <a href="/acts/1-21.htm">Acts 1:21&#8211;22</a>.<p>&#8226; By using lots one last time before Pentecost, they underscored their dependence on the Lord&#8217;s sovereign direction rather than mere human preference.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the lot fell to Matthias</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s answer was specific: &#8220;the lot fell to Matthias.&#8221; As with Saul being chosen as king (<a href="/1_samuel/10-20.htm">1 Samuel 10:20&#8211;24</a>), the outcome signaled divine appointment, not coincidence.<p>&#8226; Matthias had walked with Jesus &#8220;from the baptism of John until the day He was taken up&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-22.htm">Acts 1:22</a>), faithfully remaining in the background. His selection reminds us that the Lord sees hidden faithfulness and elevates servants in His timing (<a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The silence about any objections shows the eleven received this outcome as God&#8217;s settled will, aligning with Jesus&#8217; earlier promise that the Spirit would guide them into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So he was added to the eleven apostles</b><p>&#8226; With Matthias &#8220;added to the eleven apostles,&#8221; the full complement of twelve&#8212;symbolic of the twelve tribes of Israel&#8212;was restored (<a href="/luke/22-30.htm">Luke 22:30</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-14.htm">Revelation 21:14</a>).<p>&#8226; This restoration prepared the apostolic foundation for the coming outpouring of the Spirit in <a href="/bsb/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>. Peter will soon stand &#8220;with the eleven&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14</a>), a phrase that now includes Matthias.<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores continuity: Jesus had personally chosen the original twelve (<a href="/luke/6-13.htm">Luke 6:13</a>), and through prayer and providence He now installs Matthias, ensuring an unbroken line of witnesses to His resurrection.<p>&#8226; Practically, the early church model is evident: corporate prayer, Scripture-based qualifications, and reliance on God&#8217;s sovereign confirmation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a> shows the early believers combining diligent obedience with wholehearted trust in God&#8217;s decisive guidance. Casting lots honored Old Testament precedent, and the result affirmed Matthias as God&#8217;s chosen replacement for Judas, restoring the twelve-apostle witness core. The passage teaches that unseen faithfulness matters, divine sovereignty directs even seemingly random processes, and Christ ensures His church is rightly ordered for mission.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">And they gave forth their lots.</span>--As interpreted by the prayer of <a href="/acts/1-24.htm" title="And they prayed, and said, You, Lord, which know the hearts of all men, show whether of these two you have chosen,">Acts 1:24</a>, and by the word "fell" here, there can be no doubt that the passage speaks of "lots" and not "votes." The two men were chosen by the disciples as standing, as far as they could see, on the same level. It was left for the Searcher of hearts to show, by the exclusion of human will, which of the two He had chosen. The most usual way of casting lots in such cases was to write each name on a tablet, place them in an urn, and then shake the urn till one came out. A like custom prevailed among the Greeks, as in the well-known story of the stratagem of Cresphontes in the division of territory after the Doriar invasion (Sophocles, <span class= "ital">Aias.</span> 1285; comp. <a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm" title="The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.">Proverbs 16:33</a>). The practice was recognised, it may be noted, in the Law (<a href="/leviticus/16-8.htm" title="And Aaron shall cast lots on the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.">Leviticus 16:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">He was numbered with the eleven apostles.</span>--The Greek word is not the same as in <a href="/acts/1-17.htm" title="For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.">Acts 1:17</a>, and implies that Matthias was "voted in," the suffrage of the Church unanimously confirming the indication of the divine will which had been given by the lot. It may be that the new Apostle took the place which Judas had left vacant, and was the last of the Twelve.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="accented">They</span> <span class="accented">gave lots for them</span> for they <span class="accented">gave forth their lots</span>, A.V. and T.R.

The exact mode of taking the lot does not appear. Some think the name of each candidate was written on a tablet, and that the first name which fell out of the urn after it had been shaken was the one chosen. Some think the lot was taken by dice. But however the taking of the lot was managed, the effect was to leave the choice to God in answer to prayer. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/1-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they cast</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#948;&#969;&#954;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ed&#333;kan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1325.htm">Strong's 1325: </a> </span><span class="str2">To offer, give; I put, place.
