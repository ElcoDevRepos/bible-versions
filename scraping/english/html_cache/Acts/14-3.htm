This phrase indicates their commitment to establishing a strong foundation for the new believers. The "considerable time" suggests a period of several months, allowing them to teach and disciple the converts thoroughly. This dedication reflects the missionary strategy of the early church, emphasizing the importance of nurturing new believers and establishing a solid church community.<p><b>speaking boldly for the Lord</b><br>The boldness of Paul and Barnabas is a recurring theme in Acts, highlighting their reliance on the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>). Despite opposition and potential persecution, they continued to proclaim the gospel fearlessly. This boldness is a fulfillment of Jesus' promise that His followers would receive power when the Holy Spirit came upon them (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). Their courage serves as an example for believers to stand firm in their faith, regardless of external pressures.<p><b>who affirmed the message of His grace</b><br>The message of grace refers to the gospel, which emphasizes salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, not by works (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). God's affirmation of this message underscores its divine origin and truth. The concept of grace is central to Christian theology, contrasting with the legalistic approach of the Judaizers, who insisted on adherence to the Mosaic Law for salvation. This affirmation by God validates the apostles' teaching and encourages the believers in their newfound faith.<p><b>by enabling them to perform signs and wonders</b><br>Signs and wonders were miraculous events that served as divine confirmation of the apostles' message. These acts demonstrated God's power and authenticated the gospel, drawing attention to the truth of their proclamation (<a href="/hebrews/2-4.htm">Hebrews 2:4</a>). In the biblical narrative, miracles often accompany the introduction of new revelation, as seen in the ministries of Moses, Elijah, and Jesus. These miracles in Iconium would have been particularly significant in a Greco-Roman context, where supernatural occurrences were often associated with divine favor.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A key apostle in the early church, known for his missionary journeys and bold proclamation of the Gospel.
