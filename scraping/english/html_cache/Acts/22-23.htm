This reaction is reminiscent of other instances in the Bible where crowds react vehemently, such as during Jesus' trial (<a href="/matthew/27-22.htm">Matthew 27:22-23</a>). The shouting signifies a collective outrage and a demand for action, often seen in mob mentality.<p><b>and throwing off their cloaks</b><br>Throwing off cloaks can symbolize preparation for action, possibly indicating readiness for violence or protest. In biblical times, cloaks were valuable garments, and discarding them could signify urgency or a willingness to sacrifice personal belongings for a cause. This act may also echo the fervor seen in <a href="/2_kings/9-13.htm">2 Kings 9:13</a>, where cloaks were spread under Jehu as a sign of allegiance.<p><b>and tossing dust into the air</b><br>Tossing dust is a gesture of extreme agitation or mourning, seen in other biblical contexts such as <a href="/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>, where friends of Job express their grief. In this context, it underscores the crowd's anger and disapproval of Paul.

Each action exposes the crowd&#8217;s wholesale rejection of Paul&#8217;s gospel testimony, mirrors earlier hostile scenes toward God&#8217;s servants, and sets the stage for Roman intervention ordained by the Lord. The verse reminds believers that opposition to truth can be loud and violent, yet God&#8217;s sovereign hand remains firmly in control, turning even dust-filled chaos into steps toward the fulfillment of His unbreakable promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air.</span>--The latter gesture would seem to have been a natural relief, as with other Oriental nations, to the violence of uncontrolled passion.
