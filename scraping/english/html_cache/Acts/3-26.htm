The term "Servant" is significant, echoing the "Suffering Servant" in <a href="/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13-53</a>:12, a prophecy about the Messiah who would suffer for the sins of the people. The resurrection is central to Christian faith, affirming Jesus as the Messiah and validating His teachings and sacrifice. The concept of God raising up a servant also connects to the Old Testament, where God often raised leaders to deliver Israel, such as Moses and David.<p><b>He sent Him first to you</b><br>The "you" here refers to the Jewish people, emphasizing that Jesus' ministry was initially directed towards Israel. This aligns with Jesus' own statements during His earthly ministry, such as in <a href="/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>, where He says He was sent "only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." This priority reflects God's covenantal relationship with Israel, as they were chosen to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>). The early church, as seen in Acts, began its mission in Jerusalem before spreading to the Gentiles.<p><b>to bless you</b><br>The blessing mentioned is spiritual in nature, focusing on salvation and the forgiveness of sins. This echoes the Abrahamic covenant in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where God promises that through Abraham's offspring, all nations would be blessed. Jesus, as a descendant of Abraham, fulfills this promise, offering the ultimate blessing of reconciliation with God. The concept of blessing also ties into the Jewish understanding of shalom, which encompasses peace, wholeness, and well-being.<p><b>by turning each of you from your wicked ways</b><br>Repentance is a key theme here, indicating a turning away from sin and towards God. This call to repentance is consistent with the messages of the prophets in the Old Testament, who urged Israel to return to God (e.g., <a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>). In the New Testament, John the Baptist and Jesus both began their ministries with a call to repentance (<a href="/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2, 4</a>:17).

That blessing is inseparable from repentance: God turns individuals from sin to Himself. The verse underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness, the centrality of the resurrection, and the necessity of personal turning, displaying a salvation that is both divinely initiated and personally transformative.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Unto you first</span>. . . .--Here again we note, even in the very turn of the phrase as well as of the thought, an agreement with St. Paul's formula of the purpose of God being manifested "to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile" (<a href="/acts/13-46.htm" title="Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing you put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, see, we turn to the Gentiles.">Acts 13:46</a>; <a href="/romans/1-16.htm" title="For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.">Romans 1:16</a>; <a href="/context/romans/2-9.htm" title="Tribulation and anguish, on every soul of man that does evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;">Romans 2:9-10</a>).
