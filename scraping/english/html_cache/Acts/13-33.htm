The "us" refers to the Jewish people and, by extension, all believers who are considered spiritual descendants. The resurrection is central to Christian faith, signifying Jesus' victory over death and His divine sonship. This fulfillment is a continuation of God's covenantal faithfulness, as seen in the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The resurrection is also a pivotal event that confirms Jesus as the Messiah, the anointed one prophesied in the Hebrew Scriptures.<p><b>As it is written in the second Psalm:</b><br>The reference to the second Psalm indicates the use of the Old Testament to validate New Testament events. Psalms were often used in the early church to demonstrate how Jesus fulfilled messianic prophecies. The second Psalm is a royal psalm, traditionally understood as referring to the Davidic king, but in the New Testament context, it is applied to Jesus, the ultimate fulfillment of the Davidic line. This use of the Psalms underscores the continuity between the Old and New Testaments and the belief that Jesus is the promised King.<p><b>&#8216;You are My Son; today I have become Your Father.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase is a direct quotation from <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, which is interpreted as a messianic prophecy. In its original context, it was likely used during the coronation of a king in Israel, symbolizing the king's special relationship with God. In the New Testament, this is applied to Jesus, affirming His divine sonship and His unique relationship with God the Father. The "today" signifies a specific moment of divine declaration, often understood as the resurrection, where Jesus is publicly affirmed as the Son of God with power. This declaration is echoed in other New Testament passages, such as <a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>, which speaks of Jesus being declared the Son of God through the resurrection. This phrase encapsulates the theological truth of Jesus' identity and mission, central to Christian belief.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_barnabas.htm">Paul and Barnabas</a></b><br>Key figures in the early Christian church, they were on a missionary journey spreading the Gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/antioch_in_pisidia.htm">Antioch in Pisidia</a></b><br>A city in modern-day Turkey where Paul delivered his sermon in the synagogue, addressing both Jews and God-fearing Gentiles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to the message, His resurrection is the fulfillment of God's promise.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>King of Israel, whose lineage and Psalms are referenced as prophetic of Jesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalm_2.htm">Psalm 2</a></b><br>An Old Testament scripture quoted by Paul to affirm Jesus' divine sonship and messianic role.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' resurrection is the fulfillment of God's promises made to the forefathers, demonstrating God's faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sonship.htm">Divine Sonship</a></b><br>The declaration of Jesus as God's Son underscores His unique relationship with the Father and His authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/resurrection_as_validation.htm">Resurrection as Validation</a></b><br>The resurrection is a pivotal event that validates Jesus' identity and mission, offering hope and assurance to believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/scriptural_consistency.htm">Scriptural Consistency</a></b><br>The use of Old Testament scriptures in the New Testament highlights the consistency and unity of God's redemptive plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_response.htm">Personal Response</a></b><br>Believers are called to respond to the truth of Jesus' resurrection with faith and obedience, recognizing Him as Lord.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_13_33_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 13:33?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Acts_13_33_Jesus_as_God_s_Son_via_resurrection.htm">How does Acts 13:33 affirm Jesus as God's "Son" through resurrection?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Acts_13_33_fulfills_which_OT_prophecy.htm">What Old Testament prophecy is fulfilled in Acts 13:33?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Acts_13_33_Strengthen_faith_in_promises.htm">How can understanding Acts 13:33 strengthen our faith in God's promises?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Acts_13_33_Psalm_2_7_Jesus_identity_link.htm">How does Acts 13:33 connect to Psalm 2:7 in revealing Jesus' identity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Acts_13_33_in_daily_evangelism.htm">How can we apply the truth of Acts 13:33 in daily evangelism?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Acts_13_33_Proof_of_Jesus_as_God_s_Son.htm">How does Acts 13:33 confirm Jesus as the Son of God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_You_are_My_Son_in_Acts_13_33.htm">What is the significance of "You are My Son" in Acts 13:33?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Acts_13_33_and_Old_Testament_prophecy.htm">How does Acts 13:33 relate to Old Testament prophecy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_acts_13.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Acts 13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_is_faithfulness_important.htm">What is the significance of faithfulness as a Holy Spirit fruit?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_god_believed_to_have_a_son.htm">Is God believed to have a son?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_do_psalms_foreshadow_jesus.htm">How do Psalms foreshadow Jesus Christ's life and mission?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/is_psalm_2_2_literal_without_records.htm">How can Psalm 2:2 be taken literally when there is no historical record of all nations conspiring against Israel&#8217;s king?

By citing it here, Paul proclaims that Jesus is the true, eternal King for whom every prior king was a shadow (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-14</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You are My Son; today I have become Your Father.</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;You are My Son&#8221; affirms Jesus&#8217; unique, eternal relationship with the Father&#8212;He is of the same divine essence, not a created being (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14, 18</a>; 3:16).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Today I have become Your Father&#8221; points to a decisive historical moment when the Father publicly declares the Son&#8217;s royal status. The New Testament applies this line to the resurrection, when Jesus is &#8220;declared with power to be the Son of God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>; 5:5).<p>&#8226; The phrase does not suggest Jesus began to exist that day; rather, the Father officially installs the risen Christ as King, fulfilling the messianic hope Israel had long awaited (<a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, the verse means our acceptance is anchored in the Father-Son relationship. If the Son&#8217;s throne is secure, so is the salvation of everyone united to Him (<a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4-6</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/13-33.htm">Acts 13:33</a> announces that God has kept His ancient promises by raising Jesus from the dead. The resurrection is the Father&#8217;s public declaration that Jesus is His eternal Son and the rightful King foretold in <a href="/bsb/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a>. Because God has acted in history, every believer can rest assured that the covenant is fulfilled, salvation is certain, and the reigning Christ invites us into His victorious life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children.</span>--The better MSS. give, with hardly an exception, <span class= "ital">unto our children, </span>and the Received text must be regarded as having been made to obtain what seemed a more natural meaning. St. Paul's language, however, is but an echo of St. Peter's "to us and to our children," in <a href="/acts/2-39.htm" title="For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.">Acts 2:39</a>.<p><span class= "bld">As it is also written in the second psalm.</span>--The various-reading, "in the <span class= "ital">first</span> Psalm," given by some MSS. is interesting, as showing that in some copies of the Old Testament, what is now the first Psalm was treated as a kind of prelude to the whole book, the numeration beginning with what is now the second.<p><span class= "bld">Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</span>--Historically, Psalms 2 appears as a triumph-song, written to celebrate the victory of a king of Israel or Judah--David, or Solomon, or another--over his enemies. The king had been shown by that day of victory to have been the chosen son of God--the day itself was a new begetting, manifesting the sonship. So, in the higher fulfilment which St. Paul finds in Christ, he refers the words, not primarily to the Eternal Generation of the Son of God, "begotten before all worlds," nor to the Incarnation, but to the day of victory over rulers and priests, over principalities and powers, over death and Hades. The Resurrection manifested in the antitype, as the victory had done in the type, a pre-existing sonship; but it was to those who witnessed it, or heard of it, as the ground on which their faith in that sonship rested. Christ was to them the "firstborn of every creature," because He was also "the firstborn from the dead." (See Notes on <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - How <span class="accented">that God</span> for <span class="accented">God</span>, A.V.

Observe with what skill the apostle speaks of the resurrection of Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of God's promise to their fathers, which it was to be presumed they were anxiously expecting. The second psalm. Many manuscripts and editions have, "the first," because the first psalm was often reckoned not numerically but as an introduction to the whole book, so that the second psalm was numbered as the first. This is probably the reason why the eighteen psalms as reckoned by the Jews include <a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19</a>, though Joshua ben Levi explains it by the rejection of the second psalm, on account, no doubt, of its testimony to Messiah as God's begotten Son. But the rabbins generally acknowledge the application of this psalm to Messiah (Lightfoot, 'Exercit. on the Acts'). <span class="cmt_word">Thou art my Son</span>, etc. This application of the second psalm to the Resurrection is best explained by <a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>. The reference in both passages to David is remarkable (vers. 22, 23). Christ, who was begotten of the Father before all worlds, was declared before men and angels to be the Son of God, when he was raised from the dead in the power of an endless life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/13-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[He]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#920;&#949;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Theos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2316.htm">Strong's 2316: </a> </span><span class="str2">A deity, especially the supreme Divinity; figuratively, a magistrate; by Hebraism, very.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has fulfilled</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;&#960;&#949;&#960;&#955;&#942;&#961;&#969;&#954;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ekpepl&#275;r&#333;ken)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1603.htm">Strong's 1603: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fill completely, fulfill in every particular (to the utmost), make good.
