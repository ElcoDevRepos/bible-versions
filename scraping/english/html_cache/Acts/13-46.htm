Their boldness here reflects the empowerment of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>). Boldness was necessary in a context where proclaiming the gospel could lead to persecution. This moment occurs in Pisidian Antioch, a city in modern-day Turkey, where they were addressing a Jewish audience in the synagogue.<p><b>It was necessary to speak the word of God to you first:</b><br>This statement underscores the priority of the Jewish people in God's redemptive plan, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>. The Jews were the original recipients of God's promises (<a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4-5</a>), and Jesus Himself ministered primarily to them (<a href="/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>). The necessity reflects a fulfillment of prophecy and a respect for the covenantal relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>But since you reject it:</b><br>The rejection by the Jewish audience is a recurring theme in Acts (<a href="/acts/18-6.htm">Acts 18:6, 28</a>:25-28). This rejection was prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a> and is echoed in Jesus' ministry (<a href="/john/12-37.htm">John 12:37-41</a>). It highlights the hardness of heart that can occur despite clear evidence and fulfillment of prophecy.<p><b>and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life:</b><br>This phrase indicates a self-imposed exclusion from the blessings of the gospel. Eternal life, a central theme in the New Testament, is offered through faith in Christ (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). The Jewish audience's rejection is not due to a lack of opportunity but a refusal to accept the message of salvation.<p><b>we now turn to the Gentiles:</b><br>This turning point marks a significant shift in the early church's mission strategy, aligning with Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be witnesses "to the ends of the earth." It fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the inclusion of the Gentiles (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).

The verse reminds us that receiving the word determines one&#8217;s share in eternal life; rejecting it forfeits unimaginable blessing, while the open door of salvation continues for any who will listen.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(46) <span class= "bld">It</span> <span class= "bld">was necessary.</span>--The preachers recognised the necessity of following what they looked on as the divine plan in the education of mankind, and so they preached "to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile" (<a href="/context/romans/2-9.htm" title="Tribulation and anguish, on every soul of man that does evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;">Romans 2:9-10</a>). The former were offered, as the fulfilment of the promise made to Abraham, the high privilege of being the channel through which "all families of the earth should be blessed" by the knowledge of Christ (<a href="/genesis/22-18.htm" title="And in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because you have obeyed my voice.">Genesis 22:18</a>). When they rejected that offer, it was made, without their intervention, to the Gentiles.<p><span class= "bld">Judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life.</span>--There is a touch of righteous indignation, perhaps something like irony, in the words. The preacher had thought them "worthy" of the highest of all blessings, the life eternal which was in Christ Jesus, but they, in their boastful and envious pride, took what was really a lower estimate of themselves, and showed that they were "unworthy." They passed sentence, <span class= "ital">ipso facto, </span>on themselves.<p><span class= "bld">Lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</span>--We have to remember (1) that the words were as an echo of those which the Apostle had heard in his trance in the Temple at Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/22-21.htm" title="And he said to me, Depart: for I will send you far hence to the Gentiles.">Acts 22:21</a>); (2) that they would be heard, on the one hand, by the Gentiles with a joy hitherto unknown, and, on the other, by the Jews as a new cause of irritation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">spake out boldly</span> for <span class="accented">waxed bold</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">be</span> for <span class="accented">have been</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">seeing</span> for <span class="accented">but seeing</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">thrust</span> for <span class="accented">put</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">eternal</span> for <span class="accented">everlasting</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Spake out boldly</span>.

It is in accordance with this purpose of God that St. Paul says of the gospel that "it is the power of God unto salvation... to the Jew first, and also to the Greek" (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). Compare, too, our Lord's saying (<a href="/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>) and the woman's reply (ibid. 27). In point of fact, this had been the practice of Paul and Barnabas no less than of Peter, and was the very motive that had brought them to Antioch. <span class="cmt_word">Lo, we turn to the Gentiles</span>.
