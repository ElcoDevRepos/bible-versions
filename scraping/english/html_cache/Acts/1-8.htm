The power mentioned here is not political or military but spiritual, signifying divine enablement. This empowerment is essential for the mission that Jesus is about to outline. The Greek word for power, "dynamis," suggests miraculous ability and strength, which is consistent with the works of the apostles in the Book of Acts. This power is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, where God promises to pour out His Spirit on all people.<p><b>when the Holy Spirit comes upon you</b><br>The coming of the Holy Spirit marks a pivotal moment in the New Testament narrative, initiating the era of the Church. This event is fulfilled at Pentecost (Acts 2), where the apostles are filled with the Holy Spirit, enabling them to speak in various tongues and perform miracles. The Holy Spirit's arrival signifies God's presence and guidance, echoing the Spirit's role in the Old Testament, such as in the anointing of kings and prophets. The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is a distinctive feature of the New Covenant, as prophesied in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>.<p><b>and you will be My witnesses</b><br>The term "witnesses" implies both a legal and a testimonial role, where the apostles are called to testify to the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This witnessing is not merely verbal but involves living out the teachings of Jesus, demonstrating the transformative power of the Gospel. The apostles' role as witnesses fulfills Jesus' command in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and aligns with the prophetic tradition of bearing witness to God's truth.<p><b>in Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem is the starting point for the apostles' mission, significant as the city where Jesus was crucified and resurrected. It is also the center of Jewish religious life, housing the Temple. The choice of Jerusalem underscores the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel and the continuity of His redemptive plan. The early chapters of Acts detail the apostles' ministry in Jerusalem, highlighting the initial growth of the Church among the Jewish people.<p><b>and in all Judea and Samaria</b><br>Judea represents the broader region surrounding Jerusalem, while Samaria signifies a culturally and religiously distinct area. The inclusion of Samaria is significant, as it reflects the breaking down of historical enmities between Jews and Samaritans, as seen in Jesus' ministry (<a href="/john/4-4.htm">John 4:4-42</a>). This expansion of the mission field illustrates the inclusive nature of the Gospel, reaching beyond traditional boundaries and fulfilling the promise of salvation to all people.<p><b>and to the ends of the earth.</b><br>This phrase indicates the universal scope of the Gospel mission, extending beyond the confines of Israel to all nations. It reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). The Book of Acts chronicles the apostles' missionary journeys, culminating in Paul's ministry in Rome, symbolizing the Gospel's reach to the heart of the known world. This global mission continues to be a central tenet of Christian faith, emphasizing the call to evangelize and disciple all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The risen Lord who is speaking to His disciples, giving them final instructions before His ascension.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' command, tasked with spreading the Gospel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, promised to empower the disciples for their mission.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The starting point of the disciples' mission, significant as the city where Jesus was crucified and resurrected.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judea_and_samaria.htm">Judea and Samaria</a></b><br>Regions surrounding Jerusalem, representing the expansion of the Gospel beyond the immediate Jewish context.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ends_of_the_earth.htm">The Ends of the Earth</a></b><br>Symbolizing the universal scope of the Gospel mission, reaching all nations and peoples.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/empowerment_by_the_holy_spirit.htm">Empowerment by the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Greek word for "power" (dynamis) indicates miraculous strength and ability.

Those which follow correspond to the great divisions of the Acts--Jerusalem, Acts 1, 7; Judaea, 9:32, 12:19; Samaria, 8; and the rest of the book as opening the wider record of the witness borne "to the uttermost parts of the earth." And this witness was two-fold: (1) of the works, the teachings, and, above all, of the Resurrection of Jesus; (2) of the purpose of the Father as revealed in the Son. The witness was to be, in language which, though technical, is yet the truest expression of the fact, at once historical and dogmatic.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> <span class="accented">- When</span> for <span class="accented">after that</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">my witnesses</span> for <span class="accented">witnesses unto me</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">Samaria</span> for in <span class="accented">Samaria</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall receive power</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); a word sped-ally used of the power of the Holy Spirit <span class="cmt_word">(see Acts</span> 6:8). "Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit" (<a href="/luke/4-14.htm">Luke 4:14</a>; see too Luke 24:49); "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power" (<a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>); "Through the power of the Holy Ghost" (<a href="/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>); "The demonstration of the Spirit and of power" (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>); "<span class="accented">Strengthened</span> with might (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) by his Spirit" (<a href="/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>); "The powers of the world to come" (<a href="/hebrews/6-6.htm">Hebrews 6:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My witnesses</span>. This function of the apostles, to be witnesses of Christ, is one much insisted upon in Scripture. So we read in ver. 22, "Of these must one become ['be ordained,' A.V.] a witness with us of his resurrection." So again in <a href="/acts/10-40.htm">Acts 10:40-42</a>, "God... showed him openly; not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us....
