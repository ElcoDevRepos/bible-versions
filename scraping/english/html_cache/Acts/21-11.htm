This highlights the communal nature of early Christian ministry and the importance of fellowship and shared experiences in the spread of the Gospel.<p><b>he took Paul&#8217;s belt</b><br>The act of taking Paul's belt is symbolic and prophetic, reminiscent of Old Testament prophets who used physical actions to convey God's messages (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2-4</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/13.htm">Jeremiah 13:1-11</a>). The belt, a personal item, signifies the intimate and personal nature of the prophecy concerning Paul.<p><b>bound his own feet and hands</b><br>This dramatic action serves as a visual prophecy, illustrating the message that follows. It reflects the prophetic tradition of using symbolic acts to convey divine messages, as seen in the actions of prophets like Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/4.htm">Ezekiel 4:1-3</a>). The binding signifies impending captivity and restriction.<p><b>and said, &#8220;The Holy Spirit says:</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine origin of the message.

It emphasizes the authority and reliability of the prophecy.<p><b>&#8216;In this way the Jews of Jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt</b><br>The prophecy specifically mentions the Jews of Jerusalem, indicating the source of opposition Paul will face. This reflects the tension between Paul and certain Jewish groups who opposed his mission to the Gentiles.

It mirrors the experiences of Jesus, who was also handed over to Gentiles (Romans) by Jewish leaders (<a href="/matthew/27.htm">Matthew 27:1-2</a>).

His movement is intentional, mirroring Old-Testament prophets who sought out God&#8217;s servants with urgent messages (<a href="/2_kings/2-2.htm">2 Kings 2:2</a>; <a href="/amos/7-14.htm">Amos 7:14-15</a>). By stepping into their circle he signals that what follows is personal and unavoidable, just as earlier the Spirit had repeatedly warned Paul on his travels (<a href="/acts/20-23.htm">Acts 20:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he took Paul&#8217;s belt</b><p>Using another person&#8217;s garment was startling. The belt&#8212;or sash&#8212;kept a traveler&#8217;s robe secure; seizing it symbolized control over the whole person. Prophets often employed vivid object lessons: Jeremiah buried and then retrieved a linen waistband to picture Judah&#8217;s ruin (<a href="/jeremiah/13-1.htm">Jeremiah 13:1-11</a>); Ezekiel built a clay model of Jerusalem (<a href="/ezekiel/4-1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1-3</a>). Agabus likewise turns Paul&#8217;s own belt into a living parable, underlining that what is about to happen concerns Paul alone, not just the church in general.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>bound his own feet and hands</b><p>Agabus ties himself up, dramatizing captivity. Such visual prophecy imprints the message on the listeners&#8217; memories (<a href="/1_kings/22-11.htm">1 Kings 22:11</a>). Binding both feet and hands depicts total restraint, matching earlier Spirit-given warnings of &#8220;chains and afflictions&#8221; (<a href="/acts/20-23.htm">Acts 20:23</a>). The gesture also foreshadows the precise moment Roman soldiers will chain Paul (<a href="/acts/21-33.htm">Acts 21:33</a>), proving the literal reliability of the prophecy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said</b><p>Speech follows symbol. By prefacing with &#8220;The Holy Spirit says,&#8221; Agabus attributes the message directly to God, the same Spirit who spoke to the Antioch church (<a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>) and guided Philip earlier in this very city (<a href="/acts/8-29.htm">Acts 8:29</a>). The authority is divine, not merely human insight. This reinforces that prophetic revelation in Scripture is certain and without error (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;The Holy Spirit says: &#8216;In this way the Jews of Jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt and hand him over to the Gentiles.&#8217;&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The Jews of Jerusalem&#8221; points to the unbelieving leaders who soon incite the crowd against Paul (<a href="/acts/21-27.htm">Acts 21:27-30</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Will bind&#8221; is fulfilled when the Roman commander orders Paul shackled with two chains (<a href="/acts/21-33.htm">Acts 21:33</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Hand him over to the Gentiles&#8221; echoes Jesus&#8217; own prediction of His sufferings (<a href="/luke/18-32.htm">Luke 18:32</a>) and God&#8217;s earlier word that Paul is chosen to bear Christ&#8217;s name &#8220;before Gentiles and kings&#8221; (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The prophecy is precise: Jews spark the arrest; Romans carry it out, thereby propelling Paul toward Rome (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>). Far from derailing God&#8217;s plan, the chains become the very vehicle for wider gospel proclamation (<a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Agabus approaches, seizes Paul&#8217;s belt, binds himself, and speaks, weaving action and word into one clear revelation: Paul will be literally arrested by Jewish opposition in Jerusalem and delivered to Roman custody. The Spirit&#8217;s warning is neither a deterrent nor a contradiction of Paul&#8217;s mission; it is confirmation that suffering is the ordained path for the gospel&#8217;s advance. God&#8217;s sovereignty turns impending chains into an open door for witness all the way to Caesar&#8217;s household, assuring believers that obedience, even when costly, never thwarts divine purpose.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">He took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet.</span>--The MSS. vary between "his hands" (St. Paul's) and "his own;" but the latter is by far the best-supported reading. It is interesting to note the revival of the old prophetic manner of predicting by symbolic acts. So Isaiah had walked "naked and barefoot" (<a href="/context/isaiah/20-3.htm" title="And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder on Egypt and on Ethiopia;">Isaiah 20:3-4</a>); and Jeremiah had gone and left his girdle in a cave on the banks of the Euphrates, and had made bonds and yokes, and had put them on his neck (<a href="/context/jeremiah/13-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to me, Go and get you a linen girdle, and put it on your loins, and put it not in water.">Jeremiah 13:1-11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/27-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to me; Make you bonds and yokes, and put them on your neck,">Jeremiah 27:2</a>); and Ezekiel had portrayed the siege of Jerusalem on a tile, and had cut the hair from his head and beard (<a href="/context/ezekiel/4-1.htm" title="You also, son of man, take you a tile, and lay it before you, and portray on it the city, even Jerusalem:">Ezekiel 4:1-3</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/5-1.htm" title="And you, son of man, take you a sharp knife, take you a barber's razor, and cause it to pass on your head and on your beard: then take you balances to weigh, and divide the hair.">Ezekiel 5:1-4</a>). Looking to the previous relations between St. Paul and Agabus at Antioch (<a href="/acts/11-27.htm" title="And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.">Acts 11:27</a>), we may well believe that the latter, foreseeing the danger to which the Apostle would be exposed, came down to Caesarea, in a spirit of friendly anxiety, to warn him not to come. The feeling which led to the murderous plot of <a href="/acts/23-12.htm" title="And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.">Acts 23:12</a> could be no secret to a prophet living at Jerusalem. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="accented">- Coming to</span> for <span class="accented">when he was come unto</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and taking</span> for <span class="accented">he took</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">he bound</span> for <span class="accented">and bound</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">feet and hands</span> for <span class="accented">hands and feet</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Bound his own feet</span>, etc. The R.T. has <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> which leaves no doubt that Agabus bound his own hands and feet. The reading of the T.R., <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, would rather indicate Paul's hands and feet, as Grotius, Hammond, and others take it, though less conformably to the context.
