This city was a significant Roman administrative center in Judea, highlighting the Roman influence in the region. Centurions are often depicted positively in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5-13</a> and <a href="/luke/7.htm">Luke 7:1-10</a>, where another centurion demonstrates great faith. Cornelius's role as a centurion underscores the reach of the Gospel beyond Jewish boundaries, fulfilling the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>He is a righteous and God-fearing man</b><br>Cornelius is described as "righteous" and "God-fearing," terms indicating his devoutness and respect for the God of Israel, despite being a Gentile. "God-fearers" were Gentiles who adhered to Jewish religious practices and ethics without fully converting to Judaism. This description aligns with the broader biblical narrative of God's concern for all nations, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/56-6.htm">Isaiah 56:6-7</a>, which speaks of foreigners joining themselves to the Lord.<p><b>with a good reputation among the whole Jewish nation.</b><br>Cornelius's good reputation among the Jews suggests his consistent and visible acts of piety and charity, which were highly regarded in Jewish culture. This reputation is significant, as it demonstrates the breaking down of barriers between Jews and Gentiles, a theme central to the Book of Acts. His standing among the Jews also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>A holy angel instructed him to request your presence in his home</b><br>The appearance of a holy angel to Cornelius signifies divine intervention and guidance, a common motif in Scripture when God is orchestrating significant events (e.g., the angelic announcements in <a href="/luke/1.htm">Luke 1-2</a>). This divine encounter emphasizes the importance of Peter's forthcoming message and the inclusion of Gentiles in God's redemptive plan, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>.<p><b>so he could hear a message from you.</b><br>The message Peter is to deliver is the Gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection, which is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). This moment marks a pivotal shift in the early church, as the Gospel begins to spread beyond Jewish communities, fulfilling Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be witnesses "to the ends of the earth." Cornelius's eagerness to hear this message reflects the hunger for truth and salvation among the Gentiles, prefiguring the widespread acceptance of the Gospel among non-Jewish peoples.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cornelius.htm">Cornelius</a></b><br>A Roman centurion stationed in Caesarea, described as righteous and God-fearing.
