The act of taking her by the hand is reminiscent of Jesus' own miracles, such as when He raised Jairus' daughter (<a href="/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41</a>). This gesture signifies compassion and personal involvement, reflecting the ministry of Jesus. The physical touch underscores the reality of the miracle, emphasizing that it was not merely spiritual but also physical. The act of helping her up symbolizes restoration and new life, a theme prevalent in the New Testament.<p><b>Then he called the saints and widows and presented her to them alive.</b><br>The term "saints" refers to the believers in Joppa, indicating a community of faith that was already established. The inclusion of "widows" is significant, as they were often marginalized in society, yet they held a special place in the early church (<a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1</a>). This reflects the church's commitment to caring for the vulnerable, a principle rooted in Old Testament law (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>). Presenting her alive serves as a powerful testimony to the resurrection power of Christ working through His apostles. It also prefigures the ultimate resurrection of all believers, as promised in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>.
