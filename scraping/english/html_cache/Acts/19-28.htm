The context is the economic threat posed by Paul's preaching against idolatry, which endangered their trade of making silver shrines of Artemis. The hearing here is not just auditory but involves understanding the implications of the message against their livelihood and religious practices.<p><b>they were enraged</b><br>The anger of the men is a response to the perceived attack on their goddess and their economic interests. This reflects the deep-seated devotion to Artemis, a central figure in Ephesian culture and religion. The rage can be seen as a defense of their identity and way of life, which was intertwined with the worship of Artemis. This mirrors other instances in scripture where economic interests clash with the spread of the Gospel, such as the opposition Paul faced in Philippi (<a href="/acts/16-19.htm">Acts 16:19-24</a>).<p><b>and began shouting</b><br>The shouting indicates a public and collective outcry, a common form of protest in ancient times. This public demonstration shows the intensity of their emotions and the communal nature of their worship. It also serves to rally others to their cause, creating a mob mentality that can quickly escalate into violence, as seen in other biblical accounts of public unrest (e.g., <a href="/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!&#8221;</b><br>Artemis was a major deity in Ephesus, and her temple was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The phrase underscores the civic pride and religious fervor of the Ephesians. Artemis was not only a religious figure but also a symbol of the city's prosperity and cultural identity. This chant is both a declaration of faith and a defense against the perceived threat of Paul's teachings. Theologically, this highlights the conflict between the worship of created things and the worship of the Creator, a theme echoed in <a href="/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>. The phrase also contrasts with the Christian proclamation of the greatness of Jesus Christ, who is the true and living God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesians.htm">Ephesians</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Ephesus, a major city in Asia Minor, known for its temple dedicated to the goddess Artemis.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/artemis.htm">Artemis</a></b><br>A Greek goddess worshiped in Ephesus, associated with fertility and the hunt.
