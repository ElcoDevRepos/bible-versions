Gathering the church highlights the importance of communal worship and shared experiences. This practice of reporting back to the church underscores accountability and the collective nature of mission work.<p><b>and reported all that God had done through them</b><br>Paul and Barnabas emphasized that their successes were due to God's power, not their own abilities. This reflects a biblical theme where God works through His people to accomplish His purposes, as seen in the stories of Moses, David, and the apostles.<p><b>and how He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles</b><br>This marks a pivotal moment in the early church, as the gospel was spreading beyond Jewish communities to Gentiles. The "door of faith" symbolizes God's initiative in salvation, aligning with prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of being a light to the nations.

From this point of view it is interesting to note the recurrence of the phrase in <a href="/revelation/3-8.htm" title="I know your works: behold, I have set before you an open door, and no man can shut it: for you have a little strength, and have kept my word, and have not denied my name.">Revelation 3:8</a>, both St. Paul and St. John, representing as they did different sections of the Church (<a href="/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>), agreeing in the thought that the door of the Father's house was now opened wider than it had ever been before, and that no man might shut it. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> <span class="accented">- All things</span> for <span class="accented">all</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">how that</span> for <span class="accented">how</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a door</span> for <span class="accented">the door</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">A door</span>. <span class="accented">The door</span> is preferable, because "the faith" limits the door to one kind of opening.
