Its mention here highlights the spread of the gospel beyond Jewish territories, fulfilling the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).

This city represents the intersection of Jewish and Gentile worlds, symbolizing the gospel's penetration into the heart of Roman influence.

Like Gaza its history was chiefly marked by successive sieges: by Tartan, the Assyrian General B.C. 716 (<a href="/isaiah/20-1.htm" title="In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;">Isaiah 20:1</a>); by Psammetichus, B.C. 630, (Herod. ii. 157); the Maccabees (<a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/5-68.htm" title="So Judas turned to Azotus in the land of the Philistines, and when he had pulled down their altars, and burned their carved images with fire, and spoiled their cities, he returned into the land of Judea.">1 Maccabees 5:68</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/10-34.htm" title="Furthermore I will that all the feasts, and sabbaths, and new moons, and solemn days, and the three days before the feast, and the three days after the feast shall be all of immunity and freedom for all the Jews in my realm.">1 Maccabees 10:34</a>).

The narrative suggests the thought that here also Philip continued his work as an evangelist. Philistia was, as of old, to be joined with Ethiopia in furnishing the city of God with converts who should be written among the people (<a href="/psalms/87-4.htm" title="I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.">Psalm 87:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">He preached in all the cities.</span>--The route which Philip would naturally take on this journey led through Lydda and Joppa, and we may probably trace the effect of his labours in the appearance in <a href="/acts/9-32.htm" title="And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelled at Lydda.">Acts 9:32</a>; <a href="/acts/9-36.htm" title="Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and giving of alms which she did.">Acts 9:36</a>, of organised and apparently flourishing Christian societies in both these towns. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - He <span class="accented">preached the gospel to all the cities</span> for <span class="accented">he preached in all the cities</span>, A.V.
