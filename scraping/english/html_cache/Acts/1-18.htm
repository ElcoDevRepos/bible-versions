This phrase highlights the consequences of Judas's actions, emphasizing the moral and spiritual implications of his betrayal. The "reward" refers to the payment he received for betraying Jesus, which is seen as tainted by his wickedness. This connects to <a href="/matthew/27-3.htm">Matthew 27:3-5</a>, where Judas, filled with remorse, returns the silver to the chief priests and elders, acknowledging his sin.<p><b>Judas bought a field</b><br>The field, known as the "Field of Blood" or Akeldama, is traditionally located in the Hinnom Valley near Jerusalem. This purchase is indirectly attributed to Judas, as the chief priests used the returned silver to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners (<a href="/matthew/27-6.htm">Matthew 27:6-8</a>). This act fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a>, which speaks of the thirty pieces of silver and the potter's field.<p><b>there he fell headlong</b><br>This phrase describes the manner of Judas's death, which has been a subject of much discussion. While <a href="/matthew/27-5.htm">Matthew 27:5</a> states that Judas hanged himself, this account suggests a different or subsequent event. Some scholars propose that the rope or branch may have broken, causing his body to fall. This detail underscores the tragic and violent end of Judas's life, serving as a stark warning about the consequences of sin and betrayal.<p><b>and burst open in the middle</b><br>The graphic description of Judas's body bursting open is unique to this account. It emphasizes the physical and gruesome nature of his death, which can be seen as a reflection of the spiritual corruption and internal turmoil that led to his betrayal. This imagery serves as a powerful reminder of the destructive power of sin.<p><b>and all his intestines spilled out</b><br>This vivid detail further illustrates the severity of Judas's demise. In the cultural context of the time, such a death would be considered shameful and dishonorable. The spilling of intestines can symbolize the complete exposure and judgment of Judas's inner corruption. This account, combined with the purchase of the field, fulfills the prophecy and serves as a somber conclusion to Judas's story, contrasting with the hope and redemption offered through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of the twelve apostles of Jesus, known for betraying Jesus to the religious authorities for thirty pieces of silver.

On the difficulties presented by a comparison of this account with that in <a href="/context/matthew/27-5.htm" title="And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.">Matthew 27:5-8</a>, see Note on that passage. Here the field bought with Judas's money is spoken of as that which he gained as the reward of his treachery. The details that follow are additions to the briefer statement of St. Matthew, but are obviously not incompatible with it. Nor is there any necessity for assuming, as some have done, that there were two fields known as Aceldama, one that which the priests had bought, and the other that which was the scene of Judas's death. The whole passage must be regarded as a note of the historian, not as part of the speech of St. Peter. It was not likely that he, speaking to disciples, all of whom knew the Aramaic, or popular Hebrew of Palestine, should stop to explain that Aceldama meant "in their proper tongue, The field of blood."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> <span class="accented">- Obtained for purchased</span>, A.V., an unnecessary change; <span class="accented">his iniquity</span> for <span class="accented">iniquity</span>, A.V.

The only apparent discrepancies in the accounts of St. Matthew and St. Luke in regard to the purchase of the field, and the name given to it, are that, according to St. Matthew's more detailed account, it was the chief priests who actually purchased the field with Judas's money, whereas St. Luke says, less accurately, that Judas purchased it. Again, St. Matthew explains the name <span class="accented">Akel-dama as</span> being given to the field because it was the price of the "innocent blood" of Jesus betrayed by Judas, whereas St. Luke's account rather suggests that it was Judas's own blood shed in his fall which gave the name. But both accounts of the name might be true, some understanding the name in one sense and some in the other. (Compare the different accounts of the name of Beer-sheba in <a href="/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a> and Genesis 26:32, 33; of the origin of the proverb, "Is Saul among the prophets?" <a href="/1_samuel/10-11.htm">1 Samuel 10:11, 12</a> and 1 Sam 20:24; and other similar cases.) Though, however, there is no serious discrepancy between St. Luke and St. Matthew, it is probable, from the variations above named, that St. Luke had not seen St. Matthew's account. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/1-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">(</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
