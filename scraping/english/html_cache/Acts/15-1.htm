The phrase "came down" reflects the geographical descent from the higher elevation of Judea to other regions. This indicates the men were likely Jewish Christians, possibly Pharisees, who were zealous for the Mosaic Law. Their journey signifies the spread of early Christian teachings and the challenges of integrating Gentile believers into what was initially a Jewish sect.<p><b>and were teaching the brothers</b><br>The "brothers" refers to fellow believers, indicating that the early Christian community was already established in the area they visited. This teaching was not merely a casual conversation but an authoritative instruction, suggesting these men held some influence or authority. The early church faced significant challenges in defining doctrine and practice, especially concerning the inclusion of Gentiles.<p><b>&#8220;Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses</b><br>Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>) and was later incorporated into the Mosaic Law. It was a physical mark of Jewish identity and religious commitment. The insistence on circumcision highlights the tension between Jewish traditions and the new covenant in Christ, which emphasized faith over law (<a href="/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>). This issue was central to the early church's struggle to define the role of the Law in salvation.<p><b>you cannot be saved.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reflects a belief that adherence to the Mosaic Law was necessary for salvation, a view that was challenged by the apostles, particularly Paul, who argued that salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ alone (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). This controversy led to the Jerusalem Council (<a href="/acts/15-6.htm">Acts 15:6-29</a>), where it was decided that Gentile believers were not required to follow the entirety of the Jewish Law.

It might have seemed as if the conversion of Cornelius had been accepted as deciding the question which we now find raised again (<a href="/acts/11-18.htm" title="When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then has God also to the Gentiles granted repentance to life.">Acts 11:18</a>). It would seem, however, that those who had raised objections to Peter's conduct in that case were not content to accept the conclusion which he drew from it, and it is not difficult to represent to ourselves the train of thought which led them to take a different view. To them it may have seemed the exception that proved the rule. Where signs and wonders came in, they may have been content to accept an uncircumcised convert as a member of the Church, simply on the ground that God had dispensed in such cases with His own law; or they may have urged that though, in such cases, they did not require circumcision as a condition of admission, the continuance in the uncircumcised state after baptism was a wilful transgression, which shut men out from the "salvation" which they were seeking. Circumcision, they may have said, had been given as an "everlasting covenant" (<a href="/genesis/17-13.htm" title="He that is born in your house, and he that is bought with your money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.">Genesis 17:13</a>), and had never been formally abrogated. Who were the new teachers, that they should change what God had thus established? It is clear that they came, claiming to speak in the name of James, the Bishop of Jerusalem, and though he distinctly repudiates having authorised them (<a href="/acts/15-24.htm" title="For as much as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, You must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:">Acts 15:24</a>), yet if we suppose, as is probable, that his Epistle was written shortly before the Council, we can easily understand that they might rest their case on the words which he had used in it, that "whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all" (<a href="/james/2-10.htm" title="For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.">James 2:10</a>). Here, they might say, is a point confessedly in the Law, and even prior to it; and they were not prepared to draw the distinctions which we have learned to draw between the positive and the moral, the transient and the permanent, obligations of that Law. And it is to be noted that they did not merely make circumcision a condition of church communion; they carried their principles to their logical conclusion--as mediaeval dogmatism did in the case of baptism--and excluded the uncircumcised from all hope of salvation.

And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.">Acts 9:10</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="accented">- Came down... and taught</span> for <span class="accented">which came down</span>... <span class="accented">taught</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">saying</span> for <span class="accented">and said</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">custom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) for <span class="accented">manner</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Except ye be circumcised</span>, etc. The question thus raised nearly effected the disruption of the Church, and was the most serious controversy that had yet arisen. If the views broached by these Judaean Christians had prevailed, the whole character of Christianity would have been changed, and its existence probably cut short. How great the danger was appears from even Peter and Barnabas having wavered in their opinion. (For St. Paul's treatment of the subject, see <a href="/romans/2-25.htm">Romans 2:25</a>, etc.; 4; <a href="/galatians/5-2.htm">Galatians 5:2-6</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-12.htm">Galatians 6:12-15</a>, etc.) The expression, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, is so like that in <a href="/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> as to suggest very strongly the consideration whether Peter was not at Antioch at this time, and whether the scene related in <a href="/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>, etc., did not precede, and in fact cause, the Council of Jerusalem. In this case the "dissension and disputation" spoken of in ver. 2 would include and directly point to the memorable rebuke given by Paul to Peter; and we should understand that Peter, accepting Paul's rebuke, preceded him and Barnabas, and prepared the way at Jerusalem for the solution arrived at. And, indeed, Peter's words at Jerusalem are almost an echo of Paul's words addressed to him at Antioch. If Barnabas had shown a leaning towards the Judaizing party, he would the more readily have been accepted by them as one of the embassy. The chief objection to this hypothesis is that in <a href="/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a> Peter's visit to Antioch seems to be spoken of as something subsequent to the journey of St. Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem. But it is not in the least necessary so to understand it. St, Paul's mention of his visit to Jerusalem might naturally recall the incident which had led to it, and which was another example of his own independence. Farrar places Peter's visit to Antioch between the Council of Jerusalem and the quarrel with Barnabas, in the time indicated in ver. 35 of this chapter (vol. 1. <a href="/acts/23.htm">Acts 23</a>.), and so do Conybeare and Howson (vol. 1. p. 238), Meyer, and Alford ('Proleg.,' p. 24; note on Acts 15:36, and <a href="/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>). Renan ('St. Paul,' p. 290, etc.) and Lewin (vol. 1. <a href="/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a>.) place it after St. Paul's return to Antioch, at the conclusion of his second missionary journey (<a href="/acts/18-22.htm">Acts 18:22, 23</a>). No absolute certainty can be arrived at, but see note to ver. 35. <span class="cmt_word">Custom</span> (see <a href="/acts/16-21.htm">Acts 16:21</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> is the technical term for the Mosaic institutions, used by Josephus and Philo (see too <a href="/acts/6-14.htm">Acts 6:14</a>; <a href="/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21</a>, note). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/15-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">some men</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tines)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
