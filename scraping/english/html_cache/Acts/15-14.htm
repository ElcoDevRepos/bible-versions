Peter's role in the early church is significant, as he was instrumental in spreading the Gospel beyond Jewish communities. His testimony carries weight due to his direct experiences with Jesus and his leadership among the apostles. This phrase highlights the importance of eyewitness accounts in the early church's decision-making processes.<p><b>how God first visited the Gentiles</b><br>This phrase refers to the pivotal moment when God extended His covenant to the Gentiles, marking a significant shift in the early Christian mission. The "visitation" of God to the Gentiles is exemplified in Peter's encounter with Cornelius, a Roman centurion, as recorded in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>. This event is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of salvation reaching the ends of the earth. It underscores the inclusivity of the Gospel and God's plan for all nations.<p><b>to take from them a people</b><br>This indicates God's sovereign choice in selecting individuals from among the Gentiles to be part of His covenant community. The language echoes Old Testament themes where God chose Israel as His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). The concept of God "taking" a people suggests divine initiative and grace, emphasizing that salvation is not based on human merit but on God's purpose and calling.<p><b>to be His own</b><br>This phrase signifies the establishment of a new identity and relationship with God. Being "His own" implies belonging, protection, and a special status as God's people. This mirrors the covenant relationship God had with Israel, now extended to include Gentiles. It reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>), ultimately realized in Jesus Christ, who unites Jews and Gentiles into one body (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon.htm">Simon (Peter)</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles, who played a crucial role in the early church.

This visitation is a pivotal moment in the history of the early church, marking the expansion of the Gospel beyond Jewish boundaries.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who were traditionally seen as outside the covenant community of Israel. The inclusion of the Gentiles signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to bless all nations through Abraham.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem_council.htm">Jerusalem Council</a></b><br>The meeting of early church leaders in Jerusalem to discuss and resolve the issue of whether Gentile converts needed to follow Jewish law. <a href="/acts/15-14.htm">Acts 15:14</a> is part of the discussion led by James, affirming Peter's testimony.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The leader of the Jerusalem church, who supports Peter's account by referencing the prophets, showing that the inclusion of the Gentiles was in line with God's plan as revealed in Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_plan.htm">God's Sovereign Plan</a></b><br>God's plan for salvation is inclusive and sovereign, extending beyond ethnic and cultural boundaries.

The use of the old Hebrew form of the Apostle's name, instead of the more familiar Simon, was natural in the Galilean speaker, and is presumptive evidence in favour of our having a report from notes made at the time.<p><span class= "bld">Did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people.</span>--The two words present an emphatic contrast. The Jews claimed for themselves the exclusive right to the latter term. They alone were the "people," the rest of mankind were the "nations"--the "heathen." St. James proclaims that out of those heathen nations a people had been taken who were as truly God's people as Israel had ever been. He, too, recognises the change as fully as St. Paul does, when in <a href="/romans/9-26.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.">Romans 9:26</a> he quotes the memorable prophecy of <a href="/hosea/1-10.htm" title="Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people, there it shall be said to them, You are the sons of the living God.">Hosea 1:10</a>. St. James as well as St. Peter had, it is clear, profited by the private teaching referred to in <a href="/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> <span class="accented">- Symeon</span> for <span class="accented">Simeon</span>, A.V.; re<span class="accented">hearsed</span> for <span class="accented">declared</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">first God</span> for <span class="accented">God at the first</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Symeon</span>. This is the only place (unless <span class="accented">Symeon</span> is the right reading in <a href="/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>) in which Simon Peter's name is given in this Hebrew form, which is most proper in the month of James speaking to Palestine Jews. Singularly enough, Chrysostom was misled by it, and thought the prophecy of Simeon in <a href="/luke/1-31.htm">Luke 1:31</a> was meant, <span class="cmt_word">How first</span>; corresponding to the" good while ago" of ver. 7. <span class="cmt_word">Did visit</span>, etc. The construction <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is very unusual, and indeed stands alone. The verb always has an accusative case after it (<a href="/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3</a>; <a href="/acts/7-23.htm">Acts 7:23</a>; <a href="/acts/15-36.htm">Acts 15:36</a>), unless <a href="/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68</a> is an exception, which, however, it hardly is. There are two ways of construing the phrase. One is to consider it as elliptical, and to supply, as the A.V. and R.V. do, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>. So Alford, who compares the construction in <a href="/luke/1-25.htm">Luke 1:25</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;</span> must be supplied. But this is a harsh construction. The other and better way is to take <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, not in the sense of" visiting," but of" looking out," or "endeavoring to find something." The sense of the infinitive after the verb is nearly equivalent to" look out for and took," literally, <span class="accented">looked out how he might take.</span> With a slight modification of meaning, Irenaeus (in 'Speaker's Commentary') renders it" Excogitavit accipere," "planned" or "contrived to take." <span class="cmt_word">A people for his Name</span>; 1.<span class="accented">e.</span> to be called by his Name. <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> was the peculiar designation of "the people" of God, answering to the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> (comp. <a href="/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/15-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Simon</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#965;&#956;&#949;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Syme&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4826.htm">Strong's 4826: </a> </span><span class="str2">Simeon or Simon.
