It suggests a transition from a state of confusion or disbelief to clarity and understanding. This mirrors similar moments in Scripture where individuals come to a realization of divine intervention, such as the prodigal son in <a href="/luke/15-17.htm">Luke 15:17</a>. It highlights the human tendency to initially doubt or misunderstand God's work until it becomes undeniably clear.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Now I know for sure</b><br>Peter's declaration of certainty reflects a deep conviction and assurance in God's actions. This certainty is a common theme in the Bible, where faith is often strengthened through personal experiences of God's power and deliverance. It echoes the confidence expressed by other biblical figures, such as Job's declaration of faith in <a href="/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25</a>.<p><b>that the Lord has sent His angel</b><br>The mention of an angel underscores the belief in divine messengers who execute God's will. Angels frequently appear in Scripture as agents of deliverance and protection, as seen in the stories of Daniel in the lions' den (<a href="/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22</a>) and the deliverance of Lot from Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-15.htm">Genesis 19:15-16</a>). This highlights the ongoing spiritual battle and God's provision for His people.<p><b>and rescued me from Herod&#8217;s grasp</b><br>Herod Agrippa I, the ruler mentioned here, was known for his persecution of the early church, as seen earlier in <a href="/acts/12.htm">Acts 12</a> with the execution of James. Peter's escape from Herod's grasp signifies God's sovereignty over earthly powers and His ability to protect His servants from human authorities, reminiscent of the deliverance of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego from the fiery furnace (Daniel 3).<p><b>and from everything the Jewish people were anticipating.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase reflects the tension between the early Christian community and the Jewish authorities who opposed them. The Jewish leaders anticipated Peter's execution, similar to their earlier actions against Jesus. This deliverance serves as a testament to God's faithfulness to His promises and His protection of the nascent church, fulfilling Jesus' promise that the gates of hell would not prevail against it (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples and a leading figure in the early Christian church.

underscoring a sudden spiritual clarity after divine intervention.<p>&#8226; This reminds us that God&#8217;s direct actions often awaken believers to deeper awareness&#8212;just as Elijah recognized the gentle whisper in <a href="/1_kings/19-12.htm">1 Kings 19:12</a>.<p>&#8226;
