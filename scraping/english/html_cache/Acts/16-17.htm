In the Greco-Roman world, such individuals were often exploited for financial gain. Her following Paul and his companions indicates the spiritual conflict present as the Gospel was being spread. The "rest of us" suggests the presence of Luke, the author of Acts, as part of the missionary team, highlighting the firsthand account of these events.<p><b>shouting, &#8220;These men are servants of the Most High God</b><br>The term "Most High God" is significant as it was used by both Jews and Gentiles to refer to the supreme deity. In a polytheistic society, this acknowledgment by the spirit through the girl could be seen as an attempt to associate the apostles with the divine, yet it also reflects the spiritual recognition of God's authority. This phrase echoes the recognition of God's supremacy seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a> and <a href="/daniel/3-26.htm">Daniel 3:26</a>.<p><b>who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation!&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "the way of salvation" is central to the Christian message.

This proclamation aligns with Jesus' own words in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where He declares Himself as "the way, the truth, and the life." The spirit's declaration, though true, was likely intended to disrupt and distract, as seen in the subsequent actions of Paul in <a href="/acts/16-18.htm">Acts 16:18</a>.

Instead of violent persecution, the spirit uses a subtle form of disturbance that could confuse listeners about who is speaking truth.<p>&#8226; Noise alone never equals proclamation; <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a> reminds us faith comes from hearing the word of Christ clearly, not from chaotic clamor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>These men are servants of the Most High God</b><p>&#8226; The statement is accurate (cf. <a href="/acts/14-14.htm">Acts 14:14&#8211;15</a>), yet it comes from a spirit of divination (<a href="/acts/16-16.htm">Acts 16:16</a>). Truth on the lips of darkness can still mislead, much like the serpent&#8217;s partial truths in <a href="/genesis/3-4.htm">Genesis 3:4&#8211;5</a>.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Most High God&#8221; was a common pagan title (<a href="/daniel/3-26.htm">Daniel 3:26</a>), possibly tempting the crowd to mix the true God with local deities. Paul refuses syncretism, just as Elijah did on Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Servanthood is central to Christian identity (<a href="/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>). The spirit&#8217;s words unwittingly highlight what believers should gladly own: we belong to God, not to ourselves.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation!</b><p>&#8226; The gospel is a definite way, not one option among many (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).

Similar counterfeit promotion appears in <a href="/acts/19-13.htm">Acts 19:13&#8211;16</a> with the sons of Sceva.<p>&#8226; God turns even demonic testimony into an opening for truth, echoing Joseph&#8217;s words in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>: &#8220;You intended evil... but God intended it for good.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The slave girl&#8217;s relentless shouting shows that spiritual warfare often masquerades as helpful affirmation. While the spirit&#8217;s words were technically correct, the source and the setting threatened to dilute the gospel&#8217;s clarity. Paul&#8217;s eventual rebuke (<a href="/acts/16-18.htm">Acts 16:18</a>) protects the message, guarding listeners from confusion and maintaining the distinctiveness of &#8220;the way of salvation.&#8221; Scripture highlights both the reality of unseen opposition and the supremacy of Christ, encouraging us to discern voices carefully and to stay committed to a clear, uncompromised proclamation of the gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">kept on crying.</span> Assuming that the case now before us presented phenomena analogous to those of the cases of demoniac possession, we may refer to what has been said in the <span class= "ital">Excursus</span> on that subject appended to St. Matthew's Gospel for general views of the question. Here it will be enough to note the same symptom of a divided consciousness. We lose much of the human interest of the narrative if we merely think of a demon bearing, as in mockery, his witness to the work of Christ, in order that he might thwart that work. That continual cry spoke, we may well believe, of the girl's mind as longing for deliverance, and peace, and calm. She sees in the preachers those whom she recognises as able to deliver her, as unlike as possible to the masters who traded on her maddened misery. And yet the thraldom in which she found herself led her to cries that simply impeded their work. We note, as characteristic, the recurrence of the name of the Most High God, which meets us from the lips of the demoniac in the Gospels. (See Note on <a href="/mark/5-7.htm" title="And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the most high God? I adjure you by God, that you torment me not.">Mark 5:7</a>.) As the name which was often in the mouths of exorcists, it became familiar to those who were regarded as subjects for their treatment. As she seems day by day to have gone to the river-side oratory, it is probable that she also had some points of contact with the faith of those who worshipped there, and had listened there to the preaching of the Apostles. Might not she claim a share in "the way of salvation" which was proclaimed to them?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="accented">- Following after</span>... <span class="accented">cried out</span> for <span class="accented">followed</span>... <span class="accented">and cried</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">servants</span> for the servants, A.V.; <span class="accented">proclaim unto you</span> for <span class="accented">show unto us</span>, A.V. and T.R. This testimony of the spirit of divination to the doctrine of St. Paul is analogous to that of the unclean spirits who cried out to Jesus, "Thou art the Son of God" (<a href="/mark/1-23.htm">Mark 1:23-26</a>; <a href="/mark/3-11.htm">Mark 3:11</a>; <a href="/luke/4-34.htm">Luke 4:34, 35</a>); and St. Paul's dealing with the spirit of divination was similar to that of our Lord's with the evil spirits in the cases referred to. What was the motive of the damsel, or the spirit by which she was possessed, for so crying out, or St. Paul's for so silencing her, we are not told. Perhaps she interrupted him, and diverted the minds of those to whom he was preaching. And he did not like the mixture of lies with truth.
