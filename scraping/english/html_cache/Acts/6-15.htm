It held significant authority over Jewish religious and civil matters. This setting underscores the gravity of the situation, as Stephen is brought before the highest Jewish authority, similar to Jesus' trial (<a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59-66</a>). The Sanhedrin's role in maintaining religious orthodoxy and their opposition to the early Christian movement is crucial to understanding the tension in this scene.<p><b>looked intently at Stephen</b><br>The phrase suggests a focused and scrutinizing gaze, indicating the seriousness with which the Sanhedrin regarded Stephen's testimony. This intense observation reflects their suspicion and the high stakes of the accusations against him. It also mirrors the scrutiny Jesus faced during His trial, highlighting the continuity of opposition faced by His followers.<p><b>and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel</b><br>This description suggests a divine or supernatural radiance, reminiscent of Moses' face shining after speaking with God (<a href="/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-35</a>). It implies that Stephen was filled with the Holy Spirit, as mentioned earlier in <a href="/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>, and that his countenance reflected God's presence and approval. This angelic appearance serves as a divine testimony to Stephen's righteousness and the truth of his message, contrasting with the hostility of the Sanhedrin.

It must be interpreted by the account given of angels as appearing in the form of "young men" (<a href="/mark/16-5.htm" title="And entering into the sepulcher, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.">Mark 16:5</a>), and so throws some light upon St. Stephen's age, as being, probably, about the same standing as St. Paul, and implies that his face was lighted up as by the radiance of a divine brightness. The phrase seems to have been more or less proverbial. In the expanded version of the Book of Esther, which appears in the LXX., she says to the King, as in reverential awe, "I saw thee, O my lord, as an angel of God" (<a href="/esther/5-2.htm" title="And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the scepter.">Esther 5:2</a>). In <a href="/2_samuel/14-17.htm" title="Then your handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD your God will be with you.">2Samuel 14:17</a>, the words refer to the wisdom of David rather than to anything visible and outward. Here the impression left by St. Luke's narrative is that the face of St. Stephen was illumined at once with the glow of an ardent zeal and the serenity of a higher wisdom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> <span class="accented">- Fastening their eyes</span> for <span class="accented">looking steadfastly</span>, A.V.
