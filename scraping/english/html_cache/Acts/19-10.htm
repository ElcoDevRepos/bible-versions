This duration allowed for deep discipleship and the establishment of a strong church. The extended stay contrasts with Paul's shorter visits to other cities, highlighting Ephesus's strategic importance. The two-year period also suggests a fulfillment of God's timing and purpose, as Paul was able to reach a wide audience and lay a solid foundation for the spread of the Gospel.<p><b>so that everyone who lived in the province of Asia</b><br>The province of Asia refers to the Roman province located in what is now western Turkey. Ephesus was a major city in this region, serving as a hub for commerce and culture. The phrase "everyone who lived" suggests the extensive reach of Paul's ministry, facilitated by Ephesus's status as a center of travel and trade. This widespread dissemination of the Gospel fulfills the Great Commission, as the message of Christ began to permeate a significant portion of the Roman Empire.<p><b>Jews and Greeks alike</b><br>Paul's ministry was inclusive, reaching both Jews and Greeks. This reflects the early church's mission to transcend ethnic and cultural boundaries, in line with the teachings of Jesus and the vision of the church as a unified body of believers. The inclusion of both groups also demonstrates the breaking down of the "dividing wall of hostility" mentioned in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>, as the Gospel was for all people, regardless of their background.<p><b>heard the word of the Lord</b><br>The "word of the Lord" refers to the message of the Gospel, centered on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Hearing the word implies not just passive listening but an active engagement with the message, leading to transformation and faith. This phrase underscores the power of the Gospel to reach and impact diverse populations, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of salvation reaching the ends of the earth.
