The hostility arose because they believed Paul was teaching against the Jewish law and had brought Gentiles into the temple (<a href="/acts/21-28.htm">Acts 21:28-29</a>). This reflects the deep-seated tensions between Jewish traditions and the emerging Christian faith. The attempt on Paul's life echoes the persecution faced by early Christians, as seen in the stoning of Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58-60</a>). It also parallels the sufferings of Christ, who was similarly rejected by His own people (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>).<p><b>the commander of the Roman regiment</b><br>The commander, or "chiliarch," was a high-ranking officer in charge of a cohort, typically consisting of about 600 soldiers. This reflects the Roman military presence in Jerusalem, which was part of the larger Roman Empire's control over Judea. The presence of Roman authority highlights the political tension in Jerusalem, where Roman law often clashed with Jewish customs. The Roman intervention in Paul's situation underscores the providential protection over Paul, allowing him to continue his mission.<p><b>received a report that all Jerusalem was in turmoil</b><br>The report indicates the widespread chaos and unrest in the city, a common occurrence during major Jewish festivals when Jerusalem was crowded with pilgrims. This turmoil is reminiscent of previous disturbances in the city, such as those during the ministry of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/21-10.htm">Matthew 21:10</a>). The unrest also foreshadows the eventual destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70, as prophesied by Jesus (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41-44</a>).

The Roman garrison was obviously stationed there to command the crowds of pilgrims, and was likely to be on the alert at a time like the Pentecost Feast. The Procurator Felix, however, was for the time at Caesarea. The next verse shows that their appearance was sufficient at once to strike some kind of awe into the turbulent mob.
