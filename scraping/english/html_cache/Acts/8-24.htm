His response here follows Peter's rebuke for attempting to buy the power of the Holy Spirit with money. This highlights the early church's struggle against syncretism and the misunderstanding of spiritual gifts. Simon's answer indicates a moment of self-reflection and fear, showing the impact of apostolic authority.<p><b>&#8220;Pray to the Lord for me</b><br>Simon requests intercession from Peter, acknowledging the apostles' connection to God. This reflects a common practice in the early church where believers sought the prayers of those they considered spiritually mature. It also shows Simon's recognition of his own inadequacy in approaching God directly, a theme seen in other biblical figures who sought intercession, such as the Israelites asking Moses to speak to God on their behalf (<a href="/exodus/20-19.htm">Exodus 20:19</a>).<p><b>so that nothing you have said</b><br>Peter had warned Simon of the dire consequences of his actions, including the possibility of perishing with his money. This phrase indicates Simon's fear of judgment and his desire to avoid the repercussions of his sin. It underscores the seriousness with which the early church viewed the purity of the gospel message and the dangers of attempting to manipulate or commercialize spiritual gifts.<p><b>may happen to me.&#8221;</b><br>Simon's plea reveals his concern for his own well-being, rather than a genuine repentance or understanding of the gravity of his sin. This reflects a common human tendency to seek relief from consequences rather than true transformation. The narrative leaves Simon's ultimate fate ambiguous, prompting readers to consider the nature of true repentance and the importance of aligning one's heart with God's will. This moment serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of superficial faith and the need for sincere conversion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_the_sorcerer.htm">Simon the Sorcerer</a></b><br>A man from Samaria who practiced sorcery and amazed the people.

Simon&#8217;s focus on avoiding consequences signals that the Holy Spirit&#8217;s work in him is still incomplete.<p>&#8226;&#8194;Nevertheless, the passage stands as a grace-filled invitation: anyone who genuinely turns to Christ finds full forgiveness (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-7.htm">Isaiah 55:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/8-24.htm">Acts 8:24</a> captures a moment of uneasy conviction. Simon sees the reality of divine judgment and instinctively seeks apostolic intercession, yet his words reflect a heart more alarmed by outcomes than sin. The verse warns against superficial repentance while graciously pointing every reader to the only sure refuge&#8212;personal, humble faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Pray ye to the Lord for me.</span>--There is something eminently characteristic in the sorcerer's words. (1) His conscience reads "between the lines" of St. Peter's address what was not actually found there. That "if perhaps" is to him as the knell of doom. (2) He prays not for deliverance from "the bond of iniquity," but only from the vague terror of a future penalty. (3) He turns, not, as Peter had bidden him, to the Lord who was ready to forgive, but to a human mediator. Peter must pray for him who has not faith to pray for himself.<p>At this point Simon disappears from the history of the Acts, and this seems accordingly the right place for stating briefly the later traditions as to his history. In those traditions he occupies a far more prominent position than in St. Luke's narrative, and becomes, as it has been said, the "hero of the romance of heresy," as given in the <span class= "ital">Homilies</span> and <span class= "ital">Recognitions</span> of the Pseudo-Clement. Born at Gittom, in Samaria (Justin, <span class= "ital">Apol.</span> i. 26), he received his education at Alexandria, and picked up the language of a mystic Gnosticism from Dositheus (<span class= "ital">Hom.</span> ii. c. 22; <span class= "ital">Constt. Apost.</span> vi. 8). He had for a short time been a disciple of the Baptist (<span class= "ital">Hom.</span> c. 23). He murdered a boy that the soul of his victim might become his familiar spirit, and give him insight into the future (<span class= "ital">Hom. ii.</span> c. 26; <span class= "ital">Recogn.</span> ii. 9). He carried about with him a woman of great beauty, of the name of Luna or Helena, whom he represented as a kind of incarnation of the Wisdom or Thought of God (Justin, <span class= "ital">Apol. i.</span> 6; <span class= "ital">Hom.</span> ii. c. 25; Euseb. <span class= "ital">Hist.</span> ii. 13). He identified himself with the promised Paraclete and the Christ, and took the name of "<span class= "ital">He who stands</span>," as indicating divine power (<span class= "ital">Recogn. ii.</span> 7). He boasted that he could turn himself and others into the form of brute beasts; that he could cause statues to speak (<span class= "ital">Hom. iv.</span> c. 4; <span class= "ital">Recogn.</span> ii. 9, iii. 6). His life was one of ostentatious luxury. He was accompanied by the two sons of the Syro-Ph?nician woman of <a href="/mark/7-26.htm" title="The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she sought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.">Mark 7:26</a> (<span class= "ital">Hom.</span> i. 19). After the episode related <span class= "ital">in</span> the Acts, he went down to Caesarea, and Peter was then sent thither by James, the Bishop of Jerusalem, to confront and hold a disputation with him on various points of doctrine. From Caesarea he made his way to Tyre and Tripolis, and thence to Rome, and was there worshipped by his followers, so that an altar was seen there by Justin with an inscription, "SIMONI DEO SANCTO" (<span class= "ital">Apol.</span> i. 56). Peter followed him, and in the reign of Claudius the two met, once more face to face, in the imperial city. According to one legend, he offered to prove his divinity by flying in the air. trusting that the demons whom he employed would support him; but, through the power of the prayers of Peter, he fell down, and had his bones broken, and then committed suicide (<span class= "ital">Constt. Apost.</span> ii. 14; 6:9). Another represents him as buried alive at his own request, in order that he might show his power by rising on the third day from the dead, and so meeting his death (Irenaeus, <span class= "ital">Adv. Haer</span>. vi. 20).<p>In the midst of all this chaos of fantastic fables, we have, perhaps, one grain of fact in Justin's assertion that he had seen the altar above referred to. An altar was discovered at Rome in 1574, on the island in the Tiber, with the inscription "SEMONI SANCO DEO FIDIO." Archaeologists, however, agree in thinking that this was dedicated to the Sabine Hercules, who was known as SEMO SANCUS, and it has been thought by many writers that Justin may have seen this or some like altar, and, in his ignorance of Italian mythology, have imagined that it was consecrated to the Sorcerer of Samaria. His statement is repeated by Tertullian (<span class= "ital">Apol.</span> c. 13) and Irenaeus (i. 20). Of the three names in the inscription, Semo (probably connected with <span class= "ital">Semen</span> as the God of Harvest, or as <span class= "ital">Semihomo</span>) appears by itself in the Hymn of the Fratres Arvales, and in connection with Sancus and Fidius (probably connected with <span class= "ital">Fides, </span>and so employed in the formula of asseveration, <span class= "ital">medius fidius</span>) in Ovid, <span class= "ital">Fast.</span> vi. 213; Livy, viii. 20; 32:1.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - And <span class="accented">Simon answered</span> for <span class="accented">then answered Simon</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">.for me to the Lord</span> for <span class="accented">to the Lord for me</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the</span> for <span class="accented">these</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Pray ye</span>, etc.; addressed to both Peter and John, who were acting together, and whose prayers had been seen to be effectual (ver. 15) in procuring the gift of the Holy Ghost.
