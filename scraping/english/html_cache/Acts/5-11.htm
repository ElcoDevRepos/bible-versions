This fear is not merely terror but a deep respect for God's power and authority. In the context of <a href="/acts/5.htm">Acts 5</a>, this fear follows the divine judgment on Ananias and Sapphira, who lied to the Holy Spirit. The early church, still in its formative stage, witnesses firsthand the seriousness of sin and the importance of integrity within the community. This event underscores the holiness required of God's people, echoing the Old Testament instances where God's holiness was demonstrated, such as the deaths of Nadab and Abihu (<a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-3</a>).<p><b>came over the whole church</b><br>The term "church" (Greek: ekklesia) refers to the assembly of believers, marking one of the earliest uses of the term in the New Testament to describe the Christian community. This indicates that the fear was not limited to individuals but was a collective experience, emphasizing the unity and shared responsibility within the body of Christ. The early church was characterized by communal living and shared resources, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>, and this incident reinforced the need for honesty and transparency in such a community.<p><b>and all who heard about these events</b><br>The phrase "all who heard" suggests that the impact of the event extended beyond the immediate church community to the broader public. This widespread fear served as a testimony to the power and presence of God among His people, potentially drawing others to the faith or causing them to reconsider their actions. The events surrounding Ananias and Sapphira would have been a topic of significant discussion, highlighting the seriousness with which God views sin and the importance of truthfulness. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's desire for His people to be a light to the nations, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, and the call for the church to be a witness to the world, as Jesus instructed in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The community of believers in Jerusalem who were the first followers of Jesus Christ.

Much like <a href="/2_chronicles/20-29.htm">2 Chronicles 20:29</a>, where &#8220;the fear of God came on all the kingdoms,&#8221; the Spirit impresses truth on hearts so powerfully that people cannot shake it.<p>&#8226; This divine takeover builds a culture of holiness, reminding believers that God disciplines those He loves (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the whole church</b><p>&#8226; This is the first time Luke uses &#8220;church&#8221; (ekklesia) for the New-Testament people of God. Every member, not just leaders, felt the impact.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a> illustrates the idea: &#8220;If one part suffers, every part suffers with it.&#8221; What happened in one couple&#8217;s living room reverberated through the entire body.<p>&#8226; The episode reinforces that purity is a community matter; <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a> pictures Christ cleansing &#8220;the church in order to present her to Himself in splendor.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all who heard</b><p>&#8226; The circle widens beyond believers to the watching world.

Even unbelievers recognize a power that demands respect, echoing Rahab&#8217;s words in <a href="/joshua/2-11.htm">Joshua 2:11</a>: &#8220;When we heard of it, our hearts melted.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>about these events</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;These events&#8221; refers to the sudden deaths of Ananias and Sapphira for lying to the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/5-3.htm">Acts 5:3-5</a>). Their story mirrors <a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-3</a>, where Nadab and Abihu fell under similar judgment, teaching that God&#8217;s holiness has never relaxed.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a> reminds us, &#8220;These things happened to them as examples.&#8221; The church in every age must remember that hidden sin is never hidden from God (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/5-11.htm">Acts 5:11</a> shows that when God defends His holiness, fear and awe sweep through both the church and the watching world. The Spirit presses the lesson home: the church belongs to a holy God who sees the heart, judges sin, and calls His people to integrity. Such reverence purifies the community, magnifies Christ&#8217;s name, and prepares hearts for true worship and witness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And great fear came upon all the church.</span>--With the exception of the doubtful reading in <a href="/acts/2-47.htm" title="Praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.">Acts 2:47</a>, this is the first occurrence of the word <span class= "ital">ecclesia</span> since the two instances in which our Lord had used it, as it were, by anticipation. (See Notes on <a href="/matthew/16-18.htm" title="And I say also to you, That you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.">Matthew 16:18</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-17.htm" title="And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it to the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be to you as an heathen man and a publican.">Matthew 18:17</a>.) Its frequent use in the LXX. version for the "assembly," or "congregation," of Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-16.htm" title="According to all that you desired of the LORD your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.">Deuteronomy 18:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-1.htm" title="He that is wounded in the stones, or has his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.">Deuteronomy 23:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/26-12.htm" title="My foot stands in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.">Psalm 26:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-26.htm" title="Bless you God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.">Psalm 68:26</a>), its associations with the political life of Greece as applied to the assemblies, every member of which was a full citizen, made it a natural and fitting word for the new society; and the use by our Lord either of the actual Greek word or of the corresponding Aramaic term stamped it with His sanction. Its occurrence here is, perhaps, an indication of the increase of the Hellenistic element among the disciples. The sudden startling death of Ananias and his wife naturally tended to give a new prominence to the society, the rulers of which were seen to be clothed with supernatural powers; and the fear that fell upon all who heard of these things led them in part to draw near with reverence, in part to shrink back in awe. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - The <span class="accented">whole Church</span> for <span class="accented">all the Church</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">all that heard</span> for <span class="accented">as many as heard</span>, A.V.
