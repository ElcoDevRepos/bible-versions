Tyre was a major Phoenician city, known for its trade and commerce. The journey from Tyre to Ptolemais would have been a coastal voyage along the eastern Mediterranean, reflecting the interconnectedness of early Christian communities. The mention of "we" suggests the presence of Luke, the author of Acts, as part of Paul's traveling companions, providing an eyewitness account.<p><b>we landed at Ptolemais</b><br>Ptolemais, known today as Acre or Akko, was an important port city in ancient times. It was part of the Roman province of Syria and had a mixed population of Jews and Gentiles. The city's strategic location made it a hub for trade and travel, facilitating the spread of the Gospel. The landing here signifies a brief stop in Paul's journey towards Jerusalem, highlighting the network of early Christian communities along the Mediterranean.<p><b>where we greeted the brothers</b><br>The term "brothers" refers to fellow believers in Christ, indicating the presence of a Christian community in Ptolemais. This greeting underscores the unity and fellowship among early Christians, regardless of geographical location. It reflects the practice of hospitality and mutual support that was vital for the survival and growth of the early Church. This community likely consisted of both Jewish and Gentile converts, illustrating the inclusive nature of the Gospel.<p><b>and stayed with them for a day</b><br>The brief stay suggests a time of fellowship and encouragement among believers. It highlights the itinerant nature of Paul's ministry, as he often traveled from city to city, strengthening the churches. This short visit would have provided an opportunity for teaching, prayer, and sharing news from other Christian communities. The hospitality extended to Paul and his companions reflects the early Church's commitment to supporting missionaries and fostering a sense of belonging among believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_his_companions.htm">Paul and His Companions</a></b><br>The apostle Paul is traveling with his companions, continuing his missionary journey.

Here, also, as through all the line of cities along the coast, we find a church already organised, founded probably, as already suggested, by Philip the Evangelist. Here the stay of the travellers was shorter than at Tyre, probably because the ship only put into the harbour for the night.
