In the context of Acts, Paul had been in Caesarea, staying with Philip the evangelist. The "days" refer to the time spent in fellowship and preparation for the journey to Jerusalem. This reflects the early Christian practice of community and hospitality, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>.<p><b>we packed up</b><br>The act of packing up suggests preparation and intention. It implies a deliberate decision to move forward despite potential challenges. This reflects the missionary zeal and commitment of Paul and his companions. The use of "we" indicates the presence of Luke, the author of Acts, as part of the traveling group, emphasizing the firsthand account of the events.<p><b>and went on to Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem holds significant importance as the center of Jewish worship and the early Christian church. Paul's journey to Jerusalem is pivotal, as it fulfills his desire to bring aid to the believers there, as mentioned in <a href="/romans/15-25.htm">Romans 15:25-27</a>. This journey also foreshadows the trials and tribulations Paul will face, similar to Jesus' own journey to Jerusalem.
