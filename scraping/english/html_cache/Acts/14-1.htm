It was a significant city in the region of Lycaonia and part of the Roman province of Galatia. The city was a cultural and commercial hub, with a diverse population including Jews, Greeks, and Romans. Iconium's strategic location made it an important center for spreading the Gospel. The presence of a Jewish synagogue indicates a substantial Jewish community, which was common in many cities of the Roman Empire.<p><b>Paul and Barnabas went as usual into the Jewish synagogue</b><br>Paul and Barnabas followed their customary practice of beginning their ministry in a new city by visiting the local synagogue. This approach was strategic, as synagogues were places where Jews gathered for worship and teaching, and they often welcomed visiting teachers. Paul's background as a Pharisee and his deep understanding of the Hebrew Scriptures made him well-suited to engage with Jewish audiences. This method also fulfilled the principle of "to the Jew first" (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>), reflecting the priority of offering the Gospel to the Jewish people before extending it to the Gentiles.<p><b>where they spoke so well</b><br>The phrase indicates that Paul and Barnabas were effective communicators, able to present the Gospel in a compelling and persuasive manner. Their ability to articulate the message of Jesus Christ was likely enhanced by the Holy Spirit, who empowered them to speak with boldness and clarity. This effectiveness in communication is a recurring theme in Acts, as seen in other instances where the apostles preached with power and conviction (<a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13, 6</a>:10).<p><b>that a great number of Jews and Greeks believed</b><br>The response to Paul and Barnabas's preaching was significant, with many Jews and Greeks coming to faith in Christ. This highlights the inclusive nature of the Gospel, breaking down the barriers between Jews and Gentiles, as emphasized in passages like <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>. The mention of Greeks indicates that the message of Jesus was reaching beyond the Jewish community, fulfilling the Great Commission to make disciples of all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). This diverse response also foreshadows the growing Gentile inclusion in the early Church, a major theme in the Book of Acts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A key apostle in the early church, known for his missionary journeys and spreading the Gospel to the Gentiles.

promise that His witnesses would carry the message &#8220;to the ends of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul later recalls the hardships he faced in Iconium alongside those in Lystra and Antioch (<a href="/2_timothy/3-11.htm">2 Timothy 3:11</a>), underscoring both the reality of persecution and the Lord&#8217;s rescue.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Paul and Barnabas went as usual into the Jewish synagogue</b><p>&#8226;
