In both cases, quick obedience maintains holiness in the gathered community.<p>&#8226; The apostles stay focused on ministry, while the younger men meet the physical need&#8212;an early glimpse of the complementary roles later formalized in <a href="/acts/6-2.htm">Acts 6:2-4</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>wrapped up his body</b><p>&#8226; Jewish custom called for a body to be securely bound in linen before burial; <a href="/john/19-40.htm">John 19:40</a> records that &#8220;they wrapped Jesus&#8217; body in linen cloths with the spices, according to the Jewish burial custom.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The wrapping also shields the congregation from ceremonial defilement (<a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11-13</a>) and preserves modesty.<p>&#8226; Their careful handling honors even a sinning brother as one made in God&#8217;s image, echoing the respect shown in <a href="/genesis/50-2.htm">Genesis 50:2</a> when Joseph ordered that Jacob be &#8220;embalmed.&#8221;<p>&#8226; At the same time, the absence of public mourning underscores the severity of Ananias&#8217;s deceit; the text moves on without eulogy or lament.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and carried him out</b><p>&#8226; Removal from the meeting place protects the purity of worship, much like &#8220;Take the blasphemer outside the camp&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase highlights the separation that sin creates; Ananias&#8217;s body cannot remain among the living fellowship.<p>&#8226; Practically, the young men shoulder the weight&#8212;literally&#8212;of sin&#8217;s consequence, foreshadowing later exhortations: &#8220;Brothers, if someone is caught in a trespass, you who are spiritual should restore him with a spirit of gentleness&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>).

So in <a href="/luke/20-26.htm" title="And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marveled at his answer, and held their peace.">Luke 20:26</a> we find the same word answering in the parallel clause to "him that serveth," and opposed to "elders," where the latter word seems used in a half official sense rather than of age only. We find here, accordingly, rather than in Acts 6, the germ of the later diaconate as a body of men set apart for the subordinate services of the community. The special work here done by them was afterwards assigned to the <span class= "ital">Fossarii, </span>the sextons, or grave-diggers of the Church.<p><span class= "bld">Wound him up.</span>--The word in this sense is found here only in the New Testament. It implies the hurried wrapping in a winding-sheet. It was followed by the immediate interment outside the walls of the city. Custom, resting partly on the necessities of climate, partly on the idea of ceremonial defilement, as caused by contact with a corpse (<a href="/context/numbers/19-11.htm" title="He that touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.">Numbers 19:11-16</a>), required burial to follow quickly on death, unless there was a more or less elaborate embalmment. In the act itself we note something like a compassionate respect. There is a reverence for humanity, as such, perhaps for the body that had once been the temple of the Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm" title="What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?">1Corinthians 6:19</a>), that will not permit men to do as the heathen did, and to inflict dishonour on the lifeless corpse. The narrative implies that the new society had already a burial-place to which they had free right of access. Was it in the Potter's Field that had been bought to bury strangers in? (<a href="/matthew/27-7.htm" title="And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.">Matthew 27:7</a>.) Did the body of Ananias rest in the same cemetery with that of Judas?
