This moment of prayer occurs as the apostles seek divine direction in choosing a replacement for Judas Iscariot. The act of prayer underscores the importance of seeking God's will in decision-making processes, reflecting the early church's commitment to spiritual discernment.<p><b>Lord, You know everyone&#8217;s heart</b><br>This phrase acknowledges God's omniscience, particularly His ability to see and understand the innermost thoughts and intentions of individuals. The apostles recognize that human judgment is limited, and they rely on God's perfect knowledge to guide their choice. This echoes <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God tells Samuel that He looks at the heart rather than outward appearances, emphasizing the divine ability to discern true character.<p><b>Show us which of these two</b><br>The apostles are choosing between two candidates, Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias, to replace Judas. This decision is significant as it maintains the symbolic number of twelve apostles, representing the twelve tribes of Israel. The process of selection through prayer and casting lots reflects the cultural practices of the time, where lots were often used to discern God's will, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>.<p><b>You have chosen</b><br>The phrase indicates a belief in divine election, where God has already made His choice, and the apostles seek to align their decision with His will. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty in choosing individuals for specific roles, as seen in the calling of prophets and leaders throughout the Old Testament. It also prefigures the New Testament understanding of believers being chosen by God for His purposes, as expressed in <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The remaining eleven apostles after Judas' betrayal and death, seeking to replace him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/matthias_and_joseph.htm">Matthias and Joseph (called Barsabbas)</a></b><br>The two candidates considered to replace Judas as an apostle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The location where the disciples were gathered, waiting for the Holy Spirit as Jesus instructed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prayer.htm">Prayer</a></b><br>The act of seeking divine guidance, demonstrating reliance on God's wisdom and knowledge.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>Referring to Jesus Christ, whom the disciples are addressing in their prayer for guidance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_prayer_in_decision-making.htm">The Importance of Prayer in Decision-Making</a></b><br>Before making significant decisions, seek God's guidance through prayer, acknowledging His wisdom and understanding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience.htm">God's Omniscience</a></b><br>Trust in God's perfect knowledge of our hearts and motives, which surpasses human understanding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_selection_and_calling.htm">Divine Selection and Calling</a></b><br>Recognize that God has a specific purpose and calling for each individual, and His choices are based on His perfect will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_unity_in_seeking_god's_will.htm">Community and Unity in Seeking God's Will</a></b><br>Engage in communal prayer and discernment, valuing the collective wisdom and unity of the body of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Faith in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Have faith that God is in control and His plans are for our good, even when the path is not clear to us.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_1_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 1:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Acts_1_24_Prayer_s_role_in_decisions.htm">How does Acts 1:24 demonstrate the importance of prayer in decision-making?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Acts_1_24_God_s_insight_into_hearts.htm">What does Acts 1:24 teach about God's knowledge of our hearts?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_emulate_apostles_trust_in_God.htm">How can we apply the apostles' reliance on God in Acts 1:24 today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Old_Testament_God_knows_hearts.htm">What Old Testament examples show God knowing the hearts of individuals?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Align_decisions_with_God_s_will_Acts_1_24.htm">How can we ensure our decisions align with God's will, as in Acts 1:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Acts_1_24_God_s_role_in_decisions.htm">What does Acts 1:24 reveal about God's role in decision-making?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Acts_1_24_Prayer_s_role_in_choosing_leaders.htm">How does Acts 1:24 demonstrate the importance of prayer in leadership selection?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_seek_divine_over_human_wisdom_in_Acts.htm">Why is divine guidance sought in Acts 1:24 instead of human wisdom?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_acts_1.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Acts 1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/who_was_matthias_in_the_bible.htm">Who was Matthias in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/who_succeeded_judas_as_apostle.htm">Who replaced Judas as the 12th apostle?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_is_'third_heaven'_about.htm">What does 'God gave them over' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/is_casting_lots_reliable_for_choosing_apostles.htm">(Acts 1:21&#8211;26) How reliable is the process of selecting a new apostle by casting lots, and why isn&#8217;t it used elsewhere?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Acts 1:24 Mean</div><b>And they prayed</b><p>&#8211;
