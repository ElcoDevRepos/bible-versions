Immediate obedience marks a life surrendered to God, just as Abraham &#8220;rose early&#8221; when commanded (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>) and Paul urged, &#8220;Now is the day of salvation&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a>).

Peter&#8217;s arrival fulfills Jesus&#8217; blueprint that the good news move &#8220;to the ends of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).

Expectation signals faith; Cornelius took the angel&#8217;s word at face value (<a href="/acts/10-3.htm">Acts 10:3&#8211;7</a>) and waited in confidence, much like the psalmist who prays and then &#8220;watches expectantly&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>). Faith is &#8220;the assurance of things hoped for&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-1.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>), and God honors that assurance by bringing Peter right to Cornelius&#8217; door.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Had called together his relatives and close friends</b><p>&#8220;and had called together his relatives and close friends&#8221; (10:24 d).
