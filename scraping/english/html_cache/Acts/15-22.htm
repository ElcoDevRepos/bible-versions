The apostles and elders were the primary leaders, but the involvement of the whole church indicates a communal approach. This reflects the early church's commitment to shared leadership and accountability, as seen in <a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1-6</a>, where the church selected deacons to serve. The decision-making process here underscores the importance of discernment and prayer in leadership, as well as the value of involving the broader community in significant decisions.<p><b>to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas.</b><br>Antioch was a major center of early Christianity and the location of the first Gentile church. It was here that believers were first called Christians (<a href="/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>). The decision to send representatives to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas underscores the importance of maintaining doctrinal unity and addressing the concerns raised by the Gentile believers. This action demonstrates the church's commitment to fostering relationships and ensuring that the message of the gospel was consistent across different regions. The presence of Paul and Barnabas, who had been instrumental in the church's growth in Antioch, highlights their ongoing role as trusted leaders and missionaries.<p><b>They chose Judas called Barsabbas and Silas,</b><br>Judas called Barsabbas and Silas were selected as representatives, indicating their respected status within the early church. Judas, possibly related to Joseph Barsabbas (<a href="/acts/1-23.htm">Acts 1:23</a>), was likely a Jewish Christian, which would have been significant in addressing the concerns of both Jewish and Gentile believers. Silas, also known as Silvanus, later became a close associate of Paul and is mentioned in several of Paul's letters (e.g., <a href="/1_thessalonians/1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/1-19.htm">2 Corinthians 1:19</a>). Their selection reflects the church's desire to send credible and trustworthy leaders who could effectively communicate the council's decisions and foster unity.<p><b>two leaders among the brothers,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the leadership roles of Judas and Silas within the early Christian community. Being recognized as leaders among the brothers suggests they were well-respected and had demonstrated spiritual maturity and wisdom. Their leadership would have been crucial in conveying the decisions of the Jerusalem Council and ensuring that the message was received with authority and clarity. This selection also highlights the early church's practice of appointing leaders based on character and ability, as seen in the qualifications for elders and deacons outlined in <a href="/1_timothy/3.htm">1 Timothy 3</a> and <a href="/titus/1.htm">Titus 1</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/apostles_and_elders.htm">Apostles and Elders</a></b><br>The leaders of the early church in Jerusalem who were responsible for making important decisions regarding doctrine and practice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_whole_church.htm">The Whole Church</a></b><br>Refers to the congregation in Jerusalem, indicating that the decision was made collectively, not just by the leaders.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/antioch.htm">Antioch</a></b><br>A significant city in early Christianity, where believers were first called Christians.

If they concurred in the letter, it must have been submitted to their approval, and the right to approve involves the power to reject and, probably, to modify. It is probable enough, as in the analogous constitution of Greek republics above referred to (see Note on <a href="/acts/15-4.htm" title="And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.">Acts 15:4</a>), that the Ecclesia, or popular assembly, did not possess the power of initiating measures; but their right to vote appears, from this instance, to have been indisputable. (See, however, Note on the next verse.) It does not follow, of course, that what was thus the polity of the apostolic age was necessarily adapted for the Church of all subsequent ages; but the exclusion of the laity from all share in Church synods, though it may be defended as a safeguard against the violence of a barbarous or faithless age, must, at any rate, be admitted to be at variance with primitive and apostolic practice.<p><span class= "bld">To send chosen men.</span>--Literally, the participle being active in meaning, <span class= "ital">to choose and send men.</span> This was obviously necessary, to guard against suspicion. Had Paul and Barnabas alone been the bearers of such a letter, it might have been said that they had forged it.<p><span class= "bld">Judas surnamed Barsabas.</span>--The same patronymic meets us, it will be remembered, in <a href="/acts/1-23.htm" title="And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.">Acts 1:23</a>, as belonging to "Joseph, called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus." It is a natural inference that the two were brothers, and therefore that the disciple now mentioned had been among those who were personally followers of our Lord. This would naturally clothe him with a high authority. The fact that he is spoken of in <a href="/acts/15-32.htm" title="And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brothers with many words, and confirmed them.">Acts 15:32</a> as a prophet, makes it probable that he was of the number of the Seventy. (See Note on <a href="/luke/10-1.htm" title="After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, where he himself would come.">Luke 10:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Silas.</span>--This may have been either a contracted form of Silvanus, as Antipas was of Antipatros, or an Aramaic name, for which Silvanus was adopted as the nearest Greek equivalent. It is probable that he, too, fulfilled the same conditions as his companion. He also was a prophet (<a href="/acts/15-32.htm" title="And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brothers with many words, and confirmed them.">Acts 15:32</a>). His later history will be noticed as it comes before us. As the name is connected with the Hebrew for "three," he has by some been identified with the Tertius of <a href="/romans/16-22.htm" title="I Tertius, who wrote this letter, salute you in the Lord.">Romans 16:22</a>; but it is hardly probable that one who had been known at Corinth as Silvanus (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-19.htm" title="For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yes and no, but in him was yes.">2Corinthians 1:19</a>), should afterwards have changed his name. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="accented">It</span> <span class="accented">seemed good to</span> for <span class="accented">pleased it</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the elders</span> for <span class="accented">elders</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to choose men out of their company and send them, etc.</span>, for to <span class="accented">send chosen men of their own company</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Barsabbas</span> for <span class="accented">Barsabas</span>, A.V. and T.R., as <a href="/acts/1-23.htm">Acts 1:23</a>. <span class="cmt_word">To choose men</span>, etc. This is a necessary, change, because the middle aorist (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) cannot have a passive meaning (chosen); see ver. 40. <span class="cmt_word">Chief men</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">leaders.</span> So in <a href="/luke/22-26.htm">Luke 22:26</a> <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is rendered, "He that is chief."
