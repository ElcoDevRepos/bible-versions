The opening of heaven signifies a direct communication from God, similar to instances in <a href="/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a> and <a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>. It underscores the importance of the vision and the authority of the message being conveyed. The opening of heaven often precedes significant divine interventions or revelations, emphasizing the supernatural origin of the vision.<p><b>and something like a large sheet</b><br>The imagery of a large sheet suggests a vessel or container, symbolizing the inclusivity of God's message. The sheet's size indicates the vastness of the vision's scope, possibly representing the entire world or all of creation. This vision challenges Jewish dietary laws and cultural boundaries, foreshadowing the inclusion of Gentiles into the Christian faith. The sheet can be seen as a type of the church, encompassing all believers regardless of ethnic or cultural background.<p><b>being let down to earth</b><br>The descent of the sheet from heaven to earth signifies the bridging of divine and human realms. It illustrates God's initiative in reaching out to humanity, emphasizing that the message is not of human origin but divinely ordained. This act of letting down symbolizes God's grace and the extension of His covenant to all people, aligning with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>.<p><b>by its four corners</b><br>The mention of four corners suggests universality, as the number four often represents the entirety of the earth (e.g., four winds, four corners of the earth). This detail highlights the global scope of the vision, indicating that the message is for all nations and peoples. It reflects the prophetic vision of <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where God's salvation is extended to the ends of the earth. The four corners can also symbolize the completeness and perfection of God's plan, as seen in the four living creatures in <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle who is the central figure in this vision.

Its inward meaning may fairly be thought of as corresponding to his prayer. One who looked out from Joppa upon the waters of the Great Sea towards the far-off Isles of the Gentiles, might well seek to know by what process and under what conditions those who dwelt in them would be brought within the fold of which he was one of the chief appointed shepherds. The place, we may add, could not fail to recall the memory of the great prophet who had taken ship from thence, and who was conspicuous alike as a preacher of a gospel of repentance to the Gentiles, and, in our Lord's own teaching, as a type of the Resurrection (<a href="/context/matthew/12-40.htm" title="For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.">Matthew 12:40-41</a>).
