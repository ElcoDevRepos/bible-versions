Paul and his companions had been in Cyprus, where they encountered the proconsul Sergius Paulus and the sorcerer Elymas. The departure from Paphos marks the continuation of their missionary journey, emphasizing the spread of the Gospel beyond Jewish communities to Gentile regions.<p><b>Paul and his companions</b><br>This phrase highlights the leadership role of Paul in the missionary team, which included Barnabas and John Mark. The shift from "Barnabas and Saul" to "Paul and his companions" indicates Paul's emerging prominence. This team dynamic is crucial for the spread of early Christianity, showcasing the importance of collaboration in ministry.<p><b>came to Perga in Pamphylia</b><br>Perga was a city in the region of Pamphylia, located in modern-day Turkey. It was a significant city in the Roman province, known for its temple of Artemis. The journey to Perga marks the beginning of Paul's first missionary journey into Asia Minor. This region was a melting pot of cultures, providing a strategic location for the dissemination of the Gospel.<p><b>where John left them</b><br>John, also known as John Mark, was a relative of Barnabas and initially part of the missionary team. His departure from the group is significant, as it later becomes a point of contention between Paul and Barnabas (<a href="/acts/15-37.htm">Acts 15:37-39</a>). This incident highlights the challenges and human dynamics within early Christian missions.<p><b>to return to Jerusalem</b><br>John Mark's return to Jerusalem suggests a withdrawal from the mission, possibly due to personal reasons or disagreements. Jerusalem was the center of early Christianity, and his return there may indicate a preference for the familiar or a need to report back to the church.

The absence of any record of evangelising work there is probably due to the fact that there were no synagogues, and that the Apostles in this mission adhered to the plan of preaching in the first instance to the Jews, and making the synagogue, as it were, their base of operations.<p><span class= "bld">John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.</span>--We are left to conjecture the motives of this departure. He may have shrunk from the perils and hardships of the journey into the interior of the country. He may have been drawn by affection for his mother, who lived at Jerusalem. It is clear, in any case, from St. Paul's subsequent conduct (<a href="/acts/15-38.htm" title="But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.">Acts 15:38</a>), that he looked on the reason as insufficient, while Barnabas saw, at least, enough to admit the plea of extenuating circumstances. The pressure of the famine at Jerusalem may have seemed to him to excuse the desire of the son to minister to the mother's wants.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - Vow for <span class="accented">now</span> when, A.V.; <span class="accented">set sail</span> for <span class="accented">loosed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and came</span> for <span class="accented">they</span> came, A.V.; <span class="accented">departed.., and returned</span> for <span class="accented">departing</span>... <span class="accented">returned</span>, A.V. A very marked change may here be observed in the relations of Barnabas and Paul. Hitherto Barnabas has always occupied the first rank. It has been "Barnabas and Saul" (<a href="/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>; <a href="/acts/12-25.htm">Acts 12:25</a>; vers. 2, 7).

Renan dwells much on the beauty of Barnabas's character as seen in his cheerful acquiescence in this change of relative position, and his single-minded devotion to the success of the work. <span class="cmt_word">Came to Perga</span>, the capital of Pamphylia, in that part of the coast of Asia Minor which looks due south. Perga was about seven and a half miles inland, on the river Cestrus, which is navigable. There was a constant intercourse between Paphos the capital of Cyprus, and Perga the capital of Pamphylia, fostered probably by the two famous temples of Venus and Diana. The word for set sail (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) is a nautical term, meaning sailing from the shore or harbor into the open sea (see <a href="/acts/16-11.htm">Acts 16:11</a>; <a href="/acts/21-1.htm">Acts 21:1</a>; <a href="/acts/27-12.htm">Acts 27:12</a>; <a href="/luke/8-22.htm">Luke 8:22</a>). At Perga John Mark left them. Perhaps his position as Barnabas's cousin was less pleasant now that Paul took the first place; perhaps his courage failed him now that they were fairly launched out into the heathen world, where, unlike Cyprus, his Jewish kinsmen were a small minority, and the dangers and fatigues were great. Pamphylia was now governed by a propraetor, being an imperial province. Its name denotes that it was inhabited by a mixed race - men of all tribes, aborigines, Cilicians, Greeks, etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/13-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">After setting sail</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#957;&#945;&#967;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Anachthentes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_321.htm">Strong's 321: </a> </span><span class="str2">From ana and ago; to lead up; by extension to bring out; specially, to sail away.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(apo)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_575.htm">Strong's 575: </a> </span><span class="str2">From, away from.
