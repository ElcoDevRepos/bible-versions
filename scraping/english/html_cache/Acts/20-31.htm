In the context of <a href="/acts/20.htm">Acts 20</a>, Paul is addressing the Ephesian elders, urging them to be watchful over the church. The Greek word for "alert" implies a continuous state of watchfulness, akin to a shepherd guarding his flock. This echoes Jesus' admonition to His disciples in <a href="/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a> to "watch and pray." The call to alertness is a recurring theme in the New Testament, emphasizing the need for spiritual discernment and readiness against false teachings and spiritual attacks.<p><b>and remember that for three years</b><br>Paul's reference to "three years" highlights the duration of his ministry in Ephesus, which was one of the longest periods he spent in any city. This time frame is significant as it underscores the depth of his commitment and the thoroughness of his teaching. Ephesus was a major city in the Roman province of Asia, known for its temple to Artemis and its diverse population. Paul's extended stay allowed him to establish a strong foundation for the church amidst a challenging cultural and religious environment.<p><b>I never stopped warning each of you</b><br>Paul's continuous warning reflects his pastoral care and responsibility. The Greek word for "warning" can also mean "admonishing" or "exhorting," indicating a proactive approach to guiding the believers. This mirrors the role of a prophet, who warns of impending danger and calls for repentance. Paul's warnings were not generic but personal, as he addressed "each of you," showing his deep personal investment in the spiritual well-being of the Ephesian believers.<p><b>night and day</b><br>The phrase "night and day" emphasizes the relentless and tireless nature of Paul's ministry. It suggests a sense of urgency and dedication, reminiscent of the apostle's own words in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>, where he describes his labor "night and day" to avoid being a burden. This continuous effort reflects the seriousness with which Paul approached his mission, understanding the spiritual stakes involved.<p><b>with tears</b><br>Paul's mention of "tears" reveals the emotional intensity and sincerity of his ministry. His tears are a testament to his genuine love and concern for the believers, akin to Jesus weeping over Jerusalem in <a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>. This emotional expression underscores the depth of Paul's pastoral heart and his empathy for the spiritual struggles of the church. It also serves as a model for Christian leaders, highlighting the importance of compassion and heartfelt concern in ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The speaker in this passage, Paul is addressing the elders of the church in Ephesus.

His call is:<p>&#8226; Stay awake to spiritual danger&#8212;just as Jesus said, &#8220;Be on guard, stay alert; for you do not know when the appointed time will come&#8221; (<a href="/mark/13-33.htm">Mark 13:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Guard the flock&#8212;Peter echoes, &#8220;Be sober-minded and alert.

Like the vinedresser in Jesus&#8217; parable who tended the fig tree &#8220;for three years&#8221; (<a href="/luke/13-7.htm">Luke 13:7</a>), Paul invested patiently until the church could stand on its own.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I never stopped warning each of you</b><p>&#8220;I never stopped&#8221; shows persistence; &#8220;warning each of you&#8221; highlights personal care.<p>&#8226; Paul tells the Colossians, &#8220;We proclaim Him, admonishing everyone&#8230;so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>).<p>&#8226; To the Corinthians he writes, &#8220;I am not writing this to shame you, but to warn you as my beloved children&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-14.htm">1 Corinthians 4:14</a>).<p>&#8226; As Ezekiel was a watchman for Israel (<a href="/ezekiel/33-7.htm">Ezekiel 33:7</a>), Paul functions as a watchman for the church, sounding the alarm whenever error or sin threatens.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Night and day</b><p>His vigilance was around the clock:<p>&#8226; &#8220;You remember our labor and toil: working night and day so as not to burden any of you&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; He tells Timothy, &#8220;I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/1-3.htm">2 Timothy 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Anna served in the temple &#8220;worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-37.htm">Luke 2:37</a>).<p>Faithful ministry refuses to punch a time-clock; love compels a shepherd to sacrifice convenience for the wellbeing of the flock.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With tears</b><p>Paul&#8217;s warnings were not harsh scoldings but heartfelt appeals:<p>&#8226; Earlier he reminded these elders that he served &#8220;with great humility and with tears&#8221; (<a href="/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>).<p>&#8226; To Corinth he wrote, &#8220;I wrote to you out of great distress and anguish of heart, with many tears&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Speaking of false teachers, he says, &#8220;I have often told you, and now say again even with tears&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/3-18.htm">Philippians 3:18</a>).<p>Tears prove the authenticity of his concern; doctrine divorced from compassion fails to reflect Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a> paints a portrait of vigilant, sacrificial shepherding.
