It was here that Paul and Barnabas were first sent out on missionary journeys (<a href="/acts/13.htm">Acts 13:1-3</a>). The church in Antioch was a diverse and vibrant community, reflecting the multicultural nature of the city itself. Paul's return to Antioch after his second missionary journey indicates the importance of this church as a base for his missions. This time in Antioch likely involved teaching, fellowship, and planning for future missions.<p><b>he traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia</b><br>Galatia and Phrygia were regions in Asia Minor, modern-day Turkey. Galatia was known for its Celtic inhabitants, and Paul had previously established churches there during his first missionary journey (Acts 13-14). The letter to the Galatians addresses issues faced by these churches, such as the influence of Judaizers. Phrygia was a region with a mix of Greek and native Phrygian culture. Paul's travels through these areas demonstrate his commitment to nurturing and strengthening the churches he had planted, ensuring they remained steadfast in the faith.<p><b>strengthening all the disciples</b><br>Paul's mission was not only to evangelize but also to disciple and strengthen believers. This involved teaching sound doctrine, encouraging perseverance, and addressing false teachings. The strengthening of disciples is a recurring theme in Paul's ministry (<a href="/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22, 15</a>:41). It reflects the Great Commission's call to make disciples of all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). Paul's efforts to strengthen the disciples highlight the importance of spiritual growth and maturity in the Christian life, ensuring that believers are equipped to face challenges and remain faithful.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is central to the spread of the Gospel to the Gentiles.

The change came afterwards. Some falling away from their first love, some relapse into old national vices, he may have noticed already which called for earnest warning (<a href="/galatians/5-21.htm" title="Contentions, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.">Galatians 5:21</a>). As he passed through the churches he had founded on his previous journey, he gave the directions for the weekly appropriation of what men could spare from their earnings (the term, a weekly "offertory," though often employed of it, does not represent the facts of the case), to which he refers in <a href="/1_corinthians/16-2.htm" title="On the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God has prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.">1Corinthians 16:2</a>.

According to Renan, Lewin, 'Speaker's Commentary,' and many others, it was at this time that the meeting with St. Peter occurred to which St. Paul refers in <a href="/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>, etc. And Renan ingeniously connects that perversion of the faith of the Galatians which led to St. Paul's Epistle being addressed to them, with the visit to Antioch of James's emissaries, Lewin also identifies the journey of St Paul to Jerusalem mentioned in <a href="/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1</a> with that recorded in our ver. 22. But neither of these theories is borne out by any known facts, nor is in itself probable. There is no appearance of Barnabas or Titus being with St. Paul at this time, and it is very unlikely that any should have come from James to Antioch so immediately after St. Paul's salutation of the Church at Jerusalem and the fulfillment of his vow there. The time preceding the visit of Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem, as related in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, is far the most likely for the encounter of the two apostles (see <a href="/acts/14-28.htm">Acts 14:28</a>; <a href="/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1</a>, and note). <span class="cmt_word">Went through</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as in <a href="/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4, 40</a>; <a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>; <a href="/acts/13-6.htm">Acts 13:6</a>; <a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a>; <a href="/acts/17-23.htm">Acts 17:23</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">The region of Galatia and Phrygia</span>. In <a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a> the order is inverted, "the region of Phrygia and Galatia," R.V., or "Phrygia and the region of Galatia," A.V. The natural inference from this is, as Lewin says, with whom Farrar agrees, that on this occasion St. Paul went straight from Antioch to Galatia, passing through the Cilician Gates and by Mazaca, or Caesarea, as it was called by Tiberius Caesar, in Cappadocia, and not visiting the Churches of Lycaonia. He proceeded from Galatia through Phrygia to Ephesus. The distance from Antioch to Tarsus was one hundred and forty-one miles, from whence to Tavium in Galatia was two hundred and seventy-one miles, making the whole distance from Antioch to Tavium in Galatia four hundred and twelve miles, or about a three weeks' journey including rest on the sabbath days. From Galatia to Ephesus would be between six hundred and seven hundred miles. The entire journey would thus be considerably more than a thousand miles, a journey of forty days exclusive of all stoppages. Six months probably must have elapsed between his departure from Antioch and his arrival at Ephesus; Lewin says "several months" (p. 330, note). <span class="cmt_word">In order</span>; in the same order, though inverted, in which he had first visited them, leaving out none. <span class="cmt_word">Stablishing</span>, etc. (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>); see above, <a href="/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="/acts/15-32.htm">Acts 15:32, 41</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/18-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[After]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Paul] had spent</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#942;&#963;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(poi&#275;sas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4160.htm">Strong's 4160: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I make, manufacture, construct, (b) I do, act, cause.
