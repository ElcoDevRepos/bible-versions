The ascension marks the conclusion of Jesus' earthly ministry and His return to the Father. It is recorded in more detail in <a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>. The ascension fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, where the Messiah is invited to sit at the right hand of God. This event took place on the Mount of Olives, a significant location in biblical history, situated east of Jerusalem. The ascension signifies Jesus' exaltation and the completion of His redemptive work, paving the way for the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.<p><b>after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit</b><br>The instructions given by Jesus were not merely human commands but were imparted through the Holy Spirit, emphasizing the divine authority and guidance behind them. This highlights the role of the Holy Spirit in the early church and in the lives of believers. The Holy Spirit is seen as the source of wisdom and revelation, as mentioned in <a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>, where Jesus promises that the Spirit will teach and remind the apostles of everything He has said. The instructions likely included the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18-20</a>) and the command to wait in Jerusalem for the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4-5</a>).<p><b>to the apostles He had chosen</b><br>The apostles were specifically chosen by Jesus to be His witnesses and to carry on His mission after His ascension. This selection underscores the concept of divine election and purpose. The apostles, originally twelve in number, represent the new Israel, paralleling the twelve tribes of Israel. Their role was foundational for the establishment of the church, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>, where they are described as part of the church's foundation, with Christ as the cornerstone. The choosing of the apostles also reflects Jesus' intentional preparation of leaders who would be empowered by the Holy Spirit to spread the gospel to the ends of the earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, who, after His resurrection, gave instructions to His apostles through the Holy Spirit before His ascension into heaven.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The chosen disciples of Jesus who received His teachings and instructions.
