The tabernacle&#8217;s journey&#8212;from Moses to Joshua, through conquest, and on to David&#8212;assures us that the Lord who once dwelt in canvas now dwells in our hearts through Christ (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(45) <span class= "bld">Brought in with Jesus.</span>--This is, of course, as in <a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm" title="For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.">Hebrews 4:8</a>, the "Joshua" of the Old Testament. It would, perhaps, have been better, as a general rule, to have reproduced the Hebrew rather than the Greek form of Old Testament names in the English version of the New. On the other hand, there is, in this instance, something gained in our attention being called to the identity of the two names. It is noticeable that though Stephen was on his trial as a disciple of Jesus of Nazareth, that name does not pass his lips as he speaks in his defence, except in this reference to the great captain of Israel. It is possible that under this reticence, there may have been a half-veiled reference to Him who, also bearing the name that marked Him out as a Saviour, had come, after another fashion, "into the possession of the Gentiles." The word for "possession" is found in <a href="/acts/7-5.htm" title="And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.">Acts 7:5</a>, but not elsewhere in the New Testament. In the LXX. it is common enough, as in <a href="/genesis/47-11.htm" title="And Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.">Genesis 47:11</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-24.htm" title="And in all the land of your possession you shall grant a redemption for the land.">Leviticus 25:24</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-51.htm" title="Because you trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you sanctified me not in the middle of the children of Israel.">Deuteronomy 32:51</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> <span class="accented">- In their turn</span> for <span class="accented">that come after</span>, (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), A.V.; <span class="accented">Joshua</span> (the Hebrew form) for Jesus (the Greek form of the name), A.V.; <span class="accented">when they entered on the possession of the nations</span> for <span class="accented">into the possession of the Gentiles</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">which God thrust</span> for <span class="accented">whom God drave</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">In their turn;</span> more literally, <span class="accented">having received it in</span> succession.
