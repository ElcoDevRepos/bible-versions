The statement that "her household" were baptised has often been urged as evidence that infant baptism was the practice of the apostolic age. It must be admitted, however, that this is to read a great deal between the lines, and the utmost that can be said is that the language of the writer does not exclude infants. The practice itself rests on firmer grounds than a precarious induction from a few ambiguous passages. (See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/19-13.htm" title="Then were there brought to him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.">Matthew 19:13-15</a>.) In this instance, moreover, there is no evidence that she had children, or even that she was married. The "household" may well have consisted of female slaves and freed-women whom she employed, and who made up her <span class= "ital">familia.</span> It follows, almost as a necessary inference, that many of these also were previously proselytes. For such as these, Judaism had been a "schoolmaster," leading them to Christ. (See <a href="/galatians/3-24.htm" title="Why the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.">Galatians 3:24</a>.) We may think of Euodias and Syntyche, and the other women who "laboured in the gospel" (<a href="/context/philippians/4-2.htm" title="I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.">Philippians 4:2-3</a>), as having been, probably, among them. The names of the first two occur frequently in the inscriptions of the <span class= "ital">Columbaria</span> of this period, now in the Vatican and Lateran Museums, the Borghese Gardens, and elsewhere, as belonging to women of the slave or <span class= "ital">libertinae</span> class.<p><span class= "bld">She besought us.</span>--Up to this time the teachers, four in number, had been, we must believe, living in a lodging and maintaining themselves, as usual, by labour--St. Paul as a tentmaker, St. Luke, probably, as a physician. Now the large-hearted hospitality of Lydia (the offer implies a certain measure of wealth, as, indeed, did her occupation, which required a considerable capital) led her to receive them as her guests. They did not readily abandon the independent position which their former practice secured them, and only yield to the kind "constraint" to which they were exposed.<p><span class= "bld">If ye have judged.</span>--The words contain a modest, almost a pathetic, appeal to the fact that the preachers had recognised her faith by admitting her to baptism.
