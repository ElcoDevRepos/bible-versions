In Jewish tradition, the day was divided into specific times for prayer, and this afternoon time would have been a regular occurrence for devout Jews. The mention of "afternoon" suggests a time of transition, possibly symbolizing the shift from the old covenant to the new covenant through the actions of the apostles.<p><b>Peter and John</b><br>Peter and John were two of Jesus' closest disciples, often seen together in the Gospels and Acts. Their partnership in ministry highlights the importance of fellowship and collaboration in the early church. Peter, known for his leadership and boldness, and John, known for his deep spiritual insight, represent a balance of action and contemplation. Their presence together underscores the unity and shared mission among the apostles.<p><b>were going up to the temple</b><br>The temple in Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship and a place of significant religious activity. "Going up" refers to the physical ascent to the temple, which was situated on a hill. This phrase also indicates their continued participation in Jewish religious practices, showing respect for their heritage while also being part of the new movement initiated by Jesus. The temple was a place where Jesus himself taught, and now his apostles continue his work there.<p><b>at the hour of prayer</b><br>The Jewish day included three specific times for prayer: morning, afternoon, and evening. The hour of prayer mentioned here aligns with the afternoon sacrifice, a time when many would gather at the temple. This practice reflects the discipline and devotion of the early believers, who maintained regular prayer times. It also shows the continuity between Jewish customs and the emerging Christian faith.<p><b>the ninth hour</b><br>The ninth hour corresponds to 3 PM, a significant time in the Jewish day for prayer and sacrifice. This was the time of the evening sacrifice, a moment of communal worship and atonement. In the context of the New Testament, the ninth hour is also the time when Jesus cried out on the cross, "It is finished" (<a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>), marking the completion of his sacrificial work. This connection underscores the fulfillment of Old Testament sacrificial practices through Christ's ultimate sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, known for his leadership in the early church and his boldness in preaching the gospel.

They were probably about the same age (the idea that Peter was some years older than John rests mainly on the pictures which artists have drawn from their imagination, and has no evidence in Scripture), and had been friends from their youth upward. They had been partners as fishermen on the Sea of Galilee (<a href="/luke/5-10.htm" title="And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not; from now on you shall catch men.">Luke 5:10</a>). They had been sharers in looking for the consolation of Israel, and had together received the baptism of John (<a href="/john/1-41.htm" title="He first finds his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.">John 1:41</a>). John and Andrew had striven which should be the first to tell Peter that they had found the Christ (<a href="/john/1-41.htm" title="He first finds his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.">John 1:41</a>). The two had been sent together to prepare for the Passover (<a href="/luke/22-8.htm" title="And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.">Luke 22:8</a>). John takes Peter into the palace of the high priest (<a href="/john/18-16.htm" title="But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known to the high priest, and spoke to her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.">John 18:16</a>), and though he must have witnessed his denials is not estranged from him. It is to John that Peter turns for comfort after his fall, and with him he comes to the sepulchre on the morning of the Resurrection (<a href="/john/20-6.htm" title="Then comes Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulcher, and sees the linen clothes lie,">John 20:6</a>). The eager affection which, now more strongly than ever, bound the two together is seen in Peter's question, "Lord, and what shall this man do?" (<a href="/john/21-21.htm" title="Peter seeing him said to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?">John 21:21</a>); and now they are again sharers in action and in heart, in teaching and in worship. Passing rivalries there may have been, disputes which was the greatest, prayers for places on the right hand and the left (<a href="/matthew/20-20.htm" title="Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.">Matthew 20:20</a>; <a href="/mark/10-35.htm" title="And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying, Master, we would that you should do for us whatever we shall desire.">Mark 10:35</a>); but the idea maintained by Renan (<span class= "ital">Vie de Jesus, Introduction</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>that St. John wrote his Gospel to exalt himself at the expense of Peter, must take its place among the <span class= "ital">delirantium somnia, </span>the morbid imaginations, of inventive interpretation. They appear in company again in the mission to Samaria (<a href="/acts/8-14.htm" title="Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John:">Acts 8:14</a>), and in recognising the work that had been done by Paul and Barnabas among the Gentiles (<a href="/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>). When it was that they parted never to meet again, we have no record. No account is given as to the interval that had passed since the Day of Pentecost. Presumably the brief notice at the end of Acts 2 was meant to summarise a gradual progress, marked by no striking incidents, which may have gone on for several months. The absence of chronological <span class= "ital">data</span> in the Acts, as a book written by one who in the Gospel appears to lay stress on such matters (<a href="/luke/3-1.htm" title="Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,">Luke 3:1</a>; <a href="/luke/6-2.htm" title="And certain of the Pharisees said to them, Why do you that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?">Luke 6:2</a>), is somewhat remarkable. The most natural explanation is that he found the informants who supplied him with his facts somewhat uncertain on these points, and that, as a truthful historian, he would not invent dates. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="accented">- Were going up</span> for <span class="accented">went up together</span>, A.V. and T.R. Peter and John. The close friendship of these two apostles is remarkable. The origin of it appears to have been their partnership in the fishing-boats in which they pursued their trade as fishermen on the Sea of Galilee. For St. Luke tells us that the sons of Zebedee were "partners with Simon," and helped him to take the miraculous draught of fishes (<a href="/luke/5-10.htm">Luke 5:10</a>). We find the two sons of Zebedee associated with Peter in the inner circle of the Lord's apostles, at the Transfiguration, at the raising of Jairus's daughter, and at the agony in the Garden of Gethsemane (see also <a href="/mark/13-3.htm">Mark 13:3</a>). But the yet closer friendship of Peter and John first appears in their going together to the palace of Caiaphas on the night of the betrayal (<a href="/john/18-15.htm">John 18:15</a>), and then in the memorable visit to the holy sepulcher on the morning of the Resurrection (<a href="/john/20-2.htm">John 20:2-4</a>), and yet again in <a href="/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7, 20, 21</a>. It is in strict and natural sequence to these indications in the Gospel that, on opening the first chapters of the Acts, we find Peter and John constantly acting together in the very van of the Christian army (see <a href="/acts/3-1.htm">Acts 3:1, 3, 11</a>; <a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13, 19</a>; <a href="/acts/8-14.htm">Acts 8:14, 25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The hour of prayer</span>; called in <a href="/luke/1-10.htm">Luke 1:10</a>, "the hour of incense," that is, the hour of the evening sacrifice, when the people stood outside in prayer, while the priest within offered the sacrifice and burnt the incense (see <a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>, note). Hence the comparison in <a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, "Let my prayer be set before thee as incense, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/3-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[ One afternoon ]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Peter</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Petros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4074.htm">Strong's 4074: </a> </span><span class="str2">Peter, a Greek name meaning rock.
