The number forty is significant in the Bible, often symbolizing a period of testing or preparation (e.g., Israel's 40 years in the wilderness, Jesus' 40 days of fasting). Moses' time in Midian was a time of preparation for his future role as the deliverer of Israel.<p><b>an angel appeared to Moses</b><br>The angel is often understood as a manifestation of God Himself, sometimes referred to as a theophany. In the Old Testament, angels frequently serve as messengers of God, delivering divine instructions or revelations. This appearance marks a pivotal moment in Moses' life, initiating his call to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.<p><b>in the flames of a burning bush</b><br>The burning bush is a significant symbol of God's presence. Despite the flames, the bush was not consumed, indicating God's eternal nature and His power to sustain. This miraculous sign captures Moses' attention and signifies the holy ground of God's presence. It also foreshadows the divine fire that would later guide the Israelites as a pillar of fire.<p><b>in the desert near Mount Sinai</b><br>Mount Sinai, also known as Horeb, is a critical location in biblical history. It is where Moses would later receive the Ten Commandments, establishing the covenant between God and Israel. The desert setting emphasizes the isolation and humility of Moses' encounter with God, away from the distractions of Egypt. This location becomes a sacred site for the Israelites, representing God's law and covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses is chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.
