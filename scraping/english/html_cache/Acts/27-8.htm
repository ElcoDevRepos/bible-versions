The Apostle Paul was on his way to Rome as a prisoner, and the voyage was fraught with difficulties. The phrase suggests adverse weather conditions, likely strong winds, which were common in the Mediterranean Sea during certain seasons. This reflects the broader theme of trials and perseverance found throughout Acts, as Paul often faced hardships in his mission to spread the Gospel. The difficulty in travel can also be seen as a metaphor for the Christian journey, which often involves overcoming obstacles and relying on God's guidance.<p><b>we came to a place called Fair Havens</b><br>Fair Havens was a harbor on the southern coast of Crete. The name itself, "Fair Havens," suggests a place of safety and refuge, which is significant given the perilous journey. However, despite its name, Fair Havens was not considered a suitable place to winter due to its exposure to the elements. This highlights the tension between human judgment and divine providence, as the crew later decided to leave Fair Havens against Paul's advice, leading to further trials. The concept of a "haven" can also be seen as a type of Christ, who offers refuge and safety to believers amidst life's storms.<p><b>near the town of Lasea</b><br>Lasea was a small town near Fair Havens, and its mention provides a geographical anchor for the narrative. The specificity of location underscores the historical accuracy of Luke's account in Acts. Archaeological evidence supports the existence of Lasea, though it was not a major port, which aligns with the narrative's implication that Fair Havens was not ideal for wintering. The mention of Lasea also serves to remind readers of the real-world context of Paul's journeys, grounding the spiritual lessons in tangible history. This connection to a specific place emphasizes the reality of God's work in the world, through real people and real events.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who is being transported to Rome as a prisoner.
