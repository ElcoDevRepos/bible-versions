Their jealousy stemmed from Joseph being favored by their father, Jacob, and from Joseph's dreams, which suggested he would rule over them (<a href="/genesis/37-3.htm">Genesis 37:3-11</a>). This jealousy is a recurring theme in Scripture, illustrating the destructive power of envy (<a href="/proverbs/14-30.htm">Proverbs 14:30</a>; <a href="/james/3-16.htm">James 3:16</a>). Joseph's story foreshadows the rejection of Jesus by His own people, as He was also envied and rejected by the religious leaders (<a href="/mark/15-10.htm">Mark 15:10</a>).<p><b>they sold him as a slave into Egypt</b><br>Joseph's brothers sold him to Midianite traders for twenty pieces of silver (<a href="/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>), a transaction that parallels Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus for thirty pieces of silver (<a href="/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a>). This act of selling Joseph into slavery was intended for harm, yet it was part of God's sovereign plan to preserve the family of Israel during a future famine (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>). Egypt, a significant nation in biblical history, becomes the setting for Joseph's rise to power, illustrating God's ability to use adverse circumstances for His purposes.<p><b>But God was with him</b><br>Despite the betrayal and hardship Joseph faced, God's presence remained with him, providing protection and favor (<a href="/genesis/39-2.htm">Genesis 39:2-3, 21</a>). This phrase emphasizes God's faithfulness and sovereignty, themes that resonate throughout Scripture (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). Joseph's life is a testament to God's providential care and serves as a type of Christ, who also experienced suffering and rejection but was ultimately exalted (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8-9</a>). The assurance of God's presence is a promise to all believers, offering comfort and strength in times of trial (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_patriarchs.htm">The Patriarchs</a></b><br>Refers to the sons of Jacob, who were the leaders of the twelve tribes of Israel.

Envy had actuated the patriarchs when they sold Joseph; envy had led their descendants to deliver up Jesus (<a href="/matthew/27-18.htm" title="For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.">Matthew 27:18</a>).
