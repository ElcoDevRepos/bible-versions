In biblical context, the "right hand" is a position of power and favor (<a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>). The exaltation of Jesus is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13</a>, which speaks of the servant being exalted. This exaltation signifies Jesus' victory over death and His ascension into heaven (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>). It also reflects the early Christian belief in Jesus' divine nature and His role in the heavenly realm, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>.<p><b>as Prince and Savior</b><br>The term "Prince" (Greek: "arch&#275;gos") can also be translated as "leader" or "author," indicating Jesus as the originator and guide of salvation (<a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>). "Savior" highlights His role in delivering humanity from sin, a central theme in Christian theology. This dual title underscores Jesus' authority and His mission to bring salvation, aligning with Old Testament expectations of a messianic figure who would lead and save (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>). The combination of these titles affirms Jesus' unique role in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>in order to grant repentance and forgiveness of sins</b><br>This phrase outlines the purpose of Jesus' exaltation. Repentance and forgiveness are core components of the gospel message. Repentance involves a change of mind and heart, turning away from sin and towards God (<a href="/luke/24-47.htm">Luke 24:47</a>). Forgiveness of sins is a key aspect of the New Covenant, prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>, where God promises to remember sins no more. This reflects the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice, enabling believers to be reconciled with God.<p><b>to Israel</b><br>The initial focus on Israel highlights the fulfillment of God's promises to His chosen people. Jesus' ministry was primarily directed towards the Jews (<a href="/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>), and the early church began in Jerusalem, spreading the message of salvation first to the Jewish people (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of Israel's role in God's plan, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>, where the gospel is for the Jew first and then the Gentile. It underscores the continuity of God's covenantal faithfulness to Israel while also foreshadowing the inclusion of the Gentiles in the salvation plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who exalts Jesus to a position of authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Referred to as "Prince and Savior," highlighting His divine authority and role in salvation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/right_hand_of_god.htm">Right Hand of God</a></b><br>A position of power and honor, signifying Jesus' exalted status.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_forgiveness.htm">Repentance and Forgiveness</a></b><br>The gifts offered through Jesus, emphasizing the purpose of His exaltation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The initial recipients of the message of repentance and forgiveness, representing God's chosen people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/exaltation_of_christ.htm">Exaltation of Christ</a></b><br>Recognize the significance of Jesus being exalted to God's right hand, affirming His divine authority and role as our mediator.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_as_prince_and_savior.htm">Role as Prince and Savior</a></b><br>Understand Jesus' dual role as both ruler and redeemer, emphasizing His authority and His sacrificial love.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/gift_of_repentance.htm">Gift of Repentance</a></b><br>Acknowledge that repentance is a gift from God, made possible through Jesus' work, and is essential for a restored relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/forgiveness_of_sins.htm">Forgiveness of Sins</a></b><br>Embrace the forgiveness offered through Christ, which cleanses us and reconciles us to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/mission_to_israel_and_beyond.htm">Mission to Israel and Beyond</a></b><br>Reflect on the initial focus on Israel and the broader mission to all nations, encouraging us to share the message of repentance and forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_5_31_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 5:31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Acts_5_31_Jesus_as_Prince_Savior.htm">How does Acts 5:31 emphasize Jesus' role as "Prince and Savior"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_repentance_to_Israel.htm">What does "repentance to Israel" mean for understanding God's plan for salvation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Jesus_exaltation_daily.htm">How can we apply Jesus' exaltation to our daily Christian walk?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Acts_5_31_to_OT_Messiah_prophecies.htm">Connect Acts 5:31 with Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah's role.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_forgiveness_on_relationships.htm">How does receiving "forgiveness of sins" influence our relationship with God and others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Acts_5_31_Jesus_role_in_salvation.htm">What does Acts 5:31 reveal about Jesus' role in salvation and repentance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Acts_5_31_Jesus_as_divine_leader.htm">How does Acts 5:31 support the concept of Jesus as a divine leader?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Acts_5_31_Repentance_forgiveness.htm">Why is repentance emphasized in Acts 5:31, and how does it relate to forgiveness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_acts_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Acts 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/main_themes_of_bible's_books.htm">What are the main themes of the Bible's books?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_did_israel_retreat_after_the_sacrifice.htm">Why would a single human sacrifice on a city wall abruptly force Israel's retreat (2 Kings 3:26-27)?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_death_for_sabbath-breaking,_not_mercy.htm">Exodus 31:15 -
