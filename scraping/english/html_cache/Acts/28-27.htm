In biblical context, a callous heart is often associated with stubbornness and rebellion against God (<a href="/ezekiel/3-7.htm">Ezekiel 3:7</a>). The Israelites frequently exhibited this behavior, as seen in their repeated disobedience throughout the Old Testament. The hardening of the heart is a recurring theme, notably in Pharaoh's resistance to Moses in Exodus. This condition is a warning against spiritual apathy and the dangers of ignoring divine truth.<p><b>they hardly hear with their ears,</b><br>This indicates a lack of spiritual perception and understanding. In the cultural context of the time, hearing was a primary means of learning and receiving instruction. The phrase suggests a deliberate refusal to listen, akin to the Israelites' rejection of the prophets. Jesus often used similar language to describe those who were spiritually deaf (<a href="/matthew/13-15.htm">Matthew 13:15</a>). The inability to hear God's word is a sign of spiritual blindness and resistance to the Holy Spirit.<p><b>and they have closed their eyes.</b><br>Closing one's eyes symbolizes a willful ignorance or rejection of truth. In biblical symbolism, eyes represent understanding and insight. The act of closing them indicates a conscious decision to ignore or reject God's revelation. This mirrors the behavior of the religious leaders who refused to acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah. The closing of eyes is a metaphor for spiritual blindness, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>, which is the source of this quotation.<p><b>Otherwise they might see with their eyes,</b><br>This phrase suggests the potential for spiritual awakening and enlightenment. Seeing with one's eyes implies gaining true understanding and recognizing God's work. In the New Testament, Jesus often healed physical blindness as a sign of spiritual sight (<a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39</a>). The possibility of seeing indicates that repentance and acceptance of God's message can lead to spiritual clarity and salvation.<p><b>hear with their ears,</b><br>Hearing with ears signifies the ability to comprehend and accept God's word. In the biblical narrative, hearing is often linked to obedience and faith (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>). The phrase implies that if the people were willing to listen, they could receive divine truth and guidance. This is a call to be attentive to God's voice, as exemplified by the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, which emphasizes the importance of hearing and obeying God.<p><b>understand with their hearts,</b><br>Understanding with the heart denotes a deep, internal comprehension that goes beyond intellectual knowledge. In Hebrew thought, the heart is the center of emotion, will, and intellect. This understanding leads to transformation and aligns one's life with God's will. The phrase echoes the promise of a new heart and spirit found in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>, highlighting the transformative power of God's word when truly understood.<p><b>and turn,</b><br>Turning signifies repentance, a fundamental concept in both the Old and New Testaments. It involves a change of direction, turning away from sin and towards God. This action is essential for reconciliation with God and is a central message of the prophets and the teachings of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>). Repentance is the first step towards spiritual renewal and healing.<p><b>and I would heal them.</b><br>Healing here refers to spiritual restoration and salvation. God's promise to heal is contingent upon the people's willingness to repent and turn to Him. This healing is not just physical but encompasses the whole being, restoring the relationship between God and humanity. The concept of divine healing is prevalent throughout Scripture, from the physical healings performed by Jesus to the ultimate healing of sin through His sacrifice (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>). This promise underscores God's desire for reconciliation and wholeness for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The primary speaker in <a href="/bsb/acts/28.htm">Acts 28</a>, Paul is addressing the Jewish leaders in Rome, explaining why he has come to them and sharing the message of the Gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_leaders_in_rome.htm">Jewish Leaders in Rome</a></b><br>These are the individuals Paul is speaking to in this passage.
