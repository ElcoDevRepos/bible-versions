It was a significant center for trade and culture, making it a strategic location for spreading the Gospel. The city's prominence in commerce and religion provided Paul with a diverse audience for his teachings.<p><b>Paul left Priscilla and Aquila</b><br>Priscilla and Aquila were a Jewish couple who had become Christians and were close companions of Paul. They were tentmakers by trade, like Paul, and had previously been expelled from Rome by Emperor Claudius. Their presence in Ephesus indicates the importance of laypeople in the early church's mission. Paul leaving them there suggests he trusted them to continue the work of establishing and nurturing the church in his absence.<p><b>He himself went into the synagogue there</b><br>Paul's custom was to begin his ministry in a new city by visiting the local synagogue. This was a strategic approach, as synagogues were places where Jews and God-fearing Gentiles gathered, providing Paul with an audience familiar with the Scriptures. This method allowed him to connect the Old Testament prophecies with the life and mission of Jesus Christ.<p><b>and reasoned with the Jews</b><br>Paul's reasoning in the synagogue involved explaining and proving that Jesus was the Messiah, as foretold in the Hebrew Scriptures. This approach was both intellectual and theological, engaging the Jews in discussions that connected their expectations of the Messiah with the fulfillment found in Jesus. This method of reasoning is consistent with Paul's approach in other cities, as seen in <a href="/acts/17-2.htm">Acts 17:2-3</a>, where he reasoned from the Scriptures to demonstrate that Jesus had to suffer and rise from the dead.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A key apostle in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and epistles.

What follows seems to imply that he no longer continued to work with them, as at Corinth, but leaving them to establish themselves in their craft, began, under the pressure of his eagerness to reach Jerusalem, an independent course of teaching in the synagogues.<p>The first mention of Ephesus calls for a short account of its history. It had been one of the early Greek colonies on the western coast of Asia Minor. It fell under the power of Alyattes, King of Lydia, and his successor, Croesus. It had from the first been celebrated for the worship of Artemis (see Note on <a href="/acts/19-14.htm" title="And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.">Acts 19:14</a>); and her Temple, with its sacred image, and stately courts, and its hundreds of priests and priestesses of various grades, was visited by pilgrims of all nations. It was one of the cities in which East and West came into close contact with each other, and the religion of Greece assumed there a more Oriental character, and was fruitful in magic, and mysteries, and charms. The Jewish population was sufficiently numerous to have a synagogue, and St. Paul, as usual, appeared in it as a teacher.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> <span class="accented">- They came</span> for <span class="accented">he came</span>, A.V. and T.R.; he <span class="accented">left</span> for <span class="accented">left</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">They came to Ephesus</span>. "No voyage across the AEgean was more frequently made than that between Corinth and Ephesus. They were the capitals of the two flourishing and peaceful provinces of Achaia and Asia, and the two great mercantile towns on opposite sides of the sea" (Howson, vol. 1:454). The voyage would <span class="accented">take</span> from ten to fifteen days. <span class="cmt_word">Reasoned</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, as in <a href="/acts/17-2.htm">Acts 17:2, 17</a>; ver. 4, 19:8,9; 20:7, 9; 24:25. As regards the expression, <span class="cmt_word">left them there</span>, it probably arises from some actual detail which made it the natural one to use. If, for example, the synagogue was just outside the city, and Paul, parting with Aquila and Priscilla in the city, had gone off immediately to the synagogue, the phrase used would be the natural one; or the words, "he left them there," may be spoken with reference to the main narrative, which is momentarily interrupted by the mention of St. Paul's visit to the synagogue. Note the extreme importance of this brief visit to Ephesus, where the foundation of a vigorous and flourishing Church seems to have been laid. He who knows "the times and the seasons" sent St. Paul there now, though two years before he had forbidden him to go to Asia. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/18-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they reached</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#964;&#942;&#957;&#964;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Kat&#275;nt&#275;san)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2658.htm">Strong's 2658: </a> </span><span class="str2">From kata and a derivative of anti; to meet against, i.e. Arrive at.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Ephesus,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7964;&#966;&#949;&#963;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Epheson)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2181.htm">Strong's 2181: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ephesus, a coast city, capital of the Roman province Asia.
