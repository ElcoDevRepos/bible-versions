It was strategically located on the road from Jerusalem to the coastal city of Joppa (modern-day Jaffa). This proximity facilitated communication and travel between the two locations. Joppa was an important port city in ancient Israel, mentioned in the Old Testament as the place where Jonah attempted to flee from God's command (<a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>). The closeness of Lydda to Joppa highlights the interconnectedness of early Christian communities and their ability to quickly share news and resources.<p><b>the disciples, hearing that Peter was there</b><br>The term "disciples" refers to the followers of Jesus who were committed to spreading His teachings. By this time, Peter had become a prominent leader in the early Church, known for his bold preaching and miraculous works. His presence in Lydda was significant, as it indicates the spread of the Gospel beyond Jerusalem into the surrounding regions. The disciples' awareness of Peter's location suggests a network of communication among early Christians, emphasizing their unity and shared mission.<p><b>sent two men to urge him</b><br>Sending two men was a common practice in the ancient world to ensure the reliability of a message, as two witnesses could confirm the details of the request (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). This action reflects the urgency and importance of the situation in Joppa, as well as the respect and authority Peter held among the believers. The choice to send two men also underscores the communal nature of the early Church, where decisions and actions were often taken collectively.<p><b>&#8220;Come to us without delay.&#8221;</b><br>The urgency in the request indicates a critical situation in Joppa, later revealed to be the death of Tabitha (also known as Dorcas), a beloved member of the Christian community known for her good works and acts of charity (<a href="/acts/9-36.htm">Acts 9:36-37</a>). The plea for Peter to come "without delay" suggests the disciples' faith in his ability to perform miracles through the power of the Holy Spirit, as he had done previously (<a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6-8</a>). This phrase also highlights the early Church's reliance on apostolic authority and the belief in the continuation of Jesus' miraculous ministry through His apostles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lydda.htm">Lydda</a></b><br>A town in the region of Judea, known for its Jewish population and its proximity to Joppa.
