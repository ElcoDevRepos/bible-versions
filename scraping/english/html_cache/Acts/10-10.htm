Hunger is a common theme in the Bible, often used to signify deeper spiritual truths (e.g., <a href="/matthew/5-6.htm">Matthew 5:6</a>, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness"). It sets the stage for a divine revelation, as physical hunger often precedes spiritual insight.<p><b>and wanted something to eat</b><br>Peter's desire for food reflects the cultural practices of the time, where meals were central to daily life and community. In Jewish tradition, food laws were significant, and Peter's vision challenges these dietary restrictions, pointing to a new covenant where such laws are fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18-19</a>).<p><b>but while the meal was being prepared</b><br>This indicates a pause, a moment of waiting that often precedes divine intervention in Scripture. The preparation of a meal can symbolize the preparation of the heart for receiving God's message. It also reflects the hospitality customs of the time, where meals were prepared with care and shared communally.<p><b>he fell into a trance</b><br>The trance signifies a supernatural state where God communicates directly with an individual. This is a pivotal moment in Acts, as it leads to the revelation that the Gospel is for all people, not just Jews. Similar trances or visions are seen in the experiences of other biblical figures, such as Daniel (<a href="/daniel/10-9.htm">Daniel 10:9</a>) and Paul (<a href="/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17-18</a>), often marking significant turning points in God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles, a key leader in the early church, and the central figure in this passage.

It is obvious that it might in part be the natural consequence of the protracted fast, and the intense prayer, possibly also of exposure under such conditions to the noontide sun. The state was one in which the normal action of the senses was suspended, like that of Balaam in <a href="/numbers/24-4.htm" title="He has said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:">Numbers 24:4</a>, or that which St. Paul describes in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-3.htm" title="And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;)">2Corinthians 12:3</a>, "whether in the body or out of the body" he cannot tell, and, as such, it was, in this instance, made the channel for a revelation of the Divine Will conveyed in symbols which were adapted to the conditions out of which it rose.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="accented">- Hungry</span> for <span class="accented">very hungry</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">desired to eat</span> for <span class="accented">would have eaten</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Hungry</span>.
