In the early church, the coming of the Holy Spirit was often accompanied by visible signs, such as speaking in tongues or prophesying (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>, <a href="/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44-46</a>). The delay in the Holy Spirit's arrival here emphasizes the apostolic authority and unity of the church, as Peter and John were sent to Samaria to lay hands on the new believers (<a href="/acts/8-14.htm">Acts 8:14-17</a>). This event underscores the transitional nature of the book of Acts, where the gospel spreads from Jerusalem to Judea, Samaria, and the ends of the earth (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><b>they had simply been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</b><br>Baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus signifies identification with Christ and His authority. It reflects the early church's practice of baptizing new believers as a public declaration of faith and allegiance to Jesus as Lord. This baptism is distinct from the baptism of John, which was a baptism of repentance (<a href="/acts/19-4.htm">Acts 19:4</a>). The phrase highlights the importance of both water baptism and the reception of the Holy Spirit in the believer's life. It also connects to the Great Commission, where Jesus instructed His disciples to baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>), showing the Trinitarian nature of Christian baptism.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philip_the_evangelist.htm">Philip the Evangelist</a></b><br>One of the seven deacons chosen in <a href="/bsb/acts/6.htm">Acts 6</a>, Philip was instrumental in spreading the Gospel to Samaria, where he preached and baptized new believers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_samaritans.htm">The Samaritans</a></b><br>The people of Samaria who received the word of God and were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus but had not yet received the Holy Spirit.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter_and_john.htm">Peter and John</a></b><br>Apostles sent from Jerusalem to Samaria to pray for the new believers so that they might receive the Holy Spirit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, whose coming upon the believers in Samaria was a significant event, marking the inclusion of Samaritans into the early Christian community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>A region with historical tensions between Jews and Samaritans, highlighting the breaking of cultural barriers through the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit is essential for the full experience of Christian life and empowerment for service.

Here, that promise had not yet been fulfilled for these new converts.<p>&#8226; The pause underscores God&#8217;s sovereign timing. The same Spirit fell immediately at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>), while Cornelius&#8217;s household received Him mid-sermon (<a href="/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44-46</a>). In Samaria, however, God waited until Peter and John arrived, highlighting unity between Jewish and Samaritan believers and confirming apostolic oversight (<a href="/acts/8-14.htm">Acts 8:14-17</a>).<p>&#8226; This delay does not imply a second-class salvation; rather, it served a specific purpose in redemptive history&#8212;visibly linking Samaritan believers with Jerusalem through the apostles&#8217; hands (cf. <a href="/acts/11-15.htm">Acts 11:15-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they had simply been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus</b><p>&#8226; Water baptism testified to their faith and allegiance: &#8220;Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>). The Samaritans had obeyed this command.<p>&#8226; Baptism &#8220;into the name&#8221; emphasizes identification with Christ&#8217;s person and authority (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). It sealed their public confession but, in this unique moment, preceded the Spirit&#8217;s visible arrival.<p>&#8226; The pattern elsewhere&#8212;believe, receive the Spirit, be baptized&#8212;sometimes varies (<a href="/acts/10-47.htm">Acts 10:47-48</a>; 19:5-6). The New Testament records these variations not to confuse but to show that salvation is by faith in Christ, while the timing of external manifestations rests with God.<p>&#8226; By waiting to pour out the Spirit until Peter and John laid hands on them, the Lord confirmed that Samaritan believers stood on equal footing with Jewish believers, addressing centuries of hostility (<a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9</a>) and fulfilling Jesus&#8217; mandate that the gospel move from Jerusalem to &#8220;Samaria&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/8-16.htm">Acts 8:16</a> reveals a purposeful delay between the Samaritans&#8217; water baptism and their reception of the Holy Spirit. God withheld the visible descent of the Spirit until apostles from Jerusalem could witness and affirm it, forging unity in the early church and demonstrating that salvation in Christ transcends ethnic and cultural barriers. The verse reminds us that while water baptism testifies to faith, the empowering presence of the Spirit is God&#8217;s gracious gift, given in His perfect timing to all who believe in the Lord Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">As yet he was fallen upon none of them.</span>--The same verb is used of the gift of the Spirit in <a href="/acts/10-44.htm" title="While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.">Acts 10:44</a>; <a href="/acts/11-15.htm" title="And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.">Acts 11:15</a>, and of Peter's trance in <a href="/acts/10-10.htm" title="And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,">Acts 10:10</a>.

The use of the prepositions in the New Testament is much influenced by the Hebrew, through the language of the LXX.

But as baptism was preceded by a confession of faith similar to that in our own Baptismal Service, so it was a true description to speak of baptism as being in the Name of Jesus Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/8-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
