Listening to Paul indicates an openness to the gospel message, which Paul was preaching. The act of listening is significant in biblical narratives, often preceding faith and healing (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>). Lystra was a pagan city, and the presence of Paul and Barnabas there highlights the spread of Christianity beyond Jewish communities.<p><b>who looked intently at him</b><br>Paul's intense gaze suggests discernment and spiritual insight. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where spiritual leaders perceive deeper truths (<a href="/acts/3-4.htm">Acts 3:4</a>). The ability to discern faith or spiritual readiness is a gift of the Holy Spirit, as seen in other biblical accounts where Jesus or the apostles recognize faith in individuals (<a href="/mark/5-30.htm">Mark 5:30-34</a>).<p><b>and saw that he had faith to be healed</b><br>Faith is a recurring theme in the New Testament as a prerequisite for healing (<a href="/matthew/9-22.htm">Matthew 9:22</a>). The man's faith, though not verbally expressed, is evident to Paul, indicating that faith can be perceived through spiritual insight. This aligns with the biblical principle that faith, even as small as a mustard seed, can lead to miraculous outcomes (<a href="/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>). The healing that follows is a testament to the power of faith and the authority given to the apostles to perform signs and wonders in Jesus' name (<a href="/acts/2-43.htm">Acts 2:43</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>An apostle and missionary, Paul is the central figure in this passage.

There is great resemblance between this miracle of healing, and that of the lame man laid at the gate of the temple, who was healed by Peter (<a href="/acts/3-2.htm">Acts 3:2-10</a>), and, not unnaturally, considerable identity of expression in the narratives. Both men were lame from their birth; the apostles fastened their eyes upon both; both, when healed, leaped and walked; and in both cases the miracle 'had a great effect upon the multitudes who beheld it. Zeller (vol. it. p. 6), with characteristic recklessness, infers that "this narrative was, merely in imitation of the early miraculous story of Peter;" and so relegates both it and the subsequent narrative to the regions of fable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/14-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">This [man]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(houtos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">was listening to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7972;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;kousen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
