His clinging signifies gratitude and amazement at his newfound ability to walk. This act of clinging also symbolizes the dependence of new believers on the apostles for spiritual guidance. The healing is a testament to the power of Jesus' name, as Peter had invoked it for the miracle. This event echoes the miracles of Jesus, who often healed the lame, demonstrating the continuity of His work through the apostles.<p><b>all the people were astonished</b><br>The crowd's astonishment reflects the miraculous nature of the healing. In a culture where physical ailments were often seen as a result of sin or divine displeasure, such a transformation would have been shocking. The reaction of the people is reminiscent of the amazement often shown by crowds during Jesus' ministry, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/9-33.htm">Matthew 9:33</a>. This astonishment sets the stage for Peter's subsequent sermon, where he explains the source of their power and calls the people to repentance.<p><b>and ran to them</b><br>The urgency with which the people ran to Peter and John indicates their eagerness to witness the miracle and understand its significance. This eagerness is a common response to divine acts, as seen in other biblical accounts where crowds gather quickly to witness or hear about miraculous events, such as in <a href="/mark/6-33.htm">Mark 6:33</a>. The gathering of the crowd provides Peter with an opportunity to preach the gospel, highlighting the role of miracles in drawing people to hear the message of Christ.<p><b>in the walkway called Solomon&#8217;s Colonnade</b><br>Solomon's Colonnade, also known as Solomon's Porch, was a covered area on the eastern side of the Temple Mount.

It consisted, in the Herodian Temple, of a double row of Corinthian columns, about thirty-seven feet high, and received its name as having been in part constructed, when the Temple was rebuilt by Zerubbabel, with the fragments of the older edifice. The people tried to persuade Herod Agrippa the First to pull it down and rebuild it, but he shrank from the risk and cost of such an undertaking (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 9, ? 7). It was, like the porticos in all Greek cities, a favourite place of resort, especially as facing the morning sun in winter. (See Note on <a href="/john/10-23.htm" title="And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.">John 10:23</a>.) The memory of what had then been the result of their Master's teaching must have been fresh in the minds of the two disciples. Then the people had complained of being kept in suspense as to whether Jesus claimed to be the Christ, and, when He spoke of being One with the Father, had taken up stones to stone Him (<a href="/context/john/10-31.htm" title="Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.">John 10:31-33</a>).
