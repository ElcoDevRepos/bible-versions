This location was not ideal for wintering due to its exposure to harsh winter winds and lack of adequate facilities. In the ancient world, harbors needed to provide shelter from storms and have resources for ships and crews to survive the winter months. The decision to move from Fair Havens reflects the practical concerns of ancient maritime travel.<p><b>the majority decided to sail on</b><br>This decision was made by the ship's crew and passengers, including the centurion Julius, who was in charge of Paul and other prisoners. The majority's decision highlights the democratic process often used in ancient seafaring, where the opinions of experienced sailors and the ship's owner would weigh heavily. It also reflects human nature's tendency to follow the majority, even when it might not be the wisest choice, as Paul had earlier advised against continuing the journey (<a href="/acts/27-10.htm">Acts 27:10</a>).<p><b>hoping that somehow they could reach Phoenix to winter there</b><br>Phoenix, also known as Phenice, was considered a more suitable harbor for wintering. The phrase "hoping that somehow" indicates uncertainty and the precarious nature of sea travel. This reflects the human tendency to rely on hope and chance when making decisions, rather than divine guidance, which Paul represented. The decision to aim for Phoenix shows the crew's desire for a safer and more comfortable location, despite the risks involved in continuing the journey.<p><b>Phoenix was a harbor in Crete</b><br>Crete is a significant island in the Mediterranean Sea, known for its strategic location and historical importance. In the context of Acts, Crete was a place where Paul had previously established churches, as mentioned in <a href="/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a>. The island's geography made it a common stop for ships traveling between Asia, Africa, and Europe.<p><b>facing both southwest and northwest</b><br>This description of Phoenix's orientation indicates its suitability as a winter harbor. A harbor facing both southwest and northwest would be protected from the prevailing northeasterly winds of winter, providing a safer anchorage for ships. The geographical detail underscores the practical considerations of ancient navigation and the importance of natural features in determining safe harbors.

The harbour so described has been identified with the modern <span class= "ital">Lutro, </span>on the east of the promontory of <span class= "ital">Kavo Muros, </span>which looks eastward, and so corresponds to the interpretation just given of the words that describe it. The harbour is named by Ptolemy (iii. 17) as Phoenikous, and a city named Phoenix lay a few miles inland. It is still used as a harbour by Greek pirates, and was marked as such in the French admiralty charts of 1738; but, owing to the silting up of the sand, has become unsuitable for larger vessels. An inscription of the time of Nerva, of the nature of a votive tablet to Jupiter and Serapis, found near the spot, records the fact that it was erected by Epictetus, the <span class= "ital">tabularius, </span>or agent, of the fleet to which the ship belonged, with the assistance of Dionysius of Alexandria, the pilot (the same word as that which St. Luke uses) of a ship which had as its sign (the same word as in <a href="/acts/28-4.htm" title="And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffers not to live.">Acts 28:4</a>) the Isopharia. It is a natural inference from this that the Alexandrian ship (we note the Egyptian element in the dedication to Serapis, and possibly in the connection of the sign with the Pharos, or lighthouse of Alexandria) had anchored, and possibly wintered, at Ph?nice, and that the tablet was a thank-offering for its preservation.

It is identified with almost certainty with the modern <span class="accented">Lutro</span> or <span class="accented">Loutro</span>, which is both "an admirable harbor," situated exactly where Phoenice ought to be, and further by its proximity to a village called <span class="accented">Aradhene</span>, and another called <span class="accented">Anopolis</span>, shown to be the same as. Phoenix, or Phenice, which is described m ancient writers (Hierocles and Stephanus of Byzantium) as identical with or close to <span class="accented">Aradhena</span> and <span class="accented">Anopolls</span> (the upper city). <span class="cmt_word">Winter</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, so too <a href="/acts/28-11.htm">Acts 28:11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-6.htm">1 Corinthians 16:6</a>; <a href="/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in this verse. It is found also in classical writers. <span class="cmt_word">Looking north-east and south-east.</span> The margin of the R.V. has "Greek, <span class="accented">down the southwest wind, and down the north-west."</span> This phrase has caused considerable perplexity to commentators. To say, as a recommendation of a harbor for winter quarters, that it lies or looks toward the south-west and north-west, and consequently is exposed to the most furious winter storms, is obviously impossible. If Phoenix was open to the south-west and the north-west, it would not be as commodius a place to winter in as Fair Havens was which was sheltered by Cape Matala. Two methods, therefore, have been adopted of explaining the phrase so as to make it give a reasonable sense. One, that adopted by Dean Howson and Bishop Wordsworth, viz. that it looks southwest and north-west, from the point of view of the sailor, or any one approaching it from the sea, the object upon which it looks being the land which locks it in and shelters it. The other is that supported by Alford, and adopted by the R.V., and rests upon the observation that <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> are not points or' the compass, but the names of the south-west and north-west winds, and that to look down (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>) a wind is the same as looking down a stream. If the harbour looks down the south-west wind it looks toward the north-east, and if it looks down the north-west wind it looks toward the southeast. Its open side would be from northeast to south-east, it would be entirely sheltered on the south-west and north-west side. This is the explanation adopted also by Dean Plumptre. <span class="accented">The south-west wind</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;</span>, only here in the New Testament, but frequent in classical Greek and in the LXX.
