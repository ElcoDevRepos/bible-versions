In biblical times, a name was more than a label; it represented the essence and authority of a person. Faith in Jesus' name implies trust in His divine power and identity as the Messiah. This reflects the early church's understanding of Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who brings healing and redemption.<p><b>this man whom you see and know has been made strong</b><br>The man referred to is the lame beggar healed at the temple gate called Beautiful (<a href="/acts/3-2.htm">Acts 3:2</a>). His healing was a public event, witnessed by many who frequented the temple, thus providing undeniable evidence of the miracle. This act of healing serves as a sign of the in-breaking of God's kingdom through the apostles' ministry, echoing Jesus' own healing miracles and fulfilling His promise that His followers would do greater works (<a href="/john/14-12.htm">John 14:12</a>).<p><b>It is Jesus&#8217; name and the faith that comes through Him</b><br>This phrase underscores that the source of the healing is not the apostles themselves but Jesus. The faith that comes through Him suggests that even the ability to believe is a gift from God, aligning with <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which teaches that faith is a gift of grace. This highlights the early church's reliance on divine empowerment rather than human ability.<p><b>that has given him this complete healing in your presence</b><br>The term "complete healing" indicates not just physical restoration but also a holistic renewal, reflecting the biblical concept of shalom, or peace, which encompasses well-being in all aspects of life. The public nature of the healing serves as a testimony to the power of Jesus and the truth of the apostles' message, reinforcing the credibility of their witness and the transformative impact of the gospel.

Some (see Alford, 1:1) compare <a href="/1_peter/1-21.htm">1 Peter 1:21</a>, and make God the object of the faith of his witnesses, Peter and John. Others (Meyer) understand that the faith in the Name of Christ was wrought in Peter and John by or through Christ's ministry and resurrection. But it is much more consonant with other passages (<a href="/acts/14-9.htm">Acts 14:9</a>; <a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31</a>, etc.; <a href="/matthew/15-28.htm">Matthew 15:28</a>, etc.) to understand the faith to be that of the man who was healed; and then the phrase, "which is through him," will denote naturally that it was through Jesus Christ that the man's faith brought him into contact, so to speak, with God who healed him. In the same spirit we read that the lame man "praised God" (vers. 8, 9) for the cure effected through the Name of Jesus Christ; and Peter says (ver. 15), "Whom God raised from the <span class="accented">dead."</span> The interpretation of the phrase <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> depends upon whether we supply an active or a passive word.
