His Greek name suggests he was a Hellenistic Jew, which means he was a Jew who spoke Greek and was likely influenced by Greek culture. This background is significant as it highlights the diversity within the early Christian community and the church's efforts to address the needs of all its members.<p><b>who was full of grace and power</b><br>The phrase "full of grace and power" indicates that Stephen was endowed with divine favor and spiritual strength. Grace here refers to the unmerited favor of God, which empowered Stephen to carry out his ministry effectively. The power mentioned is likely the power of the Holy Spirit, which was a common theme in Acts, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> where Jesus promises the disciples they will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon them.<p><b>was performing great wonders and signs</b><br>Stephen's ability to perform wonders and signs is reminiscent of the apostles' ministry, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-43.htm">Acts 2:43 and 5</a>:12. These miraculous acts served as divine validation of his message and ministry, demonstrating that God was working through him. This aligns with the biblical pattern where signs and wonders often accompany the proclamation of the Gospel to confirm its truth (<a href="/mark/16-20.htm">Mark 16:20</a>).<p><b>among the people</b><br>The phrase "among the people" suggests that Stephen's ministry was public and accessible, taking place within the community. This public nature of his ministry would have made him a prominent figure in the early church and a target for opposition, as seen in the subsequent verses where he faces resistance from certain Jewish groups. His ministry among the people reflects the early church's mission to reach out and engage with the broader society.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>One of the seven deacons chosen by the early church to serve and manage the distribution of food to widows.
