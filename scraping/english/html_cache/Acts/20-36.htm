Paul had been in Ephesus for over two years, teaching and establishing the church. His speech, found in <a href="/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17-35</a>, is a heartfelt exhortation and warning to the leaders of the church. It reflects his deep concern for the spiritual well-being of the believers and his awareness of the challenges they would face. This moment marks a transition in Paul's ministry as he prepares to journey to Jerusalem, aware of the hardships that await him.<p><b>he knelt down</b><br>Kneeling in prayer is a posture of humility and reverence, often associated with earnest supplication and worship. In the cultural context of the time, kneeling was a common posture for prayer, signifying submission to God. This act demonstrates Paul's humility and his dependence on God, setting an example for the Ephesian elders. It also reflects the seriousness of the moment, as Paul entrusts the church to God's care.<p><b>with all of them</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the communal aspect of the early church. Paul is not alone; he is surrounded by the elders of the Ephesian church, highlighting the importance of fellowship and unity among believers. The presence of the elders signifies their role as shepherds of the flock, responsible for guiding and protecting the church in Paul's absence. This moment underscores the relational nature of ministry and the deep bonds formed within the body of Christ.<p><b>and prayed</b><br>Prayer is a central theme in the Book of Acts, illustrating the early church's reliance on God for guidance, strength, and protection. Paul's prayer with the Ephesian elders is a powerful reminder of the importance of seeking God's will and blessing in all aspects of life and ministry. This act of prayer also connects to other scriptural instances where prayer precedes significant events or decisions, such as Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-36.htm">Matthew 26:36-46</a>) or the early church praying for Peter's release from prison (<a href="/acts/12-5.htm">Acts 12:5</a>). It highlights the necessity of prayer as a means of aligning with God's purposes and receiving His grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is the central figure in this passage.

Jesus did the same in Gethsemane (<a href="/luke/22-41.htm">Luke 22:41</a>). Stephen knelt while forgiving his killers (<a href="/acts/7-60.htm">Acts 7:60</a>), and Paul later writes, &#8220;I bow my knees before the Father&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/3-14.htm">Ephesians 3:14</a>).<p>- Scripture never binds believers to one posture, yet it repeatedly associates kneeling with earnest, reverent prayer (<a href="/psalms/95-6.htm">Psalm 95:6</a>; <a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>).<p>- Paul, a recognized apostle, models leadership that bows&#8212;reminding us that spiritual authority expresses itself in submission to God, not domination over people (<a href="/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with all of them</b><p>- The &#8220;them&#8221; are the Ephesian elders who met Paul at Miletus (<a href="/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17</a>).

As Jesus promised, &#8220;For where two or three gather in My name, there am I with them&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and prayed</b><p>- The verse ends not with a farewell party but with direct communion with God, revealing that real ministry concludes&#8212;and begins&#8212;in prayer.<p>- Paul&#8217;s letters echo this priority: &#8220;Pray without ceasing&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>); &#8220;Do not be anxious about anything, but&#8230;present your requests to God&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>); &#8220;The prayer of a righteous man has great power&#8221; (<a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>).<p>- By praying rather than strategizing, Paul entrusts future events to God&#8217;s providence, confident that &#8220;He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/20-36.htm">Acts 20:36</a> captures the moment Paul finishes his farewell counsel, physically lowers himself, gathers the elders around, and together they seek the Father&#8217;s help.
