This promise is rooted in the Old Testament, where God often made covenants with His people, such as the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>) that included blessings for future generations. The inclusion of "your children" emphasizes the continuity of God's covenantal faithfulness across generations, reflecting the Jewish understanding of communal and familial blessings.<p><b>and to all who are far off</b><br>This phrase expands the scope of the promise beyond the immediate Jewish audience to include Gentiles and those geographically distant from Jerusalem. It echoes the prophetic vision of <a href="/isaiah/57-19.htm">Isaiah 57:19</a>, which speaks of peace to those "far and near." This inclusion signifies the universal nature of the Gospel, fulfilling Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be witnesses "to the ends of the earth." It also prefigures the later missionary journeys of Paul, who would bring the Gospel to the Gentiles.<p><b>to all whom the Lord our God will call to Himself.</b><br>This highlights the divine initiative in salvation, underscoring that it is God who calls individuals to Himself. It aligns with the doctrine of election, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a> and <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>, where God predestines and calls His people. The phrase also reflects the fulfillment of <a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>, quoted earlier in <a href="/acts/2-21.htm">Acts 2:21</a>, which states that "everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."

It is the essence of St. Peter's appeal that all to whom he speaks can claim the promise as fully as himself. The phrase "those that are afar off," was probably wide enough to cover both the Jews of the Dispersion, to whom the Apostle afterwards wrote (<a href="/context/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1Peter 1:1-2</a>), and the heathen nations among whom they lived. The use of the phrase in <a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm" title="But now in Christ Jesus you who sometimes were far off are made near by the blood of Christ.">Ephesians 2:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm" title="And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were near.">Ephesians 2:17</a>, inclines rather to the latter meaning.<p><span class= "bld">Even as many as the Lord our God shall call.</span>--There seems, at first sight, a limitation on the universality of the previous words. And in some sense there is; but it is not more than is involved in the fact that spiritual knowledge and culture are not bestowed on all nations and ages alike. Wherever there is a difference, some possessing a higher knowledge and greater power than others, the Apostle could only see, not chance, or evolution, but the working of a divine purpose, calling some to special privileges, and yet dealing equitably with all.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> <span class="accented">- To you is the promise</span> for <span class="accented">the promise is unto you</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">shall call unto him</span> for <span class="accented">shall call<span class="cmt_word">.</span> To you is the promise</span> (see <a href="/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4</a>; <a href="/acts/2-33.htm">Acts 2:33</a>).
