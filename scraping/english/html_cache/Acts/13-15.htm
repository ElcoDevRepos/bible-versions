This practice dates back to the time of Ezra and Nehemiah, emphasizing the importance of Scripture in Jewish worship. The Law refers to the first five books of the Bible, traditionally attributed to Moses, while the Prophets include historical and prophetic books. This reading set the stage for teaching and exhortation, as seen in <a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-21</a> when Jesus reads from Isaiah in the synagogue.<p><b>the synagogue leaders sent word to them</b><br>The synagogue leaders, or rulers, were responsible for the order of service and maintaining the synagogue. They were respected figures within the Jewish community. In this context, they recognized Paul and Barnabas as visiting teachers, possibly due to their attire or reputation. This invitation reflects the Jewish custom of allowing visiting teachers to speak, which provided Paul and Barnabas an opportunity to share the gospel.<p><b>Brothers, if you have a word of encouragement for the people, please speak.</b><br>The term "Brothers" indicates a sense of kinship and respect, acknowledging Paul and Barnabas as fellow Jews. A "word of encouragement" was a common request for teaching or exhortation, often based on the Scripture reading. This phrase shows the openness of the synagogue leaders to hear new interpretations or teachings, which Paul uses to introduce the message of Jesus Christ. This moment parallels other instances in Acts where Paul uses the synagogue as a platform to preach, such as in <a href="/acts/17-2.htm">Acts 17:2-3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/synagogue_leaders.htm">Synagogue Leaders</a></b><br>These were the officials responsible for the order and conduct of the synagogue service.

Then came the reading of the Law in Hebrew by the reader, and the interpretation by the interpreter, who, outside of Judaea, generally used the version of the LXX. This reading, or lesson, was called the <span class="accented">Parashah.</span> Next came the reading and interpreting of the prophets, called the <span class="accented">Haphtorah</span>, either by the regular reader or by any one invited by the ruler of the synagogue (<a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16, 17</a>). Then came the <span class="accented">Midrash</span>, the exposition or sermon, which Paul undertook at the invitation of the ruler of the synagogue. Our Lord at Nazareth seems to have delivered the <span class="accented">Midrash</span> sitting (<a href="/luke/4-20.htm">Luke 4:20</a>); here St. Paul stands (ver. 16). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/13-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(meta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3326.htm">Strong's 3326: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) gen: with, in company with, (b) acc: (1) behind, beyond, after, of place, (2) after, of time, with nouns, neut. of adjectives. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
