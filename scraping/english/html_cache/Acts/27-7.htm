The slow progress suggests adverse weather conditions, likely due to contrary winds, which were common in the Mediterranean during certain seasons. This reflects the historical reality of ancient sea travel, where voyages were heavily dependent on wind patterns. The delay also highlights the perseverance and patience required in the face of obstacles, a theme often seen in Paul's missionary journeys.<p><b>we arrived off Cnidus</b><br>Cnidus was an ancient city located on the southwestern coast of modern-day Turkey. It was a significant maritime hub in the Roman Empire, known for its strategic location and bustling port. The mention of Cnidus situates the narrative geographically, providing a real-world anchor for the events described. This location was a critical juncture for ships traveling from the eastern Mediterranean to the western regions, emphasizing the importance of this leg of the journey.<p><b>When the wind impeded us</b><br>The wind's opposition is a recurring theme in <a href="/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>, symbolizing the spiritual and physical challenges faced by Paul. In a broader biblical context, wind often represents the unseen forces that can either aid or hinder human endeavors. This phrase underscores the unpredictability of life and the need for reliance on God's providence, as seen in other scriptural accounts where natural elements play a significant role, such as Jesus calming the storm (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>).<p><b>we sailed to the lee of Crete</b><br>Sailing to the lee of Crete indicates a strategic decision to seek shelter from the adverse winds. Crete, an island in the Mediterranean, provided a natural barrier against the elements. This action reflects the practical wisdom and adaptability required in navigating life's challenges. Crete's mention also connects to other biblical references, such as <a href="/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a>, where Paul addresses the church in Crete, highlighting the island's significance in early Christian history.<p><b>opposite Salmone</b><br>Salmone was a promontory on the eastern tip of Crete, known for its rugged coastline. The specific mention of Salmone provides a precise geographical marker, enhancing the historical accuracy of the account. This detail illustrates the meticulous nature of Luke's narrative in Acts, offering insights into the navigational practices of the time. The journey past Salmone signifies a turning point, as the ship moves from open sea to a more sheltered route, symbolizing hope and divine guidance amidst adversity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who is being transported to Rome as a prisoner.

Here, as the coast trends away to the north, and they had no longer the shelter of the land, they were exposed to the full force of the Etesian winds. It was useless to attempt to make head against these, and their only alternative was to steer southward, so as to get, if possible, under the lee of the coast of Crete, the modern <span class= "ital">Candia.</span> They succeeded in getting as far as Cape Salmone, the eastern point of the island, and finding here some shelter, went on their way westward under the lee of the coast.

When they had with great difficulty got as far as over against Cnidus, on the coast of Carla, the north wind which caught them made it impossible to go further north.
