Stoning was a common form of capital punishment in ancient Jewish law for certain offenses, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/17-7.htm">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>. The act of stoning was typically carried out by the community, symbolizing collective judgment. Stephen's stoning was instigated by the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council, after he was accused of blasphemy. This reflects the intense opposition faced by early Christians from Jewish authorities. The stoning took place outside the city, as was customary, to avoid defiling the city with bloodshed.<p><b>Stephen appealed</b><br>Stephen's appeal during his execution highlights his role as a faithful witness to Christ, even unto death. His appeal is a direct communication with Jesus, indicating his deep faith and the early Christian belief in Jesus' divine authority. Stephen's actions mirror those of Jesus, who also prayed for his persecutors during his crucifixion (<a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>). This parallel underscores Stephen's Christ-like character and the transformative power of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers.<p><b>&#8220;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.&#8221;</b><br>Stephen's invocation of Jesus as "Lord" affirms the early Christian belief in the divinity of Christ. By entrusting his spirit to Jesus, Stephen echoes the words of Jesus on the cross, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit" (<a href="/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>), demonstrating his unwavering faith and hope in the resurrection. This phrase also reflects the Christian understanding of life after death and the assurance of being in the presence of the Lord. Stephen's martyrdom is seen as a powerful testimony to the truth of the Gospel and the hope of eternal life, serving as an inspiration for future generations of believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>A deacon in the early church, known for his faith and filled with the Holy Spirit.

As Paul later notes, &#8220;Everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Even under lethal assault, Stephen&#8217;s composure shows the Spirit&#8217;s power (<a href="/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5, 10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Stephen appealed</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Appealed&#8221; signals prayer, not panic.

The verse models unshakable faith, teaches that believers may call directly on Christ, and affirms immediate, conscious life with Him after death&#8212;truths that comfort and embolden every follower today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(59) <span class= "bld">Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.</span>--The words are memorable as an instance of direct prayer addressed, to use the words of Pliny in reporting what he had learned of the worship of Christians, "to Christ as God" (<span class= "ital">Epist</span> x. 97). Stephen could not think of Him whom he saw at the right hand of God, but as of One sharing the glory of the Father, hearing and answering prayer. And in the prayer itself we trace an echo of words of which Stephen may well have heard. The Son commended His Spirit to the Father (<a href="/luke/23-46.htm" title="And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.">Luke 23:46</a>); the disciple, in his turn, commends his spirit to the Son. The word "God," in the sentence "calling upon God," it should be noted, is, as the italics show, an insertion to complete the sense.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 59.</span> - The <span class="accented">Lord</span> (in italics) for <span class="accented">God</span> (in italics), A.V. The A.V. is certainly not justified by the context, because the words which follow, "Lord Jesus," show to whom the invocation was made, even to him whom he saw standing at the right hand of God. At the same time, the request, <span class="cmt_word">Receive my spirit</span>, was a striking acknowledgment of the divinity of Christ. Only he who gave the spirit could receive it back again, and keep it safe unto the resurrection.
