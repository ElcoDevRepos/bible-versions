Nighttime in biblical narratives often symbolizes a period of trial or testing, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>, where Nicodemus visits Jesus at night. The night can also represent a time when God works in unexpected ways, as in the Exodus when the Israelites were led out of Egypt at night (<a href="/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29-31</a>).<p><b>an angel of the Lord</b><br>Angels are messengers of God, often appearing in critical moments to deliver divine instructions or aid. In the Old Testament, angels frequently appear to guide or protect God's people, such as in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a> with Lot or in <a href="/daniel/6.htm">Daniel 6</a> with Daniel in the lions' den. The presence of an angel here underscores the divine intervention and approval of the apostles' mission.<p><b>opened the doors of the jail</b><br>This miraculous act demonstrates God's power over human institutions and His ability to liberate His servants. It echoes other biblical accounts of divine deliverance, such as Peter's later escape from prison in <a href="/acts/12-6.htm">Acts 12:6-10</a>. The opening of the jail doors symbolizes the breaking of spiritual and physical barriers, reminiscent of Jesus' resurrection, which opened the way to eternal life.<p><b>and brought them out</b><br>The act of bringing the apostles out signifies not only physical liberation but also a call to continue their mission. This mirrors the Exodus narrative, where God brought the Israelites out of Egypt to serve Him. It also reflects the theme of redemption and deliverance found throughout Scripture, pointing to Christ's ultimate deliverance of humanity from sin.<p><b>saying,</b><br>The angel's forthcoming message is crucial, as it provides divine guidance and reassurance. In biblical accounts, angelic messages often carry significant instructions or revelations, as seen in <a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26-38</a> with the Annunciation to Mary. This emphasizes the importance of listening to and obeying God's directives, as they lead to the fulfillment of His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The primary subjects of this passage, the apostles were imprisoned for preaching the Gospel and performing miracles in Jesus' name.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/angel_of_the_lord.htm">Angel of the Lord</a></b><br>A divine messenger sent by God to intervene in the apostles' imprisonment, demonstrating God's power and authority over earthly authorities.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jail.htm">The Jail</a></b><br>The physical location where the apostles were held, representing the opposition and persecution faced by early Christians.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanhedrin.htm">The Sanhedrin</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are the Jewish council responsible for the apostles' imprisonment, highlighting the religious opposition to the early Church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events took place, serving as the center of early Christian activity and the birthplace of the Church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_intervention.htm">Divine Intervention</a></b><br>God is sovereign and can intervene in human affairs, even in seemingly impossible situations.

Like Israel exiting Egypt to serve the Lord (<a href="/exodus/7-16.htm">Exodus 7:16</a>), the apostles exit prison to continue proclaiming Christ (<a href="/acts/5-20.htm">Acts 5:20</a>).<p>&#8226; It also reassures believers today that obedience may bring opposition, yet God Himself oversees the outcome (<a href="/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying,</b><p>&#8226; The angel&#8217;s forthcoming instruction (verse 20) shows that divine miracles always pair with divine mandates.

Those who do not accept that view of it, and yet wish to maintain the general historical character of the narrative, are driven to the hypothesis that the "angel" was some jealous and courageous disciple; and that the Apostle, in the darkness of the night and the excitement of his liberation, ascribed his rescue to the intervention of an angel. <a href="/acts/12-7.htm" title="And, behold, the angel of the Lord came on him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.">Acts 12:7</a> may be noted as another instance of a like interposition. It has sometimes been urged, with something of a sneer, what was the use of such a deliverance as this, when the Apostles were again arrested on the very next day. The answer to such a question is not far to seek. (1) The marvellous deliverance was a sign, not without its influence on the subsequent decision of the Council, and on the courage of the two Apostles. (2) It was no small boon for them to be delivered even for a few hours from the vile companionship to which they had been condemned.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> <span class="accented">- An angel</span> for <span class="accented">the angel</span>, A.V.; out for <span class="accented">forth</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">An angel</span>, etc. The phrase is a translation of the Old Testament phrase <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>.
