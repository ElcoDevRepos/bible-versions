His transformation from a persecutor of Christians to an apostle is a pivotal moment in Christian history, illustrating the power of divine intervention.<p><b>for he is praying.</b><br>Saul's prayer signifies his repentance and spiritual awakening following his encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus. Prayer is a recurring theme in Acts, often associated with divine guidance and revelation (<a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14, 4</a>:31).

God rarely adjusts His plan to our comfort; instead, He calls us into His.<p>&#8226; By standing, Ananias aligns himself physically and spiritually with God&#8217;s purpose, mirroring Saul&#8217;s own soon-to-come rising for baptism (<a href="/acts/9-18.htm">Acts 9:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street</b><p>&#8220;Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street...&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The Lord gives exact directions&#8212;city, street, homeowner.

The Lord is about to harness that sharp mind for gospel proclamation (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>; 26:16-18).<p>&#8226; Ananias must approach Saul, the notorious persecutor (<a href="/galatians/1-13.htm">Galatians 1:13</a>).

Somewhat curiously, the house shown by guides as that of Judas is not in it.

We can but think of the contrast between the present and the recent past--between the threatening and slaughter which the persecutor breathed out as he drew near to Damascus, and the prayer of humble penitence in which he was now living. Estimating that prayer by that which came as the answer to it, we may think of it as including pardon for the past, light and wisdom for the future, strength to do the work to which he was now called, intercession for those whom he had before persecuted unto the death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="accented">- To</span> for <span class="accented">into</span>, A.V.<span class="accented">, named</span> for <span class="accented">called</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a man of Tarsus</span> for <span class="accented">of Tarsus</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The street</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;</span>, usually the narrower lanes in a town as distinguished from the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, or wide streets.

It still exists, and is called the Sultany Street; but instead of being the wide and splendid street it was in the apostolic age, a hundred feet wide, with colonnades separating the two footways on the side from the central read, and adorned with a triumphal arch, it is contracted into a narrow mean passage (see Lewin, vol. 1. p. 69). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/9-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Get up!&#8221;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8048;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Anastas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_450.htm">Strong's 450: </a> </span><span class="str2">To raise up, set up; I rise from among (the) dead; I arise, appear.
