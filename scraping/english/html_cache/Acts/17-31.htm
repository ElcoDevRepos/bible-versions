The concept of a divinely appointed day is consistent with biblical themes of God's control over history (<a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>). It reflects the eschatological expectation found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/daniel/12.htm">Daniel 12:1-2</a> and <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>, where a future day of judgment is anticipated.<p><b>when He will judge the world with justice</b><br>The judgment of the world is a central theme in both the Old and New Testaments. This judgment is characterized by divine justice, as seen in <a href="/psalms/9-8.htm">Psalm 9:8</a> and <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>. The idea of God as a just judge is foundational, ensuring that His judgments are righteous and fair (<a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5-6</a>). This reflects the biblical understanding of God's holiness and righteousness.<p><b>by the Man He has appointed</b><br>This refers to Jesus Christ, whom God has designated as the judge. The appointment of Jesus is affirmed in <a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22-27</a>, where Jesus is given authority to execute judgment. This highlights the unique role of Christ in God's redemptive plan, fulfilling messianic prophecies such as those in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a>.<p><b>He has given proof of this to everyone</b><br>The proof mentioned here is the resurrection of Jesus, which serves as a divine validation of His authority and mission. The resurrection is a cornerstone of Christian faith, as emphasized in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14-17</a>. It provides assurance of the future resurrection and judgment, as well as the truth of Jesus' claims.<p><b>by raising Him from the dead.</b><br>The resurrection is the ultimate demonstration of God's power and the pivotal event in Christian theology. It confirms Jesus' victory over sin and death (<a href="/romans/6-9.htm">Romans 6:9-10</a>) and is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-11</a>. The resurrection is also a type of the believer's future resurrection, as described in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a> and <a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20-21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who has set a day for judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_he_has_appointed.htm">The Man He has appointed</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, whom God has chosen to execute judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Represents all of humanity that will be judged.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resurrection.htm">The Resurrection</a></b><br>The event that serves as proof of Jesus' authority and divinity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/athens.htm">Athens</a></b><br>The city where Paul delivered this message, known for its philosophical and religious diversity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's judgment is based on His perfect justice, ensuring that all will be judged fairly.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_jesus.htm">The Role of Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus is central to God's plan for judgment, emphasizing His authority and divinity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_assurance_of_resurrection.htm">The Assurance of Resurrection</a></b><br>The resurrection of Jesus is a foundational proof of His power and the hope of eternal life for believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/urgency_of_repentance.htm">Urgency of Repentance</a></b><br>Knowing that a day of judgment is set should motivate individuals to repent and turn to Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_with_eternity_in_mind.htm">Living with Eternity in Mind</a></b><br>Believers are called to live in light of the coming judgment, focusing on eternal values rather than temporal concerns.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_17_31_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 17:31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Acts_17_31_Jesus_role_in_God_s_justice.htm">How does Acts 17:31 affirm God's justice through Jesus' appointed judgment day?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Jesus_resurrection_confirm_God_s_plan.htm">What role does Jesus' resurrection play in confirming God's plan in Acts 17:31?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prepare_for_Acts_17_31_judgment.htm">How can we prepare for the judgment described in Acts 17:31?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Acts_17_31_and_Jesus_authority_to_judge.htm">How does Acts 17:31 connect with other scriptures about Jesus' authority to judge?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Acts_17_31_s_impact_on_daily_Christian_life.htm">How should Acts 17:31 influence our daily walk with Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Acts_17_31_Certainty_of_Jesus_judgment.htm">How does Acts 17:31 affirm the certainty of judgment by Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_resurrection_in_Acts_17_31.htm">What evidence supports the resurrection mentioned in Acts 17:31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_Jesus_the_judge_in_Acts_17_31.htm">Why is Jesus chosen as the judge in Acts 17:31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_acts_17.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Acts 17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/acts_17_31_-_evidence_for_judgment_by_resurrection.htm">Acts 17:31 &#8211; What evidence supports the claim of a coming judgment by a resurrected man when such accounts defy scientific understanding of death? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/who_was_athenagoras_of_athens.htm">Who was Athenagoras of Athens?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/when_was_judges_written.htm">Did Jesus come to judge the world?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_does_god_allow_the_innocent_to_suffer.htm">If God is just, why does He allow innocent people to suffer?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Acts 17:31 Mean</div><b>For He has set a day</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s calendar is fixed, not fluid.

And the certainty of this was made apparent by the fact that he who was ordained to be Judge was raised from the dead, and so ready to commence the judgment. The time for immediate action was come; God's revelation had reached them. <span class="cmt_word">The man</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>). So <a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>. And so in <a href="/john/5-27.htm">John 5:27</a> our Lord himself says of himself that the Father gave him authority to execute judgment "because he is the Son of man;" and in <a href="/matthew/26-24.htm">Matthew 26:24</a>, "Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power." (For the connection of the judgment with Christ's resurrection, see especially <a href="/acts/10-40.htm">Acts 10:40-42</a>.)
