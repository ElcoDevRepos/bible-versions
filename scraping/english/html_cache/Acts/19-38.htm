The craftsmen, including Demetrius, made a living by creating silver shrines of Artemis. The spread of Christianity, led by Paul, threatened their trade as it turned people away from idol worship. This phrase highlights the economic and religious tension between early Christians and those who profited from pagan practices. The mention of a "complaint" suggests a legal grievance, reflecting the Roman legal system's influence in the region.<p><b>the courts are open and proconsuls are available</b><br>Ephesus was a major city in the Roman province of Asia, and as such, it had a well-established legal system. The "courts" refer to the public venues where legal matters were adjudicated. "Proconsuls" were Roman officials who governed provinces and had judicial authority. This phrase underscores the structured legal recourse available in Roman society, contrasting with mob justice. It also reflects the Roman emphasis on law and order, which provided a framework for resolving disputes.<p><b>Let them bring charges against one another there</b><br>This phrase advocates for the use of legal channels rather than resorting to violence or public disorder. It reflects the Roman legal principle of due process, where accusations should be formally presented and adjudicated. This approach aligns with biblical teachings on justice and order, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-7</a>, which emphasize submission to governing authorities. The call to "bring charges" also highlights the importance of accountability and the rule of law in resolving conflicts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/demetrius.htm">Demetrius</a></b><br>A silversmith in Ephesus who made silver shrines of Artemis.

Compare Paul&#8217;s words in <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, &#8220;For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil&#8221;.<p>&#8226; By framing the matter as a &#8220;complaint,&#8221; the clerk shifts the crowd&#8217;s tumult into something that can be handled properly, echoing the wisdom of <a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a> about a gentle answer turning away wrath.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the courts are open and proconsuls are available</b><p>&#8226; God ordains civil structures to keep societal order. &#8220;Let every person be subject to the governing authorities&#8221; (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p>&#8226; In Ephesus, the &#8220;courts&#8221; (literally, sessions of Roman justice) met regularly; &#8220;proconsuls&#8221; were the governors empowered to judge. Their availability underlines that lawful avenues already exist.<p>&#8226; Paul himself had earlier appealed to a city official (<a href="/acts/16-37.htm">Acts 16:37-39</a>), showing that believers can rightly use legal systems without compromising faith.<p>&#8226; Peter teaches the same balance: &#8220;Submit yourselves for the Lord&#8217;s sake to every human institution&#8230; governors as those sent by him to punish evildoers&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; The open courts stand in stark contrast to the closed-minded mob.

There are some grounds for adopting the last alternative. Junius Silanus, who was Proconsul of Asia when St. Paul arrived in Ephesus (A.D. 54), had been poisoned by Celer and Helius, the two procurators, at the instigation of Agrippina; and it seems probable that they for a time held a joint proconsular authority.<p><span class= "bld">Let them implead one another.</span>--The English word exactly expresses the technical force of the Greek. Demetrius and his followers were to lodge a formal statement of the charge they brought against the accused. They in their turn were to put in a rejoinder, and so joining issue, each side would produce its witnesses.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> <span class="accented">- If therefore</span> for <span class="accented">wherefore if</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that</span> for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the courts are</span> for <span class="accented">the law is</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">proconsuls</span> for <span class="accented">deputies</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">accuse</span> for <span class="accented">implead</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Against any man</span>.
