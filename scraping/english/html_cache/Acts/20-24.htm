This reflects the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized self-denial and taking up one's cross (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24-25</a>). Paul's perspective aligns with the biblical theme of self-sacrifice for the sake of the Gospel, as seen in the lives of other apostles and early Christians who faced persecution and martyrdom.<p><b>if only I may finish my course</b><br>The metaphor of a race or course is common in Paul's writings (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>). It suggests discipline, perseverance, and a clear goal. The imagery would resonate with the Greco-Roman audience familiar with athletic competitions. Paul&#8217;s focus is on completing the task set before him, emphasizing endurance and faithfulness.<p><b>and complete the ministry I have received from the Lord Jesus</b><br>Paul acknowledges his calling as divinely appointed, echoing his conversion experience on the road to Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15-16</a>). This divine commission underscores the authority and responsibility of his apostolic mission. The concept of receiving a ministry from the Lord highlights the idea of stewardship and accountability to God.<p><b>the ministry of testifying to the good news of God&#8217;s grace</b><br>The core of Paul's ministry is the proclamation of the Gospel, centered on the grace of God. This grace is a key theme in Paul's theology, emphasizing salvation as a gift from God, not earned by works (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). The message of grace contrasts with the legalism of the Judaizers and is foundational to the New Covenant established through Christ&#8217;s sacrifice.

His outlook mirrors Jesus&#8217; teaching that whoever loses his life for Christ will find it (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24-25</a>). Like the psalmist who declares, &#8220;Your love is better than life&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/63-3.htm">Psalm 63:3</a>), Paul weighs Christ&#8217;s mission against personal comfort and chooses the mission every time.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of no value to me</b><p>Here Paul places zero price tag on his own safety, ambitions, or reputation. He is not embracing nihilism; he is prioritizing eternity. <a href="/philippians/3-7.htm">Philippians 3:7-8</a> shows the same heart: &#8220;Whatever was gain to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.&#8221; When the gospel is supreme, the believer refuses to cling to lesser treasures (<a href="/hebrews/10-34.htm">Hebrews 10:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>if only I may finish my course</b><p>The image shifts to a race.

Every believer has a God-assigned lane; fulfillment comes from running to the tape, not comparing tracks.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and complete the ministry I have received from the Lord Jesus</b><p>Paul did not volunteer for a hobby; he was entrusted with a sacred stewardship (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-16.htm">1 Corinthians 9:16-17</a>). The source&#8212;&#8220;the Lord Jesus&#8221;&#8212;guarantees both authority and accountability.

Grace highlights what God has done, not what we achieve (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). Thus, Paul&#8217;s self-forgetfulness is logical&#8212;grace leaves no room for boasting except in the cross (<a href="/galatians/6-14.htm">Galatians 6:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/20-24.htm">Acts 20:24</a> showcases a life recalibrated by Christ&#8217;s commission. Personal preservation bows before gospel proclamation, finishing the God-given race matters more than prolonging it, and grace&#8212;lavish, unearned, unstoppable&#8212;remains the message worth any sacrifice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">But none of these things move me . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">But I take account of nothing, nor do I hold my life</span> . . . We note the parallelism with Luther's famous declaration, when warned by his friends not to go to Worms, "I will go thither, though there should be devils on every house-top."<p><span class= "bld">So that I might finish my course with joy.</span>--The two last words are wanting in many of the best MSS., and were probably inserted as a rhetorical improvement. The passage is grander without them. What St. Paul desired was to finish his course--whether "with joy" or not mattered little. The dominance of the same ruling thought finds utterance once again in his last Epistle (<a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm" title="I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:">2Timothy 4:7</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus.</span>--We have again to note the parallelism with St. Paul's language elsewhere (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;">2Corinthians 4:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm" title="And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;">2Corinthians 5:18</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-12.htm" title="And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;">1Timothy 1:12</a>); the words that follow are in apposition with the "ministry," and explain what it consisted in. To bear witness, especially as a living example of its power (<a href="/context/1_timothy/1-12.htm" title="And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;">1Timothy 1:12-16</a>), of the good tidings that God was not a harsh Judge, but a gracious Father, willing all men to be saved (<a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm" title="Who will have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.">1Timothy 2:4</a>), that was the truth to the proclamation of which his life was to be devoted. In this there was the central truth of the kingdom of God, of which the next verse speaks. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> <span class="accented">- I hold not my life of any account, as dear</span> for <span class="accented">none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">may accomplish my course</span> for <span class="accented">might finish my course with joy</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">received</span> for <span class="accented">have received</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">from</span> for of, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">I hold not my life</span>, etc. It is inconceivable that St. Paul should have uttered, or St. Luke have reported, such an unintelligible sentence as that of the R.T., when it was perfectly easy to express the meaning clearly. Neither does the mention of his life, in the first instance, tally with that of "bonds and afflictions." The T.R., which has considerable support, seems to be far preferable. The first clause, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, means quite naturally," I take no account of anything;" I value nothing, neither liberty, nor ease, nor comfort. I am ready to suffer the loss of all things, and I do count them as dung (<a href="/philippians/3-7.htm">Philippians 3:7-9</a>); and then he adds yet further, "Neither do I count my own life as precious, so as to accomplish my course," etc. This metaphor of running a race is a favorite one with St. Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13, 14</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To testify the gospel of the grace of God</span>. An invaluable epitome of the Christian ministry. The essential feature of the gospel is its declaration of God's free grace to a guilty world, forgiving sins, and imputing righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ. The distinctive work of the ministry is to declare that grace. So St. Paul describes his own ministry, and the record of his ministry in the Acts and in his Epistles exactly agrees with this description. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/20-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(all&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
