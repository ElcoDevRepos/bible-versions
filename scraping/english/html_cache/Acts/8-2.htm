In the context of the early church, these men were likely part of the Jewish community in Jerusalem who had come to faith in Jesus as the Messiah. Their reverence for God is evident in their actions, showing respect for Stephen, a fellow believer. The term "God-fearing" is used throughout the New Testament to describe those who were pious and devout, such as Cornelius in <a href="/acts/10-2.htm">Acts 10:2</a>.<p><b>buried Stephen</b><br>Stephen was the first Christian martyr, stoned to death for his bold proclamation of the gospel and his accusations against the Jewish leaders (<a href="/acts/7-54.htm">Acts 7:54-60</a>). The act of burial was significant in Jewish culture, as it was a way to honor the deceased. Despite the potential danger from the authorities, these men took the risk to give Stephen a proper burial, demonstrating their respect and love for him. This act of burial also fulfilled Jewish customs, which required the dead to be buried promptly, usually within 24 hours.<p><b>and mourned deeply over him</b><br>The deep mourning indicates the profound impact Stephen's death had on the early Christian community. Mourning was an important cultural practice in Jewish society, often involving loud lamentation and expressions of grief. This public display of sorrow highlights the loss felt by the community and the high regard in which Stephen was held. It also reflects the early church's understanding of the cost of discipleship, as Jesus had warned that following Him could lead to persecution and death (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24-25</a>). The mourning over Stephen can be seen as a type of Christ, as Jesus Himself was mourned by His followers after His crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>A deacon in the early church, known for his faith and filled with the Holy Spirit.

St. Luke, however, always uses a different word to describe that class (comp. <a href="/acts/13-43.htm" title="Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.">Acts 13:43</a>; <a href="/acts/13-50.htm" title="But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.">Acts 13:50</a>; <a href="/acts/16-14.htm" title="And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended to the things which were spoken of Paul.">Acts 16:14</a>; <a href="/acts/17-4.htm" title="And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.">Acts 17:4</a>; <a href="/acts/17-17.htm" title="Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.">Acts 17:17</a>), and the word used here is applied by him to Simeon (<a href="/luke/2-25.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was on him.">Luke 2:25</a>), to the multitude of Jews present on the day of Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-5.htm" title="And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.">Acts 2:5</a>), to Ananias as devout according to the Law (<a href="/acts/22-12.htm" title="And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelled there,">Acts 22:12</a>). This notion must accordingly be rejected as against evidence. On the other hand, had they been members of the Church they would naturally, though perhaps not necessarily, have been described as "brethren" or "disciples." We are left therefore to the conclusion that they were Jews who had been kindled into admiration and half-conviction by the calm heroism of the martyr, and who, without committing themselves to more than that admiration, acted in his case as Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathaea had acted after the Crucifixion. They would show honour to the memory of the dead, though they had not had the courage to defend the preacher of the truth while he was yet with them. In the legend or tradition as to the death of Stephen, reported and accepted by Augustine (<span class= "ital">De Civ:</span> <span class= "ital">Dei.</span> xvii. 8; <span class= "ital">Serm.</span> 318, 319; <span class= "ital">Tract. In Joann., </span>120), Gamaliel and Nicodemus are named as actually taking part in the entombment, and as afterwards laid in the same sepulchre, on which his name appeared in Aramaic characters as <span class= "ital">Chaliel</span> (= garland), the equivalent in that language of the Greek <span class= "ital">Stephanos.</span> The translation of the martyr's relics to Ancona, Minorca, and to Uzalis, and other towns in Africa, made a deep impression on Augustine, and gave occasion to some of his most eloquent sermons. Oratories were dedicated to his memory, and miraculous cures effected by prayers addressed to him.
