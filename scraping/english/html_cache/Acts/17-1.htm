Amphipolis was a significant city due to its strategic location near the Strymon River and its proximity to the Aegean Sea, making it a vital hub for trade and military movements. Apollonia, though less prominent, was an important stop on the Via Egnatia, the major Roman road connecting the Adriatic Sea to Byzantium. The journey through these cities indicates the missionary strategy of Paul and his companions, focusing on urban centers connected by major trade routes to spread the Gospel efficiently.<p><b>they came to Thessalonica</b><br>Thessalonica was the capital of Macedonia and a major port city, making it a bustling center of commerce and culture. Its status as a free city within the Roman Empire allowed for a degree of self-governance, which contributed to its diverse population and vibrant public life. The city's strategic location on the Via Egnatia made it an ideal place for Paul to establish a church, as the Gospel could easily spread from there to other regions. Thessalonica's significance is underscored by the two epistles Paul later wrote to the church there, addressing issues of faith, persecution, and eschatology.<p><b>where there was a Jewish synagogue</b><br>The presence of a Jewish synagogue in Thessalonica indicates a substantial Jewish community, which was common in major cities of the Roman Empire. Synagogues served as centers for worship, education, and community life for Jews living in the diaspora. Paul's custom was to begin his ministry in a new city by preaching in the synagogue, as it provided a ready audience familiar with the Scriptures. This approach allowed him to connect the message of Jesus Christ to the Jewish hope for a Messiah, as well as to engage with God-fearing Gentiles who attended the synagogue. This strategy is consistent with Paul's declaration in <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a> that the Gospel is "first to the Jew, then to the Gentile."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_silas.htm">Paul and Silas</a></b><br>Key figures in the early Christian church, known for their missionary journeys to spread the Gospel.

The site of Apollonia is uncertain, but the name is, perhaps, traceable in the modern village of <span class= "ital">Polina, </span>between the Strymonic and Thermaic <span class= "ital">Gulfs.</span> A more famous city of the same name, also on the <span class= "ital">Via Egnatia, </span>was situated near Dyrrhacium. It seems clear that the names indicated the stages at which the travellers rested, and that thirty miles a day a somewhat toilsome journey for those who had so recently been scourged) was, as with most men of ordinary strength, their average rate of travelling. It would seem that there was no Jewish population to present an opening for the gospel at either of these cities, and that St. Paul, therefore, passed on to Thessalonica.<p><span class= "bld">Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews.</span>--The city, which had previously borne the names of Emathia, Halia, and Therma, had been enlarged by Philip of Macedon, and named after his daughter. It was situated on the Thermaic Gulf, and had grown into a commercial port of considerable importance. As such, it had attracted Jews in large numbers. The MSS. differ as to the presence or absence of the Greek article before "synagogue," but, on the whole, it is probable that we should read, "<span class= "ital">the</span> synagogue," that which served for the Jews of the neighbouring cities, who were not numerous enough to have one of their own. The old name survives in the modern <span class= "ital">Saloniki, </span>and there is still a large Jewish population there.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Amphipolis</span>. This was the ancient capital of that division of Macedonia (Macedonia Prima); see <a href="/acts/16-12.htm">Acts 16:12</a>, note. It was situated on the Via Egnatia, thirty-four miles southwest from Philippi, and three miles from the AEgean Sea. It lay in a peninsula, surrounded on three sides by the Strymon, whence its name, <span class="accented">Amphipolis</span>; its modern name is <span class="accented">Neokhoria</span>, now a village. Its original name was <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#xa0;&#x1ffe;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, The Nine Ways. Originally a Thracian city, it was conquered by the Athenians, then by the Lacedaemonians, then fell under the dominion of Philip of Macedon, and finally, with the rest of Macedonia, became part of the Roman empire. <span class="cmt_word">Apollonia</span>; now probably <span class="accented">Polina</span>, thirty miles due west of Amphipolis, on the Via Egnatia. The modern track from Amphipolis to <span class="cmt_word">Thessalonica</span> does not pass through Polina, but beneath it. Thessalonica; on the Via Egnatia, now the important seaport of <span class="accented">Saloniki</span>, on the Aegean Sea or Archipelago, thirty-eight miles from Apollonia, and con-raining about sixty thousand inhabitants. Its ancient name was Therma (whence the Thermean Bay), but it took the name of Thessalonica under the Macedonian kings. It continued to grow in importance under the Romans, and was the most populous city of the whole of Macedonia. It was the capital of Macedonia Secunda under the division by AEmilius Paulus (<a href="/acts/16-12.htm">Acts 16:12</a>, note), and in the time of Theodosius the Younger, when Macedonia consisted of two provinces, it was the capital of Macedonia Prima. But from its situation and great commercial importance it was virtually the capital of "Greece, Macedonia, and Illyricum" (Howson, in ' Dict. of Geog.'). Its trade attracted a great colony of Jews from before the time of St. Paul, and through the Roman and Greek and Turkish empires, down to the present day, when "one-half of the population is said to be of Israelitish race "(Lewin). Thessalonica had a terrible celebrity from the massacre of its inhabitants by order of the Emperor Theodosius, in revenge for the murder of Botheric, his general, which led to the famous penance imposed upon the emperor by St. Ambrose (Gibbon,' Decline and Fall,' <a href="/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>.). It was also taken three times in the Middle Ages: by the Saracens, with fearful slaughter, A.D. 904; by the Normans, with scarcely less cruelty, A.D. 1185; and by the Turks, in 1430. Its ecclesiastical history under its archbishops is also of great interest (see 'Dict. of Greek and Roman Geog.'). <span class="cmt_word">Where was a synagogue</span>. It is needless to point out the exact agreement of this brief statement with historical fact as pointed out above. There is said to have been twenty-two Jewish synagogues at Thessalonica after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in the fifteenth century, and the number at the present time is stated to be thirty-six. The existence of a synagogue at this time was the reason of St. Paul's visit and sojourn there. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/17-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they had passed through</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#953;&#959;&#948;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Diodeusantes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1353.htm">Strong's 1353: </a> </span><span class="str2">To journey through, go about.
