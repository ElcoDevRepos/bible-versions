This reflects the common Greco-Roman practice of deifying humans and the misunderstanding of divine power. It highlights the apostles' rejection of idolatry and their commitment to redirecting worship to the one true God.<p><b>We too are only men, human like you.</b><br>Paul and Barnabas emphasize their humanity to counter the crowd's belief that they are divine. This humility is consistent with biblical teachings that all glory belongs to God alone. It also aligns with the Christian doctrine of the Incarnation, where Jesus, though divine, took on human form (<a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-7</a>).<p><b>We are bringing you good news</b><br>The "good news" refers to the Gospel message of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection for the salvation of humanity. This proclamation is central to the apostles' mission and echoes the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). It signifies the transition from the old covenant to the new covenant in Christ.<p><b>that you should turn from these worthless things</b><br>The "worthless things" refer to idols and pagan practices prevalent in the Greco-Roman world. This call to repentance is a recurring theme in Scripture, urging a turn from idolatry to worship the true God (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>). It underscores the futility of worshiping created things rather than the Creator.<p><b>to the living God</b><br>The "living God" contrasts with lifeless idols and emphasizes God's active and dynamic presence in the world. This term is used throughout the Bible to describe God's eternal nature and sovereignty (<a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a>). It also points to the resurrection of Jesus, affirming God's power over life and death.<p><b>who made heaven and earth and sea and everything in them.</b><br>This phrase affirms God's role as the Creator, a foundational belief in Judeo-Christian theology (<a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>). It reflects the biblical worldview that God is the source of all life and sustains the universe. This declaration is a call to recognize God's authority and reject the worship of creation itself, aligning with the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_barnabas.htm">Paul and Barnabas</a></b><br>Apostles and missionaries spreading the Gospel.

The metrical structure of the. close of the speech (see Note on <a href="/acts/14-17.htm" title="Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.">Acts 14:17</a>) leaves hardly a shadow of doubt on this point.<p><span class= "bld">We also are men of like passions with you.</span>--The word, which expresses participation in all the passive conditions of human life, as well as in what are commonly known as "passions," occurs again in <a href="/james/5-17.htm" title="Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.">James 5:17</a>. There is, it will be noted, a striking parallelism between St. Paul's language here, and that of Peter to Cornelius (<a href="/acts/10-26.htm" title="But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.">Acts 10:26</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Ye should turn from these vanities.</span>--The demonstrative pronoun implies a corresponding gesture. The Apostle points to all the pomp and pageantry of the intended sacrifice. The words "vanity and "vain" were almost the invariable terms used by Jews to describe the emptiness and worthlessness of heathen worship (<a href="/ephesians/4-17.htm" title="This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you from now on walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,">Ephesians 4:17</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;">1Peter 1:18</a>; and, in the Old Testament, <a href="/1_samuel/12-21.htm" title="And turn you not aside: for then should you go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.">1Samuel 12:21</a>). In contrast with these dead and dumb things, the Apostle calls on them to turn to God, who truly lives and acts, and is the source of all life and power, the Maker of heaven and earth, the Giver of all good gifts, the Judge of all evil deeds. In contrast, alike, with the popular polytheism which assigned heaven, and earth, and sea to different deities, and to the speculative Pantheism which excluded will and purpose from its conception of the Godhead, he proclaims the One God as having every attribute of personal Life and Being. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> <span class="accented">- Bring you good tidings</span> for <span class="accented">preach unto you</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">vain things</span> for <span class="accented">vanities</span>, A.V.; who for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the heaven and the earth</span> for <span class="accented">heaven and earth</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that in them is</span> for <span class="accented">things that are therein</span>, A.V.
