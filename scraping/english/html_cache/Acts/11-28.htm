He is mentioned here and later in <a href="/acts/21-10.htm">Acts 21:10</a>, where he predicts Paul's imprisonment. Prophets in the early church were individuals who received direct revelation from God, often to provide guidance or warnings to the church. Agabus's role highlights the continuation of prophetic ministry in the New Testament era, similar to Old Testament prophets.<p><b>stood up and predicted through the Spirit</b><br>The act of standing up signifies the importance and authority of the message being delivered. The phrase "through the Spirit" indicates that Agabus's prediction was not based on human insight but was a revelation from the Holy Spirit. This underscores the belief in divine inspiration and guidance in the early church, as seen in other instances such as <a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>, where the Holy Spirit directs the church in Antioch.<p><b>that a great famine would sweep across the whole world</b><br>The term "whole world" in this context likely refers to the Roman Empire, which was the known world to the early Christians. Historical records, including those by Roman historians like Suetonius and Tacitus, confirm that several famines occurred during the reign of Emperor Claudius. This prediction aligns with the biblical theme of God using prophets to warn of impending judgment or hardship, as seen in the Old Testament with figures like Joseph in <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>.<p><b>(This happened under Claudius.)</b><br>Claudius was the Roman Emperor from AD 41 to 54. His reign was marked by several natural disasters, including famines. The mention of Claudius provides a historical anchor for the events described, affirming the accuracy of the biblical narrative. This historical context also highlights the early church's response to such crises, as seen in <a href="/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29-30</a>, where the disciples decide to provide aid to the affected regions, demonstrating the practical outworking of their faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/agabus.htm">Agabus</a></b><br>A prophet in the early Christian church who, through the Holy Spirit, predicted a significant famine.

But the expression must be taken bore as hyperbolical, just as Josephus says that Ahab sent messengers to search for Elijah, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, where, of course, only the neighboring countries to Judaea can be meant, strictly speaking ('Ant. Jud.,'8. 13:4). But there is no evidence to show that <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, <span class="accented">is</span> ever a technical term for Judaea. See the use of the word by Luke (<a href="/luke/2-1.htm">Luke 2:1</a>; <a href="/luke/4-5.htm">Luke 4:5</a>; <a href="/luke/21-26.htm">Luke 21:26</a>; <a href="/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6, 31</a>; <a href="/acts/19-27.htm">Acts 19:27</a>; <a href="/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5</a>). In point of fact, the predicted famine, which began in the fourth year of Claudius Caesar (A.D. 44) and lasted till A.D. , fell upon Judea exclusively, as far as appears from Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' lit. 15:3; 20. 2:5, 5:2), and was very severe there. Ishmael was high priest at the time; and Helena, Queen of Adiahene, fetched large supplies of corn from Egypt and of figs from Cyprus to Jerusalem, to supply the wants of the people. Eusebius ('Eccl. Hist.,' 2:8) speaks of this famine as having prevailed "over the world," and as being recorded by authors hostile to Christianity, but mentions no names and gives no particulars ('Eccl. Hist.,' 2:8), but in the twelfth chapter of the same book he limits it to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, Judaea. There were several other historical famines in the reign of Claudius, but they can hardly be included in the prophecy of Agabus. The prophet Agabus is mentioned again in <a href="/acts/21-10.htm">Acts 21:10</a>, and again as coming from Judaea. Renan ascribes the poverty-stricken condition of the Jerusalem Christians to their communistic institutions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/11-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">One</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7991;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(heis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1520.htm">Strong's 1520: </a> </span><span class="str2">One.
