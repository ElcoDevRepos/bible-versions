The Gospel of Luke provides a detailed account of the life, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Luke's meticulous approach to documenting events is evident in his attention to detail and historical accuracy, as seen in his use of eyewitness accounts and careful investigation (<a href="/luke/1.htm">Luke 1:1-4</a>).<p><b>O Theophilus</b><br>Theophilus, whose name means "lover of God" or "friend of God," is addressed in both the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts. While some scholars suggest Theophilus may have been a real person, possibly a Roman official or a patron of Luke's writings, others propose that the name could symbolize any believer or seeker of God. The use of "most excellent" in <a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3</a> suggests a person of high status, possibly indicating a formal address to someone of importance.<p><b>I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach</b><br>This phrase highlights the dual focus of Jesus' ministry: His actions and His teachings. The Gospel of Luke records numerous miracles, parables, and teachings of Jesus, emphasizing His role as the Messiah and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. The use of "began" implies that Jesus' work continues through the apostles and the early church, as documented in the Book of Acts. This continuation underscores the ongoing mission of the church to spread the Gospel and make disciples of all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/theophilus.htm">Theophilus</a></b><br>The recipient of both the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts.

It has been thought that the absence of the words "most excellent" implies that the writer's friendship with Theophilus was now of a more intimate and familiar nature. It is possible, just as a like change of relation has been traced in Shakespeare's dedication of his two poems to the Earl of Southampton, but the inference is, in each case, somewhat precarious.<p><span class= "bld">That Jesus began both to do and teach.</span>--The verb "begin" is specially characteristic of St. Luke's Gospel, in which it occurs not less than thirty-one times. Its occurrence at the beginning of the Acts is, accordingly, as far as it goes, an indication of identity of authorship. He sought his materials from those who had been "from the beginning" eye-witnesses and ministers of the word (<a href="/luke/1-2.htm" title="Even as they delivered them to us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;">Luke 1:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">I made</span> for <span class="accented">have I made</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">concerning</span> for <span class="accented">of</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to teach</span> for <span class="accented">teach</span>, A.V.

But the mention of "the apostles whom he had chosen" drew him, as it were, into the stem of his history before he was able to describe it. O Theophilus. The omission of the title "most excellent," given to Theophilus in the Gospel (<a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3</a>), is one among other indications that the publication of the Acts followed very closely upon that of the Gospel. Began both to do and to teach Some take the phrase as equivalent to <span class="accented">did</span> <span class="accented">and taught</span>; <span class="accented">o</span>thers supply the sense <span class="accented">and continued</span> until the day, etc.; or, which is the same thing, supply the <span class="accented">terminus a quo</span>, making the whole sense equivalent to "all that Jesus did and taught from the beginning until the day," etc.; others again, as Bishop Wordsworth, gather St. Luke's meaning to be that in the Acts he is about to narrate the <span class="accented">continuance</span> by our Lord in heaven of the work which he only <span class="accented">began</span> on earth. Meyer thinks that, by the insertion of the word "began," the thing said or done "is in a vivid and graphic manner denoted according to its moment of commencement;" so that our Lord is represented as at one time actively beginning to heal, then to teach, then to walk on the sea, and so on. But the words "began" and "until the day" certainly suggest the beginning and the ending of our Lord's ministry, or rather the whole ministry from its beginning to its end, so that the meaning would be "of all that Jesus did and taught from first to last." To do and to teach. So the disciples on the way to Emmaus speak of Jesus as "a Prophet mighty in deed and word" (<a href="/luke/24-19.htm">Luke 24:19</a>).
