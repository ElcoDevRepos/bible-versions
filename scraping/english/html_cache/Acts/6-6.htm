This act of presenting them to the apostles signifies the importance of leadership and accountability in the church. The number seven is often seen as a number of completeness or perfection in the Bible, reflecting the thoroughness of the apostles' decision. The apostles, as the leaders of the early church, were responsible for ensuring that the community's needs were met in a manner consistent with the teachings of Jesus.<p><b>who prayed</b><br>Prayer was a foundational practice in the early church, reflecting dependence on God for guidance and blessing. The apostles' prayer before appointing the seven men underscores the importance of seeking divine wisdom and approval in leadership decisions. This practice is consistent with other instances in Scripture where prayer precedes significant decisions or actions, such as Jesus praying before choosing the twelve apostles (<a href="/luke/6-12.htm">Luke 6:12-13</a>).<p><b>and laid their hands on them</b><br>The laying on of hands is a symbolic act with roots in the Old Testament, often associated with the transfer of authority or blessing (<a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18-23</a>). In the New Testament, it is used in various contexts, including healing, imparting the Holy Spirit, and commissioning individuals for specific tasks. Here, it signifies the apostles' endorsement and empowerment of the seven men for their new role. This act also reflects the continuity of God's work through His chosen leaders, as seen in the commissioning of Joshua by Moses.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The original disciples of Jesus Christ who were given the responsibility to lead the early church.

The congregation, having prayerfully selected seven Spirit-filled men (<a href="/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3-5</a>), brings them forward as a visible act of unity and affirmation&#8212;much like Israel presented the Levites before the LORD in <a href="/numbers/8-9.htm">Numbers 8:9-10</a>.<p>&#8226; This moment underscores the church&#8217;s responsibility to recognize qualified servants (compare <a href="/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; It models orderly delegation: leadership is preserved for prayer and the ministry of the word (<a href="/acts/6-2.htm">Acts 6:2</a>), while practical needs are met through gifted believers (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the apostles</b><p>&#8226;

Bringing the seven to them affirms that all ministry operates under God-given leadership (<a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>).<p>&#8226; It also pictures accountability: resources laid &#8220;at the apostles&#8217;

(though the term appears later in <a href="/1_timothy/3-8.htm">1 Timothy 3:8-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Their example calls today&#8217;s church to cover appointments, plans, and people in earnest, specific prayer (<a href="/colossians/4-2.htm">Colossians 4:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and laid their hands on them</b><p>&#8226;

the apostles, exercising Christ-given authority, pray and lay hands on them, entrusting them with service. The verse teaches that ministry selection is congregational in recognition, apostolic (or elder) in authorization, prayer-saturated, and publicly affirmed, ensuring both spiritual power and accountable structure in the body of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</span>--This is the first mention of the act in the New Testament. It had had an analogous meaning in the ritual of Israel (<a href="/numbers/27-23.htm" title="And he laid his hands on him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.">Numbers 27:23</a>) in acts of blessing (<a href="/context/genesis/48-13.htm" title="And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him.">Genesis 48:13-14</a>) and the transmission of functions. Its primary symbolism would seem to be that of the concentration for the moment of all the spiritual energy of prayer upon him on whom men lay their hands; and so of the bestowal of any office for which spiritual gifts are required. It had been used in the Jewish schools on the admission of a scribe to his office as a teacher. It soon became the customary outward and visible sign of such bestowal (<a href="/acts/13-3.htm" title="And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.">Acts 13:3</a>). Instruction as to what it thus meant entered into the primary teaching of all converts (<a href="/hebrews/6-2.htm" title="Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.">Hebrews 6:2</a>). It was connected with other acts that pre-supposed the communication of a spiritual gift (<a href="/1_timothy/5-22.htm" title="Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep yourself pure.">1Timothy 5:22</a>). Through well-nigh all changes of polity and dogma and ritual, it has kept its place with Baptism and the Supper of the Lord, among the unchanging witnesses of the Church's universality and permanence, witnessing, as in Confirmation, to the diversity of spiritual gifts, and, as in Ordination, to their connection with every special office and administration in the Church of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them</span>. They did not pray without imposition of hands, nor did they lay hands on them without prayer. So in the sacraments, in confirmation, and ordination, the outward sign or rite is accompanied by prayer for the thing signified. And God's grace is given through the sacrament or rite in answer to the prayer of faith (see <a href="/acts/8-15.htm">Acts 8:15</a>, and the Office for Baptism, the Prayer of Consecration in the Office for Holy Communion, and the Confirmation and Ordination Services).
