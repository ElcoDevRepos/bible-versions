Stephen was a deacon in the early church and known for his powerful preaching and miracles. His death marked a significant moment in the early church, as it was the first instance of a believer being killed for their faith in Jesus Christ. The term "witness" (Greek: "martys") is significant, as it later came to mean "martyr" in Christian tradition, highlighting the ultimate testimony of faith through sacrifice. Stephen's death fulfilled Jesus' prophecy that His followers would face persecution (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).<p><b>I stood there giving my approval</b><br>This phrase indicates Saul's (later Paul) complicity in Stephen's death. Saul was a Pharisee and a zealous persecutor of the early church, as described in <a href="/acts/8.htm">Acts 8:1-3</a> and <a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5-6</a>. His approval of Stephen's execution shows his initial opposition to the Christian movement. This moment is pivotal in understanding Saul's transformation into Paul, as it underscores the depth of his conversion experience on the road to Damascus (<a href="/acts/9.htm">Acts 9:1-19</a>). It also highlights the theme of redemption and grace, as someone who once persecuted Christians became one of the most influential apostles.<p><b>and watching over the garments of those who killed him.</b><br>In the cultural context of the time, those who stoned Stephen would have removed their outer garments to throw stones more effectively. Saul's role in watching over these garments signifies his authority and agreement with the execution. This act of holding the garments is symbolic of his participation in the persecution, even if he did not physically throw a stone. The mention of garments can also be seen as a type of Jesus Christ, who was stripped of His garments during His crucifixion (<a href="/john/19-23.htm">John 19:23-24</a>), drawing a parallel between the suffering of Christ and His followers. This connection emphasizes the cost of discipleship and the call to bear one's cross (<a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>A deacon in the early church and the first Christian martyr.

Stephen is called a &#8220;witness,&#8221; the same word for &#8220;martyr,&#8221; underscoring that his death was a testimony to Christ&#8217;s resurrection (<a href="/revelation/12-11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Blood&#8221; highlights the real, physical cost of following Jesus, echoing Jesus&#8217; words: &#8220;If anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his cross&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Stephen&#8217;s bold proclamation&#8212;&#8220;I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God&#8221; (<a href="/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>)&#8212;was the final spark that led to his death. Paul&#8217;s memory of that declaration later shaped his own Christ-centered preaching (cf. <a href="/acts/9-20.htm">Acts 9:20&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; The spilling of Stephen&#8217;s blood fulfills Jesus&#8217; warning that His followers would be persecuted (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a>) but also advances the gospel: &#8220;Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went&#8221; (<a href="/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I stood there giving my approval</b><p>&#8226; Paul (then Saul) was not a mere bystander; he &#8220;was in hearty agreement with putting him to death&#8221; (<a href="/acts/8-1.htm">Acts 8:1</a>).<p>&#8226; His consent shows the depth of his former hostility: &#8220;I persecuted this Way even to the death&#8221; (<a href="/acts/22-4.htm">Acts 22:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Later, Paul marvels at God&#8217;s mercy toward him: &#8220;Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners&#8212;of whom I am the worst&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15</a>). His conversion demonstrates that no one is beyond the reach of grace (<a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase confronts every reader with the seriousness of sin; agreement with evil is itself culpable (<a href="/romans/1-32.htm">Romans 1:32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Watching over the garments of those who killed him</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a> notes that the executioners &#8220;laid their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.&#8221; Guarding the clothes implies responsibility and intent, not neutrality.<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s role allowed the killers freedom to cast stones&#8212;an image of active participation, not distant observation.<p>&#8226; This memory likely haunted Paul and remained a touchstone of humility: &#8220;I am the least of the apostles&#8230;because I persecuted the church of God&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-9.htm">1 Corinthians 15:9</a>).<p>&#8226; His lingering recollection of coats and stones illustrates how specific sins can become catalysts for lifelong repentance and gratitude (<a href="/psalms/51-3.htm">Psalm 51:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/22-20.htm">Acts 22:20</a> shows Paul publicly confessing his past: he agreed with Stephen&#8217;s murder and facilitated it. The verse underscores three truths: martyrdom powerfully testifies to Christ, agreeing with evil is itself sinful, and God&#8217;s grace can transform even the fiercest opponent into a devoted servant. The memory of Stephen&#8217;s blood not only humbled Paul but propelled his mission, proving that &#8220;where sin increased, grace abounded all the more&#8221; (<a href="/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">When the blood of thy martyr Stephen . . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">thy witness.</span> The English word is, perhaps, a little too definite and technical, and fails to remind us, as the Greek does, that the same word had been used in <a href="/acts/22-15.htm" title="For you shall be his witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.">Acts 22:15</a> as expressing the office to which St. Paul himself was called.
