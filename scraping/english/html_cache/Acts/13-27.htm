Jerusalem was the religious and political center of Jewish life, housing the Temple, which was the focal point of worship. The rulers included the Sanhedrin, a council of chief priests, scribes, and elders who held significant authority. This group was responsible for maintaining religious order and interpreting the Law of Moses.<p><b>did not recognize Jesus</b><br>Despite the prophecies and signs, the people and their leaders failed to see Jesus as the Messiah. This lack of recognition is a recurring theme in the Gospels, where Jesus is often misunderstood or rejected by those He came to save. This blindness is both spiritual and prophetic, as foretold in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which describes the Messiah as "despised and rejected by men."<p><b>yet in condemning Him</b><br>The condemnation of Jesus by the Jewish leaders led to His crucifixion, a pivotal event in Christian theology. This act of condemnation was not just a legal judgment but a fulfillment of divine purpose. The leaders' decision to hand Jesus over to the Romans for execution was influenced by political and religious motives, including fear of losing their authority and misunderstanding of Jesus' mission.<p><b>they fulfilled the words of the prophets</b><br>This phrase highlights the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah's suffering and rejection. Scriptures such as <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> detail the suffering servant, and these were realized in Jesus' passion and death. The fulfillment of prophecy serves as a testament to the divine orchestration of salvation history.<p><b>that are read every Sabbath</b><br>The Jewish practice of reading the Torah and the Prophets in synagogues every Sabbath meant that the people were regularly exposed to the very scriptures that foretold the coming of the Messiah. Despite this, they failed to connect these prophecies with Jesus.

"This salvation is sent forth to you [according to Bengel, 'from Jerusalem,' according to others, 'from God'], for the Jerusalem Jews have rejected Christ. And in consequence of their rejection, you, who had no share in crucifying the Lord of glory, are invited to take their place. But it maybe taken as expressing the cause why this salvation is complete and capable of being offered to them. This salvation is preached to you because, through the instrumentality of those that dwell at Jerusalem, all that was written in the Scriptures concerning Christ has been fulfilled. Christ has been crucified and raised from the dead, and so now remission of sins is proclaimed to you through him (vers. 38, 39; comp. <a href="/acts/3-13.htm">Acts 3:13-20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which are read every sabbath</span>.
