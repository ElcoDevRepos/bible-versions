It was historically significant as a major seaport in Israel. In biblical times, Joppa was the port from which Jonah attempted to flee from God's command (<a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>). The instruction to send men to Joppa highlights the importance of divine direction and obedience. This command signifies a pivotal moment in the early church, as it sets the stage for the inclusion of Gentiles into the Christian faith.<p><b>to call for a man named Simon</b><br>Simon, also known as Peter, was one of Jesus' closest disciples and a leading figure in the early church. The use of his Hebrew name, Simon, emphasizes his Jewish heritage, which is significant in the context of the Jewish-Gentile relations being addressed in this chapter. This calling is a divine appointment, showing God's sovereign plan in orchestrating events for the spread of the Gospel.<p><b>who is called Peter</b><br>Peter, meaning "rock" in Greek, was the name given to Simon by Jesus (<a href="/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>). This name change signifies Peter's role as a foundational leader in the church (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>). The mention of his name here underscores his authority and the trust placed in him by God to carry out a mission that would break traditional Jewish boundaries. This event is a fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy that Peter would be instrumental in opening the door of faith to the Gentiles (<a href="/acts/15-7.htm">Acts 15:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cornelius.htm">Cornelius</a></b><br>A centurion in the Roman army, stationed in Caesarea.

The command comes directly from the angelic messenger to Cornelius, underscoring God&#8217;s initiative (cf. <a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26</a>; <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Immediate obedience is implied; delay would hinder God&#8217;s plan (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; God often engages His people in active participation&#8212;sending, going, serving&#8212;rather than allowing passivity (cf. <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Joppa</b><p>The target location is &#8220;to Joppa.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Joppa, a coastal city about thirty miles from Caesarea, has already appeared in <a href="/acts/9-36.htm">Acts 9:36&#8211;43</a>, where Peter raised Tabitha.<p>&#8226; It once served as Jonah&#8217;s escape route, highlighting a contrast: Jonah fled, Peter will come (cf. <a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s choice of Joppa shows His orchestration of geography and timing so that Cornelius and Peter will meet exactly when the gospel is poised to cross cultural boundaries (cf. <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to call for a man named Simon</b><p>Cornelius is told specifically &#8220;to call for a man named Simon.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The Lord provides explicit instructions, leaving no room for guesswork (cf. <a href="/acts/9-11.htm">Acts 9:11</a>; <a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Calling by name reveals God&#8217;s personal knowledge of His servants (cf. <a href="/isaiah/45-4.htm">Isaiah 45:4</a>; <a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Cornelius, a Gentile centurion, must reach out to a Jewish apostle; this intentional step prepares both men for the unity of Jew and Gentile in Christ (cf. <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who is called Peter</b><p>The angel adds, &#8220;who is called Peter.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This clarifies which Simon is meant, as Simon the tanner was already hosting him (<a href="/acts/9-43.htm">Acts 9:43</a>).<p>&#8226; The name Peter (&#8220;rock&#8221;) recalls Jesus&#8217; commission: &#8220;You are Peter&#8230;on this rock I will build My church&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter&#8217;s leadership and previous experience with miraculous healings (<a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6</a>; 9:34) qualify him as God&#8217;s chosen messenger to open the door of faith to the Gentiles (<a href="/acts/15-7.htm">Acts 15:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Linking Cornelius to Peter marks the next phase in salvation history, fulfilling Jesus&#8217; promise that His witnesses would reach &#8220;the ends of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/10-5.htm">Acts 10:5</a> is a concise but strategic command. God instructs Cornelius to take decisive action, sends him to a precise location, identifies the exact person to fetch, and connects him to the apostle uniquely equipped to usher Gentiles into the family of faith. Every phrase demonstrates God&#8217;s sovereign orchestration and purposeful detail, preparing for the pivotal moment when the gospel embraces all nations without distinction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5, 6) <span class= "bld">Call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter.</span>--The circumstances of the communication present, it is obvious, a striking parallelism with those attendant on the revelation to Ananias in <a href="/context/acts/9-10.htm" title="And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.">Acts 9:10-17</a>. To those who regard both narratives as fictitious, the resemblance will appear as characteristic of St. Luke's style as a writer.
