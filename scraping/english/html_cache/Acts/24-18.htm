His presence there underscores his continued respect for Jewish customs and traditions, despite his mission to the Gentiles. This setting is crucial because it highlights the tension between Paul's Jewish heritage and his Christian mission. The temple was a place of worship and sacrifice, and Paul's presence there indicates his adherence to Jewish law and customs, which is a point of contention with his accusers.<p><b>I was ceremonially clean</b><br>Paul emphasizes his ceremonial cleanliness to counter accusations of defiling the temple. According to Jewish law, ceremonial cleanliness was required to enter the temple, and Paul had undergone purification rites, as described earlier in <a href="/acts/21-26.htm">Acts 21:26</a>. This demonstrates his respect for Jewish law and his desire to avoid unnecessary offense to Jewish believers. It also highlights the false nature of the accusations against him, as he was following the law meticulously.<p><b>and was not inciting a crowd or an uproar</b><br>Paul defends himself against accusations of causing disorder. The charge of inciting a crowd was serious, as it could lead to Roman intervention and punishment. By stating he was not causing an uproar, Paul is asserting his peaceful intentions and adherence to the law. This is consistent with his teachings in other parts of the New Testament, where he advocates for peace and order (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-7</a>). The accusation of inciting a crowd is a common charge against early Christians, as seen in <a href="/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5-8</a>, where similar accusations are made against Paul and Silas.<p><b>But there are some Jews from the province of Asia</b><br>The mention of Jews from Asia refers to those who likely came from Ephesus or surrounding areas, where Paul had previously ministered. These individuals were likely familiar with Paul's teachings and opposed his message, which they saw as a threat to traditional Jewish beliefs. The province of Asia was a significant region in the Roman Empire, and Ephesus was a major city where Paul spent considerable time (Acts 19). The opposition from these Jews highlights the widespread nature of the conflict between early Christians and traditional Jewish authorities. This tension is a recurring theme in Acts, as seen in <a href="/acts/19-9.htm">Acts 19:9</a>, where Paul faces opposition in Ephesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is the central figure in this passage.

He was there to honor God, not to disrupt anybody. Earlier, in <a href="/acts/21-26.htm">Acts 21:26&#8211;27</a>, Paul had entered the temple with four men completing their Nazirite vows, a public act of devotion. Such details echo Jesus&#8217; own practice of teaching peacefully in the temple (<a href="/luke/19-47.htm">Luke 19:47&#8211;48</a>). By pointing to the place and timing, Paul is saying, &#8220;Look at the context&#8212;this was worship, not rebellion.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I was ceremonially clean</b><p>&#8220;Having been purified&#8221; (<a href="/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24, 26</a>) meant Paul followed the Mosaic requirements for temple worship, just as <a href="/numbers/19-20.htm">Numbers 19:20&#8211;22</a> outlines. This matters because the original accusation in <a href="/acts/21-28.htm">Acts 21:28</a> charged him with bringing Greeks into the temple and defiling it. By stressing his purity, Paul shows he upheld the Law, similar to his later claim in <a href="/acts/26-4.htm">Acts 26:4&#8211;5</a> that he lived according to &#8220;the strictest sect of our religion.&#8221; For believers today, Paul&#8217;s example illustrates <a href="/1_corinthians/9-20.htm">1 Corinthians 9:20</a>&#8212;voluntarily respecting cultural scruples to avoid needless offense, all while remaining faithful to Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and was not inciting a crowd or an uproar</b><p>Unlike the mob scenes in Ephesus (<a href="/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29&#8211;41</a>) or Thessalonica (<a href="/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5</a>), nothing in Jerusalem was Paul-initiated. Luke records no sermon or public dispute at that moment; instead the riot came from false rumors (<a href="/acts/21-30.htm">Acts 21:30</a>). Paul&#8217;s demeanor fits <a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>&#8212;&#8220;A gentle answer turns away wrath.&#8221; Even during his later voyage, Paul urged calm (<a href="/acts/27-33.htm">Acts 27:33-34</a>). By underlining his peaceful conduct, he exposes the baseless nature of the charge and models Christ&#8217;s own refusal to stir revolt (<a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But there are some Jews from the province of Asia</b><p>These were likely the same men who had encountered Paul in Ephesus and stirred opposition there (<a href="/acts/19-8.htm">Acts 19:8-9</a>; 21:27). Jewish law required witnesses to appear (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>), and Roman practice valued face-to-face accusers (<a href="/acts/25-16.htm">Acts 25:16</a>). Their absence strengthens Paul&#8217;s defense: &#8220;If there is something against me, let them testify&#8221; (<a href="/acts/24-19.htm">Acts 24:19-20</a>). The scene highlights how gospel opposition often comes from persistent voices rather than verified facts, echoing Jesus&#8217; warning in <a href="/matthew/10-23.htm">Matthew 10:23</a> that persecution may follow believers from one city to another.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/24-18.htm">Acts 24:18</a> shows Paul declaring his innocence on three counts: location (the temple), condition (ceremonially clean), and behavior (no riot), while pointing out that true witnesses were missing. The verse underscores the integrity of a faithful servant who honors both Scripture and civil authority, trusts God to reveal truth, and remains calm under false accusation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Whereupon certain Jews from Asia . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">in which things, </span>or <span class= "ital">wherein.</span> Many of the better MSS. give the relative pronoun in the feminine, as agreeing with "offerings," and indicating that he was, as it were, occupied with them at the very time when the Jews from Asia found him, not profaning the Temple, but purified with all the completeness which the Nazarite vow required.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> <span class="accented">- Amidst which</span> for <span class="accented">whereupon</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">they found me purified in the temple with no crowd, nor yet with tumult: but there were certain Jews from Asia</span> for <span class="accented">certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Amidst which</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x3ca;&#x3c2;</span>, R.T.) refers to the alms and offerings The T.R. has <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3c2;</span>, "<span class="accented">under</span> which circumstances," "at the transaction of which deeds," or, briefer, "whereupon," A.V. <span class="cmt_word">But there were</span>.
