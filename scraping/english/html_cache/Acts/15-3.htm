This phrase indicates the church's active involvement in mission work, highlighting the communal support and authority given to Paul and Barnabas. The church's sending reflects the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and the importance of collective discernment and blessing in missionary endeavors.<p><b>they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria</b><br>Phoenicia and Samaria were regions with distinct historical and cultural backgrounds. Phoenicia, known for its ancient cities like Tyre and Sidon, was a center of trade and maritime activity. Samaria, once the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, had a mixed population due to Assyrian resettlement policies (<a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>).

This recounting served as a testimony to God's work beyond Jewish communities, emphasizing the universality of the Gospel. It also addressed the theological debate about the necessity of circumcision and adherence to the Mosaic Law for Gentile believers, which was a central issue at the Jerusalem Council (<a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15:1-2</a>).<p><b>and bringing great joy to all the brothers</b><br>The joy experienced by the believers underscores the unity and shared mission of the early church.

They might have gone to Joppa, and so have avoided the old Canaanite cities and the region of the hated Samaritans. The very journey was, therefore, an assertion of the principles for which they were contending.

Everything points to Philip as the probable Evangelist of this region as well as of Samaria. Paul and Barnabas would accordingly, as they travelled, be setting their seal to his work, claiming fellowship with Canaanites and Samaritans; and wherever they went they were received with joy. Here, at least, they were certain of support; and, on mere grounds of policy, they were strengthening their cause by appearing at Jerusalem as the representatives of such important communities, having the courage of their convictions, and determined, though they might make concessions in things indifferent, not to sacrifice a single principle.<p><span class= "bld">They caused</span> <span class= "bld">great joy.</span>--The tense implies continued action. Wherever they went the tidings of the conversion of the Gentiles were received by the disciples at large with a gladness which presented the strongest possible contrast to the narrowness and bitterness of the Pharisee section of the Church of Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- They therefore... passed</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>... <span class="accented">they passed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">both Phoenicia</span> for <span class="accented">Phonice</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Being brought on their way</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>).
