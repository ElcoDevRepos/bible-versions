The assembly likely included apostles, elders, and other members of the early church in Jerusalem. The silence suggests the gravity of the situation and the respect given to the speakers. In Jewish culture, silence often precedes the reception of important teachings or decisions, reflecting a readiness to listen and discern.<p><b>as they listened to Barnabas and Paul</b><br>Barnabas and Paul were key figures in the early church, known for their missionary journeys and spreading the Gospel to the Gentiles. Their testimony carried significant weight due to their firsthand experiences. Barnabas, known as the "son of encouragement," was a respected leader, and Paul, formerly Saul, was a Pharisee turned apostle, whose conversion and ministry were pivotal in the spread of Christianity. Their partnership exemplified unity in mission and purpose.<p><b>describing the signs and wonders</b><br>Signs and wonders refer to miraculous events that serve as divine validation of the apostles' message. In the biblical context, such miracles were seen as evidence of God's power and presence. These acts were not merely for spectacle but were intended to confirm the truth of the Gospel and demonstrate God's authority. The miracles performed by Barnabas and Paul would have been reminiscent of those performed by Jesus and the apostles, reinforcing the continuity of God's work.<p><b>God had done among the Gentiles through them</b><br>This highlights the divine initiative in the mission to the Gentiles, emphasizing that it was God's work, not merely human effort. The inclusion of the Gentiles was a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of being a light to the nations. The phrase underscores the breaking of traditional Jewish boundaries, as the early church grappled with the inclusion of non-Jews. This was a significant theological shift, affirming that salvation through Christ was available to all, regardless of ethnic background.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/barnabas.htm">Barnabas</a></b><br>A key figure in the early church, known for his encouragement and missionary work alongside Paul.
