Paul is in Rome, under house arrest, and speaking to Jewish leaders. The Jewish leaders' willingness to hear Paul reflects a broader theme in Acts of the gospel being presented to both Jews and Gentiles. This openness can be seen as a fulfillment of Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be witnesses "to the ends of the earth."<p><b>because we know that people everywhere are speaking against this sect.</b><br>The term "sect" refers to the early Christian movement, which was often viewed with suspicion and hostility by both Jewish and Roman authorities. The phrase "people everywhere are speaking against" highlights the widespread controversy and opposition faced by early Christians. This opposition is documented throughout Acts, such as in <a href="/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6-7</a>, where Christians are accused of defying Caesar's decrees. The term "sect" (Greek: hairesis) was used to describe a group with distinct beliefs, often seen as heretical by mainstream Judaism. This reflects the tension between the nascent Christian faith and established religious traditions. The opposition also fulfills Jesus' prophecy in <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-21</a> about the world hating His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is under house arrest in Rome, awaiting trial.

Their openness, their reliance on hearsay, and the global opposition to the gospel all underscore key truths: God provides platforms for witness in any setting; rumors must be tested by direct engagement with God&#8217;s Word; and the spread of the gospel will always draw resistance. Like Paul, believers are called to speak graciously yet boldly, trusting that the unchained Word will accomplish its purpose (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">We desire . . . as concerning this sect . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">we request of thee.</span> The term is that which had been used by Tertullus when he spoke of the "<span class= "ital">sect</span> of the Nazarenes" (<a href="/acts/24-5.htm" title="For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:">Acts 24:5</a>). The speakers had clearly heard enough of the prisoner to identify him with that sect, but they treat him personally with respect, probably due in part to the favour which the authorities had shown him, and wish for an authoritative exposition of his views. The Christians of Rome had obviously, even if they were Jews, withdrawn from the Jewish quarter, and the residents in that quarter knew of them only by reports. What was the nature of those reports we can only conjecture. They were, as the speakers say, "everywhere spoken against." The darker calumnies which were propagated afterwards--stories of Thyestean (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>cannibal) banquets and licentious orgies--may possibly have been even then whispered from ear to ear. In any case the Christians of the empire would be known as abandoning circumcision and other Jewish ordinances, leading a separate life, holding meetings which were more or less secret, worshipping One who had been crucified as a malefactor. They were already, as Tacitus describes them, speaking of their sufferings under Nero, known as holding an <span class= "ital">exitiabilis superstitio</span> ("a detestable superstition"), guilty of <span class= "ital">atrocia et pudenda, odio humani generis convicti</span> ("atrocious and shameful crimes, convicted by the hatred of mankind") (<span class= "ital">Ann.</span> xv. 44), or as Suetonius writes (<span class= "ital">Nero, </span>c. 16), as a <span class= "ital">genus hominum superstitionis nov? et malefic?</span> ("a race of men holding a new and criminal superstition"). It is conceivable, looking to the early date at which such rumours were current, that even then there may have been caricatures like that which was found among the <span class= "ital">graffiti</span> of the Palace of the Caesars (now in the Collegio Romano), representing Alexamenos, a Christian convert, worshipping his god, in the form of a crucified human figure with an ass's head. Tertullian (A.D. 160-240) mentions such caricatures as current in his time (<span class= "ital">Apol.</span> c. 16), and the story that the Jews worshipped an ass's head, which we know to have been accepted at this very time (Jos. <span class= "ital">cont. Apion.</span> ii. 7; Tacit <span class= "ital">Hist.</span> v. 4), would naturally be transferred to the Christians, who were regarded as a sect of Jews. In Tertullian's time <span class= "ital">Asinarii</span> ("ass-worshippers") was a common term of abuse for them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="accented">It</span> <span class="accented">is known to us</span> for <span class="accented">we know</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">We desire</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); or, <span class="accented">we are willing</span>; literally, <span class="accented">think it right</span> (so <a href="/acts/16-38.htm">Acts 16:38</a>). <span class="greek">&#x397;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, followed by a negative, means "was unwilling."
