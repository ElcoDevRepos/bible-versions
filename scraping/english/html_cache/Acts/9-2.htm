Damascus, a significant city in Syria, was a major trade center and had a substantial Jewish population. The synagogues served as community centers for Jews, and Saul aimed to leverage these institutions to identify and arrest Christians. This reflects the early church's spread beyond Jerusalem, indicating the rapid growth of Christianity. The letters would have been formal documents granting Saul the authority to act on behalf of the Jewish religious leadership.<p><b>so that if he found any men or women belonging to the Way</b><br>"The Way" was an early term for Christianity, emphasizing the movement as a distinct path or lifestyle. This term is rooted in Jesus' declaration of being "the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The inclusion of both men and women highlights the egalitarian nature of the early church, where both genders were active participants. Saul's mission underscores the perceived threat Christianity posed to traditional Jewish beliefs and practices.<p><b>he could bring them as prisoners to Jerusalem</b><br>Saul's intent was to arrest and transport Christians back to Jerusalem for trial, likely before the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council. This reflects the centrality of Jerusalem as the religious and judicial hub for Jews. The act of bringing prisoners to Jerusalem also symbolizes the attempt to suppress the nascent Christian movement at its roots.

Damascus lay about 150 miles north of Jerusalem&#8212;well beyond Judea&#8212;showing how far Paul was willing to travel to stop the gospel (compare <a href="/acts/8-3.htm">Acts 8:3</a>).<p>&#8226; By targeting synagogues, Paul aimed at the very places where Jews first heard the message of Jesus (<a href="/acts/13-14.htm">Acts 13:14-15</a>; <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; His zeal fulfills Jesus&#8217; warning that some would persecute believers &#8220;thinking they are offering a service to God&#8221; (<a href="/john/16-2.htm">John 16:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that if he found any men or women belonging to the Way</b><p>Paul&#8217;s goal was clear: root out those &#8220;belonging to the Way.&#8221;<p>&#8226;

Paul&#8217;s determination underscores human opposition to the gospel, yet God would soon turn this persecutor into a preacher (<a href="/galatians/1-13.htm">Galatians 1:13-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He could bring them as prisoners to Jerusalem</b><p>Arrests in Damascus were only the first step;

How it came to be so, having been previously under Vitellius, the Roman president of Syria (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xiv. 4, ? 5), is not clear. It is probable, however, that in the war which Aretas had declared against Herod Antipas, in consequence of the Tetrarch's divorcing his daughter in order that he might marry Herodias (see Notes on <a href="/matthew/14-3.htm" title="For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.">Matthew 14:3</a>; <a href="/luke/3-14.htm" title="And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said to them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.">Luke 3:14</a>), he had been led, after defeating the Tetrarch (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xviii. 5, ? 1), to push his victories further; and, taking advantage of the absence of Vitellius, who had hastened to Rome on hearing of the death of Tiberius (A.D. 37) had seized on Damascus. In this abeyance of the control of the Roman power, Aretas may have desired to conciliate the priestly party at Jerusalem by giving facilities to their action against the sect which they would naturally represent as identified with the Galileans against whom he had been waging war. The Jewish population at Damascus was, at this time, very numerous. Josephus relates that not less than 10,000 were slain in a tumult under Nero (<span class= "ital">Wars, </span>ii. 25), and the narrative of the Acts (<a href="/acts/9-14.htm" title="And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on your name.">Acts 9:14</a>) implies that there were many "disciples of the Lord" among them. Many of these were probably refugees from Jerusalem, and the local synagogues were called upon to enforce the decrees of the Sanhedrin of the Holy City against them. On the position and history of Damascus, see Note on next verse.<p><span class= "bld">If he found any of this way.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">of the way.</span> We have here the first occurrence of a term which seems to have been used familiarly as a synonym for the disciples of Christ (<a href="/acts/19-9.htm" title="But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.">Acts 19:9</a>; <a href="/acts/19-23.htm" title="And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.">Acts 19:23</a>; <a href="/acts/22-4.htm" title="And I persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.">Acts 22:4</a>; <a href="/acts/24-14.htm" title="But this I confess to you, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:">Acts 24:14</a>; <a href="/acts/24-22.htm" title="And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.">Acts 24:22</a>). It may have originated in the words in which Christ had claimed to be Himself the "Way," as well as the "Truth" and the "Life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.">John 14:6</a>); or in His language as to the "strait way" that led to eternal life (<a href="/matthew/7-13.htm" title="Enter you in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leads to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:">Matthew 7:13</a>); or, perhaps, again, in the prophecy of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm" title="The voice of him that cries in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.">Isaiah 40:3</a>) cited by the Baptist (<a href="/matthew/3-3.htm" title="For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.">Matthew 3:3</a>; <a href="/mark/1-3.htm" title="The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.">Mark 1:3</a>), as to preparing "the way of the Lord."

And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.">Acts 11:26</a>) it served as a convenient, neutral designation by which the disciples could describe themselves, and which might be used by others who wished to speak respectfully, or, at least, neutrally, instead of the opprobrious epithet of the "Nazarenes" (<a href="/acts/24-5.htm" title="For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:">Acts 24:5</a>). The history of the term "Methodists," those that follow a distinct "method" or "way" of life, offers a partial but interesting analogue. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="accented">- Asked</span> for <span class="accented">desired</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">unto</span> for <span class="accented">to</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">any that were of the Way</span> for <span class="accented">any of this way</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">whether men</span>, etc., for <span class="accented">whether they were men</span>, etc., A.V.; <span class="accented">to</span> for <span class="accented">unto</span>, A.V.

But it is clear from vers. 10 and 13 that there was already a considerable number of Christian Jews at Damascus. And this, with the fact of there being a great multitude of Jews settled there, was a sufficient reason why Saul should ask for letters to each of the synagogues at Damascus, directing them to send any Christians who might be found amongst them bound to Jerusalem to be tried there before the Sanhedrim. There may have been thirty or forty synagogues at Damascus, and not less than forty thousand resident Jews. <span class="cmt_word">Of the Way</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> holding the doctrine of Christ. Thus in <a href="/acts/18-25.htm">Acts 18:25, 26</a>, the Christian faith is spoken of as "the way of the Lord" and "the way of God." In <a href="/acts/19-9.htm">Acts 19:9, 23</a>; <a href="/acts/22-4.htm">Acts 22:4</a>; <a href="/acts/24-14.htm">Acts 24:14</a>, was the term by which the faith of Christ was spoken of chiefly, perhaps, among the Jews. The term means a peculiar doctrine or sect. Its application to Christians apparently lasted only so long as Christianity was considered to be a modification or peculiar form of Judaism, and its frequent use in the Acts is therefore an evidence of the early composition of the book. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/9-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">to ask for</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8080;&#964;&#942;&#963;&#945;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;t&#275;sato)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_154.htm">Strong's 154: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ask, request, petition, demand.
