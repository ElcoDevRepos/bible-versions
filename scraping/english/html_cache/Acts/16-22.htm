The crowd's involvement indicates a mob mentality, often seen in Acts when the gospel challenges local customs or economic interests. In this case, Paul and Silas had disrupted the income of those profiting from a slave girl's fortune-telling (<a href="/acts/16-16.htm">Acts 16:16-19</a>). The crowd's reaction reflects the common human tendency to resist change and protect economic interests, even at the expense of justice. This mirrors other instances in Acts where the apostles face opposition, such as in <a href="/acts/19-23.htm">Acts 19:23-41</a> in Ephesus, where the silversmiths incite a riot to protect their trade.<p><b>and the magistrates ordered that they be stripped and beaten with rods</b><br>The magistrates in Philippi were Roman officials responsible for maintaining order. Their decision to have Paul and Silas stripped and beaten without a trial reflects the Roman practice of summary justice, especially against those perceived as disturbers of the peace. This punishment was a common Roman method of maintaining control and was intended to publicly humiliate and deter others. The use of rods was typical of Roman punishment, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>, where Paul recounts being beaten with rods multiple times. This act of injustice against Paul and Silas, who were Roman citizens, sets the stage for their later vindication and the conversion of the jailer, demonstrating God's sovereignty and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_silas.htm">Paul and Silas</a></b><br>Early Christian missionaries and apostles who were spreading the Gospel in Philippi, a Roman colony in Macedonia.

A stirred-up crowd, abetted by civic leaders, strips and beats Paul and Silas, exposing the counterfeit justice of the world and the steadfast courage of Christ&#8217;s servants. Their suffering becomes a platform for praise, the salvation of the jailer, and the planting of the Philippian church, proving that God turns opposition into opportunity for the advance of His kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Commanded to beat them.</span>--The Greek verb gives the special Roman form of punishment, that of being beaten with the rods of the lictors. This, therefore, takes its place as one of the three instances to which St. Paul refers in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm" title="Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;">2Corinthians 11:25</a>. The question naturally occurs, why he did not, on these occasions, claim, as he did afterwards at Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/22-25.htm" title="And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to whip a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?">Acts 22:25</a>), the privileges of a Roman citizen. Some have supposed that the violence of the mob rendered it impossible for his claim to be heard. Others have even questioned the truthfulness of his claim. A more natural supposition is that he would not assert in this instance a right which would only have secured exemption for himself, and left his companion to suffer the ignominious penalty of the law, and that by putting the <span class= "ital">strategi</span> in the wrong, he sought to secure for his disciples afterwards a more tolerant treatment. As far as the first part of this hypothesis is concerned, it may, perhaps, be accepted (see, however, Note on <a href="/acts/16-37.htm" title="But Paul said to them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privately? no truly; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.">Acts 16:37</a>); but such of the Philippian disciples as belonged to the <span class= "ital">colonia, were</span> already protected from outrages of this kind as Roman citizens.
