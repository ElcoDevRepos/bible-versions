The timing, "right up to daybreak," suggests urgency and the need for preparation as daylight would bring new challenges. In biblical times, daybreak often symbolized new beginnings or deliverance, as seen in <a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>, "Weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning."<p><b>Paul kept urging them all to eat</b><br>Paul's insistence on eating highlights his practical wisdom and care for the physical needs of the crew and passengers. This reflects the biblical principle of stewardship of the body, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>. Paul's leadership is reminiscent of Jesus' feeding of the multitudes, where physical nourishment was provided alongside spiritual teaching (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>).<p><b>Today is your fourteenth day</b><br>The mention of "fourteenth day" underscores the severity and length of the storm they endured. The number fourteen can symbolize deliverance or salvation, as seen in the Passover, which occurs on the fourteenth day of the first month (<a href="/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6</a>). This period of trial parallels the Israelites' journey through the wilderness, emphasizing reliance on God's provision.<p><b>in constant suspense</b><br>The phrase "in constant suspense" captures the anxiety and fear experienced by those on the ship. This mirrors the human condition of uncertainty and the need for faith, as seen in <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>, which encourages believers to present their requests to God to receive peace. The suspense also reflects the trials faced by early Christians, who often lived in uncertainty due to persecution.<p><b>without taking any food</b><br>The lack of food intake for such an extended period indicates the severity of the situation and the crew's preoccupation with survival. Fasting, whether voluntary or involuntary, is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with seeking divine intervention or guidance (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>, <a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2-3</a>).

Scripture consistently shows faithful servants active until dawn when crisis looms&#8212;think of Jacob wrestling &#8220;until daybreak&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24-26</a>) or Paul earlier &#8220;speaking until daybreak&#8221; in Troas (<a href="/acts/20-11.htm">Acts 20:11</a>). The literal setting&#8212;night turning to morning&#8212;mirrors the spiritual picture: God&#8217;s light is about to break through the storm.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Paul kept urging them all to eat</b><p>Leadership here is practical as well as spiritual. Paul has already thanked God for the sailors&#8217; future rescue (<a href="/acts/27-35.htm">Acts 27:35-36</a>) and now presses them to restore strength. Just as Jesus told Jairus&#8217;s astonished household to give the raised girl something to eat (<a href="/luke/8-55.htm">Luke 8:55</a>), Paul knows physical nourishment positions them to receive God&#8217;s deliverance. <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a> paints the same truth: the Lord prepares a table right in the middle of trouble.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Today is your fourteenth day</b><p>The two-week span proves the severity of the ordeal and the precision of Luke&#8217;s record. Verse 27 notes &#8220;the fourteenth night,&#8221; and now, as dawn breaks, the ship&#8217;s company reaches the fourteenth day&#8212;no exaggeration, simply history. God had declared that not one life would be lost (<a href="/acts/27-22.htm">Acts 27:22</a>), and the exact timeline underscores His control over every hour.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In constant suspense</b><p>The phrase captures the crew&#8217;s prolonged anxiety&#8212;days of deafening wind, blinding rain, and ceaseless labor (<a href="/acts/27-18.htm">Acts 27:18-20</a>). Believers still face seasons of &#8220;great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8-10</a>), yet the Lord uses tension to deepen trust. Paul&#8217;s calm focus demonstrates <a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>: &#8220;You will keep in perfect peace the mind that is stayed on You.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Without taking any food</b><p>Whether from seasickness, fear, or lack of opportunity, the men had all but stopped eating. Scripture warns that exhaustion can cloud discernment; Jonathan grew faint during Saul&#8217;s rash fast (<a href="/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24-30</a>), and Elijah needed bread and water before continuing his mission (<a href="/1_kings/19-5.htm">1 Kings 19:5-8</a>). By urging a meal, Paul shows that faith does not deny bodily needs; instead, it relies on God&#8217;s provision to meet them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/27-33.htm">Acts 27:33</a> portrays Paul as a steady, Spirit-led shepherd who cares for both souls and stomachs. Through a literal two-week storm, God proves sovereign over darkness, time, emotions, and physical necessity. The verse invites us to trust His promises, receive His practical care, and watch for daylight with confident, nourished hearts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">Paul besought them all to take meat.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">to take food;</span> and so in the next verse. Once again the practical insight of the Apostle--yet more, perhaps, his kindly human sympathy--comes prominently forward. Soldiers and sailors needed something that would draw them together after the incident just narrated. All were liable at once to the despair and the irritability caused by exhaustion.<p><span class= "bld">That ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">that ye continue on the look-out, without a meal, taking no extra food.</span> The English somewhat exaggerates the force of the Greek. The word for "fasting" is not that which is commonly used in the New Testament to express entire abstinence from food. It was physically impossible that the two hundred and seventy-six who were on board could have gone on for fourteen days without any food at all. Scanty rations had, we must believe, been doled out to those who came for them; but the tension of suspense was so great that they had not sat down to any regular meal. They had taken, as the last word implies, nothing beyond what was absolutely necessary to keep body and soul together. What they wanted physically was food, and morally, the sense of restored companionship; and to this St. Paul's advice led them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> <span class="accented">- Some food</span> for <span class="accented">meat</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">wait and continue</span> for <span class="accented">have tarried and continued</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">All</span>; including the treacherous sailors whose plot he had just defeated. <span class="cmt_word">Having taken nothing</span>; not meaning that they had literally been fourteen days without tasting food, which is impossible; but that they had no regular meals, only snatching a mouthful now and then in the midst of their incessant toil. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/27-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Right</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">up to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7948;&#967;&#961;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Achri)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_891.htm">Strong's 891: </a> </span><span class="str2">As far as, up to, until, during.
