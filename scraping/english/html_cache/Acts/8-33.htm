The term "humiliation" highlights the depth of His suffering and the indignity He endured, despite His innocence. This connects to <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7-8</a>, a prophecy about the Suffering Servant, which foretells the Messiah's unjust treatment. Historically, Roman trials were known for their harshness, and Jesus' trial was marked by false accusations and a lack of fair legal proceedings. The Jewish leaders and Roman authorities both played roles in this miscarriage of justice, fulfilling the prophecy that the Messiah would be "oppressed and afflicted."<p><b>Who can recount His descendants?</b><br>This phrase raises the question of Jesus' lineage and legacy. In a literal sense, Jesus had no biological children, but His "descendants" can be understood spiritually. Believers in Christ are often referred to as His spiritual offspring, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12-13</a> and <a href="/galatians/3-26.htm">Galatians 3:26-29</a>, where faith in Christ makes one a child of God. The rhetorical question emphasizes the vast and uncountable nature of His spiritual progeny, fulfilling the promise to Abraham that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>), now extended through faith in Christ.<p><b>For His life was removed from the earth.</b><br>This phrase speaks to the crucifixion and death of Jesus, where His earthly life was prematurely ended. It underscores the sacrificial nature of His death, which was necessary for the redemption of humanity. The removal of His life from the earth also points to the temporary nature of His death, as it was followed by His resurrection, a cornerstone of Christian faith. This event is central to the Gospel message, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>, where Paul emphasizes the death and resurrection of Christ as of "first importance." The phrase also echoes the prophecy in <a href="/daniel/9-26.htm">Daniel 9:26</a>, where the Anointed One is "cut off" but not for Himself, indicating the substitutionary atonement of Jesus for the sins of the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philip_the_evangelist.htm">Philip the Evangelist</a></b><br>A deacon in the early church who was led by the Holy Spirit to meet the Ethiopian eunuch on the road from Jerusalem to Gaza.

A different meaning has, however, been given to the Hebrew preposition by many scholars, who render the words, "<span class= "ital">Through</span> oppression and [unjust] judgment He was taken away"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>He was the victim of a judicial murder. The LXX., which is here followed, seems to have adopted a different construction, "By His humiliation, by His low estate, His judgment (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the righteous judgment which was His due) was taken away." Here also, however, the word "judgment" has been taken in a different sense, and the words have been interpreted as meaning, "His condemnation was taken away, or cancelled"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>because He humbled Himself He was afterwards exalted. Assuming Philip to have explained the words as they stand in the LXX., the first of these two latter interpretations has most to commend itself. The story of the Passion, the unrighteous sentence passed on the Lord Jesus because He stood before the Council and the Governor as poor and friendless, would be dwelt on as filling in the outlines of the prophetic picture.<p><span class= "bld">Who shall declare his generation?</span>--The Hebrew noun may mean, as in <a href="/psalms/14-5.htm" title="There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.">Psalm 14:5</a>, the men of a given period, or those sharing a common character. The words have, however, been very variously taken: (1) "Who shall declare the number of those who share His life, and are, as it were, sprung from Him"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Who can count His faithful disciples? (2) "Who shall declare the wickedness of the crooked and perverse generation in which He lived?" (3) "Who, as far as His generation went, were wise enough to consider?" Assuming, as before, that it was the LXX. that Philip explained, the second of these seems preferable, as corresponding with the frequent use of the word "generation" with condemnatory epithets attached to it both by our Lord Himself (<a href="/context/matthew/12-39.htm" title="But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:">Matthew 12:39-42</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-4.htm" title="A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.

The sense which some commentators have affixed to it, "Who shall declare His duration?" "Who shall set limits to the life of Him who is One with the Eternal?" or, as others, "Who shall declare the mystery of His mode of birth?"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of the Incarnation--are, it is believed, untenable as regards the Hebrew, and yet more so as regards the Greek. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> <span class="accented">- His generation who shall declare?</span> for <span class="accented">and who shall declare his generation?</span> A.V. and T.R. The preceding quotation is taken verbatim from the LXX., which, however, varies somewhat from the Hebrew. In this verse, for the Hebrew as rendered in the A.V., "He was taken from prison and from judgment," the LXX. has, "In his humiliation his judgment was taken away," having evidently read in their copy <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5d5;</span>, or perhaps <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;</span>, "Through [or, 'in'] his oppression [humiliation] his judgment was taken away." Mr. Cheyne translates the Hebrew, "Through oppression and through a judgment [sentence] he was taken "away [to death]." For the Hebrew of the A.V., "He was cut off out of the land of the living," the LXX. has, "His life is taken from the earth," where they must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, "his life," as the subject of the verb, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, the living, taken in construction with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e5;</span> , the earth. The differences, however, are not material in regard to the general meaning of the passage. <span class="cmt_word">His generation who shall declare</span>? The explanation of this difficult expression belongs tea commentary on Isaiah. Here it must suffice to say that the explanation most in accordance with the meaning of the Hebrew words (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;</span>), with the context, and with the turn of thought in <a href="/isaiah/38-10.htm">Isaiah 38:10-12</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/11-19.htm">Jeremiah 11:19</a>, is that given in the 'Speaker's Commentary:' "Who will consider, give serious thought to, his life or age, seeing it is so prematurely cut off?" which is merely another way of saying that Messiah should "be cut off" (<a href="/daniel/9-26.htm">Daniel 9:26</a>)" from the land of the living, that his Name be no more remembered" (Jeremiah, as above). It was the frustration of this hope of Jesus being forgotten in consequence of his death that so troubled the Sanhedrim (<a href="/acts/5-28.htm">Acts 5:28</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/8-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(En)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
