The context is Paul's speech at the Areopagus in Athens, where he addresses a polytheistic audience. By using this phrase, Paul connects with his listeners by acknowledging a truth they can understand, while pointing them to the one true God. Theologically, this reflects the biblical teaching that God is the source of all life (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>) and sustains the universe (<a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>). It echoes the idea that humanity is dependent on God for existence and purpose, aligning with the biblical narrative of creation and divine providence.<p><b>As some of your own poets have said,</b><br>Paul references Greek poets to build a bridge between his message and the cultural context of his audience. This approach demonstrates his awareness of Greek literature and philosophy, which was highly regarded in Athens, a city known for its intellectual pursuits. By quoting familiar sources, Paul gains credibility and engages his audience in a meaningful way. This method of contextualization is seen throughout Paul's ministry, as he adapts his message to different cultural settings without compromising the gospel (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-22.htm">1 Corinthians 9:22</a>).<p><b>&#8216;We are His offspring.&#8217;</b><br>This quote is attributed to the Greek poet Aratus, and possibly also Cleanthes, who wrote about Zeus. Paul repurposes this statement to reveal a deeper truth about the relationship between God and humanity. By affirming that humans are God's offspring, Paul underscores the biblical teaching that all people are created in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>) and have inherent value and dignity. This concept challenges the idolatry prevalent in Athens, as it implies a personal and relational God, rather than distant deities made of stone or metal. It also sets the stage for Paul's call to repentance and recognition of the true God, who desires a relationship with His creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>A key figure in the early Christian church, Paul is the speaker in this passage.

Our life, our activity, and our very existence depend entirely on the Lord who both creates and sustains, calling us into fellowship through His Son.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">For in him we live, and move, and have our being.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">we live, and are moved, and are.</span> Each of the verbs used has a definite philosophical significance. The first points to our animal life; the second--from which is derived the Greek word used by ethical writers for passions, such as fear, love, hate, and the like--not, as the English verb suggests, to man's power of bodily motion in space, but to our emotional nature; the third, to that which constitutes our true essential being, the intellect and will of man. What the words express is not merely the Omnipresence of the Deity; they tell us that the power for every act and sensation and thought comes from Him. They set forth what we may venture to call the true element of Pantheism, the sense of a "presence interposed," as in nature, "in the light of setting suns," so yet more in man. As a Latin poet had sung, whose works may have been known to the speaker, the hearers, and the historian:--<p>"Deum namque ire per omnes<p>Terras que tractusque maris, ccelumque profundum,<p>Hinc pecudes, armenta, viros, genus omne ferarum,<p>Quemque sibi tenues nascentem arcessere vitas,<p>Scilicet hinc reddi deinde ac resoluta referri,<p>Omnia; nec morti esse locum sed viva volare<p>Sideris in numerum atque alto succedere caelo."<p>["God permeates all lands, all tracts of sea,<p>And the vast heaven.
