The remark in question is from a fellow Hebrew who questioned Moses' authority and intentions, highlighting Moses' fear of exposure and the consequences of his actions. This moment is pivotal as it marks a turning point in Moses' life, leading to his flight from Egypt.<p><b>Moses fled to the land of Midian</b><br>Midian is located in the northwestern region of the Arabian Peninsula, near the Gulf of Aqaba. This area was inhabited by the Midianites, descendants of Abraham through Keturah, as mentioned in <a href="/genesis/25.htm">Genesis 25:1-2</a>. Moses' flight to Midian signifies a period of exile and preparation, paralleling other biblical figures who experienced transformation in the wilderness. This escape also fulfills a divine purpose, as Moses' time in Midian prepares him for his future role as the leader of the Israelites.<p><b>where he lived as a foreigner</b><br>Moses' status as a foreigner in Midian reflects his displacement and identity crisis. Having been raised in Pharaoh's palace, he was neither fully Egyptian nor fully Hebrew. This experience of living as an outsider foreshadows the Israelites' own journey and identity struggles. It also prefigures Christ, who was often rejected and lived without a permanent home during His earthly ministry.<p><b>and had two sons</b><br>Moses' two sons, Gershom and Eliezer, are mentioned in <a href="/exodus/18-3.htm">Exodus 18:3-4</a>. Gershom's name, meaning "a stranger there," underscores Moses' sense of alienation and his life as a sojourner. Eliezer's name, meaning "God is my help," reflects Moses' reliance on divine assistance. These names encapsulate Moses' journey from exile to divine mission, mirroring the broader narrative of redemption and God's faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.
