The Mediterranean Sea was notorious for its sudden and violent storms, especially during the late fall and winter months. The use of "we" indicates that the author, Luke, was present, providing an eyewitness account. This storm can be seen as a test of faith, similar to the trials faced by other biblical figures, such as Jonah or the disciples during the storm on the Sea of Galilee (<a href="/mark/4-37.htm">Mark 4:37-41</a>). The violence of the storm underscores the perilous nature of the journey and the power of natural forces, which are often used in Scripture to demonstrate God's sovereignty and the need for reliance on Him.<p><b>that the next day</b><br>The mention of "the next day" highlights the duration and persistence of the storm. It was not a brief squall but a prolonged ordeal that required continuous effort and decision-making. This timeframe emphasizes the endurance required by those on board and sets the stage for the subsequent actions taken to preserve the ship and its passengers. The passage of time in the narrative also serves to build tension and anticipation for the eventual outcome, reflecting the patience and perseverance needed in the face of trials.<p><b>the men began to jettison the cargo</b><br>Jettisoning the cargo was a desperate measure taken to lighten the ship and improve its buoyancy in the stormy seas. This action reflects the severity of the situation and the crew's willingness to sacrifice valuable goods for the sake of survival. In the ancient world, cargo was often the primary source of profit for a voyage, indicating the gravity of the decision. This act can be paralleled with spiritual themes of letting go of worldly possessions or burdens to focus on what is truly important, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>, which encourages believers to "lay aside every weight." The decision to jettison the cargo also foreshadows the eventual shipwreck, illustrating the futility of human efforts without divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is being transported to Rome as a prisoner.

They effected, in this way, the relief of the ship from the imminent danger of sinking. The act shows that, in spite of the undergirding, leakage was still going on. The cargo, as coming from Alexandria, probably consisted largely of corn; but see Note on <a href="/acts/27-38.htm" title="And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.">Acts 27:38</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - As <span class="accented">we</span> labor<span class="accented">ed exceedingly</span> for <span class="accented">being exceedingly tossed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the storm</span> for <span class="accented">a tempest</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">began to throw the freight overboard</span> for <span class="accented">lightened the ship</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Labored</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, only here in the New Testament; but used by Plato, Thucydides, Diodorus Siculus, Josephus, and others, and especially by medical writers.
