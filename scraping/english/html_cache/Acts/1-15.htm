It was a time of waiting and prayer for the disciples, as instructed by Jesus in <a href="/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4</a>. This period was crucial for the early church as they prepared for the coming of the Holy Spirit.<p><b>Peter stood up</b><br>Peter, often seen as the leader among the apostles, takes initiative here. His leadership role is consistent with Jesus' words in <a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>, where He refers to Peter as the rock on which He will build His church. Peter's actions here set the stage for his prominent role in the early church.<p><b>among the brothers</b><br>The term "brothers" indicates the close-knit community of believers, united by their faith in Christ. This group included the apostles and other followers of Jesus, emphasizing the familial bond among early Christians, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/12-10.htm">Romans 12:10</a>.<p><b>(a gathering of about a hundred and twenty)</b><br>This number signifies the small but significant size of the early Christian community in Jerusalem. The gathering likely included the apostles, Jesus' family, and other disciples. The number 120 is also significant in Jewish tradition, as it was the minimum number required to form a community with its own council.<p><b>and said</b><br>Peter's speech marks the beginning of the apostolic leadership in the church. His words are not only a call to action but also fulfill the need for guidance and decision-making within the early church.

Jesus had said, &#8220;Stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-49.htm">Luke 24:49</a>).
